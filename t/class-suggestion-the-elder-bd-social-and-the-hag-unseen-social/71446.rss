    <description>&gt;# [color=ligblue]The Elder[/color]
&gt;**[color=ligblue]Blue Dragon Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Unique**
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Herbal Wisdom) ~ Immune to Bleeding and Nightshade. You will keep this Passive, even if your Class Changes.**
&gt;**Passive 2 (Around the Town) ~ Sees all day abilities being performed (Doesn&#39;t see who used them), Does not see abilities used by neutrals.**
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Meditation) ~ Make yourself conversion immune for the night. You cannot use any night abilities tonight. (2 uses)**
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Inform) ~ You and Target Player Will Know the Identity of One Person Visiting The Target Tonight. (Infinite Uses)**
&gt;**Night Ability (Communications) ~ Have 2 players see each other&#39;s feedback from abilities used last night. Does not show attacks or conversion. (2 uses)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Goal: Defeat the Cult/Unseen and any Neutrals who seek to do you harm.**

&gt;# [color=purple]The Hag[/color]
&gt;**[color=purple]Unseen Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Unique**
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Herbal Wisdom) ~ Immune to Bleeding and Nightshade. You will keep this Passive, even if your Class Changes.**
&gt;**Passive (Keen Ears) ~ See all day abilities being performed (Does see who used them), Does not see abilities used by neutrals.**
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Nosy) ~ Listen in on the Prince tonight. (2 uses)**
&gt;**Day Ability 2 (Invoke) ~ Disable Target&#39;s Passives For Current Day and Night. Can be Used During The King&#39;s Election Phase. Target Will Not Receive A Notification. Does not remove death and conversion immunity. (3 uses)**
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Educate) ~ Target Unseen Member Will Know the Identity of all Players Visiting Them. (3 Uses)**
&gt;**Night Ability 2 (Astonish) ~ Frame Target and Receive the Feedback of the Ability the Target Used Last Night. (Infinite Uses)**
&gt;
&gt;**Goal: Defeat the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm.**

&gt;# [color=grey]Clarifications[/color]
&gt;~ **For Invoke, it removes the target&#39;s passives for the day used and the following night. So if it was used Day 5, it would work from Day 5 to the end of Night 5.**
&gt;~ **For Nosy, it does not give away who the Prince/Jailed are, it would show something like this.
Prince: Class?
Jailed: I am a Noble.**
&gt;~ **For Around The Town, it would show something like this.
A Noble or Aristocrat forced [15] to vote for [6].
        For Keen Ears, it would show something like this.
[7] forced [15] to vote for [6].**

I&#39;d love to hear some feedback, as this is a raw idea. Thanks!</description>

            <p>Yeah, people always are annoyed when they “Take the L” from being a convert. So it makes sure that the Elder won’t get too powerful and OP and protects them late game.</p>

            <p>I like that. It nerfs The Elder (As they are pretty powerful anyways), and helps protect them. Good Idea!</p>

            <p>You can remove eavesdrop and can give day ability to make himself conversion immune for night.But if he use this he can’t perform night ability for that night.Since it is social class it makes sense.Just throwing ideas here</p>

            <p>Yeah, I can definitely see where you’re coming from, and this is kind of a raw idea, open to interpretation. I COULD see if I can think of something but I’m being on the safe side with just making it an Apostle.</p>

<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive (Herbal Wisdom) ~ Immune to Bleeding and Nightshade. You will keep this Passive, even if your Class Changes.</strong><br>
<strong>Passive 2 (Around the Town) ~ Sees all day abilities being performed (Doesn’t see who used them), Does not see abilities used by neutrals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day Ability (Meditation) ~ Make yourself conversion immune for the night. You cannot use any night abilities tonight. (2 uses)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Inform) ~ You and Target Player Will Know the Identity of One Person Visiting The Target Tonight. (Infinite Uses)</strong><br>
<strong>Night Ability (Communications) ~ Have 2 players see each other’s feedback from abilities used last night. Does not show attacks or conversion. (2 uses)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal: Defeat the Cult/Unseen and any Neutrals who seek to do you harm.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Day Ability (Nosy) ~ Listen in on the Prince tonight. (2 uses)</strong><br>
<strong>Day Ability 2 (Invoke) ~ Disable Target’s Passives For Current Day and Night. Can be Used During The King’s Election Phase. Target Will Not Receive A Notification. Does not remove death and conversion immunity. (3 uses)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Educate) ~ Target Unseen Member Will Know the Identity of all Players Visiting Them. (3 Uses)</strong><br>
<strong>Night Ability 2 (Astonish) ~ Frame Target and Receive the Feedback of the Ability the Target Used Last Night. (Infinite Uses)</strong></p>

<h1><font color="grey">Clarifications</font></h1>
<p>~ <strong>For Invoke, it removes the target’s passives for the day used and the following night. So if it was used Day 5, it would work from Day 5 to the end of Night 5.</strong><br>
~ <strong>For Nosy, it does not give away who the Prince/Jailed are, it would show something like this.<br>
Prince: Class?<br>
Jailed: I am a Noble.</strong><br>
~ <strong>For Around The Town, it would show something like this.<br>
A Noble or Aristocrat forced [15] to vote for [6].<br>
For Keen Ears, it would show something like this.<br>
[7] forced [15] to vote for [6].</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d love to hear some feedback, as this is a raw idea. Thanks!</p>
