    <description>## Win7 Returns

![win7-1920x622-headerImg|690x223](upload://AhisZe70T7gjXgkaenyzox1bUBX.png) 
Thanks to Photon (our 3rd-party realtime game server)&#39;s persistent effort to ensure we got Windows 7 support back, `v2.3.1a` now brings back Win7!

(We&#39;re still testing v2.4 - Ran into a few snags, but it&#39;s super close - see #test-realm-chat for more info)

Although Windows 7 is now playable again, once Windows 7 is deprecated, we can no longer *guarantee* support for Windows 7: **Microsoft dropping security updates is a big deal** - this also means that our 3rd-party issue won&#39;t be the only one that experiences this. Remember Windows XP (RIP)? It&#39;s only a matter of time before Win7 gets left behind in the wind.

We&#39;ll *unofficially* support it for as long as we possibly can: As long as *Throne&#39;s* required 3rd-party libraries support Win7, so will we.
