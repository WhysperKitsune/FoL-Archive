    <title>Good/Neut starting King strategy</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/good-neut-starting-king-strategy/27888</link>
    <description>Step 1: find an evil by any means necessary other than outing him. If it&#39;s through an invest class then tell him the rest of the plan.

Step 2: Whisper him that you are evil king and that he should tell him the rest of the Unseen.

Step 3: if he does then out them all. If he doesn&#39;t then if he was outed through invest/ you are good king then out just him. Otherwise pretend to be evil king to him for awhile until you need BD credit.

Note: This strategy is tested to work.</description>
