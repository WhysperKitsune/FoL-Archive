    <title>[Bug] Incorrect Observer feedback with no Apostle/Illusionist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-incorrect-observer-feedback-with-no-apostle-illusionist/25180</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Observer followed an outted Merc to check if he was lying about contract at night. Target received a messaged saying that a mercenary guarded but Observer&#39;s reports said that the Merc did not visit anyone that night. 

Additional info: Merc&#39;s target (physician) and the Cult Leader both visited the Merc that night as well. Observer&#39;s logs reflected that accurately. The Merc was converted that night as well. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The Observer should have received a messaged saying that Merc visited their target.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Not exactly sure, but it seems like the things that stood out were:

1. Have Cult Leader convert mercenary same night as he guards target
2. Have Observer watch

#### Comments:

It was confirmed by end game screen and Cult members that there was no Apostle at any time during the game.
I don&#39;t know what else to add but as I was the target (phys) Ill post a screenshot of my logs below.

Edit: for clarification, 7 was Merc and 8 was Obs telling Merc to guard his target in whispers.</description>
