    <title>Recent 1 Day Ban</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/recent-1-day-ban/19967</link>
    <description>I was banned as of this morning for 24 hours.  The reason being, &quot;revealing Unseen.&quot;  Now I can sort of accept this ban, as I did reveal unseen in my journal.  
However, what I want clarification on is, can you also be banned for outing a fellow unseen/cult in the day time? 
 The reason I outed the MM in my journal is because I was converted N1, then outed by my MM D2.  He then proceeded to tell me afterwards that alcoholic is not a good converted class so he wanted me out.  This is especially annoying because he is essentially doing the same thing I am doing but for some reason, my actions are reportable.  It is often the case unseen may &quot;out&quot; fellow unseen in their journal to try and get more BD killed.  In a fashion, what I am doing is &quot;metagaming&quot; to mess with BD.  So what exactly is the difference here and why is my case bannable?</description>

            <p>He asked you “wtf man” and that was after the unvote. Maybe he thought something weird happened. You could’ve answered him like a normal human being “I guess the NK killed him or something, that sucks” and continued with the game - but no, you immediately went to “VOTE HIM UP HE’S THROWING HE’S VOTING ME BECAUSE HIS FRIEND DIED” - <strong>even though he had unvoted you by that point, in fact, IMMEDIATELY after the initial erroneous vote</strong>.</p>

<p>He voted and unvoted you right away, as you can see, and you immediately outed him and yourself.<br>
He very obviously meant to whisper you by right clicking and accidentally left clicked your name to accuse you, but then fixed it. But nah, you raged and outed him and yourself anyway. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"><br>
Suspension was justified.</p>

            <p>No, that’s not what you were suspended for. You were suspended  because you were Cult Leader, your Ritualist asked you to convert someone, that person died that same night, and you flipped out and outed them and yourself in day chat. I can post quotes here for everyone to see, if you want. The suspension was for 3 days because of multiple other offenses and your previous history.<br>
If you have a question about a punishment you can always approach a moderator, but let me assure you, this one was justified. In fact, I recognize your name from all the reports you’ve been getting for various things recently, you really have no justification for complaining about any punishment.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t work try asking a Moderator on the Discord.</p>
<p>No clue what your circumstances are so I won’t pass judgement one way or the other, but I recommend not trying to evade bans. The OP here has been stellar in that regard (some people get really salty over temporary bans, and then get banned for longer for being toxic).</p>

            <p>9/10 someone will investigate those you list as evil. If they are innocent, you might waste some time. If they are guilty, you are likely getting them killed.</p>

            <p>When you die as an evil faction and out BDs as evil.  Do you automatically believe the evil person’s logs and exe those people listed? Doesn’t that make those outed in the evil’s log not suspicious.  What I am saying is doing it for actual evil people could be called a tactic to relieve suspicion but robflop has cleared stated this tactic is not allowed.</p>

            <p>I’m missing you here… the dev’s have explicitly said say lying and putting BD down as unseen, or listing unseen as BD in your log book is perfectly legal. What is outright undeniably gamethrowing, is outing actual unseen as unseen in your logbook. You can’t call it bussing to truely out, as you can’t improve your own credibility if they are looking at it after you are dead.</p>

            <p>So using the logbook to relieve suspicion on fellow evil players is not a viable tactic and is reportable.<br>
Thank you for clearing this up robflop.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>generally what’s been stated is accurate. Buzzing someone without prior communication of this often leads to the victim of the buss to believe that the person who is throwing them under the bus is gamethrowing and revenge-reveal them in the game as well before they die, effectively gamethrowing themselves.</p>
<p>You can see how that turns into a mess quickly.</p>
<p>So generally, as mentioned before, don’t bus without consent. If you do and a chain of reports follows it depends on how the respective person handling the report interprets the situation.</p>
<p>On the topic outing people in your logbook: That is 100% intended gamethrowing.</p>
<p>The log doesn’t show up until you die, meaning the person doing something like this probably plans it in advance or shortly before dying, for the sole reason of just outing their factions members and getting them killed for whatever reason.</p>
<p>An exception would be a situation where you had just found an Unseen/Cult the night before and gotten converted the same night, forgetting to remove this from your log – mistakes like these happen and will normally be overlooked as honest mistake.</p>
