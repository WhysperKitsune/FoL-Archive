    <description>Looking for input from wiser players than I on how you ensure your survival in the instance of being outed early as MM.

I was outed as a false Sheriff claim late on D2 in dead psy logs; even if I wasn&#39;t actual Sheriff, an outed Sheriff that early is a guaranteed convert target. After telling my teammates to out me (they didn&#39;t), and unsure what else to do, I whispered king early the following day (3) to &quot;exe me as insurance if you&#39;re BD; protect me if you&#39;re EK&quot;. he didn&#39;t. D4 dawned, I was still alive as MM, and now my teammates were boned. I got exed D4 and the salt was so real from my bromies - and I&#39;m not even sure it was unjustified - but I legit wasn&#39;t sure what else to do.

Tips? Suggests? Input? What&#39;s the best play in a sitch like this? Teach meeeee

            <p>Ahhh, of course… probably a king accuse that he didn’t move on a fabricated lead, hyper aggress… That <em>would</em> be the obv answer, wouldn’t it?</p>

            <p>Interesting. i suppose it kinda depends who wants to report for what, and what the reviewers would think as well, but if BD had any brains they hopefully wouldn’t exe an MM the day before MM became perma, yea?</p>

            <p>Outting yourself as MM is not necessarily gamethrowing. In this context, you figured you dying would help your team more than being alive.</p>

            <p>Hmm, short of throwing (outing myself as MM D3 - which would likely backfire anyway if BD is smart enough to delay a day) or bussing another teammate to survive and still die later when someone thought to check me – sounds like it may have been a no win situation. I like the knight guard claim but if checked or followed. we’d <em>both</em> get busted, not just me.</p>
<p>I guess I’m not sure there is an ultimately correct play but that’s why I’m asking for opinions</p>

            <p>If no one buses you day 3, then you can always disconnect just before the end of that day. It guarantees that you die in the window for another MM to appear. However, I’m not sure if this is an acceptable approach in terms of the game’s rules.</p>

            <p>Your assasijn claims knight and you claim he is guarding you from death and bus a non assassin teammate as just converted and you know because of scout. Works until assassin dies or two sheriff’s die. Also or until a knight/nk kills you. You did the right thing having tjem try to bus you though. They are dumb for not doing it. Especially king. Was he evil?</p>
