    <description>So this update for me has 2 different things happening to it.

The first is that now there is 2 new labels / boxes. This change I find pretty confusing. The box that tells that you who your scum teammates are don’t label it on the box of who you vote. So when I become scum I have to trace down who has the same name as my scum teammates instead of it being labeled there already my teammates and their numbers. I feel that it was much simpler before. The second box is good it separates whispers and night actions from the day chat. 

The next big change is the room change personally. Although not being able to have personalized rooms may seem like a small change, overall it is a big change in that since it is harder to know you got jailed and just the aesthetics is lost. So ussually when you get jailed you appear in this jail cell knowing obviously you got jailed, but now you just get a small message in the top box you have been jailed. There is many problems with this. The first is that if your scroll is up and you are not seeing the current chat by accident then you look and you see that you aren’t jailed. As a result, it may happen that prince thinks you are just being defiant and he will exe you. Additionally the rooms are also aesthetically appealing. Shows the thought that went into the game for each Individual room matching each class.</description>

<p>Showing the new boxes. The one on the top left gives the results and whispers and the top right shows your teammates on the scum factions. Btw I love the new private matters logo for mystic!</p>
