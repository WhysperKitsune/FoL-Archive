    <description>**Swear Fealty** — Make a player conversion immune permanently. 

Just my suggestion, I think the player (that swore fealty) that the MM/CL tries to convert should get a message saying, &quot;A member of the Unseen/Cult tried to convert you last night, but you swore fealty to the Blue Dragon.&quot; 

At its current state, no one knows the guy is conversion immune but the GK and the MM/CL (after they attempt to convert), and the GK doesn&#39;t get notified if and/or when SF worked. This can confirm a GK and a BD or an EK could use it after he uses Allies on an Unseen member and tells him about it.</description>

<p>The entire point of the King is that to make them impossible to mechanically confirm, which is why not even faction checks work on him.</p>
