    <title>[BUG] Party System not working</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-party-system-not-working/61435</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
When inviting a friend to a party it simply would not give the invite to the recipient.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Upon inviting said friend to a party they should have gotten a invite to join me, where they can accept or decline.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Invite friend to party from Title Screen.

#### Comments:
Edit: If you do the following;
1. Create Party
2. Invite Friend

It should work properly.</description>

            <p>Well, me and my friend messed around with it and came to the conclusion that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you directly invite someone from title screen, it will end up as the described outcome above</li>
<li>If you create a party, THEN invite someone, it should invite properly.</li>
</ol>

            <p>This started maybe a week ago, and also affects inviting other and getting invites.<br>
but I am also on Linux, and I have the same issues as <a class="mention" href="/u/oflegends">@ofLegends</a> where this affects me all the time,<br>
after a new game has started and while I have been playing for 3-4 hours still the same.</p>

            <p>This is happening to me every single time, doesn’t matter if it’s after playing a game or when I just launch the game. It’s not rare for me at all.</p>
