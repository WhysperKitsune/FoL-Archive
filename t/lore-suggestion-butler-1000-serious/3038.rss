    <title>Lore Suggestion: Butler (1000% serious)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-butler-1000-serious/3038</link>
    <description>Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I&#39;d like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I&#39;ll tell you how I became the Butler to Castle Adiart&#39;s heir

In west Castle Demwir born and raised
In the wheat fields was where I spent most of my days
Walkin&#39; out farmin&#39; harvestin&#39; all cool
And baking some bread while my son was at school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
My wife had an idea that she thought was smart
She said, &quot;You&#39;re movin&#39; to work in that there castle, Adiart&quot;

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she sold the business and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my best shirt on and said, &quot;I might as well kick it.&quot;

I can&#39;t be bothered to finish the song</description>
