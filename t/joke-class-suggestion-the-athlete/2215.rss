Unlike everybody else, your legs aren&#39;t paralyzed so that means you can actually WALK around the castle like a normal person.

Passive 2: Your too slow!
Since you can outrun everybody else you are immune to death at night.

Day Ability 1: Peek (infinite)
Go behind a player and look in their pockets, revealing their class.

Day Ability 2: Realize (1)
You realize that everyone else teleports around the castle instead of walking.
Then you commit suicide, since you are unable to grasp this fact.


Night Ability 1:  Go For A Walk (infinite)
Escape the castle of death, becoming immune to death for 1 day.
You cannot use any abilities, talk or vote while walking.
When your walk ends this ability goes on a 1 day cooldown.

Night Ability 2: Nature&#39;s Candy (3)
Pull out a box of raisins and eat them.
You are cured of all negative effects.

Objective: Eat your raisins.

Lore:
The citizens of Adiart were affectd by some weird disease. Their legs became paralyzed but they could teleport! Meanwhile, on a walk through the USA, Furrest Gupp saw this super cool castle and decided to stay there for a while.</description>
