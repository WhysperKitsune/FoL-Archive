    <title>King Ability &quot;Into the Tower&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-ability-into-the-tower/40669</link>
    <description>So, we where brainstorming in Derps chat.

How about a new day ability for the king called &quot;Drag him away&quot; or the like.

How it works:

- Useable at day
- Target: any player alive
- Targeted player gets removed from chat immediatelly and has to spend the whole following night in Jail/the tower.
- counts as occupied
- All normal jail interactions that don´t depend on Prince still aply
- Anouncement in chat that player X gets dragged away to the tower.

Maybe add three charges or a one day cooldown so king can not abuse it.

This abiltity should help to give King more authority so people think twice about beeing anoying in chat (looking at you fool) or pissing of the king (&quot;King, Leads!?!?&quot;, &quot;Evil king!&quot;).

Aditional sugestions:

- If you jail royal blood you use this ability afterwards (Noble blood still spends the night in tower)
- Some kinda kill ability to execute the person in the tower.

Fears:
Might be booring for the person thrown into tower (but hey, it should be a penalty for pissing of the king)
Maybe makes the prince feel less unique

Thank you for your consideration :)</description>

<p>You are immune to beeing killed, checked and the like, just as you would be if prince jailed you. But if prince Executes his prisoner, you do not also get killed</p>

<p>IF you throw someone with noble blood into the tower he still has to spend the night there but you loose the ability to throw anyone into tower afterwards.<br>
Similar to how prince looses his executes if he kills a BD.</p>
