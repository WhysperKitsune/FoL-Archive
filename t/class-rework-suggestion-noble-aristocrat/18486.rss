            <p>Disorder has three reasons for its existance: It can be used by Evils to delay King nominations(making them a valid protection target sometimes!), it gives BD an incentive to not kill them(if delaying King selections is bad for them) and last, but definitely not least because the King selection process would interfere with Declaration of Distrust.<br>
Maybe I have used the wrong words for Declaration of Distrust. I have changed them to make its effect crystal clear.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, these abilities can be used wrongly and negatively affect Blue Dragon- but then again that’s also true about Bulter and Occupy, Hunter and Wolf, Drunk and Debauch…</p>

            <p>I don’t see the point of disorder as it just delays a king really providing no benefit to any faction and just stalling. These day abilitys seem like really conditional day abilitys and can really stuff up BD if a target is choosen wrongly. The Night abilitys can just be easily expressed in your will that you do not trust so and so. The unseen forge ancestry seems pretty unique but again conditional, the target has to of claimed a royal blood class and step up. Take over seems good but conditional. I think the whole idea was that noble was too conditional of a class and needed some more active ability’s.</p>
