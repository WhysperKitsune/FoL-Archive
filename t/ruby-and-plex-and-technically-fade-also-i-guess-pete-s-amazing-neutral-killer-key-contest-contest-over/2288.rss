    <description>### I debated spelling it &quot;Kontest&quot; but then realised there would be 3 Ks

# You know what&#39;s a fun Faction/Type combination? Neutral Killer

# You know what&#39;s also fun? Free shit

# Well Plex and I are giving away a FREE ToL Alpha(and beyond, of course) Key, that saves you or your friend ten whole dollars, that&#39;s like eight entire pounds(or your regional equivalent)

# All you need to do to enter is create a Neutral Killer class, and PM it to me and Plex with the title &quot;Neutral Killer Contest: [Your Name Here]&quot;, you may only submit one class, but you may edit your class as many times as you want before the deadline

# We will not accept classes already made(those who have threads made about them already)

# You should strive you make your class Unique, Balanced and(most of all) Fun

# Once the deadline is reached, Plex, Myself, and possibly a few others, will judge every class fairly, and we will announce the Top 3


# *Prizes*
# First Prize gets you a ToL Key(Thanks to @ThePlex)  , Your class added to Forum Of Lies, and Plex and I will perhaps even submit the class to the devs if they have a moment
# Second Prize gets your class added to Forum Of Lies, and a ToL Key(Thanks to @FadeBlade) and a coupon for a free hug from me
# Third Prize will get you a pat on the back and a ToL Key(Thanks to @PandaPete)

            <p>Here is mine(4th place):</p>
<p>The Incinerator (Unique Neutral Killer)</p>
<p><strong>Passive1: Zifthol’s Fire</strong>: You won’t die at night if you attack with Fireball or Fiery Rage or if you are under the effect of the Cloak of Zifthol.<br>
<strong>Passive2: Elemental Mastery</strong>You will silently ignore the effects of Wall of Fire, Pants on Fire and Ice Ward.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1:Fireball(Unlimited uses)</strong>:Attack someone with fire. They cannot be healed.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2:Fiery Rage(Unlimited uses)</strong> Attack your first target tonight. They cannot be healed. You will attack your second target publicly at the start of the day, the second attack acts like a day ability.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1:Cloak of Zifthol(2 uses)</strong> For the next night, you cannot be imprisoned, you cannot be occupied, a visit or an attempt to imprison you will result in an unpreventable unhealable immunity piercing attack towards the one visiting or attempting to imprison you.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2:Zifthol’s Mirror(1 use):</strong> Prepare a mirror for someone that will show you what they are doing at the following night and what their visitors did at their home at that night. You will be seen visiting the Mirror target. But this will disable your immunities and Fiery Rage for that night.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>Kill everyone who does not need to survive.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lore:</strong></em> Many of those who are good fear the darkness, and rightfully so. However, not everything that spends light is good. Just like too much light blinds and burns… Burns… There are frequent reports about agents of a power named Zifthol, also named The Deadly Fire, and these reports usually end with lots of fast fiery deaths. They are named the Incinerators. Due to their highly deadly power and the nature of their power, not much is known about them. There are rumors that they can even take heat away to generate cold, but these reports are very rare, probably because Zifthol does not seem to like it when its agents do not use their power to kill… at least not without a very good reason. The Unseen and the Cult are a target for the Incinerator like probably everyone else, they have not been reported to help them or be helped by them, quite the opposite, they are found burnt just like everyone else. The only way to deal with the Incinerators is to find them fast before they burn everything and everyone to ashes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Please keep in mind that the submission period ended before the last patch that changed the Court Wizard so it is not updated yet(Elemental Mastery might need changes)<br>
Also its Lore Creativity and Fun ratings were quite good, while the balance ratings… well… were not so good(average under 3). I don’t exactly know if they thought that it was overpowered or if they thought that it was underpowered, but I suspect the former because I tried to give it actual win chances at the endgame(main weakness here would be the guards of the King or the Cloak not activating); the cloak is powerful but can reveal you… The Herbalist will also note your presence the second they are unable to heal someone… and, ofcourse, you cannot sit idly because that will cost you your immunity. Just like occupation.</p>

            <p>Reposting the Druid to make it look neater</p>
<h1>Druid (Neutral Killer)</h1>
<p><em>Passive - Vines You are immune to death and occupation at night.</em></p>
<p><em>Passive - Vine Network No matter what investigates you, they will receive the result ‘Vines cover the outside of your target’s room’.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day - Judgement of the Wild:</strong> During the day, you may command the spirits to mark a player. The player you marked will be announced to all. Should that player not be dead by the beginning of the following day you will gain a use of Nature’s Retribution… - Infinite Uses</p>
<p><strong>Night - Creeping Vines:</strong> Every night you may extend your vines through the bricks of the castle to a player’s room. They will show up as a Druid to all investigative tonight, but not the following night.- Infinite Uses<br>
<em>Note: Player will not be informed that vines are surrounding their room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Night - Nature’s Retribution:</strong> All players whoose rooms you have entwined in your vine network will die tonight, and you are immune to detection by Investigatives tonight. Each night you will lose a use of this should you not lose it.- 0 uses.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> You win by elimiinating the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and all others who seek to corrupt nature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lore:</em></strong> <em>Ages ago, long before the Blue Dragon came, an ancient tribe lived in the forest known as the Druids. The Druids lived in harmony with nature, but their way of life soon began to fade as technology began to advance. Where once stood the tribal center of the Druids’ home now stands a castle, and the tribe is all but wiped out.</em></p>
<p><em>However, in the town surrounding the Blue Dragon’s magnificent castle, lives a man. This man was a scholar, especially intriuged by the Druid’s history. And when he did learn that history, he found hmself feeling… anger? Yes, Anger. Not pity at this great race being wiped out, but anger, and a sense of vengance.</em></p>
<p><em>He dug out an ancient spell book, and began to read, and soon he became a new Druid, ready to right the wrongs that the Blue Dragon committed. The Unseen and the Cult weren’t helping Nature either, and thus they must be destroyed too.</em></p>

            <p>Balance points are the most valuable out of all the knds of points.<br>
And secondly if you noticed it isn’t quite a ToS arso, it also is a Contract Killer.</p>
<p>The basic idea is do we obey them and kill someone innocent or risk them killing a lot of people.</p>

            <h1>First Place</h1>
<p>Druid<br>
Neutral Killer</p>
<p>Passive - Vines You are immune to death and occupation at night.</p>
<p>Passive - Vine Network No matter what investigates you, they will receive the result ‘Vines cover the outside of your target’s room’.</p>
<p>Day - Judgement of the Wild During the day, you may command the spirits to mark a player. The player you marked will be announced to all. Should that player not be dead by the beginning of the following day you will gain a use of Nature’s Retribution… - Infinite Uses</p>
<p>Night - Creeping Vines Every night you may extend your vines through the bricks of the castle to a player’s room. They will show up as a Druid to all investigative tonight, but not the following night.- Infinite Uses<br>
Player will not be informed that vines are surrounding their room.</p>
<p>Night - Nature’s Retribution - All players whoose rooms you have entwined in your vine network will die tonight, and you are immune to detection by Investigatives tonight. Each night you will lose a use of this should you not lose it.- 0 uses.</p>
<p>Goal You win by elimiinating the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and all others who seek to corrupt nature.<br>
Lore: Ages ago, long before the Blue Dragon came, an ancient tribe lived in the forest known as the Druids. The Druids lived in harmony with nature, but their way of life soon began to fade as technology began to advance. Where once stood the tribal center of the Druids’ home now stands a castle, and the tribe is all but wiped out.</p>
<p>However, in the town surrounding the Blue Dragon’s magnificent castle, lives a man. This man was a scholar, especially intriuged by the Druid’s history. And when he did learn that history, he found hmself feeling… anger? Yes, Anger. Not pity at this great race being wiped out, but anger, and a sense of vengance.</p>
<p>He dug out an ancient spell book, and began to read, and soon he became a new Druid, ready to right the wrongs that the Blue Dragon committed. The Unseen and the Cult weren’t helping Nature either, and thus they must be destroyed too.</p>

            <h1>Second Place</h1>
<p>The Paranoid (Neutral Killer)<br>
Immune to Conversion</p>
<p>Passive: Steel Door<br>
You are overly protective of your room and have made sure that no Killers can get to you. (Immune to death at night, aside Prince)</p>
<p>Passive: Solid Mind<br>
If you are Occupied, you will be immune to it the next night but the Occupier will not be told.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: Schitzophrenic (Special)<br>
If you’ve killed somebody using Paranoia, your mind will start playing tricks on you. Your next attack will kill anybody else visiting your target. If you are jailed, you will kill the Prince if you are not executed.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Panic Attack (Infinite uses)<br>
Attack your target in a fit of panic. If they are an Investigative, you will destroy their journal.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Paranoia (2 uses)<br>
You will stay in your room tonight and overthink all possibilities and will kill any visitors.</p>
<p>Goal: Don’t get caught, don’t get executed.<br>
Lore:<br>
Those who sit around in the court room, blabbering on about politics and the next big debate will never know true war. For us, war was real. The battle for politics were childsplay compared to fighting these wars. Adiart’s armies battled for decades. Once the wars had come to a stop, many people went home to their families and their friends. Not me. I lost my family. I lost my friends. I didn’t have a single soul to share my thoughts to. I sat in my cottage, watching people and time go by. Not a moment passed that I didn’t think about the times of war. Wishing I could go back to doing my part for old Adiart.</p>
<p>Once Adiart passed away, I knew that the Kingdom would fall. It was only a matter of time before people would rebel. Hell, I would hear rumors of people being killed in the Castle over some myth about the Unseen. ‘It’s just a legend’ they say. The Kingdom that Adiart left behind are full of weaklings. I grew bored of sitting in my cottage all day. The only thing on my mind was cleansing Adiart’s Castle and taking back what was his. By any means. Nobody will find me. Nobody will see it coming.</p>

(edited)<br>
Lore:</p>
<p>Pa always tol’ me to keep ma mouth shut.</p>
<p>“Head down, lips sealed. Get on with yer work, boy, an’ perhaps we eat t’night.”</p>
<p>An’ I did. O’ at least I tried. But a life of servitude, of yessir’s an’ sweeping shite off the floor ain’t for everyone. Least of all me. ‘Specially when I see em’ fancy nobles in their purple robes, and a bleedin’ King that I couldn’t even vote for.</p>
<p>Problem is that they so busy squabbling over power, em’ Seekers an’ Soulcatchers an’ Sheriffs, they forget wha’ court really be for – to serve us. The people. We couldn’t give a rats arse who sat the throne. An’ nuffin was being done. Nuffin I tell ya. So yeah. I took matters into my own ‘ands. That make me a bad person? Gettin’ justice for the people?</p>
<p>It’s funny was how easy is’ been. See, all em’ rich folk so busy fightin’ each other over a hard chair, they don’ even mind the likes of me slipping into their chambers every night. Well, all apart from em’ high and mighty royals – they claim they smell my stench. They laugh, but I’ll fin’ out who they are soon enuf, and when that happens….</p>
<p>Ya see, it don’t matter if they’re a Seeker or a Soulcatcher o’ even a Sheriff. They all die jus’ as easy. For every man is equal in death. That’s all I’m askin’ for really:</p>
<p>Equality.</p>
