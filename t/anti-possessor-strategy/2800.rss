    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/anti-possessor-strategy/2800</link>
    <description>have everyone whisper a personal code of their choosing to the king. Every day, they shall repeat the code. Make sure everyone remembers not to put it in their wills. Every day, people shall whisper the king the same code. Anyone who whispers the wrong one or doesn&#39;t whisper shall be executed.

Currently, a bug surrounds the possessor possessing king so you should know when it happens.  When it is fixed, have the king whisper his code to two different people.</description>

            <p>The bad mcbads can, and then let people know via death note the next night that the King is immune. It’s an unlikely scenario, and most sane evils won’t attack the King early, but it’s a possible one that should be considered when talking about the reworked Possessor as a whole.</p>

</aside>
<p>That raises the question of whether (once the bug is fixed, of course), if the Possessor takes over the King during the first few days of the game, he can be voted up or not, because the King has vote immunity for the first few days.<br>
If he can’t be voted up, and someone tries to kill him at night and finds out he’s immune (because he’s Possessor), there’s fuck all anyone can do, and he’ll probably leave the King the day before he can be voted up. He can claim he used Guards on himself that night, but that’d seem very suspicious.<br>
If he <em>can</em> be voted up, people will instantly know the real King is gone.<br>
Seems like the whole situation is a big can of worms, which is why I’m honestly not a huge fan of the reworked Possessor.<br>
Afterthought: Also I don’t know whether the Butler can still poison the King when he’s been taken over, and whether it’ll kill him or not if he stays once it expires.</p>

</aside>
<p>The thing is, if people start using this strategy whenever they see a dead Possessor day 2, the only line of play available to the Possessor <em>in every single Possessor game</em> to not out himself is to Possess the King n1 and pretend to be the original. He wouldn’t want to leave, because then a new King would get elected and people would be able to use the strategy again to find him. And yeah, I know they could make him use Royal Finger to test, but that’s possible even without the code strategy. Also, you probably won’t get Kings to start whispering codes in the first 10 seconds of the game before the first night on the off-chance that there is a Possessor in the game. That’d be really fucked up.</p>

<p>yes I was in that game. From what I could tell, the king was fine. He didn’t seem to care much.</p>
<p>I was the physician, I’m sorry I thought that the possessor has committed suicide meant he moved to a new body.<br>
A way to find if possessor is dead is through exhume</p>

        <title>Anti-possessor strategy</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Methnor]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, I played a game with this yesterday (I was neither the Possessor nor the King). I’m pretty sure that the Possessor left the game day 1 so it was just a giant fucking pointless goose chase the entire time, but we couldn’t really know that. I also can’t speak for the King of that game as for how annoying it was to have to deal with that, but looking from the sidelines, it seemed to be kind of a pain in the ass to have to do.<br>
That being said, a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>This seems borderline metagaming, but upon reflection on this topic I was comparing it to Reaper checks. Those don’t feel like metagaming to me, but probably because that’s the only reason to actually find out if someone was Reaped. I don’t know. Worth discussing the subject as a whole, I think.</li>
<li>Assuming the current bug with the King and the Possessor is fixed (I don’t know the specifics but I’ve heard it mentioned here and elsewhere), if this strategy gets widespread, it would force the Possessor to pretty much possess the King night 1 and stay there, pretending to be the original, at least until a bunch of people die and he can move on. Not sure how desirable this is, but there’s no other real counterplay on the part of the Possessor that I can think of.</li>
<li>Reworked Possessor is strong without this strategy, extremely weak with it. Probably needs some sort of balancing, possibly involving Investigative classes being able to find out if a person is Possessed besides “is this person acting differently than yesterday”. I’ll leave that up to people more creative than myself.<br>
Just my 2 cents.</li>
</ol>

            <p>I am not falsely accusing you. You said “norm you are an idiot” so you clearly do break rule 5</p>
<p>seeing as you have broken rule 5 in this thread, I imagine that the second time probably was as well.</p>
