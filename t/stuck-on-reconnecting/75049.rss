    <title>Stuck on &quot;Reconnecting&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/stuck-on-reconnecting/75049</link>
    <description>My game just crashed in the middle of a match with &quot;Critical Error&quot; message but won&#39;t let me join a new one because it only gives me the option to &quot;Reconnect&quot; but gets stuck on &quot;Reconnecting&quot; when I click it

**UPDATE:** a few minutes later the problem has gone away</description>
