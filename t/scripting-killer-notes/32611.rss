    <description>With the ability to draw on the killer notes, I feel compelled to draw detailed drawings on them. I&#39;ve had fun in the past doing so on sites like isketch. Before I attempt that I want to confirm whether or not that is safe to do in game. I am unaware of any anti cheat detection in Throne of Lies.

Will I be banned for automating my point and clicks on the killer note screen in Throne of Lies?</description>

            <p>Have your script pause when you need to communicate or perform actions. That’s what I did.</p>

            <p>I tried doing the same, ultimatly resigned cause it took like 2 nights to draw a DN and that made me fall behind. Especially as assassin - you don’t want to waste 2 nights of kills just for a DN.</p>

            <p>Alright, after a lot of testing and tweaking I managed to get a script working. Draws great!</p>
<p>I wish there was a way to save death notes and just paste them into new games. It would make the process a lot easier.</p>

            <p>As far as I am aware, it is completely acceptable to use drawing aids to generate cleaner, well drawn death notes, I know of no rules against it.</p>

            <p>I still would like to know. I feel like it would really spice up the game if the killer had a beautifully drawn note. You can’t really “aimbot” or gain an advantage in this way either. However, Steam is Steam.</p>

            <p>I would personally go with avoiding such things.</p>
<p>This is really one of those “if you have to ask, it’s a bad idea” questions.</p>
