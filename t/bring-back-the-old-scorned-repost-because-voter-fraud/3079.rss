    <title>Bring back the old scorned (repost because voter fraud)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bring-back-the-old-scorned-repost-because-voter-fraud/3079</link>
    <description>I like old corned, I don&#39;t see why It was removed.
I felt like I was on a super secret mission, a whole different playing field. Everyone else was playing checkers, but I was playing chess.

New scorned can be won in one day. After winning old scorned, you had a sense of accomplishment; now, as new scorned, you just want to win so you can do whatever you want.

[poll type=regular public=true]
* I like new scorned, no need for change
* I like old scorned, I want it back!
* I like neither, needs rework
* I like neither, needs removal
[/poll]

(Moderators please lock old thread)

Answer me below if you don&#39;t like old scorned why you don&#39;t!
If you want rework, post your ideas!</description>

<p>I watched a game where scorned won because one of their targets was converted to cult, and then paladin found them. Scorned did nothing all game.</p>

<p>Once again, be real.</p>
<p>The old Scorned was very boring. You wait until all 3 of your targets were dead.<br>
The Scorned we have now actually requires you to talk and work on getting at least one executed.</p>
<p>Just because you <em>loath</em> playing it, doesn’t call for a removal either. I personally mark it down as my favourite class.</p>

It is boring. You just wait until one day to make your play, and then win or lose.</p>
<p>If people don’t like old scorned, that is fine; I think it needs a rework then. Or a removal; scorned is the only class that I loath playing in this game.</p>

            <p>If the community ALL agreed on it, I’m sure it’d change.<br>
But at this point more people seem to like the New Scorned, it won’t be reverted.</p>
<p>Hopefully by brining back Troll Box it’ll help boost his win-rate a little, but who knows?</p>
<p>What is known though is that Scorned at its current state needs a boost.</p>

Old Corn wasn’t much better either.</p>
<p>At least New Corn has Trollbox!</p>

            <p>Norm, be realistic here. If we changed something every time someone had a suggestion, do you think the game would ever be finished?</p>
<p>The fact that you’re getting spicy over the scorned is honestly funny.</p>
<p>People actually didn’t like the former Scorned because it relied solely on waiting for your targets to die, which people found utterly boring. It revolved around a lot of waiting, which you seem to think is more fun.</p>
<p>The Scorned we have now is more based on you actually playing for the win, rather than sitting around doing nothing with a thumb up your bum.</p>
<p>People like the Scorned we have now, what’s the point in changing it and then have a bunch of people coming here and being like “We want old scorned back” again.</p>
<p>Get real, Norm. Stop whining, it just feels like you’re trying to make changes to become relevant or important, when you can just do that by playing the game and reporting bugs.</p>
<p>Apologies if I seem aggressive, but I just feel the need to say this.</p>

            <p>I dislike old Scorned because it was mostly an RNG/luck crapshoot, both with your targets and how you used Bait and Switch.<br>
I like new Scorned much more but I feel that it’s underpowered.</p>

            <p>Rope, know why you are despised? You base most of your argument with “But it will be fun.”</p>
<p>People have different intrepretation of fun. Yours are not the only one. One opinion against balance of class and the game in general is meaningless. Stop using it to base argument.</p>
<p>For this scorned topic, I have no credibility since I don’t own the game. But the 30% win rate drop your argument to the cliff.</p>
