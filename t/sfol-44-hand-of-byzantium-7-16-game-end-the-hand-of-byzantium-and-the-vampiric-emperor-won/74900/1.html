          <h1>Welcome to SFoL - Hand of Byzantium!</h1>
<p>Hosted by Alice</p>
<p><strong>In a far away land, a magnanimous empire rules fairly over its land. However, familiar threats seem to be looming on the horizon…</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Hand of Byzantium, a SFoL I was working on for a while before I took a break. The setup here is simple. The uninformed majority needs to find and execute the traditional informed minority, that is either the Unseen or the Cult, alongside the Neutral Killer. The only difference here is that the uninformed majority is a different faction than the Blue Dragon, plus I’ve added some of my own neutrals, most of them being anti-town by nature, into this match. The King is also replaced with an Emperor that is more social and active than the classic King.</p>

<strong>Dependency (Passive)</strong> - If you die during the night or you are executed, all drained players will also die with you the following night.<br>
<strong>Transfer Life (Day)</strong> - Allows you to kill a drained player overnight, provided they are not healed or night immune, during the coming night and transfer their remaining life in turns to another drained player. This will also heal the latter player. If you transfers to yourself, then you will gain a charge of Love’s Malady instead. If the first player is healed then the ability will still function but without the first player dying. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Infatuation (Day)</strong> - When this ability is activated, all drained players will vote to pardon if a trial is underway. Usable only while a player is on trial. - 3 uses<br>
<strong>Vital Drain (Night)</strong> - Learns the target player’s class type and will drain them to death over the next two nights. While there is at least one player being drained then you will heal yourself if you are attacked or bleeding. If a drained player is healed then their timer until they are drained to death will not lower for the night but neither the healer nor the player will be notified. Does not count as an attack. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Love’s Malady (Night)</strong> - Makes the user immune to occupation and redirection for the night and instantly kills a player while bypassing Night Immunity, healing, and does not count as visiting. - 0 uses</p>
<p><em>Your objective is to defeat the Hand of Byzantium, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.</em></p>

<strong>Lycanthropy (Passive)</strong> - You are also randomly assigned a Hand of Byzantium-aligned pseudo-class at the start of the game. The pseudo-class must be able to exist on its own, such as you cannot have a Surgeon pseudo-class if three Surgeons already exist or a Magistrate pseudo-class when a Magistrate is already in the match. This pseudo-class decides your first day and first night ability along with giving you all of the pseudo-class’ passives and having bonus attributes depending on the current day or night.</p>

<li>You will be seen as your pseudo-class to investigative abilities.</li>
<li>If you are executed or die in any way, you will flip as your pseudo-class.</li>

<ul>
<li>You are immune to Poison and Bleeding.</li>
<li>You are immune to redirection and occupation.</li>

<p><strong>Lunacy (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to death at night and also can use both night abilities starting the fourth night.<br>
<strong>??? (Day)</strong> - The same primary day ability as of your pseudo-class. - ? uses<br>
<strong>Eclipse (Day)</strong> - Allows you to switch back to the attribute set for the first three nights for this night and the following day, but you can still use Maul and Chow. - 1 use<br>
<strong>??? (Night)</strong> - The same primary night ability as of your pseudo-class. - ? uses<br>
<strong>Maul and Chow (Night)</strong> - Kills the target player, but this ability cannot be used in the first or second nights. Can be used alongside your pseudo-class primary ability. - Infinite uses</p>

          <p>I tinkered around with the Emperor because the site meta is to leave obvious EKs alone until the end as they can’t convert nor kill. A DE has a 1-shot conversion while a CE has a 1-shot kill, which has an extra use if their previous class was a Baronet. The point here is that EKs are now a threat even before getting close to LyLo.</p>

<p><strong>Neutral Support</strong><br>
<strong>Mentorship (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to death at night and will have a 50-50 chance of starting aligned with the Hand of Byzantium or against them. If the Senex is aligned with the Hand of Byzantium, then he will lose his night immunity after the second night.<br>
<strong>Beloved Mentor (Passive)</strong> - If you win with the Hand of Byzantium, your attributes will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are executed on trial, then all Hand of Byzantium-aligned players who did not vote for a pardon will be occupied in the coming night and will have their immunity to occupation bypassed.</li>
<li>If you are killed by a Hand of Byzantium-aligned killing role, then they will die of guilt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teachings (Day)</strong> - Reveals the user as the Senex - One use<br>
<strong>Mind Reader (Day)</strong> - Learns the target player’s alignment. If they are not aligned with the Hand of Byzantium then you learn their exact class. Can only be used if you are against the Blue Dragon and can be used in the same day along Teachings. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Traditional Herbs (Night)</strong> - Heals a player, preventing them from dying to night and cures poison and bleeding. The target player will also be seen as a member of the Hand of Byzantium to faction checks. Cannot be used on the same player two nights in a row and can be used on the user. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Ancient Tonic (Night)</strong> - Causes the targeted player to be night and occupy immune for the current night allows them to bypass healing, night immunity, occupation immunity, and redirection immunities. - 1 use<br>
<em>Has a random goal of either A) See that the Hand of Byzantium win or B) See that the Hand of Byzantium is defeated.</em></p>
