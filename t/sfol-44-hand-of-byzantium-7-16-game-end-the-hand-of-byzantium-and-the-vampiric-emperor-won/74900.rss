    <description># Welcome to SFoL - Hand of Byzantium!

Hosted by Alice

**In a far away land, a magnanimous empire rules fairly over its land. However, familiar threats seem to be looming on the horizon…**

Welcome to Hand of Byzantium, a SFoL I was working on for a while before I took a break. The setup here is simple. The uninformed majority needs to find and execute the traditional informed minority, that is either the Unseen or the Cult, alongside the Neutral Killer. The only difference here is that the uninformed majority is a different faction than the Blue Dragon, plus I&#39;ve added some of my own neutrals, most of them being anti-town by nature, into this match. The King is also replaced with an Emperor that is more social and active than the classic King.

&gt;**Lycanthropy (Passive)** - You are also randomly assigned a Hand of Byzantium-aligned pseudo-class at the start of the game. The pseudo-class must be able to exist on its own, such as you cannot have a Surgeon pseudo-class if three Surgeons already exist or a Magistrate pseudo-class when a Magistrate is already in the match. This pseudo-class decides your first day and first night ability along with giving you all of the pseudo-class&amp;rsquo; passives and having bonus attributes depending on the current day or night.
&gt;
&gt;~Attributes until the fourth day.
&gt; * You will be seen as your pseudo-class to investigative abilities.
&gt; * If you are executed or die in any way, you will flip as your pseudo-class.
&gt;
&gt;~Attributes from the fourth day onwards.
&gt; * You are immune to Poison and Bleeding.
&gt; * You are immune to redirection and occupation.
&gt; 
&gt;**Lunacy (Passive)** - You are immune to death at night and also can use both night abilities starting the fourth night.
**??? (Day)** - The same primary day ability as of your pseudo-class. - ? uses
**Eclipse (Day)** - Allows you to switch back to the attribute set for the first three nights for this night and the following day, but you can still use Maul and Chow. - 1 use
**??? (Night)** - The same primary night ability as of your pseudo-class. - ? uses
**Maul and Chow (Night)** - Kills the target player, but this ability cannot be used in the first or second nights. Can be used alongside your pseudo-class primary ability. - Infinite uses
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to defeat the Hand of Byzantium, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.*
[/details]
The Cult will remain the same, but the Cult alts for each class was added. Check the class cards for more.
