            <p>well we are drifting off topic, might go better in the remove inq thread… but on a strategic level… I’d disagree with the general concept. I mean yeah his goal and the BD’s goal are aligned… but on a strategic level… for him it is a good idea to blind stab every night, starting day 2, or 3 at the latest. doing which probability wise is more likely to elminate BD… but it has a chance to kill the sorc. and it also lowers the suspect pool for when executions happen the next day (and obviously he wants it to end before he has a chance of getting killed), so needless to say that’s all in his interests, though probability wise is against BDs interests.</p>
<p>As a vote he’s good, but he’s almost 3x more likely to remove at least one BD vote, thus negating his value as a voter, and that’s of course ignoring that after the sorc is dead… he has zero remaining incentive to help BD.</p>
<p>Mainly what I always see everyone say with regards to inq. “Lie and claim you are investigating, but do blind stab”. But everyone knows that’s how they would play, and how everyone else would play… so why the heck do we pretend to buy that?</p>
<p>In short IMO the Alch’s using his abilities is very likely to help BD (he has unlimited use of heal, and generally a desire to prove himself as alc… mainly because he has reason to fear prince or votes, while unseen/cult would probably not risk wasting a night bouncing off his stoneskin), and the alc doesn’t have the option to shoot for an early finish like the inq does.</p>

<p>Because he isn’t just an alch with more bombs. He votes with BD and won’t turn until a specific (and known) point. AKA: when the sorc dies. After the sorcerer is dead all bets are off.</p>
<p>Remember: If the Inquisitor survives to a BD victory then he wins. Surviving to a scum victory is not safe. Therefore he balences like a BD member while the Sorc is alive.</p>

</aside>
<p>honestly with alc I’ve seen them executed so rarely because honestly on a practical level, alc itself is so useful it’s pretty detrimental to kill them. I’d say an 80-90% BD preference rate for legitimate alcs (do note prefrence means that does turn around if BD messes up enough that unseen has majority), They do generally heal, and of course are conversion immune and difficult to kill.</p>
<p>The one that totally baffles me most of the time, is why the heck isn’t inq kill on sight. He’s just an alc with an extra bomb and no healing.</p>

<p>The physician isn’t actually weak or even boring like CW used to be. Her problem is being to common which makes people burn out and want something else. These suggestions are trying to make it so we can reduce healer frequency and increase the distinction between healers.</p>

            <p>What if a new neutral killer was introduced with a non-nightshade poison. this could bring differences between phys and alch (say phys can remove the poison by drawing it out, but the alch’s potions don’t cure it). this would make phys feel stronger than alchs, and make town more reliant on phys.</p>

            <p>The heal message could just be changed to a general “you cured your target’s wounds” then to prevent that.</p>

            <p>Honestly. That’s missing the point. Bleed was chosen because it makes the heal message the same. The idea being that if you get creative you could do something fancy to get people killed.</p>

            <p>Agreed, but instead of replacing nightshade rupture should give poison instead.  It might be a bit confusing since bleed is already a night ability for hunter.  And they should have different mechanics.</p>

<p>What is the point of changing poison to bleed, apart from making it slightly more difficult to tell what the evil faction is?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s the point.  It’s too easy to tell what the evil faction is early game.  SHeriff and paladin need changes as well.</p>

<p>Oh another thing I wanted was to make bleed always kill in one night. That might be too much however</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s why I said they should be different mechanics.  Bleeding should be a night ability which kills in one night, and poison a day ability that kills in 2.</p>

            <p>Not ALL of the FoL things should be added. Cult points is another example of things that work in FoL but not ToL. Same with the reduced feedback.</p>
<p>However both games can learn from each other</p>

            <p>I mean the less radical changes.</p>
<p>The average ToL player would probably just quit if the near-zero feedback change was added to the game, but other changes such as merging bleeding+poison would not affect much barring granting evils more claim-space.</p>

            <p>The people playing FoL and the general populace playing ToL are extremely different, so you gotta take that into account.</p>
<p>FoL and ToL also play very differently.</p>
