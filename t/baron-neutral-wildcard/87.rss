    <description>The Baron
Neutral Wildcard 
Goal: Destroy the Blue Dragon **at all costs** (even if you die)

Passive: Money talks: Immune to death at night. 

Passive: Adaptive Morality- If converted, you will join the converter&#39;s team as usual, but your role will remain the same (your goal will change to match)

Day Ability 1: Bribe: Give gold to someone. They will be unable to vote that day, as you now control their vote. You can make them vote for anyone, _including themselves (nothing will show in that case, the required votes will just go down silently if that happens.)_

Night ability 1: Coerce: 2 uses:  Can buy a player drinks at night, occupying them. In his/her drunken stupor, your target taught you how to use their abilities. 

Night ability 2: Capitalize: Infinite: Select out of the abilities you&#39;ve been taught, and some of them you&#39;ve learned previously (Some random abilities, and some abilities you&#39;ve gained from occupying roles) and perform one tonight. 
**Abilities that cannot be gained: Any kills, Bribe**</description>

            <p>Thank You, Xblade,</p>
<p>I ended up updating the class to allow for a few more abilities.</p>

<p>Give gold to someone. They will be unable to vote the following day, and you control their vote in addition to yours for only the following day</p>

<p>I like “The Aristocrat” as a name. We recently renamed “Nobles” to “Royals” so it’s not confused with <a href="https://tol.wikia.com/The_Noble">The Noble class</a>.</p>
<p>This idea is quite similar to something we planned for The Thief (a future date), but we couldn’t think of enough fun techniques to do with gold stealing and bribery. Keep the ideas flowing, I like where this is going <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>How about calling it Aristocrat or Baron? It would fit the description of the class, as aristocrats and barons are generally high-ranked and wealthy people.</p>
