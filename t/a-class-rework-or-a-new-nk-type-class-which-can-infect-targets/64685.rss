    <title>A class rework or a new NK type class which can infect targets</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/a-class-rework-or-a-new-nk-type-class-which-can-infect-targets/64685</link>
    <description>I was thinking about the neutral killers, and how they work. The neutral killers can only kill one at a time ( with exceptions, eg. Sorcerer Circle of Death). It would be nice if a concept where a class &quot;infects&quot; or &quot;smothers&quot; targets which could either be killed after being infected or empower the class itself after a certain number of people have been infected into this game.

For example, the class could &quot;infect&quot; targets on odd or even nights, and once a certain number has been reached or whenever they wanted to, these targets would be killed (with exceptions, eg healed, in jail etc.) Some classes could be immune to this, and others could protect themselves from it (eg. fool hide could protect them from being infected). They could either kill the targets, or become empowered after &quot;infecting&quot; multiple targets. I think if this were to become a new class, it would probably just be another neutral killer.

This is just a vague idea I have, but I think this could be worked into a new class or a class rework which could make the game more interesting. If anyone has other ideas like this comment below!

Thanks
- Lily

Edit: This is something like the Arsonist/Plaguebearer from ToS. Also, I heard a name idea from the discord for this possible new class: Warlock.</description>

            <p>Well, instead of a new class, you can have a Reaper Rework that works similar to this.</p>
<p>At night, the Reaper visits a person and takes their soul, learning their class (or class type). The victim, however, does not die and continues to act normally. All of the Reaper’s powers still work the same (Empowered Reap, instead of bypassing Death Immunity, bypasses Visit Prevention instead), but at night, they have the ability to Mark for Death, which kills all soulless targets at once (bypassing Death Immunity).</p>
<p>That way, the Reaper remains mostly the same, but without the telltale “reaped” effect. In compensation, the Reaper now is able to claim an Investigative role to buy themselves some time before the big strike.</p>

<p>Actually it makes it easier because there are more live Investigatives and people to gather and act on those claims.</p>

            <p>I have two main concerns.</p>
<p>Firstly: It’s going to be a lot harder for the bd to find them. If people die slowly, it means more people to get claims from and investigate. If it’s anout one death per night, and then suddenly everyone except the nk and alch drop dead, bd’s going to have a rough time of it.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s going to REALLY screw over the unseen/cult. Have you ever played an evil after the sorc gets yolo stabbed n1? It’s really really slow. You can do it as cult through sheer nbers, but it’s insanely difficult for unseen. With an “infector,” it’s going to be like that until either the nk gets caught and killed (in which case the evils must do all the killing themselves), or everone but the nk spontaneously drops dead.</p>

            <p>Like I said, this is just a vague idea. That may be the biggest problem with this class, the fact that it would be hard to work the class so it is not super easy to discover its evil  and have bd be able to root it out quickly and just execute. I’m not 100% sure how this could be worked, but maybe others could add to this?</p>
