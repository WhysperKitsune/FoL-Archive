    <title>Revert the Sheriff changes; make the Sheriff non-unique and convertable</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/revert-the-sheriff-changes-make-the-sheriff-non-unique-and-convertable/40655</link>
    <description>Making the Sheriff unique, guaranteed, and unconvertable is an absolutely terrible idea.  In practice, the most important impact of this is to make it [i]completely impossible[/i] for evils to ever claim Sheriff - the real sheriff will easily call you out.

This in turn means that anyone who claims Sheriff will be almost always be believed (Scorned have a huge amount of trouble claiming Sheriff, too, because, again, the real Sheriff will call you out immediately, knowing that a second one is impossible, and the real sheriff will [i]always be present[/i] in an Unseen game.  There&#39;s some configurations of fools and scorned that could occasionally lead to a mistake, but the vast majority of the time Sheriff claims are now off-limits to anyone but a real Sheriff and trying to fakeclaim it will get you instantly called out.)

At the same time, Sheriffs now have no strategic depth in deciding when to reveal - conversion immunity means that you&#39;ll almost always be covered (since knights, physicians, alchemists, and the king can all completely protect you, and Observers can functionally do so as well.)  This leaves Unseen with few options for dealing with a Sheriff and makes gameplay surrounding the Sheriff extremely dull (Sheriffs reveal as soon as they have any info; protectives always protect a revealed sheriff who hasn&#39;t been CCed because they&#39;re almost 100% genuine; Unseen have to avoid him; nobody has any interesting choices or room for deception.)

What was this change trying to accomplish?  It makes the metagame significantly worse; I saw only one post requesting it, based on very weak arguments about making Sheriffs more fun for the Sheriff (without regard for the impact on gameplay beyond that) and veiled threats by the poster that the risk of being converted made them want to gamethrow as a Sheriff by never revealing themselves or doing anything to help BD.  These are not credible arguments, certainly not for a set of changes that (taken together) severely damage the metagame.  ToL is a conversion-based game.  The risk of being converted is a major part of every role and central to the game; among the BD, [i]only[/i] the Prince and the King should ever be completely immune.  If people are terrified of being converted, there are changes that can be made to reduce the penalty for getting converted late (as I&#39;ve suggested in the past).  But it&#39;s central to the game and granting BD roles conversion-immunity undermines the basic concept that keeps things interesting.

Beyond that, Sheriffs [i]absolutely cannot[/i] be unique.  This is the most serious problem with the changes.  The change seems to be premised on the idea that uniqueness makes a BD role weaker; but the opposite is true.  Uniqueness makes roles more powerful by making it harder for evils to claim them.  Yes, it can be used to balance an overpowered role, but individual Sheriffs were not (previously) overpowered.

And, more generally, we need to be moving in the direction of allowing more roles that evils can claim, not less. A change that makes it functionally impossible for anyone but a Jester to fakeclaim Sheriff is a terrible idea.

(Having Sheriffs be guaranteed is not itself a problem as long as they&#39;re not also unique.  But the combination of the two completely removes the Sheriff as a fakeclaim for most eviles, which I don&#39;t think is an acceptable sacrifice for the very weak and mostly unimportant gains that this change was aimed at producing.)</description>

            <p>Trust me, Orange…<br>
The Sheriff change was a horrible thing, and here is why:<br>
Sheriff is now no longer a valid fakeclaim. That is very important because sheriff was a very strong fakeclaim for Unseen that was absolutely needed.<br>
Sheriff can protect himself 3 times while outing unseen that visit OR making all visitors MM or not unseen.<br>
Sheriff can freely out himself because usually there are so many healers, especially these alchs the Unseen can’t reliably kill.<br>
Their ability stops even a Sage with Wall of Fire.</p>
<p>Every time I see Unseen win one of the following happens:<br>
The Sheriff dies because they didnt claim.<br>
The Sheriff was murdered by the Evil King.<br>
The King got killed somehow, and replaced by a trusted Evil King.<br>
THATS IT.</p>

            <p>Sheriff is a bit much.  Had a game where he openly outted himself d3 and Unseen spent the entire game trying to kill him and couldn’t, game went to d10.  Prince was even dead, but it didn’t matter.  Kings would chain guard him while healers healed him, assuming he didn’t just make himself unkillable, which also let him see whoever was after him.</p>
<p>We tried killing the king and converting a known Drunk, but that also failed, which just reset their guards and it was all over at that point.</p>
<p>If you don’t  get a Royal Blood convert early AND get them voted up it’s kind of rough, especially since Kings are usually good, which makes the Sheriff outting himself a fairly safe play.</p>

            <p>I’ve had varying results, but I agree that people broadly trust him less.</p>
<p>I’m trying to figure out <span class="bbcode-i">why</span>.  Anyway, we’ll see if the new numbers in the latest patch change anything, but IMHO either way, strategically, BD should almost always trust the starting king unless they have a compelling reason not to.  The benefits of trusting a good king vastly outweigh the disadvantages of trusting an evil one, since an evil one usually can’t do anything bad without outing themselves.</p>
<p>I feel that this is part of a more general problem in these kinds of Mafia games where the Town / BD / good-uninformed side is too reluctant to share information, as if they can just keep their heads low and the evils will forget about them.</p>

            <p>King is definitely not as trustworthy because of the reasons I described. Previously, if a King found and outed an evil, he appeared as if he was working for BD. Now, there’s is no way for King to increase the Court’s trust in himself. AND because he has a direct kill ability, he is even less trustworthy and communication is discouraged. Why would I ever tell the king my class when he can directly kill me if he’s evil?</p>
<p>Anyway, I do think old king/Allies deserved a nerf. I just don’t approve of completely removing the king’s investigative abilities, since they are what gave king his social power. Allies should come back in a nerfed fashion. Allies having 3 charges and giving feedback in the form of ‘sus/not sus’ is probably the best way to do it IMO.</p>

            <p>1: I have not played the new patch, nor do I claim to have.</p>
<p>2: The King is <em>exactly</em> as trustworthy as he was before.</p>
<p>3: I do not deny that the King has issues. See my King suggestion.</p>
<p>However, I strongly believe that removing Allies is the right move in any circumstance. Also, there are entire games built around the idea of nobody having investigative powers, and sometimes no powers at all (such a mountainous setup). These games are still entirely winnable by Town with a higher percentage than random chance would suggest.</p>
<p>Now, despite this, I do not suggest removing all investigatives from ToL. I know you don’t mean to insinuate that I do, and that you were only hyperbolizing my position in an attempt to make a point, but I will still clarify that that is not my goal.</p>
<p>But the old King crossed the line between having investigative powers available and relying entirely on them.</p>

            <p>That’s not what I’m talking about when it comes to deduction, so you ‘wildly misunderstand’ what I’m even trying to say. Obviously finding evils with check targets is not deduction. I’m talking about figuring out who the evils are AFTER you discover that a certain person is evil.</p>
<p>And to even find out who evil people are, there need to be checks as crutches to a certain degree. Fuck it, let’s just remove Observer’s Peek and Sheriff entirely! After all, they are ‘I win’ buttons, amirite. Let’s just have no hard checks at all and force everybody to figure out who the evils are by just talking to each other! I’m sure the game will be REALLY fun and interesting then, especially for new players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now you are forced to actually socially deduct things and figure out who the scum are</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I keep seeing people say this but I still have seen no real justification for this. The only thing that changed is that there is less publicly and privately available information. No amount of chatting can solve things if claims are solid and logs are fine. The change literally decreased deduction and now you’re forced to make wilder guesses with less concrete information to back it up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although, on that note, you do realize that the King is literally exactly as trustworthy as he was before, right? The probabilities of the King being good or evil are the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you completely miss the point. The King’s spawn rate is not relevant here. The whole point is it’s become completely impossible for a King to ‘prove’ whether or not he’s good or evil until he starts killing people, and even then it’s a ‘oops didn’t know he was BD’ situation. Now, literally not a single BD should trust the King and the court should hang him ASAP. It’s not smart letting a Killer with unknown allegiances stay long enough to get kills off, on the off chance (33%!) he’s actually a good guy.</p>
<p>Anyway I’m not making the wrong complaints, you’re just not making the proper observations of the patch and its direct/indirect effects.</p>

<p>I agree there, but I do have to say the sheriff changes, is a bloody mess from where I see it… I am glad everything isn’t rolling around the king, but it seems to me, almost everything insane about the king, just went to the sheriff.</p>
<p>New night ability Surveillance - Prevent visitors and learn the name of those that try. You will be alerted if an Unseen member tries. 3 uses.</p>
<p>The sheriff is now, unconvertable… and un CCable. That tool is off the charts in confirmability… Checking claims… as well as making the unseen think twice before attempting to assasinate the confirmed sheriff.</p>
<p>Assasian CC’s the sheriff after being busted on day 3.<br>
Sheriff - N1 - Surveylance (joe visited me).<br>
Even works if the visitor died n2 (bob visited sheriff - prevented)</p>
<p>Well… day tricks are out, lets kill him at night… wait… if he’s anticipating that it’s the equivalent of getting debauched. He won’t die, and he knows the unseen who visited him.</p>

            <p>I think you wildly misunderstand the core concept of the word “deduction”.</p>
<p>Deduction is <strong>not</strong> clicking a button at night, finding a member of the Unseen, and then whispering that to the King and letting him vote them up for you.</p>
<p>Sure, you can’t really do that anymore, but so what? Now you are forced to actually socially deduct things and figure out who the scum are, especially once your Sheriff dies.</p>
<p>The game plays more like it used to now. The Sheriff must be careful about when he reveals, as he can’t necessarily out to the King alone and survive.</p>
<p>Although, on that note, you do realize that the King is literally exactly as trustworthy as he was before, right? The probabilities of the King being good or evil are the same.</p>
<p>All in all, you’re making the wrong complaints.</p>

            <p>Sheriff being unique and nonconvertible AND the King having no checks breaks down the communication network significantly in ways which I believe even the devs did not anticipate. Previously, sheriffs could afford to out themselves AT LEAST to the King, knowing that even if they died there would be potentially another Sheriff. Now, what happens? Sheriff can’t trust King (literally nobody should and the entire court should be clamoring to hang King ASAP), and Sheriff won’t want to out himself to the court. And that’s not even counting the HORRIBLE matches where Sheriff gets random killed early and BD have virtually no proper investigators the whole game besides maybe an Obs.</p>
<p>The entire attempt to open up deduction/communication has backfired IMO. Now information is even harder to come around and there is now less actual deduction and more being helpless/guessing wildly.</p>

            <p>I don’t deny that was the idea which Bos said to all of us, but I feel like that the Unseen’s winrates will go further away slightly where the Unseen would be screwed if the Sherrif keeps on finding them and cannot go for a claim of Sherrif they used to go for.</p>
<p>As I said further above. Let’s see what happens. Maybe it does work</p>

            <p>I agree with this outlook, but according to Boslof it’s also an attempt to bring Unseen and Cult’s winrates closer.</p>

            <p>That’s questionable really. I remember one game the Mastermind made a fatal mistake claiming Princess when it was Royal Blood phase, and then they were executed. That was the end of the Unseen that game. Was kinda funny at the same time.</p>
<p>This shows you really need to be slightly experienced to be able to make plays like that</p>

            <p>The unconvertable sheriff make the game more about deceive.</p>
<p>For example, as an assasian, you can claim “9 lies im the sheriff”, then bd will exe/prince exe 9 because he is a “fool” now, and you’ll get killed by a prince to get more room for converts.</p>

            <p>To be honest, even I’m not happy with the Sherrif changes due to the fact the Unseen can be capped only at three and when the Mastermind is killed after Night 3, there will be no way of making converts compared to the Cult, where every death of a Leader makes someone into the new one. It would have been better to have a guaranteed Unique and unconvertable Paladin, as it means the Cult has to play carefully to kill the Paladin to ensure their survival and pray that no one is watching/healing them.</p>
<p>We’ll see where it goes. I even remember the times in the Beta where Sherrif and Paladin were unconvertible, and there have been times where I have been able to win as Cult (just barely though) because we out doubt on the Paladins</p>
