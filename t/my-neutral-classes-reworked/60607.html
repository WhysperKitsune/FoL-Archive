<p>Changes:</p>

<strong><em>Class Type - Investigative</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive 1 - slowly dying</strong> - The first time you are attacked, he will not die but the next day and night you will not be able to use any abilities, also you will not be able to talk in any form of chat (includes prince or psychic chat for that night)</p>

<li>If you take someone’s night ability that has unlimited then they won’t know you took one, but if there is a limit then you will be alerted that some of your soul has been taken.</li>
<li>If you take someone’s soul for the third time, who has royal blood then you would gain royal blood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1 - full body swap</strong> - become a class of your choice(except any Unique classes) you will become that class for the next day and night. When you become a class you are allowed to use their day and night abilities (2 uses)</p>
<p>Notes:</p>

<li>if you become a fool and get killed during the day that morning then you will win still.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Win condition</strong>- survive to see the BD fall.</p>
<p><strong>My thoughts -</strong> this is a class to help counter BD while also having a lot of claiming space.</p>
