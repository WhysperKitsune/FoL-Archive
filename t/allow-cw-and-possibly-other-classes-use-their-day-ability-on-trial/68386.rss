    <title>Allow cw (and possibly other classes) use their day ability on trial</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/allow-cw-and-possibly-other-classes-use-their-day-ability-on-trial/68386</link>
    <description>I think cw should be able to use their day abilities on trial,

There is nothing more frustrated from getting converted to a loss that are responsible for,
And bd should have a way to deal with just convert any invest class,

The new cw day ability should be used when you know who is that invest class, but you don&#39;t have time to figure it out because once trial started, it&#39;s too late.

Also, I don&#39;t get why any ability that doesnt prove yourself should be limited on trial, Trial is somtimes 80% of the day.</description>

            <p>Boslof already said he overlooked this. I fully expect this to be changed in the next patch or 2</p>
