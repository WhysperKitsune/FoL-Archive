    <title>[BUG] Free gold bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-free-gold-bug/65999</link>
    <description>#### What happened?I clicked on purchase gold awhile ago, but never followed through with the purchase. After the latest patch the gold recieved after purchasing went up, so they gave as much gold as they increased it with. How ever even though I never went through with the purchase I still recieved the extra gold. Just wanted to let the developers know so it doesn&#39;t happen again in the future.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? I wasn&#39;t supposed to recieve any gold at all.

#### Steps to reproduce:

#### Comments: This game is great :)</description>

            <p>I believe there was an announcement about this on the Discord. They are aware there was a bug but have decided to let everyone who accidentally got given gold to keep it.</p>
