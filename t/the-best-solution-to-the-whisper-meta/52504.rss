    <description>No Whispers,  just remove fucking whispers from the game. Fol, Sfol don&#39;t have it and everyoen loves them.

It&#39;s not like it changes anything drastically, psychic finally gets the purpose that it needs rather then being a Jr Prince.</description>

            <p>I’m fairly sure that no RB favors BD even more. Random Suicides is too punishing for when a BD king is Good but Dumb.</p>
<p>Anarchy is… probably about fair, but I don’t know that people would care?</p>

<p>That’s a total of 2 deaths as a result of butler poison regardless of Kings faction. 1 of which is BD at minimum. That isn’t worth it and is the reason why Butler can even have an ability like that.</p>

            <p>Either way, I would also add an “anarchy” penalty (either Nobility doesn’t count after that, or no king at all) for when a Butler poisons a BD king, because otherwise people would have the Butler kill the king to get around the penalty <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> prove the Butler.  The Butler’s suicide isn’t enough because it takes two full nights to happen and is totally a worthwhile trade-off to make a confirmed BD king.</p>

            <p>It is probably the “safest” solution, although I admit I am fond of the “you done fucked up; every BD who didn’t vote inno on him commits suicide the next night” approach.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s drastic, but I feel that lynching the king should be an <span class="bbcode-i">extremely big deal</span>, and making it so the entire game hangs in the balance is interesting.</p>

            <p>I would also point out, if good king is executed his logbook isn’t displayed. is a pretty negligable penalty. If people don’t trust the king enough that they killed him early… they probably also didn’t whisper him anything to log.</p>
<p>The royal blood killer I’d be in favor of though. That single handedly kills the primary motive for executing the undetermined king (as royal blood eliminates 80-90% of evils and neutrals from the race)</p>

<p>The problem here is that then the starting king will be auto-lynched so that a proven king can take charge.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Penalize BD somehow if a Good King is lynched (there’s already penalties if he’s poisoned by a butler or executed by the prince, but those could be made worse somehow.)  This is something I suggested over and over as an alternative to making the king more likely to be good.</p>
<p>For example, some possibilities (varying drastically in severity):</p>
<p>If a Good King is lynched or dies to BD, his logbook isn’t displayed.</p>
<p>If a Good King is lynched, there’s no lynch the next day (possibly the next two days), like a Jester.</p>
<p>If a Good King is lynched, nobility no longer counts for anything for the rest of the game (the nobility step is skipped, so nobles can’t confirm themselves and anyone can become king.)  This makes it less likely that you’ll be able to replace him with someone good early on.</p>
<p>If a Good King is lynched, Anarchy is declared and the king doesn’t get replaced fullstop.  No more king for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>If a Good King is lynched, every BD who didn’t vote inno on him commits suicide the next night.  (The most extreme version.  I mean, this is pretty much “BD loses” - yes, it could out some evils who voted him up, but given the severity of the punishment it hardly matters.  But I think it might actually lead to interesting gameplay.  Lynching the king should be a drastic step.)</p>
<p>Possibly, for all of the above:  A Neutral King is considered to be a Good King for these purposes D2 and D3 (since it is extremely unlikely BD would validly know he’s neutral that early.)</p>
<p>I honestly, seriously believe it was a mistake to fiddle with the king percentages, <span class="bbcode-i">especially</span> over concerns about people auto-lynching kings.  Not knowing the king’s role is central to the game.  Lynching the king to replace him with a confirmed BD is an exploit that needs to be patched, but making the starting king very likely to be good is counterproductive because, again, you’re supposed to be <span class="bbcode-i">unsure</span> if the king is good - if he’s more likely to be good than evil, it doesn’t work (and we get problems like this stemming from BD auto-trusting him.)</p>

<p>What if using a whisper cost time?  It took 5 seconds off the day length each time someone whispered?  It might make sense to also move the day length indicator to an animation so that its speed could be changed to reflect this rather than the clock “jumping.”</p>

<p>how would one avoid say, 4 BD 3 unseen. it’s finally becoming clear 30 seconds before voting ends. votes start to happen, then all 3 unseen whisper eating up 15 seconds</p>
<p>(I am assuming it isn’t duplicate whispers).</p>
<p>also not sure what would be accomplished in the good. king would get most everything he cares about (the origional claims) on day 2. then he’s just got 2 or 3 people he will get frequent updates with. I’m assuming no person can count more than once as that would lead to the crazy time eater strategy of one guy running the whole clock down single handedly.</p>

            <p>Wholeheartedly disagree. This only became a problem once the king change and subsequently the king’s alignment chances change were implemented. I honestly prefer going back to the allies days, but for sure at least raise the chance of an evil king.</p>

<p>What if using a whisper cost time?  It took 5 seconds off the day length each time someone whispered?  It might make sense to also move the day length indicator to an animation so that its speed could be changed to reflect this rather than the clock “jumping.”</p>

            <p>You entirely miss my point, I said remove basic whispering {Eo: Whisper during the day}</p>
<p>And if you want my follow up if I wanted this to occure</p>
<p>Psychic changes their Private Whisper ability to be 1 of 2 options</p>
<ol>
<li>A selected player is able to use the old whisper mechanic and will be notified if they are able to do so</li>
<li>A selected player will be able to whisper to the psychic</li>
</ol>
<p>Noble can also be changed to incorporate a whisper-like mechanic into their abilities.</p>

            <p>On Orange’s thread <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/lets-talk-about-whispers/51870/8">here</a>, Boslof said he couldn’t do this. So it’s not really a solution unfortunately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whispers were perfectly fine before the King whisper meta. Just removing them is not how to fix that problem.</p>
<p>People like to whisper. No one is going to leave the game because whispers are still there. People will leave if you remove them.</p>
