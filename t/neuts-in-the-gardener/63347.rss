    <description>**[The Gardener]**
_&quot;Someone has to take care of the plants in Castle Adiart.&quot;_

Special

**Pasives:** 
_Just watering the flowers:_ Immune to death at night. Immune to occupation and redirection.
_Dont mind me:_ Can not vote people up. Can vote Execute/Pardon. (Counts as a dead player for the amount of votes required to get someone up)

**Day abilities:**

_Blue Seeds:_ Give a Blue seed to a player, cant target King.

_Purple/Red Seeds:_ Give a Purple/Red seed to a player, cant target King. (Purple in Unseen games, Red in Cult, yeah, he knows what game is from the start)

**Night abilities:**

_Grow!:_ Chose a player with a seed, it will grow tonight if its a Puple/Red seed, or the following night if its a Blue one.

_Deadly vines:_ Select 2 players with grown seeds, and grow vines between them.
 [Max 2 spaces between them **2**-(3,4)-**5**]. 
If the players caught between them try to leave their rooms, they will be prevented and bleed, dying within 1 night. (1 uses)


**Win condition:** Grow seeds with the colour of the winning side. If BD, Cult and Unseen lose, you lose too.

Blue seeds: Can only grow in Blue Dragon players.
Purple/Red seeds: Can only grow in Cult/Unseen.
Trying to grow a seed on the wrong player will occupy them.


Do I think this class coul be fun? I dont know, I just think that we need a Gardener class.
He plays his own mini-game, he is just a gardener. But watch out with the plants!

Edit: Changed Extra Thorny Rose to Deadly vines. Deadly vines would use an updated hunter wolf warning, also you cant target dead players with seeds.</description>

            <p>Forgot this question!</p>
<p><em>How does the Seeds work?</em><br>
<strong>During the day you chose a player, you give them a seed, A or B, and during the night you grow it.</strong><br>
<strong>Red/Purple seeds grow the same night, you will get a notification if it works, if it fails you OCC the targeted player.</strong><br>
<strong>Blue seeds take longer, since there is more BD than Evil/Neut, it takes 2 nights, so if you grow it on night 2, at the end of night 3 you will be notified.</strong></p>

            <p><em>Will you get a prompt D1 that chooses what team your on?</em><br>
<strong>No, you can see from D1 what game is it based on the color of the seeds, then you chose what to plant that day.<br>
(Could just make the 2º seed something diferent and make it work the same way without the “I know what game it is from the start” part, but I think it would be cool to have something like this on a neut class)</strong></p>
<p><em>Or will you plant a BD seed on someone, try to use Grow! Find out it’s not working and then planting a Purple/Red seed?</em><br>
<strong>This is what would happen, try to plant a blue one, it fails, you are noticed at the end of the next night.</strong></p>
<p><em>Will you be able to plant seeds of both types?</em><br>
<strong>Yes, but if you have even seeds you lose, or maybe you could make that the winning with NK situation.</strong></p>
<p><em>Who do you win with if that’s the case?</em><br>
<strong>If you plant 3 blue and 2 red, and cult wins, you lose since you had more on bd.</strong></p>
<p><em>When growing seeds fail, do you know if you occupied them or do you not?</em><br>
<strong>Yes you do, remember that blue seeds are delayed 1 night, so if you grow N2 and it fails ,you will Occ them N3</strong></p>
<p><em>Will the Growing of seeds be considered a “Conversion” (as per Noble and Sellsword)?</em><br>
<strong>Nope.</strong></p>
<p><em>If it is, will the current CW without rework be able to block it?</em><br>
<strong>Nope</strong></p>
<p><em>Will people who died with grown / ungrown seeds keep their seeds? (For Deadly Vines ability)</em><br>
<strong>The seed counts for your win, but you CANT target dead players.</strong></p>
<p><em>Will Deadly Vines skip over dead people, or will dead people be counted on the “Max 2 spaces”</em><br>
<strong>No, if you target 2-5, and 3 is dead, you only hit 4, the max of 2 space is for targeting.</strong></p>

            <p>Vines is a really hard skill to use, good but hard to use, you want to hit the 2 targets, so you must watch out while planting seeds, and still it can be healed, lets say that Sorc perception makes her immune to it, reaper and poss can still be bleed, Poss can try to jump next night and Reaper can just eat a soul.<br>
He cant kill prince, and I think thats a really important point.</p>

            <p>He can side with unseen, but could kill the Sorc with vines, maybe Perception could work with vines so she doesnt die.<br>
The goal is to “predict” the winning faction of the game, and play arround that</p>

            <p>Actually I cant give him white seeds because the game only lets you have 2 skills, and yeah, I didnt want him to win with nk because that would make him too good later in the game, anyway, before vines he had a worse killing skills, but yeah, also lorewise…<br>
KILLERS DO NOT LIKE PLANTS, CANT SIDE WITH THEM (except assassin, he loves roses)!</p>

            <p>Giving Gardener the ability to side with NK would mostly make Gardener too easy.<br>
The Gardener can bleed people, and a lot of times, the NK needs a quick way to kill of people, with Gardener simply helping NK out it would be too simple for Gardener to win.</p>
<p>Making Gardener unable to win with NK also restrains his use on Deadly vines (It only has 1 use anyway)</p>
<p>Thinking about it, you <em>COULD</em> give him “White seeds”, but then he has to choose wether to side with NK, Evils or BD. Not exactly an easy choice.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s because Sorc can win with Unseen/Cult</p>
<p>Also the whole idea with Sorc and Inq isn’t good imo, it would be better if we made the Sorc into a NK and remove the Inq part imo</p>

            <p>Ofc, the seed WONT give a notificacion, only the gardener knows who got one, and the colour of the seed, you should think what to do, tell the court that X is evil, or keep it a secret, since blue seeds take longer to grow etc<br>
Id like to give him a killing skill, maybe a “bear” for players with seeds, or a CoD maybe?</p>

            <p>Maybe make the Gardener fake claim able? Like the receiver isn’t made aware if they get a seed or something? This can shade some doubt on the claim, and maybe making it slightly against both sides could give it a reason to be voted/executed/killed at night (as mentioned by <a class="mention" href="/u/solic">@Solic</a>).</p>

            <p>Don’t mind me, makes him way too confirmable, it will instantly show the entire court there is a Gardener in the game. The rest looks cool, but I don’t know what this would specifically add to the game. Maybe a seeded person, would flip with his converted/unconverted counterpart during an lynch? That would give BD some incentive to get rid of him and adds at least an interesting new mechanic that impacts a larger part of the game: false flips during the day.</p>

            <p>Not all neuts can side with NK, look at the Inquisitor<br>
I just tried to give him an unique win-condition, and I think it fits perfectly, probably could use more work, but this is something I came up in 10 mins <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p><strong>[The Gardener]</strong><br>
<em>“Someone has to take care of the plants in Castle Adiart.”</em></p>
<p>Special</p>
<p><strong>Pasives:</strong><br>
<em>Just watering the flowers:</em> Immune to death at night. Immune to occupation and redirection.<br>
<em>Dont mind me:</em> Can not vote people up. Can vote Execute/Pardon. (Counts as a dead player for the amount of votes required to get someone up)</p>
<p><strong>Day abilities:</strong></p>
<p><em>Blue Seeds:</em> Give a Blue seed to a player, cant target King.</p>
<p><em>Purple/Red Seeds:</em> Give a Purple/Red seed to a player, cant target King. (Purple in Unseen games, Red in Cult, yeah, he knows what game is from the start)</p>
<p><strong>Night abilities:</strong></p>
<p><em>Grow!:</em> Chose a player with a seed, it will grow tonight if its a Puple/Red seed, or the following night if its a Blue one.</p>
<p><em>Deadly vines:</em> Select 2 players with grown seeds, and grow vines between them.<br>
[Max 2 spaces between them <strong>2</strong>-(3,4)-<strong>5</strong>].<br>
If the players caught between them try to leave their rooms, they will be prevented and bleed, dying within 1 night. (1 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Win condition:</strong> Grow seeds with the colour of the winning side. If BD, Cult and Unseen lose, you lose too.</p>
<p>Blue seeds: Can only grow in Blue Dragon players.<br>
Purple/Red seeds: Can only grow in Cult/Unseen.<br>
Trying to grow a seed on the wrong player will occupy them.</p>
<p>Do I think this class coul be fun? I dont know, I just think that we need a Gardener class.<br>
He plays his own mini-game, he is just a gardener. But watch out with the plants!</p>
<p>Edit: Changed Extra Thorny Rose to Deadly vines. Deadly vines would use an updated hunter wolf warning, also you cant target dead players with seeds.</p>
