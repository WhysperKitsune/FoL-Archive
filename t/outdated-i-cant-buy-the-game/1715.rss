            <p>If you were charged, you’d have an email with the key. Sounds like your connection hiccuped (laptop? cell phone? wifi?) - it should take about 1/2 second max.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you saw the not charged page, there was a reason for not being charged after – what did that reason say? “You were not charged - <strong>because…</strong>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your email for a Stripe receipt. Your key will be there~</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message me in Discord with your email, if no email receipt.</p>

            <p>I was charged. Should I wait for the key and contact Xblade if it doesn’t come in 12 hrs?</p>

            <p>So, were you charged? If so, Xblade will probably see they got the payment and give you your keys. If not, just rebuy it, if it is your browser, try using another device. If it is your Stripe account, try PayPal.</p>
