    <description>The Librarian (Neutral - Investigative)

Day Ability 1 - Book Rental (3 uses): Lend a book to the targeted player.

Night Ability 1 - Find Books (unlimited uses): Tomorrow morning you will search the court for the books. One of three things can happen:
1. You find the book with the Player who borrowed it. You will not be able to take it back since they are reading it.
2. If the player you lent the book to is killed, you will find the book on the ground in a terrible state.
3. If the player you lent the book to kills someone, he will accidentally drop the book in the scene. The book will be soaked in blood and beyond restoration.

Night Ability 2 - Restore Literature (1 use): You can restore one book you found in a terrible state to its original form. If anyone was carrying one of your other books, they will return it in the morning, regardless of what happened to them that night. You get another use of your day ability. You need a book in a terrible state to use this ability and you can only use it once during the whole game.</description>

            <p>His goal is to survive. The books are mere literature to entertain the members of the court, it serves no purpose in the game. The only thing that’s important from the books for the gameplay it who rented them and where were them found in the morning.</p>
