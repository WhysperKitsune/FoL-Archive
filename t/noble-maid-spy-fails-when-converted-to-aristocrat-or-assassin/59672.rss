    <title>Noble Maid Spy fails when converted to Aristocrat or Assassin</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/noble-maid-spy-fails-when-converted-to-aristocrat-or-assassin/59672</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Used Maid Spy the same night that I was converted to aristocrat. I could not read whispers the next day, despite having no prevention or fail message. Same happened when I was promoted to assassin when using maid spy the same night.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Maid Spy&#39;s effect should carry over to the next class?

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Use maid spy the same night your class changes due to conversion or promotion.

#### Comments:
This may or may not be a bug depending on what the devs think should happen during conversion, but the interaction isn&#39;t mentioned anywhere in the game and is inconsistent with the conversion interactions with other classes&#39; abilities.</description>
