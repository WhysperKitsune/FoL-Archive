    <description>## :heart:[color=hotpink]Welcome to Minority Rule 5: Love is In the Air Edition![/color]:heart: 
Hosted by Marluxion. 

*Welcome to Minority Rule :heavy_heart_exclamation:  The rules are pretty simple. I will present you a choice of several rooms—just choose one to enter :heavy_heart_exclamation:  If you pick the room with the most people, you will all meet a horrible demise*:heavy_heart_exclamation: 

# [color=crims] How to play? [/color]
Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. if you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated. If there is a tie, then both rooms are considered a majority and players who picked both are eliminated. The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. Do /Join to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me.



## [color=hotpink]Rooms[/color]
**[color=skyblue]Air [/color]** - A random picker becomes light.
**[color=#801080]Betrayal [/color]**- If this room is tied for the minority, it gains infinite picks and becomes the majority.
**[color=black]Death [/color]**- Everyone who picks this dies, even if it is not the majority.
**[color=#DFDFDF]Dice [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status.
**[color=#BFBF00]Divide [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as half.
**[color=lightbrown]Earth [/color]**- A random picker becomes heavy.
**[color=#800000]Evil [/color]**- All pickers become cursed.
**[color=#FF00FF]False [/color]**- This room does nothing, but it takes the name of another random room.
**[color=#8000FF]Force [/color]**- A random person who did pick this will change to a random room in the current pool.
**[color=#BF0080]Gravity [/color]**- A random person who did not pick this will change to this room.
**[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]**- A random picker becomes a saint. All other pickers become cursed.
**[color=#800080]Illusion [/color]**- This room takes the effect of another secret item before the start of the round.
**[color=#808080]Insanity [/color]**- A random picker becomes insane.
**[color=#00BFFF]Life [/color]**- If nobody picks this, everybody dies.
**[color=green]Luck [/color]**- If this room is the majority, then one random picker will survive. If this is not the majority, then one random picker will die.
**[color=#000080]Majority[/color]** - If this room is the majority, the items with the second most votes will be the majority.
**[color=#FFBF40]Multiply [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as two.
**[color=sienna]Mundane [/color]**- This room literally does nothing.
**[color=dark]Murder [/color]**- One random picker becomes a Serial Killer

**[color=#505050]Permanency [/color]**- If picked by anyone, this room will also be in the pool for the next round. Once this room is the majority, it is removed from the pool for all future rounds.
**[color=#509090]Protection [/color]**- All pickers are immune to death this round for any reason other than the majority. A random picker becomes a bodyguard.

**[color=Steelblue]Secrecy[/color]** - All pickers become cultists.
**[color=blue]Unity [/color]** - If all players pick this, nobody will die due to the majority.

## [color=red]Statuses[/color]
[color=#408000]Bodyguard [/color]- Nobody who picks the same room as you can die for any reason other than the majority. If anyone who would die without your intervention is saved, you will die instead.
[color=Steelblue]Cultist[/color] - If there are any cultists, then there will be an item that only its members may pick. It will be denoted in [brackets].
[color=#804080]Cursed[/color]- You will die next round unless your status is removed or your death is prevented. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=#FF0000]Healthy[/color] - You cannot die for any reason except for the majority. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#808080]Insane[/color] - You must pick the majority or you will die.
[color=skyblue]Light[/color] - You do not count as a picker for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.

    Existing Statuses
    Majority calculated (Death from majority happens here.) 
    New Statuses

# [color=hotpink]Special Rules[/color]:heavy_heart_exclamation: 
1. [color=red]**Blind Date:**[/color] Just like minority rule 4, this will be played in teams of two! However, unlike MR4, you **cannot pick your partner.** You will be assigned one at random when the game starts! **Your teammate will NOT be made public. Everyone&#39;s team is a secret!**  Only you will know your partner. You are free to speculate who each other&#39;s partners are, and lying is encouraged. (This is valentines themed after all :wink:)  
1. [color=hotpink]**Roses are red, Violets are blue, If It&#39;s a tie, I&#39;ll defeat you**[/color]: Just like last time, we&#39;ll be keeping roses :rose: (Formerly :tangerine:s)  to break ties! The way you earn them will be a little different.  **Whenever both players in a team go into the same room, their team receives a single rose.** :rose: Roses :rose:  are used to break ties if the last two remaining players are a part of different teams. The last remaining player with the most roses :rose: wins the tie. However, unlike last time, roses :rose: are assigned to the team, not the individual.

            <p>To be honest, it was the choice between you losing and… you losing. If you decided to pick Gravity, you would die, but those in Mystery wouldn’t. If you decided to pick Mystery, you would die as well.</p>
<p>Somebody would need to sacrifice themselves.</p>

<p>Picking murder in the previous round was super bold and ended up paying off. It scared everyone away from gravity! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Well played!</p>
