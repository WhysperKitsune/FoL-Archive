    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Drawer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-drawer/6790</link>
    <description>This role is meant to add a neutral killer role which is also supposed to try to deceive the other players by making them vote up players and then pardoning them,
That mechanism would also hinder the so called system of VFR (see below) to become a thing in ToL while also not being focused on solely countering exactly that.
[Skip if you already know about Voting for roles]

**What is VFR?**

VFR is an abbreviation for &quot;voting for roles&quot; and basically means randomly putting players on the stand in order to force them to reveal their role or get lynched if they do not do so.
**Why is this bad?**

The pure number of BD compared to evil/neutrals favors the evils because it is more likely to find a BD member than an evil/neutral member by voting up random people.
Subsequently VFR destroys any strategical play in a game like ToL hence  making it less fun to play and  also playing a good role ,which needs to not be known (e.g the noble), much harder.

**Why do people do this then?**
Idk maybe they are lazy and sometimes it does work I admit that.

**But VFR isnt easy in ToL cause of the way the rolelist works!**

Yes which is why i designed this class to eliminate any chance of vfring while also tempting people to do VFR ( I know that sounds confusing! Just check the role below and you will understand! )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Role Conception**
The Drawer
Alignment: Neutral
Sub-Role: Killer/Offensive

Passives:

-Dark Inspiration: When a player gets put up on the stand and pardoned by other players you will draw a picture of the fear of getting executed thus gaining one charge of Dark Inspiration. Furthermore you will see the faction of the corresponding player being pardoned.

_Notes: This will make the Drawer want to randomly vote people because it will profit him but him being a neutral killer role should stop town from randomly voting._

**Day Abilities:**
-[Maybe] Troll Box (already known)

_Notes: This will further enable the Drawer to make people suspicious just to get them pardoned in the end. Also enables non BD roles to be able to pretend being the fool or the scorned better._

-Turpentine Overdose (requires one/two charge(s) of Dark Inspiration):
Works like Nightshade poisoning. ( Maybe use same notice as Nightshade poisoning for further interesting interaction between neutral and unseen? )

_Notes: The advantages of this ability are basically the same as for the unseen. However giving the same notice to a member of the neutral faction will make it harder for town to detect whether or not a Drawer is in play. Also the cost of Dark Inspiration charges will make the Drawer to not be too strong._

**Night Abilities:**
- Evil needs (unlimited uses):
You thirst to draw more pictures of peole dying right in front of you. You will kill one person tonight and draw a picture of the last seconds of their life.
- Treachery (1/2 charge(s) of Dark Inspiration):
You will pierce night immunity tonight with your Evil needs ability.

_Notes: Same as for every killing role while Treachery can enable the Drawer to kill value targets found from random votings._

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Goals of the addition of  role**
- Have a neutral role which directly impacts both BD and Cult/Unseen.
- Have a killing role that cna make use of the trollbox.
-Make non Drawer roles care more about who they suspect of treason.
- Make VFR almost impossible for BD/Unseen/Cult!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Lore**

You are the grim artist.
After being expelled from the court by an evil king you gradually became evil yourself and developed a temptation to draw people while they suffer pain and agony.
 In order to satisfy your low need to draw people panicking on the stand just to get pardoned or their last seconds of life you will do everything possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you think of this role?
It was just a shower thought but having experienced lots of VFRs in other games i think that Drawer would fit quite well here and also would not just be a anti-meta role but rather very fun to play especially because of the Trollbox.
PS: Sry I am not a native speaker but i tried my best!
EDIT1: Fixing bold texts.Sry for that if anyone saw that!</description>

            <p>I don’t feel VFR is a problem that needs solving, or a neutral role that punishes it would be healthy for the game.  It was a problem in ToS due to ToS being poorly designed and forced to have a specific role list that makes mafia just lose due to lack of claim space with nothing they can do about it.  That isn’t the case here, there’s no role list and converts can always claim their starting role and never be counterclaimed.</p>
<p>VFR has a place, it’s a legit strategy. It’s one of the few ways BD can win if investigatives are taken out early or not doing well at finding targets.  The alternatives to VFR are either random lynching, or BD sitting around every night waiting to die, either of which is going to make the game more fun.</p>
<p>VFR runs the risk of outing importing BDs, so it’s not even a strategy you always want to employ. It is countered by keeping good fake logs and being convincing, which are skills players should have to develop.</p>

            <p>It is not meant to be the meta counter to VFR, its meant to be a fun role overall which also is supposed to hinder the uprise of VFR in this game.<br>
Edit: might have to change title.</p>
