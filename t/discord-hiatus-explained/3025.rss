    <title>Discord-Hiatus Explained</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/discord-hiatus-explained/3025</link>
    <description>As many of you may know and not care, I haven&#39;t been in the Discord lately. This is because I cause too much trouble, it&#39;s for the best of I and you that I don&#39;t go there for a while. It brings drama to you and I and it&#39;s best I stay away from that. It&#39;s bad for the soul. I will still play on the game and I will try to be active on the forums so I can still proudly show my support for this awesome game. But not in the Discord. It&#39;s make always me uncomfortable and it will bring mine self esteem to a low that  I don&#39;t want. I want happiness in life, and I don&#39;t want to make others unhappy. and that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this, I hope you can forgive me and here&#39;s reasons why I will list below.

1. I may forget to take my medicine, and you say something I take the wrong way and it escalates
2. It&#39;s late and I need to sleep, cranky.
3. I don&#39;t like you, and/or you don&#39;t like me / Personality Clash.
4. Lack of substance in my tummy. Hunger makes people more susceptible to anger.
5. Discord is making me mad because it launches whenever I turn on my PC which takes it longer to login.
6. I get addicted to the Discord which is bad while I&#39;m in School and Work. Type, type, type.
7. Occasionally my humor goes to the deepest depths of darkness, which is offending to some.
8. Shipping.. I like to ship people, who doesn&#39;t? But well, some people don&#39;t like to be shipped with some people- and I need to respect that. I do. I try, but it&#39;s hard.
9. Kinda like 6. but a little different. I&#39;m having schooling now.
10. Life is short, we can&#39;t spent all of it typing on our cell-phones, I should go see the world, and bury my feet under the sand and melt the sand to glass and have glass slippers.
11. No more reasons, I already gave you 10. That&#39;s not enough? If so, I am sorry and I will try to think of more if you&#39;d like, but fear not, I shall see you in-game &lt;3

I am sorry for this friends.
