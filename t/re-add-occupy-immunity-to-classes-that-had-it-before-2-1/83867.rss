            <p>You can contest a Sheriff calling you Unseen, you can contest a Knight calling you Death Immune, you can contest a Butler calling you Occupy Immune …</p>
<p>But you can’t contest a Butler calling you NON-occupy immune.  Because he can occupy you 2 more nights, and that can be a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>Removing “You occupied / redirected X” feedback would solve this.</p>
<p>Or making everyone occupy immune for 1 night after each occupy.</p>
<p>Or, make anyone targeting a Butler / Drunk immune to occupies from that specific Butler / Drunk.</p>

            <p>I think there’s a case for giving Poacher occ immunity</p>
<p>that case being ‘action resolution go brrrrrr’</p>
<p>although ideally that would be accompanied by not telling offensives if their target is immune</p>
