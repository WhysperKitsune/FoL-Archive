# Gameplay

- There is a Day 1 Lynch.

- Days are 72 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Lynches are majority and plurality. In case of a tie, the lynch will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.

- The **[Color=BF5FFF] Coven [/Color]** has an optional factional kill each night.

- The **[Color=BF5FFF] Coven [/Color]** will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

- Kills are announced. This means when somebody dies, the role(s) that killed them will be announced. Coven factional kills will be &quot;Massacred by the **[Color=BF5FFF]Coven[/Color]**&quot;, regardless of which member performed it. 

- Feedback will be kept to a minimum this time.

            <p>The PoE from Alice/Twi was insane</p>
<p>Twi had a 4 person PoE in their logs, and it was you and the last 3 coven which was insane</p>
<p>but alas we never dealt with nk. It was discussed every day, but d1 we weren’t worried, d2 Wazza claimed nk, d3 we discuss some more, and d4 Cheese claims nk</p>
<p>and so the deaths just kinda kept rolling in. Mightve worked better if we didn’t have 2 death d1, so we had more people for you to have to stalk</p>
<p>good work though</p>

            <p>100% no reason to claim it other than to CC a claim, which you didn’t. You have a day reveal so if you’re ever pushed…boom reveal.</p>
