<p>people: asks me for a readlist<br>
also people: hammers Alice</p>
<details>
<summary>
Readlist from before hammer yesterday</summary>
<p>Portion of readlist that hasn’t changed due to obvious reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Wazza - town vig. I don’t believe this to be quite questionable, since it would be easily confirmable.</li>
<li>Italy - town Transporter. Similarly confirmable.</li>
<li>Marshal - town Vet. Pretty much confirmed I think.</li>
<li>CRichard564 - town Mayor. Again confirmed.</li>
<li>clonedcheese - town VT. duh</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously null portions</p>
<ul>
<li>N.1 Zone – Townlean. N.1 trying to gather “meta evidence” was pretty consistent with their towny attitudes that I know of – but some people say that they do this as scum too, so I won’t push this too much. Zone however has claimed VT – as much as I don’t like people claiming, I’m tempted to believe this as a truthful attempt by a legit VT to get out of getting lynched. They tried to catch up to thread as fast as possible, asking people for reads, claims, and other shenanigans, which further supports this slot being town.</li>
<li>Twil1ight – townlean until claim, then townread. This slot felt like they were looking at all possibilities, reasoning things one by one – towny. Their suspicions on Alice then the CC nailed this slot town.</li>
<li>katze - townlean. This slot has been trying to solve, and doesn’t feel informed. They sporadically switched between “team cheese” and “team alice” – if this slot was scum, I’d say that they would sit still on one wagon rather than being confused.</li>
<li>EVO – townread. This slot’s POV during their “fight” with alice made sense, and seemed like they were genuinely flustered that alice was continuing their narrative. Their TI claim, therefore, makes sense now.</li>
<li>SogMan - null. Main reason is that this slot hasn’t posted. Especially given the massclaim shenanigans, I don’t think I can judge this slot based on what they have posted so far. (Suspicion - since in past games Seth has tunneled town, maybe SogMan is town?)</li>
<li>Fossil – townlean, but possible 3p. Them calling out for civility and calmness was nice. They called for a “compromise” between Alice and Marshal yelling, which was noteworthy – I think this comes from town, watching from afar.</li>
<li>Universal – townlean. Like most of my other townleans, this slot has been doing ISO’s and trying to reason things out, considering all possibilities.</li>
<li>Magnus - null/slight scumlean. They say they are being “careful with their votes,” but seems very “hedgy” (if that’s the right word) right now. I think this slot can be potentially scum, trying to side with me on a TvT EoD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously non-null portions</p>
<ul>
<li>an_gorta_pratai – null. As much as I don’t like this slot claiming VT right off the bat, their interaction with N.1/Zone’s slot has been quite villagery, inviting them to read and analyze and whatnot. Have this slot as null because this slot has not posted since that time, and want to see more. Can-be-both-alignments type of null here.</li>
<li>Alice - townread. I genuinely think this slot is what they claim to be - town tracker. This slot has been quite angry lately, and I think that this comes from town. Their claiming of vet was unoptimal given the players I think, and they should have known better, but what’s done is done. I again think this slot has been honest with what they were doing or was trying to do (claiming vet =&gt; reasoning behind FPS =&gt; claiming tracker). Won’t say they have 0 chance of being scum, but pretty towny.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Updated Alice – null/scumlean. This slot calling for people to play mountainous seemed really bad, especially when they were getting pushed. Add onto that EVO and Twilight coming in</p>
<ul>
<li>oB_Light – townlean. Some slots were scumleaning this slot - I’m not sure why. This slot has been sharing reads multiple times, and was willing to consider various possibilities. Look at their wallposts - they have some good insight, and they are willing to change their opinion as events warrant.</li>
<li>TheBlueElixir - Townlean. My main reason is that the people I townlean/townread has this slot listed as obvtown. This slot to me has been doing a lot of good analysis from a towny POV, and seems to be quite helpful in considering possibilities.</li>
<li>PokemonKidRyan - null. This slot again is a “this slot can be anything” type of null. I believe this slot to have some neutral equity - the would not have given “NB” as an example if it didn’t have any truth to it. Normally they would have put “VT” next to their name. However, their response to such accusations have been quite towny, so I am not entirely sure about this slot.</li>
<li>ModeShifter – Seth, and therefore (and only therefore) townie. I really don’t like their early VT claim, their unbased pushes on me, and pushing mayor to reveal. However, I think the last two genuinely comes from seth – as such, I believe that revealing VT was honest (but stupid nonetheless).</li>
