    <title>Physician Immunity BUG</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physician-immunity-bug/52123</link>
    <description>**What happened?**

Drunk (11) debauched me but I(Physician - 7) was immune and was not affected

 **What was SUPPOSED to happen?**

Physician are not target-immune therefore, i was supposed to heal 11 instead

 **Steps to reproduce:**

1) start as physician
2) heal random first night
3) heal someone whos bleeding (11 i believe)
4) rez 16(psychic)
5) heal somone else whos bleeding (10)
6) heal 3(prince)
7) following message is : 
You will heal Edgeyworth [3] tonight.
Someone tried changing your target, but you are immune.
Edgeyworth [3] did not require healing
 
**Comments:** 
There were no CWs in my game i believe, and neither was I debauched or occed before.

            <p>I’m not sure about this, but I think the “Someone tried changing your target, but you are immune.” message is bugged at the moment. It seems to appear at random regardless of what actually happens at night.</p>
<p>I’ve received the message before as a king when I was guarding myself, which should be impossible because no target changers can target the king and I was not visiting someone else.</p>
