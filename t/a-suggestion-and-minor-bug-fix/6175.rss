    <title>A suggestion and minor bug fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-suggestion-and-minor-bug-fix/6175</link>
    <description>First, could you allow players to select a default name? I use the same for each game and it&#39;s easy to miss the window for entering it in.

Second, the game crashes for me every time I &#39;x&#39; out of the window. It&#39;s only a minor annoyance but it makes the game run up hours on Steam when I thought I was exited from it.</description>

<p>You’re not supposed to close the game like that. There is a Quit Game button for a reason.</p>
