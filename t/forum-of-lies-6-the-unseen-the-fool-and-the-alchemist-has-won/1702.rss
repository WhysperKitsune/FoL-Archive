Gameplay
• Days last 96 hours, or until majority is reached for execution. Nights last 48 hours.
• All actions, including whispers (Only Butler, Invoker(if they choose so), and Servant can whisper via loud whisper), must be sent to the mod.
• Unseen/Cult will talk through a special Discord server.
• Priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server.
• All classes will be used, and will be used as they are found in the Class Cards Thread.

Executions
• To accuse someone say &quot;/accuse [player]&quot; or &quot;/vote [player]&quot;
• Votes saying Guilty or Not Guilty before the target is on the stand will not be counted.
• Should the votes reach the majority, that player will go on trial. They can say a defense, and the rest of the players must vote Guilty or Not Guilty on the thread.
• Players can discuss while the target is on trial.
• No one is able to use day powers when a trial is in session. The Only exception is the king’s Decide Fate and the fortune teller&#39;s blasphemy!. 
• After the voting, the King has 24 hours to choose to allow or veto the vote. Should the king not respond, the majority vote will be accepted.
• The day timer does not stop when the target is on trial.
• If the day timer runs out before a total majority is hit, the option with the most votes is what happens to the target.

Picking a New King
• When the king dies 24 hours is given for any player with royal blood to step up and take the throne.
• After that 24 hours anyone is free to step up.
• If only 1 person steps up when the day ends that person becomes the king
• If 2 people step forward everyone votes on who should be the next king. Whoever has the most • votes during the end of the day becomes the king. If the votes are tied whoever stepped up 1st becomes the king

            <p>Oh shoot I totally forgot my own paper plate awards</p>
<p>MVP definitely goes to <a class="mention" href="/u/Hippolytus">@Hippolytus</a>, generally good Fool play (other than softing Fool, wtf lol)</p>
<p>Dirty Bastard Award goes to <a class="mention" href="/u/sketch">@Sketch</a> . I became very suspicious of his claim even before Mole essentially proved him evil, but that was a low play to get himself towncred. If anybody does this again, they should certainly be punished - but honestly I find myself respecting his balls.</p>
<p>Worst Assassin goes to <a class="mention" href="/u/frostwolf103">@Frostwolf103</a> . Stop poisoning me, meanie. ;(</p>

</aside>
<p>Let’s not get hyperbolic here. You have the Prince and Knight to kill Fools.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy the gameplay of Jester as you have to skirt the line between not appearing <em>too</em> important while also maintaining a decent scuminess level. The Jester/Fool has a lot of fun with it. I agree the current penalty is too harsh for BD. It should at least be lowered to one day, but it should punish scum somehow as well. I liked ToS’s Jester.</p>
