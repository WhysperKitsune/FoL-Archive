    <title>[Rework Suggestion] The King! A more vulnerable, more social class</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rework-suggestion-the-king-a-more-vulnerable-more-social-class/70302</link>
    <description>The aim of this rework suggestion is to make the king a useful figure to rally behind, but one that is vulnerable and relies on BD protection to make it through he game.

*Defeat the Blue Dragon, the Cult and the Unseen.*

***Notes:***

1) Starting King will be 10% Selfish, 30% Evil/Blood, 60% Good.
2) Blackmailers will always be Starting Mastermind/Cult Leader, Prince, and then 2 Random Blue Dragon other than Prince. Blackmailers do not know they&#39;re Blackmailers. The Selfish King will see an X to the side of a dead player if they were a Blackmailer.
3) The King not having Point Finger and instead having double votes as a passive should help Possessor win more often.
4) The Blood King&#39;s Cult Patronage does not grant occupation immunity to the Cult Leader, instead it prevents abilities that would occupy them, which means it works against Butler&#39;s Wine and Concentrated Wine, Sellsword&#39;s Intimidate and Drunk&#39;s Happy Hour. Cult Patronage does nothing against redirection of any kind.

Feedback is welcome! :smiley:</description>

<p>So what do people want the King to do, then? If they can’t gather information, not mechanically nor via whispers, if they can’t kill at night, and can’t be powerful enough to compete with Prince mechanically, what significant value do they bring to the table to compensate their odds of being not-good?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IMO support abilities fit far better for the King in order to help him with the town leader idea. Claim and work with a Good King and he’ll support you. If it turns out you’re working with an Evil King, no loss.</p>
<p>See how Kings in FoL work and you’ll understand why this model is typically agreed to be the best.</p>

<p>You will always be at a disadvantage because you’re competing with someone whose claim is actually true.

</aside>
<p>Eventually, assuming that by the time they see through your lies that they still have numbers. BD essentially lives on borrowed time and if they end up outnumbered, it’s game over for them.</p>

<p>It’s objectively superior for BD, yes, but it’s a race against time for evils, to kill as much Town as possible before you get caught. This was the reason I stopped playing ToS, because it was either open claim D2/D3 or start VFRing so that all the info was on the table, especially with the introduction of Psychic. Being evil meant racing against time and trying to create as much misdirection as possible while trying not to get caught lying when people died and shrunk your claimspace. It was thoroughly unpleasant to play.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>ToS was bad as the limited claimspace essentially made the game into “lynch a RT claim, execute the other.” ToL doesn’t have this issue as the claimspace is essentially infinite provided that you aren’t claiming a role that already has two of it in-game.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[ShadowKnight]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Something people are not quite taking into consideration is the fact that there are some broad groups of abilities and people have vocally rejected the vast majority of them.</p>
<p><strong>Investigative abilities:</strong> People hated the old Allies and don’t want King to be able to garner information mechanically.<br>
<strong>Social abilities:</strong> People want extremely limited social abilities that don’t encourage “whisper meta” and instead simply empower the King when it comes to voting. This by itself is not terribly useful, as without actual sources of information, the King will just be following along with the majority or relying on their own scumreading.<br>
<strong>Killing abilities:</strong> Highly controversial.<br>
<strong>Offensive abilities:</strong> It could be argued there are too many of these already, but it’s a possibility.<br>
<strong>Support abilities:</strong> These are the only abilities I haven’t seen people hate on, and tbh, reducing the King to an outed Support with some extra Social abilities doesn’t quite seem like enough value for BD.</p>
<p>So what do people want the King to do, then? If they can’t gather information, not mechanically nor via whispers, if they can’t kill at night, and can’t be powerful enough to compete with Prince mechanically, what significant value do they bring to the table to compensate their odds of being not-good?</p>

<p>Would it hurt you to lynch my Good King more than losing the player and their actions? Yes. Royal Blood would permanently lose its effect, and you would forever be stuck with a weaker replacement King, who at best takes away the abilities of another class just like mislynching them would and at worst puts scum in power.</p>
<p>The two situations are hardly comparable.</p>

            <p>This isn’t up-to-date at all, but it should get the point across if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>For example, pretty much all of the faction-specific abilities need changing. It does seem good enough to make my point though.</p>

<p>I think that the solution to this is to give the starting BD King a few special mechanics. If you give the starting BD King an ability the BD will be unwilling to lose, and you punish the BD for incorrectly executing a BD King, the regicide rate is unlikely to spike as much. My personal suggestions are below, but pretty much anything works as long as it achieves this end goal.</p>

<p>BD Boon: Starting Good King’s guards protect against conversion as well as kills.</p>
<p>BD Punishment: If a Good King dies to public execution or Butler, the royal bloodline is useless and royals may not step up early.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Long story short, rather than buff all Kings, give the starting BD King a little something extra that the BD don’t like needlessly losing and punish them if they lynch a starting BD King. Now you can have a King weaker than Prince and still keep a lower regicide rate.</p>

<p>False dilemma. A King should be useful for their faction but shouldn’t be able to single-handedly win games on their night and day actions alone such as single-handedly executing players.</p>

<p>The fact that you keep saying this over and over tells me you rely overmuch on your own theoretical assessments over what actually happens in the game. With occupation, guarding, healing, redirection, immunities, immunity-bypassing, conversion, anti-conversion and empowering, there is no such thing as a reliable KPN in this game.

<p>What’s wrong with Order Execution? It encourages people to claim to the king. Maid spy and 35% chance of evil king already discourage whispering to the king. It needs a buff if anything, it isn’t hard for healers/court wizards/sages to predict who the king will target.</p>

</aside>
<p>Giving the centerpiece of the game the ability to instantly kill up to two players is both incredibly strong in the endgame, as well as just feeling wrong. This also plays into my previous point on the King’s strength inherently breeding swing.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because the King shouldn’t be a killing role. Also the fact that EKs can also execute prominent BDs makes it difficult to trust the King at the start, which means it’s difficult to play as GK as you need people’s trust to find leads in order for people to trust you, creating a catch-22.</p>

<p>Yes? Because that knowledge being public means the King is inherently untrustworthy? So long as the King’s allegiance remains impossible to detect and can only be discerned through actions, they can be mechanically more powerful than Prince, but Prince will have a huge leg up on the King that the King can never match.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re missing the point. The untrustworthiness of the King may prevent you from feeling comfortable whispering all of your info to them, but that’s not at all what I was getting at.</p>
<p>The more powerful the King is, the swingier the game becomes and the more likely it is that the winning side is determined not by what happens in-game, but by which alignment gets the King. That’s a huge issue, and it can <em>only</em> be lessened by weakening the King.</p>
<p>Now, a super weak King would be pointless, but making him significantly stronger than Prince just ramps this issue way higher than it ever needs to be.</p>

<p>BD will tend to rally behind the strongest, most auto-confirmable class they currently have available. This is an inevitability. The class may change, but there’s no real way of having a free-for-all anyone-can-be-the-leader meta.</p>

<p>Most classes can play the part of a town leader as long as they play well. Rallying behind a useless King over a CW who has been finding evils via scumreading and in general has been active because they’re the King is just poor play in general.</p>
