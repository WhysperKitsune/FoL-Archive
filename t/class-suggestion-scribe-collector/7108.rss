            <p>That confiscate contraband seems way too powerful. You could rob priest rez as an example. It could be a one touch win button in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>I really like the concept. I’d keep it 1 time use though.</p>

            <p>Most classes such as CW and Fool can spawn twice in a single game. The ability Checks to see if the target had someone else at the start of the game. Meaning that if your target is a physician then you would know if there were 2 physicians or not. Thought unless he dies he could be a MM or something.</p>
