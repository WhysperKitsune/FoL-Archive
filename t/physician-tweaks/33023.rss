    <title>Physician Tweaks</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physician-tweaks/33023</link>
    <description>Hey guys, three quick suggestions here:

1. Make it so that if two physicians target the same DK, one of them gets prevented from that action and doesn&#39;t lose his resuscitate ability.
2. When there are two physicians, let them both know at the beginning of the night that there is a Death Knight currently &quot;alive&quot;. This would also help not wasting your use of resuscitation.
3. Third but not really important, DK&#39;s could know who resuscitated them. I&#39;ve seen DK&#39;s yoloing their creators more often than not.</description>

            <p>It is not random, though. It’s based on the player’s choices.<br>
What’s random is having one of the Physicians (determined by some arbitrary criteria or by RNG) not lose their ability.</p>
<p>It’s also not <em>wasting</em> the ability. The Physician accepted to trade his ability for the existence of a Death Knight, and got exactly that.</p>
<p>I don’t see anyone suggesting that if the Cult Leader and the NK choose to kill the same player, Eradicate should fail. That’s way more swingy than a game having two Physicians but only one Death Knight, which is what happens in pratically every game regardless (because there’s still a limit of one Death Knight at a time).</p>

            <p>1 seems like common sense.  Having physicians (effectively) <span class="bbcode-i">randomly</span> waste their ability if they target the same person is bad for the game, strategically.  If people think there should only be one DK revived per game ever, they should suggest that, but it shouldn’t randomly happen when two physicians coincidentally target the same person, and otherwise allow them to use their abilities in sequence.</p>
<p>Basically, wasting a revive is too “swingy” - it has dramatic impact on the game based mostly on luck.  The game should try and minimize that sort of swing unless there’s useful strategy attached to it (and I don’t see it here.)</p>
<p>The other two suggestions seem unnecessary, though.  Wasting your revive forever because you both chose the same person seems unacceptably bad design to me because of the massive swings it can cause based on little more than luck, but wasting one night is fine and not nearly such a big deal.</p>
<p>And DKs can already know who revived them…  if the Phys indicates it the next morning in public chat.  That’s a trade-off, of course, but it’s a strategically interesting one, so I don’t feel they should get that knowledge for free.</p>

<p>Why though? You are reanimating the target you chose to reanimate. You are doing exactly what you set out to do.<br>
The idea behind resurrections was always to have one of them per game anyway.</p>
<p>Also consider that with this change you are introducing a big RNG factor which will affect the game. Whose reanimation works? The game will change completely if the Physician who used up their ability is the one who survives or the one who dies in the next few nights.</p>

<li>I think it is a legit concern. but It could be use as a method to confirm other physicians in match.</li>
<li>Same problem as one. can be used for confirmation of other physician.</li>
<li>You brought he corpse to your room to re-animate him. Logically you’d know who is  your doctor Frankenstein. Still, physicians don’t need buffs imo.</li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr, The mentioned tweaks are more buffs than tweaks.</p>

            <p>physician is already better than knight (can make a knight, can confirm to psychic, can stop bleeding/poison, doesn’t die when saving someone)</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it’s a “No” for all three suggestions.</p>
<p>You’re making even easier for Physicians to confirm themselves and making Reanimate even more poweful than it already is.</p>
