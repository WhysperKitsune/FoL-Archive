    <description>Passive: King&#39;s Heir
Immune to occupation and target changing, you will be immune for the first two nights of the game, this includes attacks that bypass night immunity.

This replaces Unstoppable!

The reason for this is I feel Blue Dragon is severely hindered once the Prince is dead, mainly early, late it&#39;s not such a huge problem.
I felt perhaps giving the Prince the ability to survive for two days wouldn&#39;t be too overpowered. 
Just a thought. Criticism very much appreciated.</description>

</aside>
<p>Why!? Bypass attacks are never YOLO (besides RE but that doesn’t matter here) due to how limited they are. There is no reason why a N2 Frenzy, OE or Empower reap cannot kill Prince.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with those comments up here.</p>
<p>Maybe you could replace your replacement by something like:</p>
<p>“If the first king is alive, prince will automatically guarded by him” making of course, unable for the king to do something else at night.<br>
But still, it’s really strong and BD doesn’t need that for the moment.</p>
<p>What they need is smart people which is rare.</p>

            <p>No.<br>
BD should get penalized if they let Prince die.</p>
<p>And BD is the majority of all the player, so they didn’t need death immunity.</p>

</aside>
<p>BD should <strong>never</strong> have a night immunity by their own. They’re rellying on other BD members like Physician or Knights. If you don’t want die N1 as Prince just claim it Day 1 and ask for protection.</p>
<p>Also Prince don’t need any further buff’s since BD have the highest winrate compare to Evils.</p>

<p>I mean, a simple immunity could be ok and even that would be a big nerf for NK…</p>

            <p>I do not support this. Neutrals and scum tend to have night immunity, because they have no big team supporting them. They also usually have to survive until the end to win. That is why MM, the core piece of the unseen, whom without they’d usually lose, has night immunity. All NK’s, scorned, fool, alchemist, inquisitor have at least limited night immunity too. It is necessary for their win condition. Having a surviving prince is not a win condition for BD. Outing as Prince is the way to go if you want to have the guaranteed survival. BD has protective roles for that very reason. The prince also has the ultimate counterplay to any kills to him, simply jail the assassin/NK/CL. He does not need to be THIS unstoppable.</p>
