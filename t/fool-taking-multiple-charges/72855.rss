    <title>Fool taking multiple charges</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fool-taking-multiple-charges/72855</link>
    <description>This just happened to me, and I believe it has happened before which is why I was extra careful about noticing it: 

I was GK, I did nothing D1 and D2. D3 we executed a fool, and I lost TWO charges from each ability. 

This is a game-breaking bug.</description>
