            <p>It almost sounds to me like this is a class that only exists to be converted.<br>
At least give the man some unlimited abilities as BD.<br>
Hunter gets limited abilities as BD because he needs to time the use more. Investigatiors need to CONSTANTLY find new info. Especially since people get converted and classes change.</p>

            <p>This is true. The idea is that you could get 2 people executed before anyone caught on that you were converted. The first player being planted. By that time the Mastermind can just convert you. Obviously you would need to play things right otherwise you would get caught and killed.</p>
<p>There is risk VS reward in play making it balanced. It also means that if your actually an assassin you can. Claim to have been planted to cause extra confusion after you are executed. Plus if any assassin could claim to have been planted then how does the revived player know that they were?</p>
<p>Point being that there is plenty of depth involved. It has strong uses as well as counterplay.</p>

<p>So if you claim Agent and the priest resurrect someone that is not the executed player says the executed player got planted.</p>
<p>Surely the snoop doesn’t want get caught like that?</p>

            <p>The ability is significantly more powerful for the agent than for the snoop. The agent can confirm almost any role by asking them to visit someone and then checking what role does so. If the role he claims visits the person he said he would then he is clear.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure if it was him doing the visiting then you use check alibi. It also means that if you see the Mastermind or assassin visit someone then you can clear someone as not being one of those roles</p>
<p>The Snoop however isn’t trying to confirm people but rather trying to help the unseen. This means that his ability is more useful for the same reason as an observer.</p>

<p>Why does the Snoop get unlimited and the Agent gets limited? Surely it should be the other way round?</p>
