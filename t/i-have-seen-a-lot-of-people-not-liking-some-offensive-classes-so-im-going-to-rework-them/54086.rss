    <description>Credit to NuclearBurrito, Erik, Firekitten, Solic, and Shrimpy for suggesting some ideas that are in here

&gt; =
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 1: Dutiful: Immune to occupation and target change
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 1: Forgetful Wine: Remove all of a target&#39;s passives for the rest of the game, this will not inform them, 1 use
&gt;

[/details]
 

[details=&quot;Servant&quot;]

&gt;  =
&gt; Passive 1: Dutiful: Immune to occupation and target change
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 2: Forgetful Wine: remove all of a player&#39;s passives for the rest of the game, this will not inform them, 1 use
&gt;
