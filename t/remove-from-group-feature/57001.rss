    <title>Remove From Group Feature</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/remove-from-group-feature/57001</link>
    <description>As a streamer, it would be nice to have a &quot;remove from group&quot; function built into private lobbies. Unfortunately people banned from twitch chat can still read it and see the invite code, allowing them to join freely. (disclaimer : obviously they can still snipe public queues, we have no control over that)</description>
