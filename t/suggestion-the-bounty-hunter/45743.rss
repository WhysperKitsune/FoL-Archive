    <description>**The Bounty Hunter**
**Faction:** Neutral(Cannot be converted)
**Type:** Offensive 

**Passive Abillity 1:** Restless
Immune to occupation and redirection.Immune to death once.
**Passive Abillity 2:** Mistrustful
In end of the day, get a message if one of the talkers during day phase is your target.
Note:
You won&#39;t know who exacly is your target.
**Day Ability 1:** Behind The Scenes
Visit chosen player at night and offer him your services.Your target cannot be a King.(Infinite-Uses unless a chosen target is still alive)
Note:
It will fail if you gonna be jailed or your target is in jail.
In short, a targered player can choose from &#39;&#39;Class&#39;&#39; list next target for Bounty Hunter, a target cannot be a King unless a target stepped up to become the next King.
If its a his first target, a player cannot choose a role with pernament death immunity(NK&#39;s,Mastermind,Scorned), also a player can choose an evil role depends on game(In Cult game there wont be an Unseen Class list and vice versa).
If the current class/classes would die **not** not the Bounty Hunter, he may use this ability again next day.
A person can talk with him tonight. and he will appear as &#39;&#39;Bounty Hunter&#39;&#39; in night chat.
**Night Abillity 1:** Keen Eye
See who visits your target.(Infinity-Uses)
**Night Ability 2** Collect Bounty
Visit a player, if he&#39;s your target kill him.(4-uses). If a choosen class is NOT in current game,next night kill your client.It would waste a stack.
Note:
Does not avoiding protection provided by Knight and heals.
After succesfullly killing a target at night, a Bounty Hunter can choose once which abillity he want upgrade.It will available in Class Card.
Abillities after upgrade:
Restless:Gain pernament death immunity.
Mistrust:All possibilities reduced by half.(Example: From 8 talkers to 4 possible numbers)
Behind The Scenes:can&#39;t be upgraded!
Keen Eye:You can see who target visited.
Collect Bounty:Your attack bypass night immunity(After upgarding, your client can choose a class with pernament death immunity)

Objective:Succesfully fullfill your 2 bounties in order to win a game.(Kill **personally** your target at night)

Personal Thoughts: Im not sure how much would impact the core game if he would appear but i think this kind of idea would make a game more dynamic and interesting at same time.As neutral he can help BD or Evil Faction even the Neutral Killer which makes him useful and dangerous(At least more interesting then the Inquisitor) 
Like in other post any comments and good criticism is very appreciated. :smiley:</description>
