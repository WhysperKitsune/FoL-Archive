    <title>Reporting others / Ban+Warning FAQ Does NOT Go Here! Read Here 1st!</title>

    <description>Posting a support ticket asking about a recent ban/warning will likely be ignored. Try here:

http://throneofli.es/banfaq

If you are wanting to report _others_, you may only do that in-game. We get 100&#39;s of reports per day and when you report someone, it includes all the evidence in a nice format and includes history, usernames, ID&#39;s, etc. Even if you have a screenshot, it takes 100x longer to process -- this is why, for the sake of hours a day already spent on reports, please ONLY report players in-game.

This also prevents drama where everyone can see reports -- if you report at the end of the screen, it&#39;s also private.

Please do not post any form of reports here ~ If you missed it, then don&#39;t worry -- chances are one of the other players got it ;)</description>
