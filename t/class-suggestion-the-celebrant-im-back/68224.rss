            <p>There’s no need for an evil class, including a NK, to be silent. The reason behind making abilities not confirm-able is to prevent people relying on mechanical confirmation over social deduction, such as how previously people expected Princess claims to use the old wisp to prove themselves or how they always asked Butlers to poison the King.</p>
<p>Since no serious player is going to claim NK, then their abilities can be as noticeable as they wish.</p>

<p>A bit revealing, but an ok ability. Luckily, you can just claim they werr occupied or you’re a Butler that partied if they visit you with the new feedback changes.</p>

            <p>This class does not fill the role required from a NK as in it has a KPN of zero and no form of survivability whatsoever, and the sheer amount of RNG makes it downright terrible.</p>
<p>I’ll go on an in-depth review of its kit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive-Joy spreads around: Immune to occupation and target changing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A decent passive, but the NK needs a form of immunity against death otherwise they’ll die too easily to the evil faction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive-A fire is ablaze!: immune to the first day ability affected to you that game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a Noble attempts to force vote your class, he’s outed, and now he’s executed. Just change this to immunity to Poison/Bleed effects along with possibly immunity to Distract and Trollbox and it’ll be fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ability 1(Day)-The Lights are blinding!-A random person is blinded for 10 seconds, disabling their chat, However, you won’t know who you blinded as well as the victim- 2 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remove the RNG. If you have to use the word random in your class card then it’s a terribly made class and needs to be either scrapped or reworked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ability 2(Day)-Rocket Ride! : Ride your firework out of your room tonight, blocking others from visiting you tonight-2 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decent ability for a NK, so nothing too bad from here. Also allows you to claim Butler easily with a fake party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ability 1(Night)-Pyrotechnics: Place a firework in front of someone’s door, occupying that person tonight-3 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This needs to have a killing effect somehow. See the current NKs, all of their night abilities, Reap, Puppet Strings, Possess, Magic Missile, and Circle of Death, have some sort of mechanism that can kill players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ability 2(Night)-Grand finale: Risk your life into killing three other random people without death immunity. Cannot target king, Cult leader or Mastermind. Not useable until day 6.- 1 use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, randomness. Plus the fact that this ability can only be used in n6 makes it extremely hit-or-miss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal:Live to see someone die to your grand finale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, basically live to d7 and hope that the RNG doesn’t target players being guarded or healed.</p>
<p>Essentially, this class needs a lot of work as it’s missing a shit-ton of components that a neutral killer requires, and get rid of the RNG as nobody likes that.</p>
