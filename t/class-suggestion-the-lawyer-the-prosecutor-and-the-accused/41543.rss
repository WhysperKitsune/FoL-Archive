    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Lawyer, The Prosecutor and The Accused</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-lawyer-the-prosecutor-and-the-accused/41543</link>
    <description>Hello, here is an idea for three neutral classes that always spawn together: The Lawyer (Neutral Social), The Prosecutor (Neutral Social) and The Accused (Neutral Offensive). 

The Accused is the main of these classes, it spawns with a random alignment (similar to King, but it is either BD or Evil, cant have neutral alignment) and can either help or hinder the BD.

The Lawyer and The Prosecutor must convince the court that the Accused is either on their side (The Lawyer) or against them (The Prosecutor). Each of them has their own tricks that can help them win over the court.

To avoid the court from either ignoring or auto executing the Accused, he can either reward or punish the BD depending on their choice, which forces them to pay attention and be careful.

Notes:
* Since all three classes always spawn together, there will not be any other neutrals besides the neutral killer in &quot;Accused&quot; games.
* For the same reason as above, Sorcerer will never spawn on &quot;Accused&quot; games, since there won&#39;t be space for the Inquisitor.
* After the Accused has died, neither the Lawyer nor the Prosecutor will be able to use their abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Accused** (Neutral/Offensive)
&gt; **Passive 1: Human Resources**
&gt; Immune to poison, bleeding, death and occupation.
&gt; **Passive 2: Missing record**
&gt; You are allied to a random faction (BD or Unseen/Cult). If you are allied to the BD and executed on trial or by the Prince, all the members of the cult/unseen will gain one extra use of their limited use abilities.
&gt; **Night ability 1: Suspicious activities**
&gt; Occupy a player. Unlimited uses.
&gt; **Night ability 2: Sketchy reunion**
&gt; Target a player, occupy all members of your rival faction attempting to visit your target. 3 uses.
&gt; **Goal:** Survive to see your faction win. 


&gt; **The Lawyer** (Neutral/Social)
&gt; **Passive 1: Restless**
&gt; Immune to death and occupation. If the accused is executed you will die the next night.
&gt; **Passive 2: Confidentiality agreement**
&gt; You know who the Accused is. You can talk to the Accused at night.
&gt; **Day ability 1: Trollbox**
&gt; Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. Unlimited uses.
&gt; **Day ability 2: Bribe**
&gt; Make someone unable to talk or whisper for the rest of the day as long as they are not on trial. The ability cannot target the King or the prosecutor. 1 use. 
&gt; _(This is like an assassin&#39;s distract that lasts the whole day but loses its effects if the target is put on trial)._
&gt; **Night ability 1: Burn the evidence**
&gt; Hide the Accused&#39;s visits from investigators. 3 uses.
&gt; **Goal:** Make sure the accused achieves their goal.

&gt; **The Prosecutor (Neutral/Social)**
&gt; **Passive 1: Restless**
&gt; Immune to death and occupation.
&gt; **Passive 2: Eavesdrop**
&gt; You know who the Accused is. You can read all whispers to and from the Accused.
&gt; **Day ability 1: The trial begins** 
&gt; Put the Accused immediately on trial. Cannot be used before day 4. 1 use.
&gt; **Night ability 1: Gather proof**
&gt; Follow the Accused to see who they visit. Unlimited uses.
&gt; **Night ability 2: Forge evidence**
&gt; Make a player believe they were occupied. 3 uses.
&gt;_(Target player will receive a message saying they were occupied and won&#39;t get any feedback messages from their abilities, but their ability will still go through. If the player is occupy immune they will get a message saying someone tried to occupy them instead)._
&gt; **Goal:** Make sure the accused is executed on trial or by the Prince.</description>

<p>The reward is just there to prevent people from ignoring or instantly hanging the accused without knowing who he is siding with.</p>
<p>I can always take it back, but I believe there should be at least some kind of punishment for mislynching them.</p>

<p>It is, which is why it is limited to 3 uses. And it would also make people consider executing the prosecutor if they believe he is messing with the investigators. So it occupying investigators wouldn’t be a bad thing in my opinion.</p>

            <p>It would always be a +1 numbers advantage on either side. Sorcerer wouldnt spawn on accused games so worst case scenario would be Unseen+EK+Accused/Lawyer. While this would definitely be a numbers advantage for the unseen, the same can be said if he is aligned to the BD.<br>
Also, I believe this would be balanced because of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prosecutor will be helping the faction opposing the accused.</li>
<li>If you get rid of the accused, the lawyer will die as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is not too different from a game spawning with a fool or scorned, since they usually hinder BD and indirectly help Cult/Unseen.</p>

            <p>I’m a bit on the fence about duo-spawning neut classes (inq+sorc) already, trios are definitely too much imo. With these the evil faction could potentially start with two other allies.</p>

            <p>I was thinking it would give you a message saying you were occupied but your action would still go through. If you are occupy immune you would get a message saying someone tried to occupy you. The player you use forge evidence on wouldn’t get any feedback messages from their abilities (otherwise it would be obvious it was a fake occupy), which means it would work like a real occupy on investigative abilities, but I think that is fine since it is a limited use ability.</p>

            <p>I would really like to see how these classes would play out in an actual game. Seems pretty fun. How would the forge evidence Ability work for the prosecutor?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, here is an idea for three neutral classes that always spawn together: The Lawyer (Neutral Social), The Prosecutor (Neutral Social) and The Accused (Neutral Offensive).</p>
<p>The Accused is the main of these classes, it spawns with a random alignment (similar to King, but it is either BD or Evil, cant have neutral alignment) and can either help or hinder the BD.</p>
<p>The Lawyer and The Prosecutor must convince the court that the Accused is either on their side (The Lawyer) or against them (The Prosecutor). Each of them has their own tricks that can help them win over the court.</p>
<p>To avoid the court from either ignoring or auto executing the Accused, he can either reward or punish the BD depending on their choice, which forces them to pay attention and be careful.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since all three classes always spawn together, there will not be any other neutrals besides the neutral killer in “Accused” games.</li>
<li>For the same reason as above, Sorcerer will never spawn on “Accused” games, since there won’t be space for the Inquisitor.</li>
<li>After the Accused has died, neither the Lawyer nor the Prosecutor will be able to use their abilities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Accused</strong> (Neutral/Offensive)<br>
<strong>Passive 1: Human Resources</strong><br>
Immune to poison, bleeding, death and occupation.<br>
<strong>Passive 2: Missing record</strong><br>
You are allied to a random faction (BD or Unseen/Cult). If you are allied to the BD and executed on trial or by the Prince, all the members of the cult/unseen will gain one extra use of their limited use abilities.<br>
<strong>Night ability 1: Suspicious activities</strong><br>
Occupy a player. Unlimited uses.<br>
<strong>Night ability 2: Sketchy reunion</strong><br>
Target a player, occupy all members of your rival faction attempting to visit your target. 3 uses.<br>
<strong>Goal:</strong> Survive to see your faction win.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lawyer</strong> (Neutral/Social)<br>
<strong>Passive 1: Restless</strong><br>
Immune to death and occupation. If the accused is executed you will die the next night.<br>
<strong>Passive 2: Confidentiality agreement</strong><br>
You know who the Accused is. You can talk to the Accused at night.<br>
<strong>Day ability 1: Trollbox</strong><br>
Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. Unlimited uses.<br>
<strong>Day ability 2: Bribe</strong><br>
Make someone unable to talk or whisper for the rest of the day as long as they are not on trial. The ability cannot target the King or the prosecutor. 1 use.<br>
<em>(This is like an assassin’s distract that lasts the whole day but loses its effects if the target is put on trial).</em><br>
<strong>Night ability 1: Burn the evidence</strong><br>
Hide the Accused’s visits from investigators. 3 uses.<br>
<strong>Goal:</strong> Make sure the accused achieves their goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Prosecutor (Neutral/Social)</strong><br>
<strong>Passive 1: Restless</strong><br>
Immune to death and occupation.<br>
<strong>Passive 2: Eavesdrop</strong><br>
You know who the Accused is. You can read all whispers to and from the Accused.<br>
<strong>Day ability 1: The trial begins</strong><br>
Put the Accused immediately on trial. Cannot be used before day 4. 1 use.<br>
<strong>Night ability 1: Gather proof</strong><br>
Follow the Accused to see who they visit. Unlimited uses.<br>
<strong>Night ability 2: Forge evidence</strong><br>
Make a player believe they were occupied. 3 uses.<br>
<em>(Target player will receive a message saying they were occupied and won’t get any feedback messages from their abilities, but their ability will still go through. If the player is occupy immune they will get a message saying someone tried to occupy them instead).</em><br>
<strong>Goal:</strong> Make sure the accused is executed on trial or by the Prince.</p>
