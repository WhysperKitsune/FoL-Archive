    <title>Sheriff/Paladin Doesn&#39;t Work</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sheriff-paladin-doesnt-work/73996</link>
    <description>In the nicest way possible I currently believe sheriff/paladin may be the worst class in the game, he offers nothing except &quot;educated guesses&quot; , but most importantly offers no chance for unseen/cult to fight back, how many times have you seen a person found out by a sheriff/paladin pardoned, yes it is a possibility but certainty you don&#39;t see it in many games,  as a design  concept it doesn&#39;t work  check a player every night to see if they are unseen/cult on n1 that is a 1/16 chance of happening, and when it does it isn&#39;t fun, it isn&#39;t unskillful, it&#39;s luck, and for most of the game you do nothing but wait, ns doesn&#39;t help bd in the slightest are they mastermind/neutral/bd who knows? It doesn&#39;t give any info to bd except for that odd chance you find  an evil, and for  most of the game it is just a reassurance to bd they are evil as others probably had already thought they were scum. Now Paladin a little better in my eyes, smite can be a nice gimmick and can really help bd late game, scout is nearly useless now, since when you  find they were visited it was probably by somebody who was converted and just checked them, and now you up a random bd who can&#39;t give any arguments except that they were checked. A bit controversial and I probably didn&#39;t phrase it in the best way, which is normally my case, but I really wanted to get this out there</description>

            <p>Hold it!</p>
<p>Sheriff for a scout is great as if unseen visited him and he claims as a healer class, you may want to hang this if the healer does not have confirmed heals. <span class="hashtag">#NeutralKiller</span></p>
<p>As a sheriff, you may wish to place on scouts at the outed noble claims in case he could be the next target to convert. If your scout doesn’t give you any leads for 3 days straight, maybe you want to surveillance them could be Mastermind.</p>

            <p>“Hard Counter” has nothing to do with being overpowered.</p>
<p>People are calling them “Hard Counters” as their main job is involved with dealing with certain individuals.<br>
Like there is nothing more basic than ability that literally tells you: “This person is bad guy.” and “This person is not a bad guy.”</p>
<p>Same with Sheriff from Town Of Salem.</p>

            <p>Take the classic sheriff claim from MM I usually do, when it is past d4 and there is an outed sheriff and me and I haven’t converted him, I always push for the angle that I surveilled said sheriff as mastermind. I know what you’re thinking "<strong>Marcus isn’t the court gonna realise after they see he is sheriff that you are MM?</strong></p>
<p>Of course I do, but I’m making a play to ensure unseen have the best possible chance of winning the game, so I will happily push one more mislynch in exchange for my death, rather than get process of eliminationed and BD still have a sheriff.</p>

<p>Firekitten is right, NS lowers the PoE. Now if you want to up people during the day for more info, you don’t need to up that person because they are approx 3x less likely to be scum.</p>

</aside>
<p>If a sheriff claim has come up NS whilst a sheriff is dead and unseen are still alive and well, you won’t need a surv to tell you they’re MM.</p>
<p>Sheriffs and Paladin do work quite nicely, and the fact that they aren’t unique means you have to always be wary of potential bussing from a sheriff/paladin fakeclaim</p>
<p>In some instances it may be beneficial for you to bus one of your own so you can get a new convert, although this concept applies more to unseen games as when cult reach four players they can control the court and are usually very close to winning.</p>

            <p>As long as that is indeed correct Hard-Counters aren’t really fun to play at least compare to other investigatives.</p>
<p>But the problem is if Developers want to expand and increase the amount of players, they have to make it attractive for all type of players so it is one of the main reasons why Hard-Counters exists in the first place.</p>

            <p>See</p>
<p>Sheriff kinda needs to exist tbh. Unless we can change everyone’s mindset on how they play TOL, no one will ever lynch</p>

            <p>In the nicest way possible I currently believe sheriff/paladin may be the worst class in the game, he offers nothing except “educated guesses” , but most importantly offers no chance for unseen/cult to fight back, how many times have you seen a person found out by a sheriff/paladin pardoned, yes it is a possibility but certainty you don’t see it in many games,  as a design  concept it doesn’t work  check a player every night to see if they are unseen/cult on n1 that is a 1/16 chance of happening, and when it does it isn’t fun, it isn’t unskillful, it’s luck, and for most of the game you do nothing but wait, ns doesn’t help bd in the slightest are they mastermind/neutral/bd who knows? It doesn’t give any info to bd except for that odd chance you find  an evil, and for  most of the game it is just a reassurance to bd they are evil as others probably had already thought they were scum. Now Paladin a little better in my eyes, smite can be a nice gimmick and can really help bd late game, scout is nearly useless now, since when you  find they were visited it was probably by somebody who was converted and just checked them, and now you up a random bd who can’t give any arguments except that they were checked. A bit controversial and I probably didn’t phrase it in the best way, which is normally my case, but I really wanted to get this out there</p>
