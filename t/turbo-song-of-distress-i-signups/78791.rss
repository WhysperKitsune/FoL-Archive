    <description>**Welcome to [Turbo] - Song of Distress I**

Hosted by @KyoDaz

This setup follows simple forum rules.
The setup will start [date=2019-10-19 time=22:30:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;]
The setup will start on day one. There is no day one lynch.
This setup is not intended to be played competitively, however if you wish to do so by all means. It is not intended to be remotely balanced either.

**Gameplay**

Days will be 20 minutes long.
Nights will be 10 minutes long.
All actions must be done in your rolecard.
Whispers are enabled. Players may create one-on-one DMs as long as I am added to them. Group DMs are not allowed. You may not use whisper communications during the night.
The town alignment is the [color=#FFD505]Yellow Poppy[/color].
The mafia alignment is the [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color].
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] automatically win once majority is reached.
The [color=#FF7A21]Cultists[/color] automatically win once majority is reached.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] can only communicate during the night.
The [color=#FF7A21]Cultists[/color] can only communicate during the night.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] have a faction kill.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] are unaware of their partner&#39;s identity until night one.
You may only hold one of the same item unless it is a [color=brown]tunic[/color].

[details=&quot;Turbo Time&quot;]
[color=#FF0000]T[/color][color=#CC0033]u[/color][color=#990066]r[/color][color=#660099]b[/color][color=#3300CC]o[/color] [color=#0033CC]T[/color][color=#006699]i[/color][color=#009966]m[/color][color=#00CC33]e[/color] is enabled.

This means that if only one vote is needed to be received, the day automatically has a three minute timer to end it. This timer becomes irrelevant if someone unvotes and will be reset upon being voted or if the day already has less than three minutes to end.

This is primarily meant to speed up the game whilst also allowing the person a time to testify and people to change reads.
[/details]
**Executions**

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
Executions will be plurality. Players are not lynched until the end of the day unless all votes are received.
Ties in the votes are considered no-lynch.

Please ask if you are unsure of any lynch scenarios.
