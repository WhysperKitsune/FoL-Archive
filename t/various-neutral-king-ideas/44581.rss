    <title>Various Neutral King Ideas</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/various-neutral-king-ideas/44581</link>
    <description>I really love Kings with their own separate agendas. Here is a bunch of ones that could be put into the game:

Coward King: Current Neutral King, crowned from Alchemist.

Vengeful King: King with Scorned objectives. Crowned from Scorned, may not use Decide Fate on targets.

Foolish King: King with Fool objectives. Crowned from Fool.

(Name Needed): King with Inquisitor objectives. Crowned from Inquisitor.

Those would be nice basic neutral King classes, that would prevent Scorned/Fool from escaping their goal. It would be cool if you could start the game with one of these, since it would make King more interesting. I also have a few other ideas:

Paranoid King: Eliminate everybody with royal blood.

Merchant King: Stall the game until day 9. Based off [this idea](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/neutral-offensive-idea/44469/5).

(name needed): Kill all starting magic users. Does not include non magic users converted into cult.</description>
