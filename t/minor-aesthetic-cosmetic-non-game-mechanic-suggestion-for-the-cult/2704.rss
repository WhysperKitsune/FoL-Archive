    <title>Minor aesthetic/cosmetic (non-game mechanic) suggestion for the Cult</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/minor-aesthetic-cosmetic-non-game-mechanic-suggestion-for-the-cult/2704</link>
    <description>Hello friends,
A few patches ago, the Cult Leader was overhauled and now chooses a Cult member during the day to sacrifice at the end of the following night. As such, I thought it&#39;d be cool if the selected Cult member, assuming they aren&#39;t jailed or otherwise not present in the room that night, would be lying on the bloody table in the Cult hideout, as if they&#39;re about to sacrificed. Maybe they&#39;re squirming slightly, in fear or anticipation. Can even take it to the next level and have the Cult Leader, if he&#39;s there, standing over them with their weapon, or a blade, preparing for the ritual.
Just something I was thinking about as I was preparing to sacrifice some poor Seeker yesterday.

Now, I know there&#39;s plenty of other cosmetic/aesthetic changes that are in the pipeline (Custom rooms for each class, etc.) but I figured I&#39;d toss this out there for the future.

Thanks for reading.</description>
