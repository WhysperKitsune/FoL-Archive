    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inquisitor-sorcerer-suggestions/34078</link>
    <description>Sorcerer: 
* Change magic dust to do the following: _&quot;Select a player. Said player will appear as magic user to the inquisitor for the rest of the game.&quot; 2 uses._ This can still help sorcerer trick the inquisitor while not being as powerful as the current version of dust. 
* Make sorcerer appear as BD to faction checks like king and observer. Her main threat should be the inquisitor, not the court. Reaper can chill to prevent people trying to accuse him and possessor can just jump if they are found as neutral by the king.

Inquisitor: 
* (Optional) Give him permanent death immunity against everyone except the sorcerer. He loses this immunity as soon as the sorcerer dies. His main threat should be the sorcerer, not the cult/unseen randomly attacking him. Currently, he loses his immunity early to the unseen/cult and if he doesn&#39;t then when the sorcerer attacks him she will just attack him again the next day.</description>

            <p>I mean in theory.  In reality Evil busses them like any other NK to buy time and they don’t win with Evil, they have to win <em>and live</em>, which is significantly more difficult.</p>

<p>But the sorc is on the unseen side so its make sense that the court will be her enemy too…</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem isn’t that the court is his/her enemy, the problem is that the court is the only enemy that actually poses a threat to him… The court is more than equipped to hunt neutral killers… which as the sorc has nothing to make him more uniquely dangerous than other neutral killers, there’s no reason to have an extra neutral class specificially to hunt him… especially when that class is the only one that the sorc can more or less completely negate.</p>
<p>If they are going to justify having a class to hunt one specific NK… that should be because that NK is notably harder for the court to deal with than the other NKs, which currently sorc isn’t.</p>

            <p>Maybe, but they should definitely do something to make inquisitor the main threat to the sorcerer. Currently, her main threat is the court.</p>
