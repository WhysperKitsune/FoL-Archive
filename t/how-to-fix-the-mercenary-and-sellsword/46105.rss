    <title>How to fix the Mercenary and Sellsword</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-to-fix-the-mercenary-and-sellsword/46105</link>
    <description>There are a few ways to consider. Using an &quot;idea&quot; format. I will list them. Also adding a few buffs.
&gt; 
&gt; # [color=White]**Mercenary[/color] (Option 1: 1 Target)**
&gt; **Conversion Immune** (if not, look below)
&gt; Goal: **Choose a contract**, and Make sure that **your contract** survives the game by any means necessary. 
&gt; Passive: **Bound by Blood**: Immune to Death. Your target is immune to death on night one and night two. If your target were to somehow die of poison, that will not occur until day four.
&gt; Passive 2: **Curse of Shame**: Your target&#39;s death will lead to your immediate (not a nightly suicide. Immediate) death and loss. Failure to secure a contract in the first four days will trigger this passive. 
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Special Circumstances Re:The Possessor&quot;]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * If the Possessor uses &quot;possess&quot; to jump into your target, the possessor IS YOUR TARGET AND YOU MUST PROTECT HIM. [It&#39;s better than losing instantly due to a jump. Works well with &quot;lore&quot; of poss. 
&gt; * If your target is a Possessor, and he uses &quot;possess&quot; to steal someone else&#39;s body, your job is still to protect the possessor. He is alive and well, and he will still of course, offer your payment.
&gt; [/details]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Infinite: **Negotiate:** Offer a contract to a player. This player cannot be the King, The Fool (OP), The Scorned, The Psycho King, or another Mercenary.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: **Safeguard: 3 uses** Stand Guard at your target&#39;s home tonight, healing him and preventing others from visiting him. [This gives your target no notification]
&gt; Night Ability 2: **Rebound: 1 use Choose a player who voted against your target. Kill them.** 
//////////


&gt; # [color=gray]**Mercenary[/color] (Option 2:Fix for 2 target version)
&gt; **Conversion Immune** (if not, look below)
&gt; Goal:  Make sure that **your _CURRENT_ contract** survives the game by any means necessary. 
&gt; Passive: **Bound by Blood**: Immune to Death. Your target is immune to death on night one. If your target were to die of poison or bleeding, that will not occur until day three
&gt; Passive 2: **Curse of Shame**: If both of your targets die, you will instantly die. If you don&#39;t secure a second contract three days after the first one dies, you will instantly dies 
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Special Circumstances Re:The Possessor&quot;]
&gt; 
&gt; * If the Possessor uses &quot;possess&quot; to jump into your target, the possessor IS YOUR TARGET AND YOU MUST PROTECT HIM. [It&#39;s better than losing instantly due to a jump anyways. Works well with &quot;lore&quot; of poss. Also, if you&#39;re outed Merc, then Poss would instantly get exed. Mutual benefit]
&gt; 
&gt; * If your target is a Possessor, and he uses &quot;possess&quot; to steal someone else&#39;s body, your job is still to protect the possessor. He is alive and well, and he will still of course, offer your payment.
&gt; [/details]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Infinite: **Negotiate:** Offer a contract to a player. This player cannot be the King, The Fool (OP), The Scorned, The Psycho King, or another Mercenary.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: **Safeguard: 3 uses** [Can only be used starting from night 2]Stand Guard at your target&#39;s home tonight, healing him and preventing others from visiting him.  This ability refreshes its uses on the second contract.  [This gives no notification]
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: **Rebound: 1 use Choose a player who voted against your target. Kill them.** 


//////////////

&gt; # [color=purple]**Sellsword**[/color]
&gt; Goal: Unseen win condition
&gt;Passive: **Stonewall :Unseen members will have collective Death Immunity. This lasts for two attacks** (On the third attack, an Unseen member will die)
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 1: **Volunteer: Infinite Use (insert picture of the contract)** Offer a contract to the Assassin. This contract, if he accepts it, transforms the Assassin to become his previous converted class [Original Assassins can choose these classes: Servant, Alcoholic, Nightwatch, Herbalist, and Enforcer.], and you become the Assassin. 
&gt; 
&gt;Day Ability 2: **Magic beans: One use: On activation, this ability grants the Assassin an extra use of 2 for 1. If the Assassin uses 2 for 1, you will use Cover Up on both of his targets due to an inability to sleep**. [One use of Cover Up and One use of Revenge will be used up] {If 2 for 1 is not used, no ability charges are used.]
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: **Cover Up : 3 uses: Select a target. Nobody except the Assassin may visit that target. [Can target Allies]**
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: **Revenge: 1 use: Choose a player who voted against an Unseen member. Kill them.** 

///////////

Mercenary will no longer give notifications. 

Note: If a possessor jumps into your target and jumps away, the person he jumped into is still your target. Works both ways at once. And in the case of Mercfix#2, he is still your first target. Not the last.</description>

            <p>It is quite a bit hard for two neutrals to directly work against each other in such a weird way.</p>
<p>Edited Sellsword for more creative ways to use up that extra kill. What do you think?</p>

            <p>It’s a rare enough situation. Mercenaries will generally avoid this anyways, since it makes them harder enough. I don’t think it really needs to be solved, due to how rarely, if at all, it will come up.</p>

            <p>Being guarded by a Mercenary isn’t gonna prevent suspicion. Sure they Mercenary won’t help with your execution, but they can’t really vouch for how good you are.</p>

            <p>I think for the second contract it’s on the Mercenary to find someone who doesn’t want to get themselves killed. You just have to read the other players.</p>
<p>If they do contract the Fool, it should just be their mistake.</p>

            <p>On the flip side if you take that question off, what happens is you try to contract a Fool</p>
<p>It doesn’t immediately give you the contract</p>
<p>Now you know he’s either a Fool,Scorned, or Merc.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>At least with the question you can just assume the “Fool” said no</p>

            <p>Oh. I never knew that. Kinda interesting.</p>
<p>Tbh that shouldn’t be a thing since</p>
<p>A: You can just screw over the Mercenary<br>
B: It confirms the class</p>
<p>Perhaps Lore wise it makes no sense, but I’d remove it, since first contract doesn’t get that.</p>

            <p>I mean the idea would be so that you could give your “contract” to a member of the unseen. King doesn’t always say “contract x” (though I guess in practice they should).</p>
<p>Really, though, Betrayal would be more useful than Revenge and people complain about Rebound being useless all the time.</p>

            <p>I kind of don’t want it to be another killing ability, especially since a use of Revenge tells the whole BD that your target is not who you say it is, and ALSO, a use of this “betrayal” would tell everyone that the Merc-claim is open for business. which means the King says “Contract this guy” and then you can’t. Unless there’s another day ability for the Sellsword (which could only really  be created if all Merc notifications are removed) that allows you to give someone a fake contract</p>

            <p>How about “betrayal”, which let’s you kill your previous contact?</p>
<p>Then you can “give” your contract to your fellow unseen.</p>
<p>Also going to have to say I disagree with the idea that there should be incentive to betray your contract while unconverted. Because then it turns into “contract the alchemist”</p>

            <p>I also like these options. I just find it problematic that mercs can choose to throw target 1 to the wolves. So, I needed to do some things to make that less often.</p>

            <p>I like option <span class="hashtag">#2</span> more because it gives more…options to the Merc. And prevents losing due to your target DC’ing.</p>

            <p>EDITED: By default, notifications will no longer exist. But, if they are, the “Intoxicate” ability will be a day ability to make sure that the Merc can’t be confirmed 100% (could be sellsword)</p>
<p>Also added Revenge back, but if there’s something that would suit better, say so.</p>

            <p>What you say makes sense. I will edit my post to confirm.</p>
<p>But what do you think would be a better second night ability for the Sellsword? I don’t like Revenge too much, but at the same time, it was there.</p>
<p>(I actually had something there. If it is deemed better to remove the notifications (I think I like that idea), the Sellsword’s ability to fake “Guard” her former target would be removed also.)</p>

            <p>Mercenary definitely shouldn’t be trustworthy. That’s why people suggest not having Stand Guard confirm the Mercenary, but really, that is the only needed change.</p>
<p>We don’t need to add a betrayal aspect into the game to make the game more interesting, since Mercenary can be fake claimed, or converted. I feel like that is plenty of drama on its own.</p>
<p>The Mercenary doesn’t need to be a hugely important piece in the meta. As long as it can faked and converted, that’s drama enough.</p>

            <p>I understand what you’re trying to say here, but I am of the belief that not every single class has to have an outside impact on the game, or a new spin on everything. Some classes you just make because they’re fun, and they have a unique challenge of being thrust into a goal (in this case, of preserving someone whose identity you don’t initially know, nor their play style  [both cases would indicate a need to adjust when you use your guarding ability, and what you do during the daytime.]</p>
<p>I also think that a Mercenary who can betray her target wouldn’t add anything <em>new</em>. We already have someone whom you are supposed to give your identity, but can already betray you. The Psychic.</p>

            <p>This 100%.</p>
<p>If you’re a good Mercenary, the refreshing of abilities isn’t so that people can just spam guarding. Still use abilities sparingly (when you think your target will be targeted), but you shouldn’t be punished for doing what you’re supposed to do (2nd target [which the King probably forces you to pick the Prince who outed himself because he knew your identity already so he’s going to die] and you have no uses so you’re in a bit of a jam.)</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>The thing is that others such as me disagree with this. Having a trustworthy ally in the merc is the whole point. If you remove that then you are dealing with an entirely different even if similar class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The role of “trustworthy allies” is, for most classes, already taken by your actual allies.  (I’m assuming by “trustworthy” you mean “trustworthy when confirmed”; of course, since lying about your role and / or determining who to trust is the entire point of the game.)  Turning the Mercenary into a trustworthy ally would be redundant with that.  And it doesn’t really make sense to take a neutral and then functionally assign it to a faction at random at the start of the game - all you’re accomplishing is making the setup more swingy.</p>
<p>I mean, stepping back a bit…  in your opinion, what’s the Mercenary’s purpose in the larger meta?  Not its goal or how you want to feel when playing one, but the purpose it serves in the meta as a whole.  The Fool and Scorned serve vital roles in giving a reason to doubt accusations.  The NK serves a vital role in adding an additional enemy that strategies can play off of.  Most BD and Cult / Unseen roles serve vital roles for those factions, while also serving as potential fakeclaims (BD) or having the power to fakeclaim specific BD roles (Cult / Unseen.)  The Inquisitor balances out the fact that the Sorcerer is Cult / Unseen-sided.  Even the Alchemist, while neutral, serves a vital role by giving another way to cure poison / bleed (the Physician alone would not be enough.)</p>
<p>Give me a summary like that for the Mercenary - a vital contribution he makes to the game as a whole, not just how you feel he should play with regard to himself and his target.  Because as things stand I’m completely unable to understand what you think the Mercenary should add to the game.  It feels like you’re only considering it from the perspective of “playing as the Mercenary” or “playing as the Mercenary’s first target”, and want to maximize the benefit you can get out of it in those roles, with absolutely no important interactions with anyone else; or that you’re thinking of it solely in terms of lore / roleplaying - you really, really want to roleplay as a devoted bodyguard and don’t really care about the larger impact it has on gameplay.</p>
<p>I don’t think that those are good ways to assess a role.  The important thing about a role - the main question you need to ask, before anything else - is what impact it has on the meta.  How <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span> (all 15 other people in the game) interacts with it, what doors it opens for them, what challenges it poses, what new strategies it introduces.  A Mercenary adds the most strategies, options, and challenges to other players if it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unconformable, or at least extremely difficult to confirm, and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Untrustworthy, at least to the extent of being able to betray its first contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With those things, his role in the game is clear.  He serves as a potential fakeclaim and source of lies (both from the mercenary and between the mercenary and his target), which makes it harder for BD to solve things by collecting everyone’s claim, and increases the chance that they’ll waste a lynch on a neutral at a vital moment.  The game depends on having reasons to lie (and ways straightforward strategies can go awry) to remain interesting, so that’s a decent purpose for him to serve.</p>
<p>When you remove these things you narrow it down to a role that really only matters to itself and its target, and which can be safely ignored by everyone else (outside of occasionally protecting its target safely, but - from the perspective of everyone except those two people, ie. <span class="bbcode-i">the really important perspective</span> - that’s a purpose already served more than adequately by the Physician, Alchemist, Knight, Court Wizard, and King; adding an additional protective that only cares about one person and doesn’t really interact with anything else doesn’t make any sense.)</p>
<p>Again, I’m trying to understand what people want out of the Mercenary, but most of what I’m hearing falls into “I only care about the interaction between Mercenaries and their targets” and “I want to roleplay.”  Those aren’t really the first things we should be considering when designing or balancing a role.</p>
<p>Because, I will be completely blunt here, I would <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> rather see the Mercenary removed entirely rather than have any of the suggestions made in this thread applied to it.  If it’s not going to serve a useful purpose in the meta and just serves as a mindless, randomly-assigned buff to his target, I think it would be better to give the role the axe and let games have another Fool, Scorned, or Alchemist instead - roles that actually serve important purposes in the meta.</p>
