    <title>Is this against the rules?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/is-this-against-the-rules/34430</link>
    <description>There was a possessor in my last game, he face lifted someone as Sorcerer N1 and claimed Inquisitor, however the Prince jailed him since he thought it was too convenient that he killed the Sorcerer d1, so it seems like the poss told the prince that he was &quot;stream sniping&quot; and that&#39;s how he found her. Prince told us to report him for stream sniping but he didn&#39;t execute him. At the end of the game, turns out he was a possessor and he won the game since none of us was suspicious of him. We were going to report him for stream sniping since that is clearly against the rules but it looks like he wasn&#39;t actually breaking the rules and he only said it to the prince to avoid suspicion.

I ended up not reporting him since I don&#39;t know if that is against the rules or not, there is nothing about it in them. What do you think? Did the possessor break the rules or not? It was a really clever play on him if you ask me but some people thought it shouldn&#39;t be allowed.</description>

            <p>Definitely needs clarification in the rules. Us at SC2 had to implement a rule to stop the fake cheating/hacking claims. Any false claim to cheating is treated as real.</p>

            <p>I believe this should be clarified in the rules, even though this definitely seems wrong I don’t remember reading anything in the rules about “metagaming”.</p>

            <p>Technically it’s not. If you are Poss claiming inquis that hit Sorc (with the body being yours created by face lift). You could say that you got lucky because of screen sharing with him.</p>
<p>Note: I don’t think this is a good thing. It should be changed.</p>

            <p>Yes, but even mentioning stream sniping is metagaming, I would think… especially if you’re bringing up an outside mechanic to benefit your own position in the game, regardless of whether the action even occurred. Edit: Thought I posted this ages ago, but apparently it just sat around as a draft.</p>

            <p>I could swear metagaming is against the rules, which claiming to be stream sniping would count as.  Of course, this only applies if I’m recalling that correctly.</p>
