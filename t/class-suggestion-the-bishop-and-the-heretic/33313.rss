    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Bishop and the Heretic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-bishop-and-the-heretic/33313</link>
    <description>I know that the Priest was removed a few months ago, but in hopes of having him back, I made this. BD doesn&#39;t have a support class that recharges limited abilities (after that CW change). I planned for the Priest to be conversion immune but there&#39;s currently some debate on that topic.

[quote]
**The Bishop**

Unique Blue Dragon Support

Goal: Same as all of BD

**_Passives_**

**Devout:** Your voice cannot be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, etc. will not work on you.)

**Faithful:** You cannot be converted starting from Day 6. If you are attempted to be converted after Day 6, you will gain a charge of all limited abilities.

**_Abilities_**

**Blessing:** (Night) (Unlimited)
Choose two targets. Any buffing night action done to you (Heals, Guards, Barriers, Sacrifices, Smites, etc.) is done to the targets as well. You will see any feedback that happens if using a buffing night action with successful results. 

Ex: Does not see: 14 did not require any healing.
Sees: 14 was cured of their Nightshade poisoning.


**Renewal:** (Night) (2)
Choose one person and restore two charges on all limited abilities. Will not go over original limit. Will not work unless that person is completely out of charges for at least one limited ability.

Shows Message: &quot;You were renewed!&quot;

Parameters:
- Renewal will not affect a Prince&#39;s Execute if a BD was executed
- Renewal will not work on Physicians&#39; Reanimate


**Consecration:** (Day) (3)
Choose one person; prevent any day abilities from targeting them that day, and if the person is affected by Icy Touch or Distract, cancel it. 

Exceptions are abilities that affect the night phase, like Imprison and Scout.

 **The Heretic**

Unique Unseen Support

Goal: Same as Unseen

**_Passives_**


**Devout:** Your voice cannot be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, etc. will not work on you.)


**_Abilities_**

**Heresy:** (Night) (2)
Choose one member of the Unseen, give them one charge to one limited ability.

**Deceive:** (Night) (2) 
Have all members of the Unseen appear as not suspicious tonight.

**Consecration:** (Day) (3)
Choose one person; prevent any day abilities from targeting them that day, and if the person is affected by Icy Touch or Distract, cancel it. 

[/quote]

I don&#39;t know what abilities would work very well for the Heretic, and I am not sure if they should be a Support or Social class, and if one is chosen, how abilities should be changed or not.

</aside>
<p>Noo! You didn’t get my point. I meant, let’s keep thinking about an unlimited use ability called Blessing and put the one I suggested as the second night ability with a few uses instead of the Renewal one. Get it?<br>
Night Ability 1: Blessing (Unlimited uses)<br>
Does something we don’t know yet.<br>
Night Ability 2: Spread Religion (3 uses)<br>
Blah blah blah share benefits.</p>

            <p>Man, your idea is great in my opinion, but for a second night ability, like a limited one, you know?<br>
3 uses. Any heals, guards, barriers, etc. used on you or your target are shared between you both. If he gets healed, you get healed, if you get guarded, he gets guarded. You could even name it something like “Spread the Love” or “Spread the Religion” <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">.</p>

What about this Blessing;<br>
I’m going to merge your ideas into this one kinda.</p>
<p>Blessing: (Night) (Unlimited)<br>
Choose a target. Any beneficial night action done to you (Heals, Guards, Barriers, Sacrifices, etc.) is done to the target as well. Occupying does not carry onto the target because you would be occupied.</p>

            <p>What about this?</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Blessing - Prevent anyone from visiting your target. Anything that happens to you also happens to your target. While using this Ability you are Occupy immune. (Unlimited)</p>
<p>Note: Occupying or redirecting a priest that is doing this will instead only Occupy or redirect the target in the same way.</p>

            <p>Okay so, here’s what we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Priest will be a Support class</li>
<li>He has to have something related to Blessing. We simply need that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing that… how do we proceed?<br>
As far as Blue Dragon is concerned, the already existing supports cover the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Healing.</li>
<li>Reanimating.</li>
<li>Swapping Position.</li>
<li>Protect against negative effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking my list into consideration, some options that match being Blessed would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grant Death Immunity? (Direct death, not poison/bleed)</li>
<li>Assure that the target will bypass immunities? (That means you can occupy people who can’t be occupied, you can kill who can’t be killed. You just can’t convert classes who can’t be converted, but that’s obvious.) (I know this looks like 4 from my list, but it’s different)</li>
<li>Assure that the target will successfully receive or give beneficial actions? (Heals, Guards, etc…)</li>
</ol>
