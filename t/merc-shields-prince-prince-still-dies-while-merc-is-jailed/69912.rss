    <title>Merc shields prince, prince still dies (while merc is jailed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/merc-shields-prince-prince-still-dies-while-merc-is-jailed/69912</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was merc and had shield on prince.
I was jailed.
Prince died the night he jailed me.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I thought merc shield stays on a target until I change target.
Therefore, prince should have survived the attack.

Or perhaps being jailed cancels it and it&#39;s working as intended.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Merc shields prince.
On the next night, prince jails the merc.
Someone attacks prince.
Prince dies.

#### Comments:
Full disclosure: I might be wrong concerning how merc shield works.
I thought shield protected the target regardless of my current nightly actions.</description>

            <p>I believe since you were jailed you couldn’t have been able to “activate” the shield since jail is sort of a super occupy. Did it say “Your shield is on (Prince) tonight” or whatever the message is at the start of the night?</p>
