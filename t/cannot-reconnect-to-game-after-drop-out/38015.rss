    <title>Cannot Reconnect to game after drop out</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cannot-reconnect-to-game-after-drop-out/38015</link>
    <description>Due to my poor Wifi connection I occasionally drop out for &gt;40 seconds. When this happens, I am often taken back to the main menu with no option of reconnecting. This is frustrating as I have no way of being sure a game I play I won&#39;t throw, and be reported for.

Unsure why I am not receiving the reconnect to game message, but most people I talk to are telling me that I should have that option.

Please help, can&#39;t really play this game again until I know I&#39;ll be able to stay the whole length.

Thanks!</description>

but after a long while. I give up and press cancel, but the button doesn’t work, so i have to end it with task manager</p>
