    <title>A MM/sheriff Idea that can improve the deduction of the game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/a-mm-sheriff-idea-that-can-improve-the-deduction-of-the-game/41940</link>
    <description>I have an idea about the MM/Sheriff

When the MM or Sheriff die, at night/day, the game will say for example: &quot;andrew magnis was a sheriff/Mastermind&quot;
This will help give the game a better version of deduction. it will also help other players claim sheriff and make the sheriff less OP.

Also, change Surveillance so it won&#39;t confirm the sheriff, in order to this idea work.</description>
