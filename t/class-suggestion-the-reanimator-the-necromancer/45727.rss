            <p>I’d say if the Death Knights had some lesser power, it could work. If they could communicate with the living, an investigative power could work.</p>
<p>I’d personally recommend occupation as a power, so it doesn’t kill people, but has an effect without needing to communicate. It would be ideal if it bypassed immunity, so it could work on anything. That way, it has an effect on the game without being too powerful.</p>

            <p>I’m trying to understand the best I can.</p>
<p>But if I interpret it one way it’s a boring class to play, and if I interpret it the other way it is OP.</p>
<p>Also it’s easier to explain where someone is wrong than to yell at them. It tends to also make them more receptive.</p>

            <p>That can be 3 cold steels, which is 3 extra kills. The only class that gives extra kills now is Sellsword, and it only gives one kill. Converting the Reanimator would give you 3 extra kills, in addition to reducing BD numbers, which converting the Mercenary doesn’t.</p>
<p>The only balanced number of uses is 1, and that doesn’t make for an interesting class.</p>

            <p>It would work, but having a one use ability and then doing nothing else isn’t exactly engaging. You would just do one thing, and then nothing else.</p>
<p>It would work if you were already dead, but when you’re alive, you generally need at least a few uses of your power.</p>

            <p>Yeah, and what I’m saying is that 4 extra kills for Unseen is a lot. They aren’t even delayed like Assassin poison. It is just not a balanced ability.</p>

            <p>Reanimator seems really powerful. DK has 3 ability uses, but the Reanimator can make 3 DKs, with 6 uses total. That doesn’t even count Improved reanimation or Once More, which can get you up to 10.</p>
<p>As with the Necromancer, if each reanimated Unseen can kill once, and if you get executed you use it on yourself, that’s a whole 4 extra kills for unseen.</p>

            <p>theres a line in animal farm which I think applies to alot of classes and class suggestions<br>
“All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others” It provides BD with a semi rez and with psychic as it is right now alive I would say its fine.</p>

            <p>I don’t support this class idea. Almost all classes give you direct feedback like investigatives/offensives or feel very powerful like knight/hunter. They all have a very direct impact, instead of this class that gets all their impact second-hand. Not to mention that they have zero strategic insight needed outside of this player has cleaner logs so better res this one over the other dead BD. Once More also rewards BD for lynching one of their own, which is bad gameplay design in my opinion. Not only that, but it also makes it a bad fakeclaim for scum, because the risk of exeing an actual reanimator isn’t even a bad thing. It also requires a rework of current Physician and possibly Psychic.</p>
