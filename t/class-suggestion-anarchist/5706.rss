    <title>[Class Suggestion] Anarchist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-anarchist/5706</link>
    <description>Anarchist - Neutral Offensive

Passive: Lawless - You cannot step up to be King.
Day ability 1: Bewilder - Disable the kings day ability&#39;s for the day. (2 uses)
Day ability 2: Coup - Your target takes one less vote to be put on the stand. If he is put up to the stand this way then he is immediately executed (this is announced)(2 uses)
Night ability 1: Trace lineage - Determine if your targets starting class had royal blood (unlimited)
Night ability 2: Back stab - Make the King bleed (1 use) (cannot be used until night 4)

Goal: Kill all royals including the starting King.

Alternatively the goal could be to have the game end with there not being a king. If so the passive should instead make you become the Mad King but with the same objective that you have now.</description>

            <p>I really like it -BUT- have Bewilder as 2 uses and Coup as 1 use. I think the class would be heavily OP if it had 3 and 2. It would also force the ‘Anarchist’ to use their abilities more wisely <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I only have one issue with this class.</p>
<p>Due to the random spawning of classes, some games, it may be easier or harder to win as Anarchist. You have King and Prince, and then a random sprinkling of both royal and non-royals.</p>
<p>How would you make this more fair?</p>
