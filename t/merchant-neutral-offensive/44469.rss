    <description>Merchant: Neutral Offensive

Passive: Haggler: Occupy and redirect immune.

Day Ability: Pay Bail: Force pardon someone. One use.

Night Ability: Sell Wares: Occupy someone. Unlimited uses.

Night Ability 2: Advertise. Make all your visitors target your target. Unlimited uses.

Goal: Stall the game for 9 days.

Just an odd idea I had. Not sure if it would hold up, but I feel like it is an interesting neutral goal, though it is against both the factions.</description>

            <p>I would like to give you a theme:</p>
<p>The Merchant</p>
<p>Passive: Clever ----&gt; Haggler</p>
<p>Day Ability: Pay Bail</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Stall -----&gt; Sell Wares</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Divert ----&gt; Advertise</p>
<p>If everyone dies, the Merchant can’t sell stuff, right?</p>
<p>So he needs to ensure he can survive until Day 9, and make the game prolong itself.</p>

            <p>How about a redirect? In a role I suggested on the ToS form with this wincon I gave him the ability to swap himself with his target (just like tornado) and heal his target.</p>

            <p>I think it could go either way. If he had to survive, I would want something also to do with occupation. I’d prefer to take a different route then Butler’s party, since that makes it maybe too hard to distinguish, but something along those lines.</p>
<p>I think 8 days is a good length. I’m going to put that as the goal.</p>

            <p>Does he need to survive those days?</p>
<p>Because survive for 8 days sounds doable but hard. Also he would need a method of self defense in that case (not particularly hard. Lots of options with an offensive type)</p>
