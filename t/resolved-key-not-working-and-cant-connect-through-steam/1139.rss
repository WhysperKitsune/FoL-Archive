    <title>[RESOLVED] Key not working and can&#39;t connect through Steam?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-key-not-working-and-cant-connect-through-steam/1139</link>
    <description>What happened: I do not see the game available through steam? Is this for backers only or veterans as well?


What was SUPPOSED to happen: Supposed to be able to download(?) the game from steam in order to play



I just got my code in the email today...when I went to enter my code it says that my code has already been redeemed or is invalid. Why is that?

Also, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong, but I can&#39;t seem to link my imperium to my steam account. They share an email address.</description>

            <p>Thank you for elaborating. If I had I probably would’ve been late to practice this morning (it was that close lol).</p>

            <p>Heya! To activate the game you’ll nee to go to your steam library and click “add a game” on the bottom left, then the “activate a product on steam” you should be able to enter the code after clicking through the stuff.</p>
<p>(damn it orange!)</p>

            <p>You have to directly redeem the Steam key. Looking up how to do so is probably your best bet (I’d elaborate but a quick Google search will do the trick).</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem (probably caused by my stupidity) - when I go to the steam page, it doesn’t show the game is available. Insted I see “summer 2017”, even though I already have my alpha key.<br>
So how do I connect my steam account with my imperium account?<br>
Thanks for a reply.</p>
