    <title>Silly Contrived ToL Matches</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/silly-contrived-tol-matches/47868</link>
    <description>ToL has a lot of interesting interactions between various classes and they can make for some silly scenarios. For example, it&#39;s technically possible for BD to win on Day 2 without any executions. Here are a few fun ones I&#39;ve come up with so far: 

[details=&quot;Code Name: Dogpile&quot;] 
## Requires 
2x Knight
Sorc
Inq
Alch/Merc
Alch/Merc
2x Phys
MM
Assassin
Sage
Hunter
King

## Timeline

_**Night 1**_
Assassin attacks Prince

_**Night 2**_
Assassin attacks Phys(1)
Phys(1) rezzes Prince

_**Day 3**_
Assassin Poisons CW

_**Night 3**_
MM Converts CW
Hunter Wolfs CW
Phys(2) rezzes Phys(1)

_**Day 4**_
Phys(2) vote up Merc’s targets (if any are present)

_**Night 4**_
Sorceror uses Circle of Death on Phys(2)
Knights uses Cold Steel on Phys(2)
Inq uses Ruthless Efficiency on Phys(2)
Alchs/Mercs use Poison/Rebound on Phys(2)
Assassin uses Assassinate on Phys(2)

DKs use Cold Steel on Sage
Hunter uses Wolf on Sage
King uses Execute on Sage

Sage swaps Phys(2) &amp; Self

On Night 4 the Sage will bleed out, die from poisoning, be attacked by a wolf and then murdered 10 extra times, just to be sure. In the morning you will see it announced that the King ordered his execution, and _boy did he_.

I think, in theory, you can get something similar using a possessor and running the Sage into a Hunter bear and having 2 mercs + 1 alch or vice-versa.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Code Name: Everyone Dies&quot;] 
## Requires 
Prince
King
Sorcerer
Inquisitor
Cult Leader
Ritualist
Alch
9x Non-occupy immune BD (Princess/Knight/Paladin/Observer/Noble)

## Timeline

_**Night 1**_
Nobody dies

_**Day 2**_
Cult Leader bleeds Inquisitor

_**Night 2**_
Nothing happens

_**Night 3**_
Sorcerer uses Circle of Death on Prince
Cult Leader uses Eradicate on Prince &amp; King
King uses Order Execution on Sorcerer
Ritualist swaps Ritualist &amp; Alch
BD visit Prince
Inquisitor stabs Alch
Alch bombs Ritualist


This means:

Prince and King die to Cult Leader
BD + Cult Leader die to CoD
Ritualist dies to Inq
Alch dies to self-bomb
Sorcerer dies to Order Execution
Inq bleeds out

And everyone is dead on N3. The best part is this could _actually_ happen in a game!
[/details]

As I think of more, I&#39;ll update this thread.

            <p>It’s possible for Unseen to have majority of votes D2 with no deaths.</p>
<p>Merc on MM<br>
Merc on assassin<br>
Evil King<br>
Sorcerer<br>
Aristocrat<br>
MM<br>
Assassin</p>
<p>That’s 9 votes which is the required number to vote someone up</p>
<p>After which 2 of the BD won’t be able to vote so you only need 1 person to not Pardon and you have majority immediately. (Unfortunately you cannot also have a Fool or Scorned to be that one person because Inquisitor is taking the final Neut slot)</p>
