    <description>&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve never bothered to ask but... what&#39;s your story? How did this whole movement come to fruition?&quot; the Assassin asked the Mastermind.
&quot;Not a bad question. Expect a long answer , though.&quot; the Mastermind replied.
&quot;I&#39;m ready for it.&quot; the Assassin sat down as her leader went to explain his tale.
&quot;There was a Royal Feast, alright? Me , my father , my mother and many other nobles had been invited to this special banquet. It was said to be marvellous , a selection of dishes that were of gastronomical excellence. I was excited. Very...&quot; he trailed off.
 &quot;Go on.&quot;
&quot;We all sat down after the Royal Family came , and prepared for our first meal. When one of the servant&#39;s came to serve me my food, that was the moment my eyes were opened. I asked my father why servants were serving us our food and not us ourselves. The monster of a man dared to reply... that we aren&#39;t all created equal. It angered me. I asked him why. He said that it was the way Photine wanted it to be. Photine! He used a goddess that probably wasn&#39;t concerned with that ordeal to justify our corrupt system. I could not live like that. Slowly as I grew and became older I learnt more about how the Blue Dragon tricked people into making people think what they wanted them to , how they used to hide failures under the blanket and erase them from the history books. It was wrong. It was all wrong. I told some serfs from our town about this whole ordeal, and as the Black Rose , we marched against the Dragon and told it the truth.&quot;
&quot;But your name isn&#39;t the Black Rose anymore.&quot; The Assassin folded her arms.
&quot;Yes, it isn&#39;t. It was changed , because of the way we told people our beliefs. Marching out on the streets was a failure. Many of us were hanged , drawn and quartered for just thinking the wrong way. I was one of the few that was spared because of my heritage. I shouldn&#39;t have been. But Royal Ties I had no longer , for I was exiled for supporting radical views.&quot;
 &quot;And then you found me. A former Knight. Exiled just for trying to protect her family , after the damned Drunkards tried to kill them.&quot;
&quot;Yes. And now we , as the Unseen, will silently infiltrate castle Adiart , killing all who oppose us , and make sure everyone knows about equal rights. They wont be able to suspect us , for we lurk in the shadows. The Sheriffs wont be able to upgrade their protocol that fast for a new threat.&quot;
&quot;And what about the King?&quot;
&quot;The King? He is only a temporary concern , if he wants to survive he will join our cause. If not...&quot;
&quot;He dies.&quot;

My first attempt on a lore.
