          <p><strong>Lore:</strong> The Saboteur is someone who takes pleasure in sabotaging people’s efforts.</p>
<p>Name - Saboteur<br>
Faction - Neutral<br>
Class - Offensive</p>
<p>Win Condition: Successfully sabotage five players’ actions.</p>
<p><strong>Passive:</strong><br>
Sneaky: occupation and redirect immune; cannot be bypassed</p>
<p>Spite: death immune once</p>
<p><strong>Night Abilities:</strong></p>
<p>Sabotage (Night, Unlimited)<br>
Target a player. If they are able to be Sabotaged and take any action, it is changed this night.  You can only successfully Sabotage each player once.
