    <title>[Class Suggestion] Saboteur (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-saboteur-neutral-offensive/59125</link>
    <description>**Lore:** The Saboteur is someone who takes pleasure in sabotaging people&#39;s efforts.

Name - Saboteur
Faction - Neutral
Class - Offensive

Win Condition: Successfully sabotage five players&#39; actions.

**Passive:**
Sneaky: occupation and redirect immune; cannot be bypassed

Spite: death immune once

**Night Abilities:**

Sabotage (Night, Unlimited)
Target a player. If they are able to be Sabotaged and take any action, it is changed this night.  You can only successfully Sabotage each player once.  Once your win condition is met, this ability is disabled.  Will not use up limited abilities&#39; uses. King, Neutral Killers, Mystics and Illusionists cannot be Sabotaged.
Feedback: &quot;You sabotaged Target&#39;s actions.&quot;
                  &quot;You could not sabotage Target’s actions. A Court Wizard cast magic barrier on Target, or Target 
                    did not take an action, or Target is Sabotage immune.”

Conceal (Night, 2 uses)
Prevent visits to you.
Feedback: &quot;You prevented visitors to you.&quot;

**Notes:**
Here is how each class&#39; abilities will change if targeted for Sabotage.  Their feedback also changes and you can see them in the quotes.  And to make sure the players know they were sabotaged, the feedback will be in a different color than the usual color.

</aside>
<p>Hard question.  But for Sabotage to successfully work, it has to be before visit prevention and yet I don’t have the Saboteur as visit prevention immune nor barrier immune.  Sabotage could change abilities that prevent visits or barriers, so it has to be before visit prevention…</p>
<p>I guess they’d have to put in a check for the Saboteur to check to see if the Target could be visited by the Saboteur and have the Sabotage go through if the Saboteur can visit the Target. Then go through the current list after the ability is changed by Sabotage.</p>

            <p>Also, it can be BD oriented at times, so outing yourself is not a bad idea. Be careful. I would add something more like Sabotage 5 players Successfully Survive to the end of the game.</p>
<p>Because by Night 5, you would have ideally gotten 3~4 Sabotages. Jail is a possibility after all. The Unseen or Cult may kill people off as well. If they kill too many people, you may lose as there are not many people left to sabotage. (I’ve seen some extreme cases, like a day 4 with 8 people remaining)</p>

            <p>I’m here! And ready to biggie this.</p>
<p>Imma check what I see.</p>
<h3><font color="blue">PART A</font></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heal&gt;&lt;Kill</strong> (<font color="grey">Alchemist</font>)<br>
<strong>Guard</strong> (<font color="purple">Assassin</font>)<br>
<strong>Go people. Come.</strong> (<font color="blue">Butler</font>/<font color="purple">Servant</font>)<br>
<strong>Prevent Positive</strong> + <strong>Force 2 people to target each other</strong> (<font color="blue">Court Wizard</font>)<br>
<strong>FILMSYARGUMENT</strong>+ <strong>Guard</strong> (<font color="red">Cult Leader</font>)<br>
<strong>Suicide move</strong>+<strong>Granting Immunities</strong> (<font color="blue">Drunk</font>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="grey">Alchemist</font> doesn’t care either way, Sabotaging an Alch usually helps the Alchemist, so eyy it’s all fine and dandy!</p>
<p><font color="purple">Assassin</font>: Sabotage hurts him sooooo much, it will be fun to see an Assassin with this class lul.</p>
<p><font color="blue">Butler</font>/<font color="purple">Servant</font>: Ensuring they do their action… Interesting Idea! Something like Frenzy I’m imagining?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="gree">Court Wizard</font>: Good one. Preventing all Positives (Healing, Empowering, Guard) Is pretty good. People who try to heal them however, do they get a failed message? (“You could not heal [14] last night.” / “You could not guard [14] last night.”)</p>
<p>Tornado however is kinda good for the CW, as he can confirm himself with the ability and say “Hey I was sabotaged last night.” I like the CW one in general though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="red">Cult Leader</font>: I LULLED SO HARD ITS TOO GOOD! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"> Eradicate is too precious to be used as a guard however. I wouldn’t turn both attacks into a guard, would change only one (first target).</p>
<p><font color="blue">Drunk/Alcoholic</font>: The first one makes perfect sense gamebalance wise. The second one about giving immunities? I have my doubts but I cannot put my finger on it. (It looks REALLY FUN)</p>
<p>Current Look: Really challenging class on current glance, to prolong the game to the point that you can win. Also, Where in the precedence list does Sabotage come in?</p>
<p>CURRENT LIST<br>
Visit Prevention &gt; Barrier &gt; Redirection/Occupy &gt; Healing &gt; Misc Abilities &gt; Investigations/Killing &gt; Conversions</p>

</aside>
<p>That’d be the best honestly, but really if it’s 3 days later people should already be aware of a Saboteur since people will be getting the sabotaged abilities messages and making people aware of it, so I’m betting Prince wouldn’t exe until the Saboteur is safely dead.</p>

            <p>The main problem with this is , while it’s fun , this class would have to be restricted to a forum setting as coding it in-game would probably take a lotta work.<br>
Fix that and it will make this class a whole lot better.<br>
