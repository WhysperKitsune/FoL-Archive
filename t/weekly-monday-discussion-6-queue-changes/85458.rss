**Please read all of these (And read them carefully) before responding!**

[color=tomato]**Idea 1**[/color] - The mod/review team will use their best judgement to place games throughout the &quot;Waiting to Start&quot; portion of the queue, in order to maximize variety in terms of game size and game type. Reviewed games will no longer simply be placed at the bottom.

ie. We will attempt to make sure that there are not multiple mashes within a short period of time, or a large amount of vanilla setups clumped together. (This is similar to what we do now, but, rather than scrambling to find a small setup, we will have organization weeks/months beforehand).

[color=tomato]**Idea 2**[/color] - Create two queues. One for small games (15p maximum) and one for large games (more than 15 players). Reviewed games will be placed at the bottom of the respective queue.

[color=tomato]**Idea 3**[/color] - Create two queues. One for small *and/or* open/semi-open setups, and one for large *and/or* closed/rolemadness setups. Reviewed games will be placed at the bottom of the respective queue.

[color=tomato]**Idea 4**[/color] - Implement a scheduled queue system. Users will request a date for their game to run. Slots in the schedule will be pre-determined months beforehand, and will be separated based on gamesize. An example of a scheduled queue system is the [Mafia Universe Queue](https://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/threads/29224-2021-Unified-Queue-Thread).

[color=tomato]**Idea 5**[/color] - Change the queue system, but to something else. (Explain your idea in a reply)

[color=tomato]**Idea 6**[/color] - Don&#39;t change anything.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>for example, the CDFM queue had 5 categories</p>
<p>FM, VFM, SFM, TFM, and XFM</p>
<p>FM would just be FoL here, as it was “official” games as part of the on season - in the absence of actual FoL games, this category could easily be ignored</p>
<p>XFM were “experimental” setups, reserved for small games in PMs or any time the mods wanted to try something out - think of it like the Experimental FoL games we had here. Thus, with a total lack of FoL nowadays, this category can also be ignored</p>
<p>The other three categories were described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VFM games are Vanilla FM games, with emphasis put on standard Town-vs-Mafia gameplay. VFM games will include only standard roles and no special mechanics and can be either open or semi-open setups.</p>
<p>SFM games are Special FM games, a category that basically contains everything that isn’t a VFM game. Any game with third-party roles, a closed setup, hidden mechanics, ITAs, or any other unique features should go here.</p>
<p>Lastly, TFM games are for either Tiny FM games (less than 9 players) or Turbo FM games (phases under 12 hours, but generally turbos have phases measured in minutes, such as 15/5). These should be separate as they don’t take nearly as much effort to play or host, so can be run much more often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this breakdown makes a lot more sense than any of the proposed multi-queues, as it effectively guarantees that you can at any point find a game that aligns with your interests. I believe ToS FM also currently uses a similar breakdown, albeit they have Episodes for their standard FM queue. I’m not sure if they still use TFM or retired the category, but it never encapsulated turbos there even thought that makes a lot of sense to me. They did also have GFM for big games (and I mean <em>really</em> big games), but we could always take this category for games larger than 17p if we want to allow more density of SFM games by allowing larger ones to run in a separate queue.</p>
<p>I just think sorting by game type makes way more sense than sorting purely by playercount, and even Idea 3 interlinks those two things in a way I don’t think is particularly well defined. I’d be down to do Idea 3 with games larger than 17p automatically relegated to SFM instead of VFM, but I do think having games with really small playercounts run in a different queue also makes sense rather than having them hold up 9-17p games.</p>

            <p>I again say that the multi-queue based on game type is better</p>
<p>idk why that isn’t an idea here tbh</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>thinking out loud</p>
<p>incorporating miscs in the FM queue somehow might be awkward given there’s an audience who doesn’t really care for miscs and an audience who probably plays more miscs than FM</p>
<p>having it in place of FM would be bad probably</p>
<p>maybe we could try to sort it so they don’t overlap with larger games?</p>
<p>hmm</p>

</aside>
<p>some miscs i’d agree with</p>
<p>big brother is an example of one i don’t think would but given every misc in the queue is probably dangan or related to it, i think this is worth discussing</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Idea 1</strong> - The mod/review team will use their best judgement to place games throughout the “Waiting to Start” portion of the queue, in order to maximize variety in terms of game size and game type. Reviewed games will no longer simply be placed at the bottom.</p>
<p>ie. We will attempt to make sure that there are not multiple mashes within a short period of time, or a large amount of vanilla setups clumped together. (This is similar to what we do now, but, rather than scrambling to find a small setup, we will have organization weeks/months beforehand).</p>
<p><strong>Idea 2</strong> - Create two queues. One for small games (15p maximum) and one for large games (more than 15 players). Reviewed games will be placed at the bottom of the respective queue.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 3</strong> - Create two queues. One for small <em>and/or</em> open/semi-open setups, and one for large <em>and/or</em> closed/rolemadness setups. Reviewed games will be placed at the bottom of the respective queue.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 4</strong> - Implement a scheduled queue system. Users will request a date for their game to run. Slots in the schedule will be pre-determined months beforehand, and will be separated based on gamesize. An example of a scheduled queue system is the <a href="https://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/threads/29224-2021-Unified-Queue-Thread" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Mafia Universe Queue</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>two queues leads to bigger games taking obscene amounts of time to actually come out<br>
because they have to wait for other big games<br>
given that a lot of fun big games are just in the 17p range, I think 2 is legitimately horrible</p>
<p>idea 3 is meh<br>
smaller rolemadness games get shoved in the clogged queue for no good reason</p>
<p>idea 4 would work if we had modbot<br>
but we don’t, <em>do we</em></p>
