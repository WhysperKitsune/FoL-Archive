    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-rework-thread/55447</link>
    <description>Since new patch came out, the &quot;Whisper King&quot; Meta gone for good and that&#39;s obviously a good thing. But another problem rises: The King itself. During some long discussions, there were complains about often turn arounds and swinginess of OE(Order Execution) that makes really a game more unpredictable than it suppose to be. How about a idea of adding more types of King&#39;s, i would reconsider two following options:
1.Good or Evil King wouldn&#39;t appear as starter King.
2.Significantly lower chance of getting Good or Evil King as starter.
The only issue i see is probably getiing lynched Day 2, considering probably isn&#39;t on BD favour. For starter&#39;s a good thing would be again making The Starter King can&#39;t be voted up to Day 4( Obviously unless anyone have better idea to handle this).
Here&#39;s some examples(There aren&#39;t suggestions):

&gt; ## [color=grey]The Foolish King[/color] :shield: :speech_balloon:
&gt; **[color=grey]Unique Neutral Social[/color]**
**Tenacity (Passive)** - Immune to being occupied at night and to target changing.
**Pity Ruler (Passive)** - If you get executed during a day, unable to vote up anyone for two following days.
**Royal Finger (Day)** - Your next vote will count twice. - Infinite uses
**Decide Fate (Day)** - Decide the fate of a player on trial. - 1 uses
**Devil Trickery (Night)** - If anyone will die tonight, announce to the court, you sended guard to kill a player, swap current deathnote with yours. - 2 uses
**Guards! (Night)** - Protect yourself tonight. - 4 uses
*Get executed for Treason during a day.*

&gt; ## [color=grey]The Diligent King[/color] :Shield: :wrench:
&gt; **[color=grey]Unique Neutral Support[/color]** 
**Tenacity (Passive)** - Immune to being occupied at night and to target changing.
**Hope Dies Last (Passive)** - If both your targets die, you will commit suicide next night.
**Royal Finger (Day)** - Your next vote will count twice. - Infinite uses
**Decide Fate (Day)** - Decide the fate of a player on trial. - 1 uses
**Guards! (Night)** - Protect a chosen target, preventing anyone from visit them tonight.Gain night immunity - 6 uses
*Make sure one of your targets will survive until end of the game.*

&gt; ## [color=grey]The Merciless King[/color] :shield: :hammer:  
&gt; **[color=grey]Unique Neutral Offensive[/color]**
**Deadly Tenacity (Passive)** - Immune to being occupied at night to target changing.Immune to death at night.
**Royal Finger (Day)** - Your next vote will count twice. - Infinite uses
**Decide Fate (Day)** - Decide the fate of a player on trial. - 1 uses
**Order Execute (Night)** - Send a guard to attack a player. The attack bypasses night immunity, and it&#39;s use is announced to the court the next day if succesful.This abillity would be disabled if target wasn&#39;t a Neutral - Infinite uses(Not Usable until Day 3)
*Eliminate all Neutral roles.*

So what do you think about current situation?

            <p>Let’s be real, odds that you die Night 1 is minimal and hiding as Fool or using bear as Hunter N1, most of the time would do anything. Considering that the King would have probably objective completely irrelevant to scum/NK so they would be less and less reasons to attack him Night 1.</p>

            <p>Umm, i would like to say it’s only <strong>example</strong> not actual suggestion, so if you had an idea go ahead . But even if there were, let me answer to your questions:<br>
The Foolish King: So? I don’t know from what moment you started playing ToL, but in the past the Fool didn’t have any way to protect himself and it wasn’t that bad. Especially if there would be more types of King the wouldn’t be a big sense to attacking King by scum.<br>
The Merciless King:I understand that, but to be truth told what the difference between Good/Evil King and this King? They all needed to kill NK and this wouldn’t change about NK,s current situation.<br>
The Digilent King:I guess it’s reasonable. Fixed.</p>
