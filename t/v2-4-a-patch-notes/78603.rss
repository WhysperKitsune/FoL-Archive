# v2.4

&gt; Class Notable Changes / Fixes / Balance

* Observer&#39;s &quot;Follow&quot; now [finally] works properly.
* Fixed exploits that allowed for multiple uses (or allowed use of both abilities) in a single phase from, eg, the Reaper (although, with Reaper, we may add it back, one day, as a feature instead of a bug ʘ‿ʘ).
* Classes and abilities are now templated (read: more consistency, easier to catch/fix broken things).
* Fixed exploits that involved spamming multi-target buttons fast to allow for abnormal targeting.
* When converted, players will now &quot;finish&quot; their ability (eg, you&#39;ll get feedback).
* The Chronomancer-induced &quot;Delay death&quot; icon will now vanish on transfer.

&gt; Minor Class Improvements/Fixes

* Massive back-end revamp for the way abilities work and how classes *spawn* (+efficiency, scalability, localized, easily debugged).
* Fixed a 2~3 abilities that had the generic click instead of ability sfx - including tutorial. If anyone finds more MIA, please inform Xblade :)
* Mental Blur abil now also has *recipient* sfx.
* Follow&#39;s feedback now shows &#39;X visited target&#39; &#39;target visited Y&#39;. (Suggested by `scaremenow#6642`)
* *Heathens* are now called *Heretics*. (Suggested by `Urge To Purge#4028`)
* Shield and Scout are removed from dead players. The Mercenary/Sheriff will also be notified.
* Added cancel abil sfx

&gt; Class Icon Changes

Some icons were updated (and more will be updated in future patches):

* Marshal &quot;Probe&quot; ability icon changed! It&#39;s always better.
* Physician/Herbalist &quot;Remedy Studies&quot; ability icon has been changed (so it no longer 1:1 dupes &quot;Inoculate&quot;).
* Physician &quot;Inoculate&quot; ability icon changed to better match &quot;Remedy Studies&quot;, and to be more creative than a different-hued similar icon.
* Duchess &quot;Dark Wisp&quot; icon is now more vivid, but still... dark. Think Avatar.
* Drunk/Alcoholic &quot;Happy Hour&quot; changed from an orange tsunami wave to a happy cold brew (not to be confused with coldbrew, the coffee, which powers me daily).
* Drunk/Alcoholic &quot;I Am The Liquor&quot; passive changed from a muscle flex to ale within an ornate, ivory tusk.
* Ritualist&#39;s &quot;Will of Mithras&quot; icon was changed (it was matching a Mastermind abil).
* &quot;Snoop&quot; journals now have a purple hue to them and moved to the top-left so it doesn&#39;t block chat.

&gt; Class Card Fixes

* In-game ability system back-end has been revamped: Class cards are now sync&#39;d to in-game abilities. Eg, hovering over an abil should now show whatever you see in the class cards - always.
* Class card full descriptions for &quot;Link Minds&quot; and &quot;Conduit&quot; now explicitly mention that the King *cannot* be targeted. (Suggested by `DMS405#5739`)
* Fixed a couple class cards that had hover descriptions inadvertently swapped with full descriptions.
* Made a class card yellow memo for Mastermind&#39;s &quot;Foresight&quot; abil to mention it can be framed (and that a bug fix will come soon).
* Clarified in the Fool&#39;s class card &quot;Deceive&quot; abil that you will make yourself framed &quot;to the Blue Dragon&quot; tonight (opposed to anyone, which was incorrect).

&gt; More Quality of Life

* Upgraded to the next-gen of Unity engine: Notably for a performance boost where one can easily see the difference!
* Trials are now also announced in chat. (Suggested by `physiX#5062`)
* King is now be the one to execute if they decide fate. (Suggested by `DJLaserz#2013`)
* Deathnotes/logs you&#39;re looking at no longer hide during death recap. (Suggested by `Picturesque#7756`)
* Added reminder that leaving games while alive is punishable when trying to leave a game. (Suggested by `Mercy#3489`)
* Unlimited emote uses. (Inspired by `Kapejek#1379`)
* Players that have left will be displayed darker in the playerlist. Reaped players will not show this change to prevent metagaming. (Inspired by `Mercy#3489`)
* That &quot;high-pitched hover sfx&quot; for smaller buttons have been adjusted to be better for your ears. (thx `Clean_And_Blue#1380`).
* Config window now removed upon launching. (Suggested by `Mercy#3489`)
* Include IGNs in post-game chat. (Inspired by `Resmik#3987`)
* Day number will now be yellow instead of red if the player dies during the day. (Suggested `NuclearBurrito#4437`)
* Banned players now killed upon being banned. (Suggested by `zarthus#3972`)
* A secret feature Tryph worked on that we&#39;ll announce later.
* Tutorial confirmation popup now shows the estimated time to complete (~6 mins).
* Better-formatted ability hover descriptions for the OCD ;)
* Removed the redundant &quot;Title&quot; or &quot;Avatar&quot; header names for titles/avatars.
* Better avatar cropping/placement in the lobby.
* Player on trial now highlighted. (Suggested by `Kapejek#1379`)
* There is now an indication in post game, if the player has left during the game. (Suggested by `Kapejek#1379`)
* King will now execute if he uses Decide Fate to execute.
* King &quot;Decide Fate&quot; and &quot;Royal Finger&quot; abils will now have a shorter version of the selected sfx when you initially click (~1/2 length).
* Name selection screen now highlights the names chosen in chat to more-easily see through name selection spam.
* Name selection submit box is only submittable when you have a minimum of 3 chars to prevent &quot;Choose another name&quot; due to min length.
* Name selection input box is now scaled down to what the ~actual max length is to give you a better visual of how many max characters you can input.
* Greatly improved text performance when found in scrollers.
* When you leave a game, the left chat/tips will no longer interlap while pending &quot;leaving...&quot;.
* Fixed awkward loading tip formatting when sometimes a single word would take up an entire line in the middle.
* Less &quot;spammy&quot; logs that repeat often.

&gt; Other Bug Fixes

* Fixed some infinite loading screen/NoClass/2-people-1-class issues when Cult spawns.
* Minor security beefup.
* MVP box no longer blocks the chat scroller
* The number of games to scale class selection difficulty was unintentionally determined by the amount of gold you had (so new players would show 500 games played) - this is now fixed.
* May have finally fixed resolution dropdown weirdness in settings.
* Fixed Nightwatch&#39;s &quot;Watch Carefully&quot; abil to reveal the class name in a styled faction color for consistency with other abilities instead of a &quot;boring orange&quot; (thx `Kapejek#1379`).
* Physician&#39;s n2 &quot;Self Care&quot; ability was missing sfx, now added in.
* With 2-target abilities, selecting only 1 of the 2 targets will no longer show the ability as &quot;active&quot; (that teal background).
* Fixed some &quot;random&quot; hover and click sfx when targeting window is open and not hovering/clicking over an actual target button.
* Cancelling an ability will no longer play the ability sfx again.
* Fixed a few targeting exploits, mostly for abilities with 2 targets.
* Seeker&#39;s &quot;Identify&quot; ability was showing as the old &quot;Reveal&quot; name in the class cards (only): This was sync&#39;d back to &quot;Identify&quot;.
* Settings &quot;Graphics Preset&quot; will now initialize higher than &quot;Lowest&quot; (usually if you restarted, it&#39;d reset).
* Class cards will no longer show placeholders on first class list hover.
* Class card main class descriptions can now click on underlined glossary terms.
* Fixed several misc typos, including 3 instances of &quot;Asssassin&quot; instead of &quot;Assassin&quot;.
* &quot;Settings&quot; for Texture will no longer permanently show &quot;Normal&quot; (was just a visual bug).
* Fixed a rare bug that wouldn&#39;t play self-cast sfx for 2nd day abilities.
* Misc tutorial fixes, mostly to do with targeting, UI alignment, and incorrect feedback.
* Minor improvements to anti-hack techniques and shutdown a few exploits that allowed people with way too much time to annoy players. Not perfect: Waiting on our two 3rd-party service providers for their own sec updates (reported and following up).
* Fixed the status text on emote customizations (informing about errors, etc) that wasn&#39;t showing.
* The &quot;gray name&quot; on disconnection now extends to the end screen (so you know when someone left).

&gt; Performance

* Upgraded to Unity 2019, utilizing the new experimental Garbage Collection (GC); this means better performance/optimization! I can definitely notice a difference.
* Less &quot;spammy&quot; logs that repeat often (logs take optimization juice).
* Removed a countless number of &quot;boxed&quot; variables (Read: Improved performance).

&gt; Localization

* Fixed the buggy toggle between EN&lt;&gt;中文
* In-game hover abilities are now localized. There&#39;s still a lot to be done, but this should greatly help!
* In-game now has a bunch of new localizations in the UI.
* A great deal of dynamic text has been localized.
* Tons of corrections - thanks for the community effort!

&gt; Known New Bugs

* There&#39;s currently a bug with our text engine in Unity 2019.1: We&#39;re currently using a workaround, which may sometimes cause extra line breaks if your chat is shrunk small. However, you probably won&#39;t notice this. Unity says they&#39;ll have a fix very soon.
* Something is weird with the main archway textures: No point in delaying the patch for just this. I&#39;ll hotfix it later.

&gt; 2 Devs Join the Team!

To those that don&#39;t look at Discord often, you may have missed the news:

* Welcome our new Jr. Dev (who started this patch), TryphonX (part-time)! He&#39;s already contributed a great deal this patch and has been a mod since the beginning before this~
* Welcome our new Technical 3D Artist, Vini (part-time)! ...Who has been revamping the graphics of the game (from the ground-up) and it looks absolutely incredible... but we can&#39;t show you yet ;) we&#39;ll leak some goodies to Discord when we get a full scene ready to show. We made sure to keep the scope reasonable so it won&#39;t take too long to deliver.

&gt; Dev Note

I essentially rewrote 20% of the game&#39;s back-end: There *will* be bugs: Future patches won&#39;t be as lengthy now that we have scalability. While there&#39;s still more to scale (anything to do with &quot;Gossip&quot; and messaging type abilities), the hardest part is done - I&#39;m going to take a scalability break :)

&gt; Halloween

Yep, we&#39;re almost ready! Keep an eye on Discord for event date info.

&gt; Discord

Worth mentioning, if you ever connection experience issues, type &quot;.status&quot; in our Discord&#39;s #bot-spam channel to see if any module is experiencing an outage in realtime.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I didn’t even mention the previous dev in the post you replied to. The only reason we do mention it when we do, is because people keep blaming us (mostly Dylan) about the delay, bugs etc, when in fact that’s not quite true. I don’t wanna drag this, but it’s only mentioned when people keep yelling at us for someone else’s mistakes.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to continue this conversation, message me, because it’s both irrelevant to the patch notes and doesn’t have to be public.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your advise. It will or will not be followed.<br>
It’s just really frustating for a junior dev to have to deal with this mess of a code.</p>

            <p>Maybe it’s just me but throwing this much shade this constantly at the previous programmer is just in bad taste.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter how true it is or what else has happened internally - if an outside observer can look and see you blaming a past dev (who was known for fast balance patches) for an essential lack over a much longer period of time, that’s always going to just look bad.</p>
<p>I know you guys know where I stand on this past programmer, and I know the shakeup has caused understandable delays. But it’s just poor for your image to keep pushing this angle, and I know you’re all above that.</p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

<p>He probably assumed that they are removed from the reaped players too - then if you scouted someone who was reaped you’d know he was reaped because you got a notification the scout was removed, even though the player seems alive.</p>
<p>But I’d assume that’s not the case and it happens on the “visible” death. Am I correct in that assumption? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
