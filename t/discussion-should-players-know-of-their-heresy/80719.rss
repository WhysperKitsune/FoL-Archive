    <title>[Discussion] Should players know of their heresy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/discussion-should-players-know-of-their-heresy/80719</link>
    <description>In Inquisitor games, by informing players that they are a heretic, it allows for extra confirmation.

2 BD will always be heretics. Meaning that a heretic claim is confirmed to be not starting Cultseen/NK/Neutral, allowing BD to track down the starting evils. The third heretic can be Cultseen, but generally its -EV to claim heretic anyways just because Inq can easily dispose of you by using a Sheriff/Pally claim or something.

I typically prefer Inq games because it makes finding evils a lot easier, to the extent that I believe it favors BD. Should heretics know of their heresy?

Another alternative I would like to see is a D0 message informing players that there is an Inquisitor in-game, instead of players knowing they are a heretic.</description>

            <p>But if you had to ask me I feel like people should not know of heresy because it’s random confirmation from nowhere.</p>
