    <title>[Other] Request for tips and to Observe Design and Hosting process for anyone who might be comfortable with that going forward</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/other-request-for-tips-and-to-observe-design-and-hosting-process-for-anyone-who-might-be-comfortable-with-that-going-forward/82384</link>
    <description>Hello,

I suppose some might be wondering why I&#39;ve decided to remove myself from design and hosting for the forseeable future.

I&#39;ve done some thinking and realized that, well, ever since my first time co-hosting with EFoL 3 to my latest in Insurgency, all seven games that I&#39;ve co-hosted have all contained some kind of egregious errors from me, in the design process and/or in the hosting process.

All of the games that were &quot;my&quot; idea (Virtuous and Insurgency so far, I think), I never really designed any of. I left all the work to co-designers, which I am really sorry for. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that I actually suck at balance like I claim, or I just fear to try, or something else. I&#39;m sorry to co-designers that I time burdoned immensely in this regard.

All games that this wasn&#39;t the case, i.e. pre-established setups, all had some sort of egregious mechanical and/or laziness error(s) in-game that were my and only my fault.

Ultimately, at this point, I absolutely have never done a game anywhere near competently, if you consider its origin at ideological conception to completion of the game. Personally, I assess the process as a whole for each and every game I&#39;ve been a part of from the hosting end, I&#39;ve never even reached 50% of what I think should be acceptable.

I know some people have had fun in my games, but at this point, it is just not safe anymore for me to be a full-on co-designer or co-host for anything, for the forseeable future.

I don&#39;t mean to wallow in self-pity, but yeah this thread is I guess just a request for tips applicable to me specifically on how to not be so royally incompetent throughout the game creation and running process.

It&#39;s also a request to anyone that would be okay with that to observe the design and hosting process for any games going forward, as well as for me be able to ask questions in such chats to take notes on, but with zero responsibilities and zero hosting duties. Maybe if I learned from those far better from me and studied such philosophies, I might one day be able to co-design or co-host properly. No way to know for sure, but worth a shot, I figure.

<p>When I had that problem and wanted to doublecheck with my cohost, I just took a break<br>
I delayed questions where I knew the answer for some hours as well<br>
So it wasnt angleshootable<br>

<p>i really don’t think anything you’ve done is blacklist worthy given your worst error (sfol57, imo) is the byproduct of something you are actively working on fixing</p>

<p>problem with this is if only one of you is online at a given time</p>
<p>double checking with your cohosts isn’t inherently a bad thing but sometimes you run into the problem of answering a question that, if answered slowly, may be angleshootable</p>

<p>for example, if someone is fake-claiming x ability that had an interaction with someone with y ability, and they ask “how does x ability interact with y ability”, if you say you don’t know/am trying to find out, it outs the person as fake, because if they were real you obviously would know how the interaction worked.</p>

<p>kind of like this</p>
<p>if someone asks if X is possible because Arete claimed they did it, and they ask you and you take 20 minutes to respond, it’s a bit <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>
<p>maybe this isn’t a thing that actually happens but it’s been something i’ve kept in mind when i’ve hosted games and had to answer questions i wasn’t 100% sure of (this happened multiple times in FoL26, people asked questions and frostwolf was offline, so i just… winged it)</p>

<p>p sure i’ve usually bungled this by either talking too much or falling for that pitfall you pointed right. Ur right i have to try to be better here.

            <p>As someone who’s recently designed a setup (not going to reveal anything about it, just in general), it was mostly me and derps passing ideas back and forth before refining it and sending it to review.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to put your ideas out there, discuss the good/bad ones and weed them out, and then as far as the manual stuff like classcards, there’s not really a tip for that, just do them I guess.</p>

<p>This im much more stumped on how to fix.<br>
Quite literally dat made everything for insurgency except for me retrieving a few image links and skill names from time to time. Vul made almost everything for virtuous. And as you’ve been seeing although i’ve been doing flavour and formatting, TBE has made all classcards for DC thus far</p>
<p>Maybe it’s more so that im afraid to try to balance from scratch for some reason than not being capable of it? Because now it seems to me that i probably have never really legitimately tried.</p>

            <p>I think your biggest problem is that you don’t help as much as you should as cohost/co-designer</p>
<p>just try to set out to do a few specific things to make your cohost’s jobs easier</p>
<p>in Castle of the Blood God Amelia was the main (and better) host, and had the final answer to all mechanics questions, but I set out to just do what I could.</p>
<p>It ended up being</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer player questions when I could</li>
<li>Process any instant day actions</li>
<li>Keep spreadsheet up to date</li>
<li>Do VCs and shit</li>
</ul>
<p>And SFoL 61.5 went moderror-less. (besides arguably the kat thing but I wouldn’t really call that a moderror)</p>
<p>Just try to find things you can do to actively contribute to the process and lighten the load on a Cohost. Double-check the end result of night actions with cohosts. Don’t interfere with the actual game at all (only post host-related stuff in game-thread, only post not host stuff in off-topic channels in scumcords, etc)</p>

            <p>so</p>
<p>looking at this list, im not really seeing anything really bad specifically that I did more than once in the same way? Other than it being apparent that i’ve had a really bad problem with moderrors across the entirety of my hosting career, which were only not a thing at all in SFoL 58, RMIV, and possibly EFoL 3 (i dont remember), where my co-host did most of the work action processing-wise. Also that i’ve been horrifically bad at doing my fair share in the design process for applicable setups (that is probably the worst problem I have currently as Im most stumped on how to get better on that front than anything else).</p>
<p>obviously im not capable of predicting everything bad that i could possibly do, and i’ve been trying hard to learn from my mistakes, and i think i’ve been doing a decent job at that</p>
<p>but if i continue to show this sort of level of supreme incompetence, intentional or not, repeated mistake types or not, i will be blacklisted</p>
<p>maybe if some ppl could help me brainstorm other things i may have not precisely done yet but could possibly be prone to in the future based on the ways i’ve hosted and things i’ve done in the past, to try to avoid doing ahead of time instead of after the fact, that would improve my WiM for hosting.</p>
<p>Like ideally i want to make a list of 20+ things to not do as a host compiled of mistakes i’ve made, mistakes others have made, and mistakes i could possibly be prone to make in the future based on my style of hosting. Of course nothing can be fully comprehensive, but it would def be better than the nothing that i have now. Also if there are things other hosts do on a regular basis within and/or outside of games that help them avoid all these pitfalls i’ve been falling into consistently, that would be p valuable for me to discuss with i feel.</p>
<p>if you like what i’ve done here on that side of the door and/or want to help me in this regard, pls like this message; i’ll add you to a group dm for this.</p>
