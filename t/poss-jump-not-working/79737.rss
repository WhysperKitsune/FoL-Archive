    <title>Poss jump not working</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/poss-jump-not-working/79737</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was poss and I tried to jump someone. Me and my target both died and kept our numbers in the graveyard. It said I successfully jumped them and their name showed as alive in the player list but their body wasn&#39;t at the table and they couldn&#39;t be voted for or jailed.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
A successful poss jump.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Be poss and jump someone. My jump target was a butler but that probably doesn&#39;t matter.
