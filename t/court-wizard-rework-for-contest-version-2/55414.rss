            <p>I think my biggest nit pick is I don’t think court wizard needs two day abilities. Just get rid of absorbance and slither and crawl. They change the game and have no counter play. They also aren’t super interesting, and are almost thoughtless to use.</p>

<p>Corruption Protection Spell is a bad ability. Permanently making someone conversion immune is not a fun mechanic, and really should not be an ability to give out, ever.</p>
<p>Empowerment is interesting. No real problems.</p>
<p>Magic Shield is barrier, which I think is fine as is.</p>
<p>Sphere of Magic is basically Ice Ward, right? I assume it prevents visits. It’s fine, depending on what you determine Magic Shield to be protecting.</p>
<p>Slither and Crawl just seems to be another “add on more abilities to make the character intersting”. Sage isn’t really seen as boring, and I don’t agree with buffing him, along with changing poison mechanic for BD with no warning.</p>
<p>Ally Empowerment is simple enough. I think “conversion (edit: I mean occupy, not conversion) immune” rather than “negative effects” would be better, since I don’t think the assassin is going to be converted that night.</p>
<p>Swap a Snake is Tornado and Sphere of Darkness is Wall of Fire, so no complaints.</p>
