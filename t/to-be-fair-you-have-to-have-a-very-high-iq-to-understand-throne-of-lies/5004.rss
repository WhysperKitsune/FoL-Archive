    <description>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Throne of Lies. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical player&#39;s head. There&#39;s also The Fool&#39;s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they&#39;re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Throne of Lies truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#39;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in The Sheriff&#39;s existencial catchphrase &quot;6 is unseen,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev&#39;s Russian epic Fathers and Sons I&#39;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Xblade&#39;s genius unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Throne of Lies tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It&#39;s for the duchesses&#39; eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they&#39;re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</description>
