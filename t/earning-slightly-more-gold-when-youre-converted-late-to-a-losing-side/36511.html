          <p>It can be frustrating to get converted to the losing side late in the game.  This is an inevitable part of any conversion-based game of this nature, of course, so we can’t totally avoid it.</p>
<p>However, we can reduce its impact slightly.  I suggest slightly increasing the amount of gold you get if you were converted in the last few nights and then had the game end with a BD win.  You should still earn less gold than you would if you’d won, of course (you don’t want to incentivize people to lose after they’ve been converted), but, for example:</p>
<p>The game goes on 8 nights.  I’m converted on the 7th night.  BD wins (so I lose, since I was converted to a losing side.)</p>
<p>Under my proposal, instead of getting the 45 gold you get for a straight loss, I’d get 55 or 60 or something (the amount could depend on how close to the end of the game you were converted, ie 60 gold one night before the end of the game, 55 for two, 50 for three, and the current 45 for more than that - it just has to be more than the current 45 you get for a straight loss, and less than the 75 I’d get for winning.)  I feel this is justified because, having spent most of the game as BD, it’s likely that I contributed significantly to their victory; even though I lost in the end, I feel I should earn a bit more gold than someone who evil the entire game.</p>
<p>Incentive-wise, this improves things by making it so BD are less likely to fear being converted late in the game (and more likely to wholeheartedly support BD goals while they’re still BD).  Since you still always earn the most gold by winning, they’re still incentivized to wholeheartedly support their new role after being converted.</p>
<p>(Obviously deliberately not supporting your new role is gamethrowing, but it can be hard to prove when someone is just dispirited, and in general it’s best for the endgame rewards to incentivize good play.)</p>
<p>I mean it’s not a big deal - we’re talking just a few gold a game.  But I think it would be a nice touch.</p>
<p>The flip side to this, I guess, would be earning a bit less gold if you’re converted late and <span class="bbcode-i">win</span>.  Not sure if that’s necessary, but it’s a thought if you want to balance it out to keep gold income from increasing as a result of this suggestion.  Either way, of course, it’s important to emphasize that, at any given time, you would always earn more gold by winning than you do by losing.</p>
