    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-cyclops-neutral-killer/18406</link>
    <description>**Cyclops**

Passive 1:
**Granite Hide** - You cannot be murdered at night.

Passive 2:
**Bloodshot Eye** - You will appear to be bleeding to healers the first time they heal you.

_^ Fool others into thinking you&#39;re an innocent player the Cyclops has bled._

Day Action:
**Caged Sirens** - Force a player to use their night ability on you the following night. (2 uses)

Night Action 1:
**Lambs to the Slaughter** - Kill all who visit you, unless they have chosen to attack you. (3 uses)

Night Action 2:
**Gnash** - Select a player to attack. If your target is visited, you will inflict bleeding on their visitors instead of killing your target. (Unlimited use)

**Optional Lore:** If you don&#39;t like the idea of a giant cyclops in the game, you may consider this character a more human-like one-eyed brute with tenancies toward cannibalism and entrapping sirens. XD

**Comments:** &quot;Gnash&quot; may be OP, but keep in mind your target really won&#39;t have that many visitors, if any. You also can&#39;t kill your original target if you bleed others, so it&#39;s a bit of a trade off. This is of course open to edits.</description>

            <p>Perhaps it could be changed? Something like: “You will appear to be bleeding the first time you are healed”?</p>

            <p>Has a decent feel to it. But “Constant bleeding?” That would make some people think. how can you be bleeding always? what class are you? and why?</p>
