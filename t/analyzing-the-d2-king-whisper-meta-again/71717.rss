    <description>TL;DR - Encourage the D2 Whisper King Meta if you think scum need a buff

I&amp;rsquo;m getting deja vu writing this opinion piece up a 2nd time one year later than the first, but with so many changes and differences of opinion I think it is time to revisit the D2 claim to king meta that players have so openly embraced again.

If you have played ToL recently, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the king will guard themselves N1 and ask for claims D2. Even without asking for claims, many players will immediately whisper him their class regardless. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into WHY players are doing this and compare the advantages to disadvantages of such a strategy.

The #1 reason people claim to the king D2 isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily because they believe it is a viable strategy. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly because they themselves do not want to be voted up in front of the court because they refused to claim. BD and scum are both as likely to refuse claiming to the king - I&amp;rsquo;ve seen more BD get hanged than scum for waiting to claim on the stand. Claiming to the king is like a positive reinforcement loop - the more players who claim, the more suspicious the ones that do not claim stand out. If only 4 players claimed to the king, deciding to vote somebody up randomly for their claim suddenly doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Because 80% of players whisper claim to the king, that only leaves 2-5 players who did not claim to pick on. When more and more players claim to the king, it becomes incredibly risky for you to NOT claim to the king. If very few claim, then there is far less risk.

Whether or not players think the king whisper strategy is effective or not, the main motivation for claiming is self-survival. Fear is what drives people to claim because players know they are expected to. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Advantages of D2 Whisper Meta:

* Scum are less likely to claim unique classes. Scum are almost always outed if they claim a unique class when a unique BD class has already whispered their role to the king.

* It reveals scum who have claimed impossible classes. For example, an assassin who has claimed Physician when 3 actual BD Physicians have already claimed. While this does not specify who scum is, it gives a reliable lynching pool to choose from and puts suspicion on all those players.

* It forces scum to commit to their fakeclaim for the rest of the game instead of deciding to change their claim partway through the game based on changing scenarios.

Disadvantages of D2 Whisper Meta:

* If a Noble is converted at any point in the game, the Cult and Unseen has a huge amount of information while BD is kept in the dark.

* Possessors can hear your claim with puppet strings.

* You&amp;rsquo;re whispering all of your claims to the Evil King who then uses Allies to whisper all of those claims to the Cult/Unseen and deletes his logbook in case he dies.

* If the good king dies, everybody&amp;rsquo;s claims are out in the open. King is especially vulnerable in Reaper games.

* Players rely on the king to make good decisions based on the information the king is given. If a good decision is not made, players commonly mis-lynch the Good King the next day.

* Kings can get a player up to the stand simply by voting for them. Players sheep king accusations incredibly hard. Anecdotally, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Evil Kings simply accuse the Prince and watch all of BD and scum vote up the Prince instantly for a quick Decide Fate Execute. Certainly a worthy trade for the EK as BD have to waste their next day lynching the EK.

* Focusing on the king distracts BD from scumreading and actually searching for scum.

The advantages here are not enough to outweigh the risks of the disadvantages. Scum are not always claiming a 4th class every game and scum are not always claiming unique classes to the king. The fact they have to commit to their claim is a good advantage, but this can be useless if they weren&amp;rsquo;t planning on ever changing it or never NEEDS to change it. The whisper meta isn&amp;rsquo;t giving a 100% guarantee of lynching a scum on D2. Even with all that info, a Good King can still be unsure of who to push. If only scum refused to claim to the king, this strategy would be perfect, but this is not the case. Indeed, those who refuse to claim to the king are more often BD in my own experience.

Players view the D2:KWM as an &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; strategy as opposed to not acquiring claims and doing your own scumreading and night investigations. I agree that this is truly an active strategy - actively giving enemies the information that they need to make informed and devastating night abilities.

If you&amp;rsquo;re in a game and notice that the Unseen/Cult killed two Physicians or Sheriffs/Paladins in a single night and think, &amp;ldquo;Wow, that was unlucky&amp;rdquo; - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t lucky or unlucky. They died to the whisper meta.

Pro tip while we&amp;rsquo;re here: anybody who only contributes to the conversation by screaming &amp;ldquo;EK king&amp;rdquo; is scum.</description>

<p>This is what I refer to as the Polarity Principle, such that if a player is seeming incredibly scummy or suspicious, they tend to be polarized to either hard scum or exactly Prince and it becomes a dangerous coin flip at times.</p>

            <p>I don’t gambit as scum as often as I should. If you make a whisper buddy throughout the game and keep them alive, they are likely to not push you later on. Definitely a AtE play, but surprisingly effective.</p>

            <p>Luckily I am not trying to find scum when I try these. I am usually whispering townreads afterall unless I already have a strong scumread (that’s when I push onto the stand on refusal). The whole point is to build a townblock. This is why I always whisper Alchemist claims. Say what you want about the claiming alchemist strategy, a pocket Alch is a useful tool regardless of who you are and it makes them more likely to side with you later</p>

            <p>Except they are. No one whispers to anyone besides the King or Prince in WKM so these don’t lead to the formation of groups and eventually townblocks. And even if they did the system still has the King as an exploitable weak point meaning you keep the downsides when you didn’t have to.</p>

<p>What active strategy should BD take in that case? Because sitting around waiting for leads is like sheep waiting outside a slaughterhouse.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So, here’s the thing. I want to tell you some BD gambits that work really well for me, but I also don’t want to give away a bunch of secrets at the same time. I don’t want what I do to be out there in the ether and get popular or whatever.</p>
<p>I’ll explain just a couple because they’re very basic and NOBODY does this and I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Depending on your BD class, you can always push people. For example - Butler. I will occupy someone at night, and if I’m successful, I’ll demand them to claim to me in a whisper else they’re getting occupied again (sometimes I will or will not continue the occupation depending on their tone.)</p>
<p>Are you a Princess and found a Social/Support N1? Whisper them for their class and let them know you found them as S/S. Unless they are exactly the Ritualist or Apostle, then you found a non-NK, non-Unseen/Cult unless they got converted the night you checked.</p>
<p>Stuff like that. That’s just a small example of using your power as BD to interrogate. There are plenty of gambits you can run as BD as well that are almost foolproof, but everybody just gets their night results and just waits to see who is getting put to the stand the next day…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What active strategy should BD take in that case?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Each person should be individually putting pressure on those they have suspicion on and communicating with those you trust. If people have a series of 1 on 1 interactions as opposed to a single everyone talks to a single player then the system is much harder to compromise as a whole as converting or eliminating one group usually only trips up a single player. This makes mistakes more manageable as no one player is the lynchpin so no one kill can lose BD the game.</p>
<p>These smaller groups are still enough to coordinate to prove each other leading to deceteralized townblocks which can self regulate amungst themselves. If one of these blocks gets big enough (and it usually does as more players get confirmed) it eventually becomes big enough that PoE is enough to figure out who outside the block is scum.</p>
<p>Since smaller groups can spend more energy checking each player in the group that means that scum reads can be successful more often. As groups grow there are more people to check but also more people to check them. To contrast WKM has only one player who is expected to verify everyone at once</p>

<p>the main motivation for claiming is self-survival</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The main reason this has arisen is because some kings have a ‘claim or die’ mentality. Sometimes a claim AND die if you claim too late. Pushing against the king if he is perceived to be overly aggressive or overly passive puts a lot of pressure on the king. More evil classes need to be doing this because a starting king lynch in a vacuum is a +EV play</p>
