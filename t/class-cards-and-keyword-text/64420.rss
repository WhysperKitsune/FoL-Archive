    <description>Hello again everyone!

Having a discussion the other day with LunarWolf and it eventually evolved into us questioning interactions in the game, and ultimately how misleading class cards are and how many interactions are vague. I proposed an idea where Class Cards and wordings would be standardized, so that Key Words and word selection would allow players to easily distinguish intended effects of their actions (much like a game such as Magic: The Gathering would do it).  In addition players would be able to hover over bolded words to see a quick tooltip about what it means.

I feel that this type of standardization not only makes the game seem cleaner, but it removes a lot of burden of skill for lower level or new players.

&gt; What is a Visit? What is Target? What is the difference between the two?
&gt; Can I Happy Hour a person in Jail? What about King&#39;s Guards!, will it allow them to die?
&gt; Prince Jail says it protects target from all Visits, but my Wolf doesn’t visit! Why doesn’t it work?

For example, here are some of the following Keywords that may appear on Class Cards:

&gt; **Attack:** An offensive action that causes death to the **Target**.
&gt; 
&gt;  **(X) Immune:** Unable to be affected by the effects of X. Options can include **Death** Immune, **Occupy** Immune, **Redirection** Immune, **Conversion** Immune, **Bleed** Immune, **Poison** Immune, etc. The effect **Targets** you but has no effect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Occupy:** **Prevent** a player from taking their Night Ability.
&gt;
&gt;**Prevent**: Stop an effect from occurring.
&gt; 
&gt; **Redirection:** Changing a player’s Night Ability to another **Target.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Target:** The player selected for an Ability.
&gt; 
&gt; **Visit**: A specific type of **Target**. When **Targeting** a player with a **Visit** ability you will be affected by effects that deal with **Visiting** targets such as the _Observer’s Follow._ 

Ultimately class cards would get fixed up to be clearer. Some examples include:

&gt; _Wolf Companion (Hunter)_
&gt; **Target** a player to send a wolf to **Attack** them. They will **Bleed** and die in one day unless **Healed**.  They will be informed a Wolf **Attacked** them. Cannot be used until Night 3.

&gt; _Imprison (Prince)_
&gt; **Target** a player to jail tonight. They are unable to be **Targeted**. Can only Imprison the same player three times. Players who are Imprisoned are **Occupied** and it bypasses **Occupy Immunity**.

&gt; _Concentrated Wine (Butler)_
&gt; Throw a party, **Occupying** all players who **Target** you tonight. Bypasseses **Occupy Immunity**.

&gt; _Follow (Observer)_
&gt; **Visit** a player to see who **Visits** them and who they **Visited** at night.

&gt; _Reap (Reaper)_
&gt; **Visit** and **Attack** a player, killing them and leaving an empty body for a day. **Healing** on the victim is **Prevented**.

&gt; _Frame (Scorned)_
&gt; **Visit** a player making them appear **Suspicious** to investigative classes.

&gt; _Guards! (King)_
&gt; **Target** player gains **Death Immunity** for the Night.

There are many Class Cards that can be cleaned up but those were just some random selections. While it is nice to have the flavour text in the Class Cards (“Reap a player’s soul, killing them...”) they ultimately aren&#39;t very descriptive. Core classes such as the Prince have some funny wording on their abilities (preventing **Visits**, but in reality preventing all **Targeting**) and it has caused plenty of confusion with newer players not familiar with Throne of Lies or Mafia in general.

I think that as a whole this type of regular expression is important for interactions, clarity of play and new player understanding.

So what are some Keywords and Interactions that the Class Cards are misleading about that have bugged you? I&#39;d like to get a full list up and running but I&#39;m strapped for time today.</description>

            <p>I like the idea a lot, and think it would help with clarity. Also, a page showing the “turn order” would be useful, so new players could guess at the more arcane combos better.</p>

            <p>I agree. Consistency is crucial in a game like this, where you can’t really be asking information.</p>

            <p>While it maybe be easier to only specifically label ability’s that don’t visit.

            <p>That is fair as well. It would reduce the overall complexity by specifying the exception rather than the base.<br>
It would be easier if thats the case to change the wording on Imprison and Party to be inclusive of <strong>Targeted</strong> abilities (ones that aren’t <strong>Visits</strong>).</p>

            <p>There is no reason to specify almost every single ability as visiting. There are only a few abilities that don’t count as visits. It is much more reasonable to just label those. It is much more clearer that way.</p>

<p>I see , but you don’t mention what an offensive action is. Just an occupation , which I assume is an offensive action.</p>

            <p>Ah but here’s the thing, all <strong>Attacks</strong> are <strong>Offensive Actions</strong>, but not all <strong>Offensive Actions</strong> are <strong>Attacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at Bear (Hunter)…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summon a bear to protect you from all attacks at night. The attackers will be dead in the morning (Bypasses night immunity). You will be death and conversion immune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bear doesn’t Kill Drunks and Butlers despite them having <strong>Offensive Actions</strong> (going by the class description of Offensive). <strong>Attack</strong> seems to be a specific type of <strong>Offensive Action</strong>.</p>
<p>Just goes to show the vagueness of the wording. I’m not a wordsmith myself so the definitions can be changed but its just a series of examples really.</p>

<p>Would make the player think it did some form of occupation before the kill. I think it should be changed to a <strong>Negative Effect</strong>: Something that causes harm to you or changes what happens to your intended action<br>
Or smtn.</p>

            <p>Hello again everyone!</p>
<p>Having a discussion the other day with LunarWolf and it eventually evolved into us questioning interactions in the game, and ultimately how misleading class cards are and how many interactions are vague. I proposed an idea where Class Cards and wordings would be standardized, so that Key Words and word selection would allow players to easily distinguish intended effects of their actions (much like a game such as Magic: The Gathering would do it).  In addition players would be able to hover over bolded words to see a quick tooltip about what it means.</p>
<p>I feel that this type of standardization not only makes the game seem cleaner, but it removes a lot of burden of skill for lower level or new players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a Visit? What is Target? What is the difference between the two?<br>
Can I Happy Hour a person in Jail? What about King’s Guards!, will it allow them to die?<br>
Prince Jail says it protects target from all Visits, but my Wolf doesn’t visit! Why doesn’t it work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, here are some of the following Keywords that may appear on Class Cards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attack:</strong> An offensive action that causes death to the <strong>Target</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>(X) Immune:</strong> Unable to be affected by the effects of X. Options can include <strong>Death</strong> Immune, <strong>Occupy</strong> Immune, <strong>Redirection</strong> Immune, <strong>Conversion</strong> Immune, <strong>Bleed</strong> Immune, <strong>Poison</strong> Immune, etc. The effect <strong>Targets</strong> you but has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>Occupy:</strong> <strong>Prevent</strong> a player from taking their Night Ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent</strong>: Stop an effect from occurring.</p>
<p><strong>Redirection:</strong> Changing a player’s Night Ability to another <strong>Target.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> The player selected for an Ability.</p>
<p><strong>Visit</strong>: A specific type of <strong>Target</strong>. When <strong>Targeting</strong> a player with a <strong>Visit</strong> ability you will be affected by effects that deal with <strong>Visiting</strong> targets such as the <em>Observer’s Follow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately class cards would get fixed up to be clearer. Some examples include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wolf Companion (Hunter)</em><br>
<strong>Target</strong> a player to send a wolf to <strong>Attack</strong> them. They will <strong>Bleed</strong> and die in one day unless <strong>Healed</strong>.  They will be informed a Wolf <strong>Attacked</strong> them. Cannot be used until Night 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imprison (Prince)</em><br>
<strong>Target</strong> a player to jail tonight. They are unable to be <strong>Targeted</strong>. Can only Imprison the same player three times. Players who are Imprisoned are <strong>Occupied</strong> and it bypasses <strong>Occupy Immunity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Concentrated Wine (Butler)</em><br>
Throw a party, <strong>Occupying</strong> all players who <strong>Target</strong> you tonight. Bypasseses <strong>Occupy Immunity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Follow (Observer)</em><br>
<strong>Visit</strong> a player to see who <strong>Visits</strong> them and who they <strong>Visited</strong> at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reap (Reaper)</em><br>
<strong>Visit</strong> and <strong>Attack</strong> a player, killing them and leaving an empty body for a day. <strong>Healing</strong> on the victim is <strong>Prevented</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Frame (Scorned)</em><br>
<strong>Visit</strong> a player making them appear <strong>Suspicious</strong> to investigative classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Guards! (King)</em><br>
<strong>Target</strong> player gains <strong>Death Immunity</strong> for the Night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many Class Cards that can be cleaned up but those were just some random selections. While it is nice to have the flavour text in the Class Cards (“Reap a player’s soul, killing them…”) they ultimately aren’t very descriptive. Core classes such as the Prince have some funny wording on their abilities (preventing <strong>Visits</strong>, but in reality preventing all <strong>Targeting</strong>) and it has caused plenty of confusion with newer players not familiar with Throne of Lies or Mafia in general.</p>
<p>I think that as a whole this type of regular expression is important for interactions, clarity of play and new player understanding.</p>
<p>So what are some Keywords and Interactions that the Class Cards are misleading about that have bugged you? I’d like to get a full list up and running but I’m strapped for time today.</p>
