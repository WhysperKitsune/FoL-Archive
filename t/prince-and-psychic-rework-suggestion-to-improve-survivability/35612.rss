    <description>Hello:

At this point I&#39;m sure we all know the &quot;Prince dead N1 LUL&quot; meme, and I thought of how annoying it is when I&#39;m playing the Prince and actually die N1. As I started to think about how that could be counteracted, I realized that the best way to do this is by giving him a 1 night death immunity, like the Inquisitor. (This could also be applied to the psychic since he plays a similar role to the Prince in terms of gaining information). This would help the the Prince and Psychic make sure that the (VERY) sensitive information they&#39;re gathering stays hidden for at least another night. This would also create some confusion for Neutral Killers (and especially Sorcerers), since they might think that the person they attacked is truly resistant to killing and don&#39;t want to waste another night to find out if they are and attack them. 

I think this change would seriously enhance the Prince and Psychic classes and keep the information they have safe.</description>

            <p>I think this would be fine as long as the 1 day immunity had an expire date, like it would vanish even if not attacked after 4 days.<br>
Because otherwise, it would also be very bad for evils if they never hit the prince and late game they have to kill him twice.</p>

            <p>Fun fact. ToL used to have a retributionist esc class called the priest. She was removed because she was impossible to balance while still being fun to use.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the Prince really needs any buffs, but I agree that getting them hit randomly in the first few nights is a big swing.</p>
<p>One problem is that Throne of Lies lacks a true resurrection class like the ToS retributionist - while those are hard to balance, they serve an important role by decreasing the chance that a vital role will die randomly early on.  I’m not saying that Throne of Lies needs that, but it could benefit from something similar to mitigate the impact of losing an important role at random.</p>
<p>For instance, add a BD role with the ability to silently become a new prince if the existing prince dies within the first three nights.  (Obviously, that role would either have to be unique, or only one can “inherit” prince like that per game.)</p>
<p>Possibly even just give it to Princesses as a day ability - if the prince is dead and it’s day 1-4, the Princess can push this ability to change roles to prince.  Only one Princess can do this per game.</p>
<p>Although princess might be a bad choice because they’re also an investigative and could immediately use their knowledge to execute - maybe give it to Knight instead.</p>

            <p>Maybe. But at the same time, they hold arguably some of the most important information in the game. Having them just be vulnerable to death at any point seems a bit unfair considering said importance.</p>
