    <title>The Special King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-special-king/20011</link>
    <description>So I was thinking of an idea that instead of just the regular 3 King Types all the time, they have another type &quot;Special King&quot; which different abilities.

Fool King: Has the same day abilities, Allies is replaced with a Frame and guard is removed.
Objective: Get Executed

Scorned King: Has the same abilities  as regular king. Has a random target
Objective: Get your target executed

Strict King: Allies checks for Royal Blood rather than their faction
Objective: Kill all players with the Royal Blood passive

Killer King: Same abilities but with unlimited guards
Objective: Wins with the Neutral Killing

Fake King: No night abilities
Objective: Survive to the end

Old King: Will spawn with a different neutral class (Peasant) who&#39;s goal is to become king
Objective: Remain in power until the Peasant dies.

And maybe some more Special King classes, but this is what I thought of for now.</description>

            <p>These ideas are good if neutral steps up as king. BD and evils will still be the normal kings. This would limit the “nk step up as new king” meta. Atleast NK should become tyrant or crazy king and objective is the same as nk. Crazy king should have somekind of kill with 1 or 2 charges so you really need to safe it to last nights of the game.<br>
Scorn kill would be awesome aswell. You will keep your targets and want to exe them.<br>
Fool king would be ok also.<br>
Inq still wants to kill sorc.I think still good.<br>
Alch/merc would be “normal” neutral king.<br>
Every neutral king (expect “crazy” king) would have only normal king guard at nights. No “special” neut king spawn as first king.</p>

            <p>Strat as Fool king-1 say someone is evil 2-Put them on stand 3-Execute them 4-They are BD and you get hung for being “evil” 5-You won<br>
Seriously this is soooooooo lame your basically a fool who no one cares if you are fool or not.<br>
Old king-You want to find the peasant and kill them or have the peasant die in some way<br>
Strict King-Classes with royal blood-prince,princess,drunk,duchess,and alcoholic therefore meaning he has to kill prince to win and the only time he isnt evil is when he tries to kill converted princess and drunk<br>
Scorned king would be the easiest class to win as-You say i invested so and so get them to lynch your target</p>

<p>What do you mean?! King is useless as most possessor and sorcerer are immune so his guards only matter with reaper and even then they just kill you…</p>

            <p>How does the fool king get investigated?<br>
Scorned king is a little powerful<br>
Fake king is boring as hell<br>
Strict king is basically evil king<br>
Killer King is weird as he can guard NK but it never matters unless NK is Reaper<br>
Old King is basically the inquisitor and sorcerer<br>
So nothing really that special -_-</p>
