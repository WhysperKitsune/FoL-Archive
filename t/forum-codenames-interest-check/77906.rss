    <description>## Welcome
Hello. I shall *not* be your host for this game, I shall be playing it (well unless two other people want to codemaster but they need the words, then technically ill be host enough to give them the words, but after that im done

This variation has not come from a separate forum, im adapting it for this forum myself, so sorry if its not all too good

### Gameplay
Each turn will be 48 hours. The first turn will be 72 hours. There are *not* separate phases for the clue and voting, explained in the pdf.
I will be using, for the trial run, some easy ones but since this is on a forum and people have a lot of time to think its going to ramp up quite quickly.
In order to submit a poll, that is roughly in the format below:
***
## Would you vote for &quot;[word]&quot;?
[poll type=regular results=always public=true]
* Yes, I would like to vote for &quot;[word]&quot;

* No I would not like to vote for &quot;[word]&quot;
[/poll]
*****
If this ever reaches a unanimous conclusion to vote for the word (voting against the word does nothing, it just needs two options) then that word is chosen. That teams codemaster can then tell them which team the word belonged to. the other codemaster can also do this if they&#39;re offline
The list of words, without alignments, will be given publicly. players that are not the codemasters are not allowed to use dm&#39;s to discuss the game, and must discuss everything in the thread. While talking during the other team&#39;s turn is *not* against the rules explicitly, doing so extensively is not fun and should be avoided if possible, in particular if the team whos turn it is, is discussing their clue.
The codemasters may not speak in the thread, except for when they are giving a clue or announcing the result of a voted word. they will have a private thread with the words&#39; alignments and for them to discuss the game if they wish.
In addition, again due to this being a forum where people have much more time to think, there will be twice the amount words in a match.

these are only the forum-specific rules, here is the pdf to the actual game:
https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf

****
Ask any questions you still have if you&#39;ve read the rulebook

this is just an interest check, but im okay with turning this into a game thread if that happens</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The spymaster also gives a number that corresponds to the number of words that clue applies to (Example: “Animal 3”). Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. You are allowed to guess n + 1 times where n is the number the spymaster gives. Everyone wants to avoid the assassin.</p>

            <p>nah im not choosing them personally.<br>
like i said in the cookie thread, i tend to play it on tabletop sim, and its scripted there (it also has a couple different decks of varying difficulty) so i just choose the deck, press start a round, and take a screenshot of the variation that comes up, card alignments included</p>

<p>Isn’t this prone to bias when you are going to play as a codemaster afterwards. You can give yourself easy words/links.</p>

            <p>im not going to accept people who dont know the rules. it can be pretty complex occasionally, so you should know what you’re getting into.<br>
this isnt my bragging, its not that difficult of a game imo, its just not your average forum game and i think you should read into it some more</p>
