    <title>[Suggestion] Hunter is overly friendly to bad play and that needs to change</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-hunter-is-overly-friendly-to-bad-play-and-that-needs-to-change/5436</link>
    <description>Out of all the roles that Blue Dragon has that are Kill capable at night, Hunter is the only one that is lenient towards bad playing.

With Prince, Execute the wrong guy and you can no longer Execute. With Knight, Cold Steel a friendly and you will kill yourself. Fair enough, both balanced, IMO.

But Hunter? Wolf the wrong guy and, oh hey, you still got one more to kill someone with. This is so permissive to trolling and awful gameplay it&#39;s kind of unreal.
I believe this role needs to be tweaked before it really becomes a problem with trolls. Perhaps a simple tweak to make the Wolf actually check if someone is BD or not before it attacks?

If they&#39;re BD, the Wolf will abstain and the Hunter will get notified of that while still losing a use of that skill. If their target is Neutral/Unseen/Cult however, The Wolf will act as it does now and attack.

This gives Hunter slightly more utility by being able to either verify someone as BD or killing someone who isn&#39;t. The result you get depends on players better judgement, rather than &quot;lel lemme kill this guy... whoops.&quot;</description>

            <p>I do appreciate how the Hunter can essentially “force” somebody to claim the following day after a wolf attack. Since that person is going to die, they might as well claim now and convince a Physician or Alchemist to save them.</p>
<p>So that is a neat trick, but it can still backfire.</p>

            <p>There’s definitely an issue with Hunter where it is almost always correct to NOT use your traps within the first couple nights, but newer players feel like it is “wrong” to not do anything at night.</p>
<p>The Hunter, despite being able to kill the Mastermind and NK classes, is incredibly weak, and is a huge liability to BD in every game it spawns in. I’d love to see some raw data of BD’s win rate when a Hunter is present and not present.</p>

            <p>No. That’s the effect of many people being on the wrong track, not one.<br>
It takes 7-8 people to be wrong to convict that one person in your scenario. With Hunter’s, it takes only themselves.</p>
<p>With that said, obviously the role requires lots of responsibility to play properly especially with it having no safeguards. And I don’t believe the majority of the playerbase has that.</p>

            <p>In most games I play, all of BD acts stupid and lynches at least 2 of their team by the end, same amount of people hunter can kill with wolfs.</p>
<p>Should we take away the ability to vote people on trial?</p>

            <p>Hunter is a strange class with an unclear concept. It is the most risk/most reward BD class there is.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a> It’s nice you seem to play it properly but as I’ve said in most of the games I’ve been in, Hunter is used in a very foolish way.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a> That’s like saying a flawed world should be perfect, when it isn’t and never will be. I’ve been killed more as BD by Hunter wolves than I’ve seen them actually kill those from the opposing factions.</p>
<p>What I’m suggesting would assist with lessening their ill effect. Another option is to make Hunter Neutral and leave them as is aside from that. As Prince I’d really love to execute the ones who get out of line without penalty.</p>
