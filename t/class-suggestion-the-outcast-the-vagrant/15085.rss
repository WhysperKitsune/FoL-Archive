    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Outcast / The Vagrant</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-outcast-the-vagrant/15085</link>
    <description>[**The Outcast**]
[**Neutral Offensive**] 

The _Outcast_ is a Unique Neutral &quot;Offensive&quot; class. They must live to see two to five classes with &quot;_Royal Blood_&quot; die or be executed for treason. The _Outcast_ cannot become King, even when converted. The _Outcast_&#39;s converted class is [The _Vagrant_]. Not able to be converted if win condition is already met. If a member of the Evil Faction contains someone of &quot;_Royal Blood_&quot;, you will slay them the night you are converted.

**Passive Ability 1**: 
[_Revenge of the Outcast_] - If found guilty of treason, kill the current king before your execution. (Can provide a win if current king has &quot;Royal Blood&quot; and previous &quot;Royal Blood&quot; classes were killed.)

**Passive Ability 2**:
[_Scouting the Kingdom_] - Unable to be visited the first three nights.

**Day Ability** 1:
[_Royal Seal_] (3 Uses) - Seal a target&#39;s Night Abilities for one night if they have &quot;Royal Blood&quot; (does not inform the Outcast if it succeeded or not, and only informs target at night start).

**Day Ability 2**:
[_No Kings Live_] (1 Use) - Only available for use the day a new King is elected. You will slay the new King tonight without fail. The Court will be told who the Outcast is the next day. 

**Night Ability 1**:
[_Search for Royalty_] (4 Uses) - Occupy a target. If the target has &quot;Royal Blood&quot;, the Outcast will be informed and also frame the target, but will not be occupied and cannot be visited the next night. If the target has &quot;Royal Blood&quot; and is &quot;Evil&quot;, you will attack the target.

**Night Ability 2**:
[_Barricade_] (2 Uses) - Barricade the door, occupying all players who visit you. You will know who visited you, and if they contain &quot;Royal Blood&quot;, you will be informed but not know which visitor contains it. 

**Lore**:
The Kingdom exiled you after you accused the King of being evil for slaying your family. You vowed you would ruin him and his kin. Seven years later, the opportunity arose. 

**Win Condition**:
The _Outcast_ must live to see two to five classes with &quot;Royal Blood&quot; die or be executed for treason. 

**Comments**:
This class, although primarily seeming against the Blue Dragon, also will definitely kill Evil Royal Blood, helping the Blue Dragon. A true Neutral. 

[**The Vagrant**] (Converted Outcast)
[**Unseen Offensive**]

The _Vagrant_ is an &quot;Offensive&quot; Class that belongs to the Unseen faction. It is converted from the _Outcast._

**Day Ability 1**:
[_Coin Toss_] (2 Uses) - Choose a target, one of their Night Abilities are sealed for one night.  

**Night Ability 1**: 
[_Beg For Coins_] (Infinite Uses) - Occupy a player. Can only be used once per target.

**Night Ability 2**:
[_Redirect_] (2 Uses) - Cause all players targeting a player to target a different player instead. You will be immune to occupation tonight.

**Win Condition**: 
Generic unseen win

**Comments**:
A Neutral that can be converted is always nice. Not too overpowered abilities, and punishes the unseen or cult as a result.


Please let me know what you think!

**Suggestions**
Don&#39;t have the Outcast kill evil faction royal blood when Outcast gets converted. -NuclearBurrito
Name change due to similarity to Scorned. -Sketch</description>

            <p>The name thing is understandable. Just not sure what else would work that wouldn’t be too much of the same flavor as Scorned. I wanted Exiled but that is similar flavor and a lot of people already have that name as class suggestions, lol.</p>

            <p>I appreciate it! Yeah I can see what you mean. But I feel like he would be nice as a double-edged  sword due to primarily being out to get people who start off as Blue Dragon in the first place. Plus, you can kill Royal Blood Unseen, its just harder to do, an example would be a princess who got converted, and original assassin dies. The Princess becomes assassin = Royal Blood assassin, then Outcast gets converted and kills the assassin, becoming assassin himself.</p>
<p>But I really do appreciate your opinion as it makes a lot of sense.</p>

            <p>I like it! The only problem i have is the whole killing evil royals on convert. First of all that would only affect the cult and second of all neutral converts should be strong to make up for not reducing the amound of BD.</p>

            <p>For [Royal Seal], my version does, but of course if this class was ever used, it would be up to the developers whether or not it would work on occupy immune players.</p>
