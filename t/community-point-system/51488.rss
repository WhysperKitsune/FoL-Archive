    <description>I&#39;m stealing this one from WoWS, so it&#39;ll need a unique feature to not be a plagiarism.

Essentially, players get the opportunity to give each other a + or - point for good or bad plays, and the total shows on the profile.  Newbies should probably complete 50 or so games before unlocking the feature.

This should alleviate pressure from the report system too, which is sometimes used just because a player made a misplay or missed something that was obvious to everyone else, ie situations that were not rule-breaking but resulted in unnecessary friction.</description>
