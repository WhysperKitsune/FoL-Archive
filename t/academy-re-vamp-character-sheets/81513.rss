            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Aleksei Bishop<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 17<br>
<strong>Height:</strong> 5 foot 7 inches<br>
<strong>Class:</strong> Noble<br>
<strong>Origin:</strong> Terrion<br>
<strong>Appearance:</strong> <img src="/uploads/default/original/3X/f/d/fde17b0506de4e6b459bc999b2ac4f25120d9e79.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="AdVTaDzgvoIyCx7HMweGPRRwXcR" width="294" height="375"><br>
<strong>Backstory:</strong> As a son to a courier, when Aleksei’s father finally retired, he proudly took the mantle and continued the tradition. His father ran the dangerous jobs, the ones that were to be delivered to less civilized parts of town. So naturally he volunteered for those jobs, and used his father’s weapon of choice: a custom made combat knife that was also his grandfather’s weapon, and so on. Attempted thefts were few, but when they happened, it usually ended bloodily. Luckily, with either his expertise with knives or the attacking party’s in-expertise with knives, he only received light injuries, with the worst being a nice slash on his right arm. At first, his parents worried for him, but eventually they stopped, with his father knowing it was the same situation decades ago for him. The job paid enough to support his family, and life was fairly nice. Though, Aleksei could always feel tension in the air. The tensions between the states of Adiart and Telias that kept growing, and eventually it got to a point where he couldn’t just do the same job. He wanted to enlist as a soldier, and dreamed of becoming one of those stormtroopers father used to tell him about. The ones that would charge right after an artillery barrage, and would take enemy fortifications that were very well defended. Of course, with his age, he was denied fast. Walking on the streets infuriated, he suddenly heard a conversation about a magical school in Finera that’s accepting new students. The school apparently taught them magic, and was looking for 16-17 year olds. After hearing enough, he ran home, eager to start training.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon:</strong> His family’s steel combat knife, passed down to him when he became a courier. A combat knife is deadly, quick, durable, and concealable. What more could you ask of it?</p>

<h3>Uriah Tolliver</h3>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 15</p>
<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Although at first glance he may appear to be a normal person, his fair skin and grace suggest noble blood. Uriah has dark hair and bright eyes, both green, with a weary expression on his face. Carries a sword on his back (see more in <em>Weapon</em>). Stronger than he looks.</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Commoner</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Zephys</p>
<p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Uriah claims to have been born of Zephys, a town South of Leeves, nearing the Noble Centralized City St. Rias near the coast, where he had lived an unlucky life. His mother died when he was young, and his father followed not long later. While there, he learned of the military Academy and decided to enrol, as a way to learn the Arts and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon:</strong> A well crafted broadsword forged by a talented forgeman in the Lavis Mines. Shows affinity with the Arts. The blade is marked with the emblem of Adiart.</p>
