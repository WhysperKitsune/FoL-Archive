<strong>Class:</strong> Commoner<br>
<strong>Origin:</strong> Terrion<br>
<strong>Backstory:</strong> Growing up in a house with 2 loving parents, 2 younger brothers, and with a long bloodline of merchants, Faustus believed that he would be a trader as well. His rich family already had everything that he might need, including a boat for the future on his journeys, a 2nd manor for him in the same area, and even had a woman declared to be his future wife. Life was good for him, and his family was very supportive and caring. However, on one night while hiking near Garrelia Fortress with a couple of his friends, he saw his other rich friends laughing at something, and upon looking, he saw 2 recruits fighting with tree sticks. He briefly down at a twig near his foot, and had an urge to pick up a stick right next to him and join in. After watching the fight for a couple minutes, he knew that his true destiny was to fight. He hired an officer to help train him in secret from midnight to 4am to prepare him for the entrance exam of the army. After weeks of training, on one stormy night, his family woke up to a lightning bolt hitting outside the walls at 1:00am, and upon entering his room, saw he wasn’t there. They looked around the castle, until they noticed Faustus was training with an officer of the army. After watching the fight, they returned home in disgust and anger, furious at the notion Faustus was willing to disgrace his family to join a horrible job. Upon Faustus returning, his family told him to leave their place, shouting in an enraged tone, “If you wish to die among the peasants, then you should live with them!” He was kicked out of his home, along with his future being shattered, as his belongings and future belongings, including his to-be wife, was given to his younger brother. Desperate and dejected, he sought help from the officer, as he needed 2 years before he could join the army. The officer recommended Faustus went to an academy inside an area named “Finera”. With a map, his clothes, and a week’s worth of food and water handed to him by his family, he set off, wondering what his fate will turn out to be.<br>
