    <title>Can we get rid of the Swear Fealty Mystic N1 meta?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/can-we-get-rid-of-the-swear-fealty-mystic-n1-meta/71468</link>
    <description>I would like to have Swear Fealty removed completely, and I think most agree we need more convertables not less.  But in the meantime something&#39;s got to be done about Mystic linking King n1 and getting sworn fealtied.  This is obviously not an intended strategy of giving King the ability and only exploits the fact that Mystic is the only player that can confirm itself to King during the night.</description>

            <p>You should totally use link minds to inform the king that you are converted.</p>

            <p>it’s definently a valid strategy… though it kind of counts on the 1 in 14ish chance that the mystic is the one targetted. (either he’s announced in which case the U/C will convert randomly or he did announce it day 1, in which case the U/C will probably chose someone else in the risk that you did CM him).</p>

            <p>Mystic is pretty much the worst class to SF anyway. EVERYONE will know when a mystic is converted. No one gets linked, too obvious.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t help.  Good King dying with “Swear Fealty Mystic” in his logs just makes Mystic as confirmed as Prince the rest of the game.</p>

            <p>I think what could be done to change it is let Swear Fealty be used either N2 or N3, I think it’s a pretty good idea in having a guy you trust be made confirmed BD, but this N1 meta isn’t fun</p>
