            <p>This faction should have more interesting interactions with the point system.</p>
<p>As it is, this faction is extremely similar to Unseen without anything to make it extremely unique.</p>
<p>I’d develop on this more so that it ends up being more distinct.</p>

            <p>It’s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>Does the The Crusader bypass occ, death immunity, and poison immunity?  Does the poison applyin jail?  Or does it make poison hit no matter what so long as you can hit it?</p>
