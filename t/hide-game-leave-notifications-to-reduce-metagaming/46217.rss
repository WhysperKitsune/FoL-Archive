    <title>Hide Game Leave Notifications To Reduce Metagaming</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hide-game-leave-notifications-to-reduce-metagaming/46217</link>
    <description>I think we shouldn&#39;t get a notification when a player leaves, but just a notification when they die that they died of AFK (if they really did).  This is because game leave notifications convey too much information.  Just one example - if someone dies and leaves game immediately, they probably are not a poss jump.  Another example - if someone is on trial and all the dead evil faction leave game, that person is probably the last evil.</description>
