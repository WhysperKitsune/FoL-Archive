            <p><strong>Lets start with good changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Occupation, less confirmable.<br>
-Day ability, pretty useful, helps people if they missclick ect.<br>
-Silence, nice small buff, fits with reaper chill.<br>
-Court wizards day ability sounds cool (I dont get why cw cant empower them afterwards though.<br>
-Hunters mark change is good, HM is bassically a weaker Cs with less of a drawback when killing bd.<br>
-Maid changes pretty good, but maid is already very useful<br>
-Noble Twin less confirmable and a pretty intresting idea.<br>
-Scorned Change, very intresting idea, I’d like to see this it’s similar to how mercenary works</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Meh changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Mystic while some parts seem a little too much it’s generally a good change, also illusionists second ability being usefull is cool<br>
-Pretender, I’d change it into “1x” everytime It kill a royal, I personally don’t like this class and needs a total rehaul imo.<br>
-New bd killer class. Seems good but it seems a little underpowered tbh, Knight and hunter do a better job.<br>
-Mercenary 7 Brilders I couldn’t care if this was changed either way</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bad changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Hunter bear occupation immunity is a big disagreement with me I feel like Three death immune and conversion immunes that also kill attackers is powerful enough<br>
-Inquisitor Mercenary shouldn’t be a heathen as much as a fool or scorned shouldn’t be they have to survive until a certain point to complete there objective and shouldn’t be considered to be heathens, also Sellsword doesn’t work being a heathen because of your change suggestion.<br>
-Sellsword change, no no no. This creates false difficulty, also doesn’t allow sellsword to make cool plays like getting two people executed while claming maid ect, just ruins the class</p>

            <p>It’s a server/game issue. The 9th vote literally doesn’t matter. But it still shows up. So people expect it to shoot X, when it actually shoots Y instead.</p>

            <p>This happens when you get 9/8 required votes to up someone. “Randomly” because you can see, say, [5] being the last vote, but the arrow shoots [13] due to being the last required vote.</p>

<p>Actually no not really. When you vote someone it says X accused someone. If they did it exactly at the same time one would be before the other one. It’s no different from voting them first at the exact same time</p>

We needed a misvote otherwise the MM would have been voted up next Hunter was sus as being the assassin</p>
