    <title>Frame VS Mindwarp (On Scorned)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/frame-vs-mindwarp-on-scorned/72811</link>
    <description>So, we were arguing about putting mind warp on scorned.

I said No, it would be too strong. It requires way less skill compared to frame. As well has a 100% chance of success on a sheriff compared to a lower one on a target. It&#39;s incredibly strong.

However, They wanted mind warp to be a limited use ability, but IMO frame being unlimited allows it to be more fun in a way, as you have more things to do then just sit around.

* Frame is better for scorned to be balanced
* Mind warp is better for scorned to be balanced

            <p>I like frame better, but frame should be changed so it causes everyone visiting your target to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities.</p>

            <p>Forget about balence for a sec. Frame is fundimentally better than mindwarp on Scorned because:</p>
<p>How to successfully mindwarp?:</p>
<p>Figure out who the Investigatives are</p>
<p>How to successfully frame?:</p>
<p>Figure out who the suspicious people are</p>
<p>The difference? You can MAKE someone suspicious.</p>
<p>In otherwords you don’t guess that a sheriff will investigate X player. You give them a reason to investigate X player</p>
