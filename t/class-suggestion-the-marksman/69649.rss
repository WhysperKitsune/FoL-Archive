    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Marksman</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-marksman/69649</link>
    <description>I had originally started writing this in the arsonist thread as just a spitball idea but ended up spending considerable time on it so I wanted to put it in its own thread :stuck_out_tongue:

&gt; # [color=steblue] The Marksman[/color]
&gt; **[color=steblue] Blue Dragon Investigative [/color]**  
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Ghillie Suit)** Your abilities do not count as visits and you appear to be unconvertable, neutral, and support to evil investigative abilities.  You can still be converted however. 
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Focus)** You are immune to occupation and redirection _(credit to @NuclearBurrito)_ .
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Take Aim)** - Set your sights on a player to make them your target. (Infinite Uses) 
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Scrutinize)** - Determine information about your target based on how many days you have had them in your sights (counter reset by imprisonment and prevention). **Day 1:** Whether they visited anyone last night. **Day 2:** Narrows down their class type to one of two possibilities. **Day 3:** Their exact class type. **Day 4:** Their faction.  **Day 5:** Allows **Headshot** to kill without needing to predict who they visit. (Infinite Uses - _credit to @Kirefitten)_
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Headshot)** - Lead your target, predicting who they visit tonight *(selecting your target will count as predicting them not visiting anybody)*. _(credit to Firekitten)_  If correct, kill them and prevent their night action. Bypasses everything **(even Reaper&#39;s souls)**.  Permanently disables your **Ghillie Suit** passive.   (Infinite Uses) (Not usable before N3 - credit to @ShadowKnight and @santana )
&gt;
&gt; **Goal:** *Defeat the Unseen/Cult and any neutrals who seek to do you harm.*

&gt; # [color=purple] The Scout[/color]
&gt; **[color=purple] Unseen Investigative[/color]**  
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Camouflage)** Your abilities do not count as visits and you appear to be Blue Dragon to investigative abilities. You will keep this passive even if your class changes, but it will be lost upon your first attack. 
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Scope Out)** - Target a player.  When night begins, you will be informed of their exact class type and how many uses of each ability they have remaining. (Infinite Uses) 
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (Track)** - Exactly like Observer&#39;s Follow except you get to choose which night you get your results from.  For example, you can choose Night 1 to find who they visited and were visited by on Night 1, even if it&#39;s currently Night 4.  **May be used on dead players.** (1 use) 
&gt;
&gt; **Goal:** *Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals who seek to do you harm.*</description>

            <p>I’m imagining starting a match as Marksman with Trap and Headshot, but feeling useless because I don’t know who I want to kill yet so I just do nothing the first several nights <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/pensive.png?v=9" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Another idea would be that it places a trap that bleeds the next visitor (multiple if more than one person visits on the same night) and tells you who triggered it.</p>
<p>The Scout could be reworked to be similar to the ToS ambusher that can bleed  visitors but needs to get the night right. No more than 3 uses obviously. Maybe only 2?</p>

            <p>Well. Going in line with what it is now we could have it place a trap that triggers on your death. And the strength of the trap is baised on how long you have been targeting them for. And using it on the same person (or maybe a 2nd day ability) removes the trap.</p>
<p>Sooooo. If you die then the trap kills the target.</p>
<p>1 night: Regular attack<br>
2 nights: bypasses healing (not souls)<br>
3: nights: bypasses night immunity<br>
4 nights: bypasses everything (including souls and prevention)</p>

            <p>How would you change Scrutinize to make it Killer?  I intended the class to be Killer but then felt Headshot was too much of a niche ability to be the main focus.  I mean it’s similar to Smite but way more difficult to get a kill with, and also riskier since you can kill BD or good alchs with it.</p>
<p>I will update him to make him occupy immune like you suggest.  I do think though that there should be balance between his passives and the strength of his investigative abilities.  I mean, if he is occupy immune then it’s fairly easy for him to get a streak of several days investigating somebody, so his investigation should be weaker than if he were not occupy immune.</p>
<p>I hope you understand what I’m trying to say.</p>

            <p>I feel like this would be better as a Killer than as an investigative. You would only need to change scrutinize. Maybe also make the occupy immunity permanent?</p>

            <p>This is a really good class!</p>
<p>My only objection would be to put a limit on Headshot so that you can’t use it before Night 3, like the Knight’s Cold Steel. Otherwise, it looks pretty great!</p>

<p><strong>Passive (Camouflage)</strong> Your abilities do not count as visits and you appear to be Blue Dragon to investigative abilities. You will keep this passive even if your class changes, but it will be lost upon your first attack.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability (Scope Out)</strong> - Target a player.  When night begins, you will be informed of their exact class type and how many uses of each ability they have remaining. (Infinite Uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Track)</strong> - Exactly like Observer’s Follow except you get to choose which night you get your results from.  For example, you can choose Night 1 to find who they visited and were visited by on Night 1, even if it’s currently Night 4.  <strong>May be used on dead players.</strong> (1 use)</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> <em>Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals who seek to do you harm.</em></p>
