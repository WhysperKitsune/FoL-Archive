    <title>Change mercenary portrait border colors with the contract faction!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-mercenary-portrait-border-colors-with-the-contract-faction/48615</link>
    <description>**Hi there!**

Quick idea here:

What if the portrait border color of the mercenary changes **depending the current contract faction**?
Its a really little change, but **can help the mercenary on the trials and when she uses rebound**. Also its a good tool if you dont know at all the **class of your contract**.

Thanks for reading! - **Alan**</description>

            <p>That assumption generally helps mercs, though.  People are less likely to attack you or your target if they know you’re a merc, and of course identifying yourself to your target avoids them attacking you or wasting actions on you.  Usually, as a merc, when I whisper my target D1, it’s at least <span class="bbcode-i">partially</span> intended to give everyone the general sense that I’m their merc.</p>
<p>But I don’t think the basic idea in this thread is good.  It should be up to the merc’s target what they want to share - it shouldn’t be revealed to anyone automatically.  The mercenary is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> part of the same faction as their target and shouldn’t be treated that way.</p>

            <p>It would be convinent. I’m personally indifferent, but it does help the Mercenary.</p>

            <p>I mean the problem with that is that what happens if your target is a mastermind or a neutral killer and you do not want your mercenary to know your class. So I see this as a negative thing in 2 ways: A) allows the mercenary to know the faction of their contract when the target my not necessarily, as mentioned above; B) It makes mercenary harder to fake claim which I think is a bad thing.</p>

            <p>How Mercenary games would work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hi im merc<br>
&lt;What am I?<br>
u are neut.<br>
&lt;Correct. Now you’re a confirmed Mercenary. Tell them I’m BD, though. Just to help yourself out.</p>

            <p>This would actually legitimately help with the Mercs as it can get rid of the instant merc assumption everyone has when you whisper to a non-king D1-D2 and on rare occasions D3. Which can actually be useful without the killers knowing theres a Merc ingame.</p>
