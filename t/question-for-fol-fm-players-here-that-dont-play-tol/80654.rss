    <title>Question for FoL / FM players here that don&#39;t play ToL</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/question-for-fol-fm-players-here-that-dont-play-tol/80654</link>
    <description>hey, i have a question for forumers like myself who don&#39;t really play ToL anymore (except under rare circumstances, at least)

do any of you feel that ToL is incredibly bland compared to FoL and FM?
after pouring 1,100 hours into ToL over 2 1/2 years, that&#39;s how i feel, and why I decided to stop playing ToL, stop helping in the discord, and end my quest for attempting guideship

not sure how many other people feel like this, idk</description>

            <blockquote>
<p><em>Throne of Lies</em>  is a 3D online multiplayer game where up to 16 <strong>players use their social deduction skills in a modern take on tabletop games like  <em>Werewolf/Mafia</em></strong>  and set during a time of medieval conflict within a fantasy realm.</p>
<p>The unique Day/Night cycle allows unique encounters with different strategies per phase. <strong>During the day, players discuss their findings and accuse players of treason.</strong> At night, players use their abilities to occupy, spy on, conspire against and even kill the opposing players. In a game of minority vs majority and <strong>where wit is more important than abilities, the good players will accuse and execute the guilty of treason, while the bad guys will manipulate others to turn the good guys against themselves!</strong></p>
<p>While Cult and Unseen players know their allies, <strong>members of the Blue Dragon must be suspicious of every other player to ensure that they don’t fall to an evil plot</strong>. Even the King is suspect in  <em>Throne of Lies</em> , and the enemy’s ability to convert other players to their side means that allegiances are always shifting.</p>
<p>The game concludes when the Blue Dragon faction has disposed of all hostile threats against the kingdom or their enemies have seized control of the  <em>Throne of Lies</em> !</p>

</aside>
<p>I have no idea what this refers to</p>
<p>But I guarantee you I’ve seen “FoL players” and <em>especially</em> FM players do way crazier mechanical plays than whatever this was. There is literally a 0% chance you managed to top all of the mechanical bs and fpsing I’ve seen over the years in one game of <em>FoL</em> of all things.</p>

I never said they are right<br>
But it has some truth regardless. Tol players can do mechanical stuff Fol players never were capable of (my scum win in Fol 20 is a good example of this, the combination of several complicated mechanics)<br>
While I was playing 1000 hours Tol already and still needed to learn how to wallpost in Fol… 5 months. On the other side, I had correct scumreads already in my first few fols, I just wasnt able to explain why.<br>
Most players under 100 hours arent using social stuff in tol tho, so its kinda correct</p>

<p>FM players insult ToL players for not being able to read socially, and ToL players insult FM players for not being able to understand the mechanics</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have never seen an “FM player” unable to grasp ToL mechanics unless they specifically don’t try</p>
<p>Likewise I have never seen a “ToL player” who is, like, incapable of learning to read social cues, and you yourself have stated that once you’ve played 100+ games that most players start focusing more on social cues for their games</p>
<p>I feel like there’s a false dichotomy being drawn here</p>

<p>do any of you feel that ToL is incredibly bland compared to FoL and FM?</p>

<p>Opposite actually<br>
I find FM in general more formulaic<br>
I just find ToL more frustrating</p>
