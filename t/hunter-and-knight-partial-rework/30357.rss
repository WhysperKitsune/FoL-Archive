    <title>Hunter and Knight partial rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hunter-and-knight-partial-rework/30357</link>
    <description>The Knight is my favorite example of the worst kind of majority killer. The vig. The advantages of the Knight over the vig are as follows:

1: Unlimited uses of kill Ability so long as you use it right

2: Something to do when not killing

3: Doesn&#39;t allow for easy trolling

The Hunter is a great version of a really good majority killer. The veteran

1: ONLY kills attackers

2: Can kill directly if your suspect isn&#39;t going for you

The Hunter is mostly fine. The Knight however despite being well executed is based on a fundimentally flawed consept

Solution: Swap the effects of CS and Wolf

New Ability&#39;s are

For Hunter

&gt;Night Ability 1: Wolf companion - Attack Target player. If they are BD the wolf will turn on you and kill you instead. Does not count as a visit. No usable until N3 (3 use)

Bear remains unchanged. Hunter could be made no longer unique to make it more claimable

For Knight

&gt;Cold Steel - Wound Target player. They will die the next night if not healed. Bypasses night Immunity. Not usable until N3. You lose it if a BD dies to it.(Unlimited. 1 day cooldown)

Knight could be made unique to limit how powerful he is. If so I would suggest changing sacrifice too

&gt;Sacrifice - Prevent attacks on your target. If they are attacked then you and the attacker are both given the bleed status and will die in a day. (Unlimited)

Note: This would NOT weaken the Hunter that much. This new wolf is actually even more useful late game than the current one because of its lack of a delay. The Knights would make him better in the early game. The combination of the 2 makes it so that the Hunter is the more claimable one.

Also the CS could be made into a day ability so that the Cult leader could claim him. I would not recommend doing this however s there are better ways of going about it using the enforcer and a posable acolyte.</description>

            <p>This would confirm Knight claims as Knight and Hunter would also be hard to claim due to it being Unique. A single CC is all it takes.</p>
<p>It could also create a Knight/Physician bond much like the King/Alchemist bond everyone knows about. Heal Knight and if Phys is attacked he is guarded and because he’s immune to bleeding he will not be bled and he will heal the Knight. Making the bleed in-healable would just be weaker than the original Knights sacrifice.</p>
<p>Anyways, good idea but it’s shutting down a lot of claim space for evils. Especially making it unique.</p>

            <p>I think it’s a pretty good idea but does sacrifice really need that bleed effect like if it’s a evil player they will just have one more day to live and kill true they can confuse healing classes but I prefer the old one but overall great rework idea</p>

            <p>Not a bad idea, but I feel CS would be too trolly - perhaps adding a ‘If you kill a BD, you may not kill again.’ Condition, or butler suicide?</p>
