    <title>Return of the Acolyte</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/return-of-the-acolyte/38773</link>
    <description>Okay so, the Cult has a class for each specific class type.

Seeker ---- Investigative 
Makes sense

Ritualist ---- Support
Also Makes Sense

Apostle ---- Social
Makes Sense (although Apostle needs some changes)

Invoker ---- Offensive and Killing...
What?

Okay so Invoker as a OFFENSIVE ONLY Cult Class would be amazing. But in all seriousness, the whole point of the Cult&#39;s theme is one class for each class type, and I feel that it needs to be brought back, but as a &quot;Killing&quot; class, the Acolyte would be more like a Knight than a direct killer.



[quote]

**The Acolyte**

Cult Killer (Cannot be a starting Cult Underling)

Converts from Blue Dragon Killers

**_Passives_**

**Blood Offering:**
When you kill a player with Transfusion, you will bleed that night and give the Cult Leader one additional charge of Eradicate when you die because of bleed. (You may be healed.)

(If a Knight Cold Steels a Cult and there is a dead Acolyte and dead Knight, the Cult that was protected will 100% be executed the next day, so this is to avoid that, or at least give more time.)

**_Abilities_**

**Hemorrhage:** (1) (Day)
The Cult Leader&#39;s next Rupture will kill someone that night, not in two nights. The player will see that they are bleeding and hemorrhaged. 

The Cult Leader will be notified when Hemorrhage is activated.

**Transfusion:** (3) (Night)
Choose a player and protect them. Their attackers will die and you will activate Blood Offering. Bypasses night immunity.

**Crimson Curse:** (1) (Night)
Choose a player. If no one is currently bleeding, you will make them bleed. They will die in one night. Bypasses night immunity.

I feel like this would be balanced for a Cult &quot;Killing&quot; class.

Changelog:
Remove Sanguine Shield Passive
Added Blood Offering Passive
Changed Transfusion Details
Rename Sacrifice to Sanguine Shield
Rename Blood Curse to Crimson Curse
More Renaming</description>

            <p>That’ll be easy identify Acolyte, have multiple BD confirm they visited you, and with lots of healers in the current game, chances are all the people who visited you will be healed after you’re lynched.</p>

            <p>Maybe it could work as a day ability instead:<br>
Sanguine shield(1 use) - Cause everyone who visits you tonight to bleed.  They will die in a day unless healed.  Bypasses night immunity.</p>

            <p>That’s a bit too OP for Acolyte though imo, especially when Cult Leader can kill 2 per night in addition to a Crimson Curse, and the Cult is built more for converting than killing.</p>
<p>And 90% of all classes visit.</p>

            <p>I like the idea, but transfusion could use some changes.  Acolyte should be focused on killing, not protection.<br>
Change it to this: Transfusion(2 uses)- Cause everyone who visits and is visited by your target to bleed.  They will die in one night.  Bypasses night immunity.<br>
Blood offering would remain unchanged.</p>

            <p>Or in the case that someone does try to heal someone you hemorrhage bled, and you’re a bleeding acolyte, have ritualist swap you and the bleeder. Bleeder dies and you can transfuse again. ;&gt;</p>
<p>And this will raise the importance the alch has for cult.</p>

</aside>
<p>The reason why the Sellsword can have that Ability is because he is a converted Neutral meaning you aren’t removing BD numbers. Hunter and Knight however are BD. Plus this lets him claim Hunter better.</p>
<p>One suggestion I would do is let him target anyone with transfusion and let him use crimson curse whenever.</p>

            <ol>
<li>I like having a Cult Killer, we need one, in my opinion.</li>
<li>Transfusion + Blood Offering is great, however, since you said that the passive is there to prevent a 100% execution of the CS target, I feel obliged to tell you that if I see an Acolyte dying one day after the knight, I would always 100% execute the CS target. He just gets away if he manages to get healed but then again, I can totally imagine myself refusing to heal someone who bled after a “failed CS” from a now-dead Knight. So, you also got that to worry about. In the end, it’s a good passive but it’s not the failsafe that you suggested, as I see it.</li>
<li>His day ability is awesome, but I feel like it lacks uses since it’s so easy to counter. “Heal me tonight or I’ll die” solves the deal. Either give it more uses or follow my suggestion: Do not warn the player he was affected by this ability. He will know he is bleeding but that’s it. If he, by chance, gets healed that night, that’s great. If not, he’s dead. And then people of the court will suspect of the presence of an Acolyte. That’s the better way to go, I think.</li>
<li>I’d exchange Crimson Curse for Revenge, from the Mercenary skillset. It’s a one use ability, let it kill the target.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s my opinion right there. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I love this suggestion and I think with Burrito’s change it’d be a brilliant addition. It has the knight elements with sanguine shield and with crimson curse it can pose like a hunter, even after conversion. The message should be the same for wolving and crimson curse I think, but that might devalue hunter a lot simultaneously.</p>
<p>If I may make a suggestion of my own I would change transfusion to something that is more in line with a “killing” theme, as opposed to the more support-like character it has now. For instance:</p>
<p><strong>Haemorrhage: (1 use)</strong> (Day)<br>
If the Cult Leader uses Rupture today, it will kill the target within one day.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>Haemorrhage: (1 use)</strong> (Day)<br>
If the Cult Leader uses Rupture today, it will not be heal-able or stopped by bleeding immunity.</p>

            <p>This is about as strong as the sellsword. While this isn’t necessarily a problem (sellsword is balenced after all) you need need to remember that sellsword is converted from a neutral.</p>
<p>Simple solution however: Make crimson curse bleed someone like the Hunter wolf</p>

            <p>Crimson Curse seems too strong imo</p>

            <p>Okay so, the Cult has a class for each specific class type.</p>
<p>Seeker ---- Investigative<br>
Makes sense</p>
<p>Ritualist ---- Support<br>
Also Makes Sense</p>
<p>Apostle ---- Social<br>
Makes Sense (although Apostle needs some changes)</p>
<p>Invoker ---- Offensive and Killing…<br>
What?</p>
<p>Okay so Invoker as a OFFENSIVE ONLY Cult Class would be amazing. But in all seriousness, the whole point of the Cult’s theme is one class for each class type, and I feel that it needs to be brought back, but as a “Killing” class, the Acolyte would be more like a Knight than a direct killer.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Acolyte</strong></p>
<p>Cult Killer (Cannot be a starting Cult Underling)</p>
<p>Converts from Blue Dragon Killers</p>
<p><strong><em>Passives</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Blood Offering:</strong><br>
When you kill a player with Transfusion, you will bleed that night and give the Cult Leader one additional charge of Eradicate when you die because of bleed. (You may be healed.)</p>
<p>(If a Knight Cold Steels a Cult and there is a dead Acolyte and dead Knight, the Cult that was protected will 100% be executed the next day, so this is to avoid that, or at least give more time.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Abilities</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhage:</strong> (1) (Day)<br>
The Cult Leader’s next Rupture will kill someone that night, not in two nights. The player will see that they are bleeding and hemorrhaged.</p>
<p>The Cult Leader will be notified when Hemorrhage is activated.</p>
<p><strong>Transfusion:</strong> (3) (Night)<br>
Choose a player and protect them. Their attackers will die and you will activate Blood Offering. Bypasses night immunity.</p>
<p><strong>Crimson Curse:</strong> (1) (Night)<br>
Choose a player. If no one is currently bleeding, you will make them bleed. They will die in one night. Bypasses night immunity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I feel like this would be balanced for a Cult “Killing” class.</p>
<p>Changelog:<br>
Remove Sanguine Shield Passive<br>
Added Blood Offering Passive<br>
Changed Transfusion Details<br>
Rename Sacrifice to Sanguine Shield<br>
Rename Blood Curse to Crimson Curse<br>
More Renaming</p>
