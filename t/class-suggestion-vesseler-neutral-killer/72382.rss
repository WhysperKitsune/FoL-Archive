    <description>**Vesseler|Neutral Killer**

**Mirror Vessel|Passive**
You will take the abilities&amp;attributions of your chosen vessel for the night.
If you get attacked, you will die and get ressurected as your vessel, 
while your vessel will die within your old body. Bypasses night immunity of the vessel.
(For Ex. You chose d4,#6 as vessel, he is hunter but you are not notified.You only become occupy immune at n4.)
(For Ex. You chose d3,#7 as vessel, he is physician.Princess flirts you and it sees you Support/Social only at n3.)

**Day Ability 1: Choose Vessel|Infinite Uses[1-Day Cooldown]**|
**|Can not target King.|Can&#39;t target the same player twice in a row.|Can&#39;t target classes with killing abilities twice.|**
Choose a vessel for your lifeforce. If you get killed(except Prince or trial), you will die and get ressurected as your vessel, 
while your vessel will die within your old body. If your vessel dies and you get attacked, you will simply die.
This transmittion passes over even in jail, if jailee is not executed.
(So always choose a vessel.)

**Night Ability 1: Sacred Dagger|Infinite Uses|**
Murder somebody with your dagger, killing them eventually.You can also kill yourself(But be sure if your vessel dies or not.)

**Night Ability 2: Vessel Power|Infinite Uses|This can be used with your first night ability.|**
This ability uses the ability of your vessel, only for the night.
&quot;Sacred Dagger&quot; will be disabled for the night if you vesseled any classes with killing abilities.
Instead of giving ability names, it will give the notifications.
&quot;You will swap Target 1 with Target 2.&quot; or &quot;You will force Target 1 to Target 2.&quot;
&quot;You will heal 4 tonight.&quot; or &quot;You will assassinate 13 tonight.&quot;(Note that &quot;Sacred Dagger&quot; is disabled.)
So you won&#39;t exactly understand if the target is either CW/Ritualist, or Drunk/Alcoholic.

**Abilities:**
Physician: Self-Care|Herbalist: Defile
Butler: Serve Wine|Servant: Serve Wine
Hunter: **Wolf Companion***|Poacher: Spike Traps

*: &quot;Sacred Dagger&quot; will be disabled, since they are killing abilities.[This is to prevent multiple kills one night.]
Mystic,Prince,Mastermind,Scorned,Sellsword,Mercenary,Sheriff,Paladin can be used as vessels, 
but you won&#39;t have their ability when they are vessels.

**Tips|**
You can only cover yourself by vesseling a person, so if the court is suspicious of you, you should vessel for the night, 
since you can&#39;t choose vessel the other day and attributes of the vessel will wear out at one night.

taught all voodoo and witchcraft she knew to him/her. He/She now arrives at the court of Adiart, only to slaughter who shall not obey him/her.</description>

            <p>Once I get home I can do a full read(since my phone screen is tiny)</p>
