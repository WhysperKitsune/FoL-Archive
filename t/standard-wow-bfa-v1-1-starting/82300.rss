    <title>[Standard] WoW:BfA v1.1 - Starting</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/standard-wow-bfa-v1-1-starting/82300</link>
    <description>**Welcome to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth v2!**

Hosted by @KyoDaz

This setup follows simple forum rules

1. https://toli.es/rules
2. https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926/

The setup will start once 16 players have signed up. Backups, spectators and co-hosts are appreciated.

**Gameplay**

Days will be 48 hours long, or shorter if someone is jettisoned.
Nights will be 24 hours long or until everyone has submitted their actions.
Actions are done by messaging me.
Players receive both a class and race. The race determines your alignment.
You may choose one specialization once you receive your class. This cannot be changed.
The informed minority are aware of the faction superpower’s classcard and identity.
The informed minority have a 24/7 day and night chat.
The informed minority win once they outnumber the uninformed majority.
The informed minority do not have a faction kill.
If the faction superpower dies the outnumbered faction will be able to kill every odd night.
Your class, specialization and race will be revealed upon flip.
Positive effects are anything that are mostly beneficial to a player such as visit prevention or healing.
Negative effects are anything that are mostly harmful to a player such as occupation or redirection.
Delayed abilities are ninja.
There will be a period of silence once all of the classcards have been dealt. This is to enable players to select pre-game things such as specializations.

**Executions**

To jettison someone say &quot;**/jettison [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
There will be a day one jettison.
Executions end the day.
Executions will be majority + plurality.

**After The Night**

Only investigative abilities will return feedback. It will either be a result or &#39;You could not investigate your target.&#39;

**To Join**

To join, please &#39;**/in**&#39;

Alternate accounts will be allowed in WoW:BfA v2. You must however inform me of your identity beforehand and also submit an application directly to @Arete
 
Identity of alternate accounts will never be revealed to anyone unless moderator intervention is required and a behavioural rule is broken or a major game rule is broken such as intentional integrity breaches.
This will always be done after the game except in extreme circumstances.

If you are unsure about my custom policy message me. Otherwise questions about the program as a whole should go in private messages with a moderator or preferably [here](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/new-alternate-account-applications/82086).
