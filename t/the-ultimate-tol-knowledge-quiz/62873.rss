    <title>The Ultimate ToL Knowledge Quiz!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-ultimate-tol-knowledge-quiz/62873</link>
    <description>As the title suggests, I thought I&#39;d do this fun little topic where I post a ToL knowledge quiz that I&#39;ve prepared by myself. Starting slow and easy, the difficulty will surely ramp up by the end. Feel free to reply with answers to every single question and I will reply with your result! Some answers will be subject to my personal judgement because there can be multiple answers to one question. All questions are based on classic mode, not casual mode. I may have made mistakes. Make sure not to use the Wiki or the in-game class cards. That would be cheating!

1. How many Cult members can there be alive at one time?
2. How many Blue Dragon classes are immune to conversion by default? Which ones?
3. List all Neutral Killers currently available in the game.
4. Is there a way to successfully communicate with living players while dead? If so, how? (Without using Discord...)
5. How many different types of King can there be in a single game?
6. There are only two players alive, BD King with 1 guard available and Reaper with 5 souls. The day has just started. Is it, hypothetically, possible for the Reaper to win with optimal play from the King? Is it impossible to answer this question for some reason? Why?
7. List 4 Blue Dragon Classes that are occupy immune.
8. The Unseen have three members alive - The Mastermind, The Assassin and The Servant. It is Night 3. The Mastermind has been jailed by Prince and executed. At the start of Day 4, what is the current state of the Unseen? What are their classes?
9. The Possessor used his ability to possess the King. The King, at that moment, used his Order of Execution on the Posessor. What happened?
10. The Noble uses his gossip ability on Prince. The Prince is visited by the Mastermind (conversion), the Drunk (debauchery) and the Aristocrat (frame). What will the Noble see? (Does not have to be exact wording)
11. The evil faction is Unseen. It is Night 1. The Princess uses her flirting ability on a non-Unseen player. The result says &quot;killer/offensive&quot;. List ALL possible classes that can come up this way.
12. The Unseen have three members, The Mastermind, The Assassin and The Enforcer. Is it possible for the Assassin to kill the Mastermind? If so, how?
13. The King is a BD King. It is Night 2. The King uses his Order of Execution on a randomly chosen player. Together with the king, before the execution, there are 14 players alive. Considering the maximum amount of Neutral classes exist, is this decision mathematically correct? Consider both possibilities - The Mastermind has successfully converted Night 1 or failed to do so. Discard any possibility of heals or prevention.
14. The Mercenary has [11] as his target. At some point in the game, The Mercenary receives the message &quot;You were killed while guarding [11].&quot;. What happened? Is it possible to determine the class of the target?
15. Two players, [3] and [8] are both Drunks. They use Happy Hour on each other. What happens?
16. Consider any possible setup of classes. Assume that the only living neutral classes are the Neutral Killer and a random amount of Mercenaries. Mercenaries vote with their target. There are 13 players alive. If all the evil players knew each other&#39;s classes, is it possible for them to have the voting majority? What&#39;s the maximum amount of votes the evils can have in this situation?
17. There are four living players - The Reaper, The Assassin, The Blue Dragon King and The Scorned who has already won AND is reaped. Every player knows the class of every other player. The Reaper has 3 souls available. The Assassin is out of Nightshade. The King is not the starting king. The King has 3 guards. The Night has just started. Can The Reaper win? Can the Unseen win? Can the Blue Dragon win? Can it be a draw? Assume that The Assassin will attack The Reaper every single time he can. Otherwise, assume optimal play.
18. List all possible classes that can be immune to bleeding/poisoning without the use of Physician&#39;s Innoculate. Consider conversions and players stepping up as The King.
19. You were killed while visiting The Hunter. Your were The Physician. What could have happened? Consider every possibility.
20. How many classes can talk at night?

Good luck, everyone! If this is the wrong category then please move this thread or order me to do so. Have fun.

<li>
<p>The Assassin is promoted to Mastermind. The Servant is promoted to Assassin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The King’s Order Execution bypasses the possessor’s death immunity. The Possessor (for some unwritten rule) is therefore unable to jump. And dies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Number] is immune. This could be due to a Court Wizard or they are occupy immune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assassin. Reaper. Possessor. Sorcerer. Knight. Drunk. Butler. Hunter. (At the point of writing) will show up as Killer/Offensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While you may think that redirection is possible, it unfortunately is not. It is a guaranteed kill, and bypasses all things, redirection included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a 8/14 chance of hitting a BD. Neutrals may be in favour of BD too. Thus, Yolo Exeing N2 is not recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aha, Tricky Tricky. <em>Your target attempted to attack someone, but hit a knight. You gave your life instead.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One will get happy houred [8] while the other doesnt. The one higher up on the list [lower number] has a higher priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be a Max of 2 mercs. The most they can have is 6 votes, assuming Cult. They will not have voting majority UNLESS the Neutral Killer votes with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming optimal play, The reaper will reap the assassin, and pretend reaped after that. Thats by far the only way for Reaper to win, because there is no way for Unseen to win unless the Reaper E.Reaps the King for some reason. The BD King can win, but only through the actions of others.</p>

            <p>I assumed your answer to 19 as correct, because you specified even more reasons that came to my mind initially, so definitely correct!</p>

            <p>Okay, it would seem you have 13 correct answers out of 20. A fairly good score! Your answer to 18 is PERFECT except for Psycho King, he can’t be immune - Sorcerer becomes EK. Either way, you are definitely the closest of all to answering this correctly, well played sir!</p>

            <p>Poss has 2 Possablely reasons so that’s one. And also you didn’t specify that visiting the Hunter was actually the cause of death so direct kills would qualify too.</p>
