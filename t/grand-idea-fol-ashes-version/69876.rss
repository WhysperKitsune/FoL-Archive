    <title>Grand Idea FoL - Ashe&#39;s Version</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/grand-idea-fol-ashes-version/69876</link>
    <description>The last thread is crazy and inconsistent, so here&#39;s this one, with things how I like it (I&#39;m not removing the old thread or anything btw, just making a personalized one. Feel free to use both or one or the other).

# Rules:
Every post here must contain a class. It could be an existing one or something new. If the class is an existing FoL class, the name is simply enough to qualify it. If it is a class that is already in this thread, put down the name hyperlinked to the post in this thread that includes its class card. Otherwise, you MUST provide a class card, preferably using [this class card generator](http://puu.sh/Ax2nE/391a6a63ea.html).

Classes must adhere to [this format](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/47799) (Although for **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon[/color]** classes, the objective can instead read &quot;*Your objective is to defeat the scum faction and any neutrals that seek to do you harm*&quot;). A class must have at the very least a name, faction, type and win condition (include the win condition even when it&#39;s obvious, such as if they are Blue Dragon).

Include the post number of your post in its description. A post number may only cover one class + any of its conversions.

**[color=red]Classes can NOT prevent others from appearing in a game by being rolled.[/color]** 
**[color=red]You can not change any aspect of an existing post in a future post.[/color]**
**[color=red]Consecutive duplicate posts of the same class are banned unless that class is Vanilla Town.[/color]**

# Special FoL Specific Rules:

If a converted class is not given, Neutrals and scum faction classes should automatically be considered immune, and Blue Dragon should be considered convertable, with their unseen version having the same abilities that their Blue Dragon form does.

Converted classes can spawn at the start of a game.

There is no limit to the number of factions that can appear.

The King can be any faction of those that appear in the game, even new ones. If a Buttered Popcorn faction member is rolled, you can have a Buttered Popcorn King. The chance for each individual King to appear is always the same as any other King.

# Host Notes:
The host has the right to reject/reroll any class if they so wish.

GIFoL games fall under SFoL.
