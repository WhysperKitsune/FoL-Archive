    <title>Neuts give points if alive to winning team</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neuts-give-points-if-alive-to-winning-team/24205</link>
    <description>Currently many people will try to kill all neut claims regardless of what they are, and there is no incentive not to. This makes it very difficult to win as the alchemist for instance. 

Also, evil neut classes need to claim a BD role, which is a high risk bluff. If they could claim a survival neut without immediately being killed because &quot;neuts out&quot;, then they&#39;d have another, possibly better, option in some circumstances.

So, my solution is to incentivize not killing neuts for the hell of it by giving the winning team some extra points/coins for each neut still alive at the end. Obviously NK would need to die for anyone else to win, but this also gives the side effect of giving players another reason not to kill the fool for instance. Also, players would need to make a more difficult choice of killing a neut in case they might vote against their team or not killing them for more points, giving more depth to decision making regarding neuts.

            <p>If you give people the ability to make more gold doing one thing, they will do that thing.</p>
<p>Isn’t that the whole idea here? Effect people’s decision making by offering gold for a particular strategy? If it didn’t, this whole idea would be pointless</p>

<p>no it wouldn’t, you obviously don’t realize how much people like gold</p>

<p>I’ll put my double-blind, peer-reviewed study up against yours.</p>
<p>Anyway, my other point was that external incentives are not a healthy way to game-balance.</p>

            <p>Technically, their aim could be to make a situation where it’s better for the neuts to side with bd, which is not gamethrowing, even if they were siding with evil earlier on<br>
I.e. just because it’s a good play, like executing scum-teamed neutrals, doesn’t mean it’s the only non-gamethrowing play</p>

            <p>While I agree that, in theory, players should only vote out neuts if it’s beneficial to their team. In practice, players aren’t 100% logical. In almost every game I’ve played, claiming alc or merc to a prince will immediately get you executed or when claiming it to the king, god forbid they’re a good king, or you’ll be put up immediately half of the time because <span class="hashtag">#nuetsout</span>.</p>
<p>While I beleive, in a perfect world, players will act intelligently and vote based on what helps their team the most and only try to vote out malicious neuts, casual players will gladly waste executes on benign neuts even when there are better options to explore. Adding an incentive against indirectly playing poorly should help remove this aggressive mindset.</p>
<p>Also, obviously you wouldn’t get any extra gold if your team loses. Winning should still be the priority. This is just to avoid killing neuts off early on “because neuts”.</p>

            <p>I actually really like this. It’s such a minor bump that it wouldn’t destabilize any balancing issues and it gives a little more to consider when that alche claim is on the table. 5 to 10 extra gold is a fair compensation for keeping the true neuts around. This could even be a passive added to the true neuts like alche and merc and scorn “if you win, all other winners get an additional 10 gold” kind of thing so it’s visible on the class card</p>

            <p>I don’t think that would work or be healthy.  If someone thinks it improves their chance to win by killing a neut, that would trump any incentive to get extra gold.</p>
<p>Alchs are useful to BD because they heal, are not convertable, and soak up poison/bleeding/attacks.  That should be incentive enough to keep legitimate alch claims alive.</p>
<p>Killing/sparing neuts should be based on calculation of benefit to winning.  If that calculation leads to neuts out, then either players are playing bad or classes need to be changed.</p>

            <p>no. If an alch is teaming with unseen, it is a good play to kill them. Don’t incentivize gamethrowing</p>
