    <title>[Minor Rework] King&#39;s Day role</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/minor-rework-kings-day-role/73273</link>
    <description>Right now King plays very straightforward during the day that people have started to figure them out. I have drafted a simple formula for it:

&gt; King doesn&#39;t use finger? They&#39;re evil.

This applies to almost every case. King upping a non-claimer without finger? He&#39;s evil because he could be upping Prince. Worried of Possessor? Use finger. With the fear of evil kings growing and the infinite use of finger, the King is practically obligated to use it every single time.

**What would be the solution to this?**

One thing I have in mind is making King&#39;s finger a passive ability for the King, making every King vote count for two (or maybe even three) votes. No longer King would be restricted to using finger or a thumb, and thus would be able to give the L to all possible Princes. This would also free up a day ability slot for any future King buffs (although we shouldn&#39;t really give a crap about two ability slot maximums).

**What would be the outcome of this?**

* People would be less inclined to immediately follow the King up on putting someone up without reason.
* Possessor would not be immediately blown by his inability to finger
* King would be able to win certain 1v2 situations if he has abilities available (which in turn encourages killing the King as evils if required).
* If needed, a new day ability can be given to the King.

**What problems would this pose?**
* King without Decide Fate versus two enemies turns into a clicking contest. *Possible solution: Make King lose second vote if he has already slammed.*
* King versus Possessor + 1 turns into a clicking contest. *Possible solution: Choose which one should win at those moments and stick with it. Let one of them vote earlier. (I think there&#39;s a predecessor to letting Possessor vote instantly, and since Possessor may want to pretend to be force voted, I think he should be allowed to vote instantly when the day starts. Alternatively you could let King win this situation since jumping into Kings without consequences would be a huge buff for Possessors.)*

In the end, I think the King has become mechanically a bit stale. Right now he&#39;s there to take whispers and people are just blindly following them. Any action the King does is done out of necessity, rather than choice. Giving them more power (and therefore making him a little more feared) would make people think a little more critically and make their own decisions.

*I am perfectly aware that this would break EK win rates for the first week after the patch, but I feel like people would learn quickly to not follow King blindly.*</description>

Another solution:  Reduce royal finger to 2 uses, and make it so it instantly puts target player on trial.</p>

            <p>I wanted it to be a flavor tbh. But your way of resolving it makes sense, because it wouldn’t change the way we do it now, 2v1 would be a loss for EK unless mislynch.</p>

<p>In that world, king can’t win 1v1 (unless he has DF), so it would have to be resolved by a stalemate breaker.</p>

            <p>No because Prince VS EK isn’t stalemate if EK still has the double vote.</p>
<p>A stalemate breaker should not make someone who would have won loose</p>

            <p>I said that this stalemate breaker would resolve the situation where it’s EK vs 2 BD and King uses slam to make it 1v1. Make a couple BD classes win regardless of this, because they’re “powerful”. You get what I mean, right?</p>

            <p>Meaning that a King that hasn’t used DF is only ever in a stalemate with a Hunter. which should be a BD win</p>

            <p>Or we could implement a stalemate breaker, but that’s very complicated and would not be met with approval I imagine.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Prince vs EK = BD wins<br>
Hunter vs EK = BD wins<br>
Butler vs EK = BD wins (because he can “poison” him, even if he can’t, get it?)</p>
<p>Some other “flavor” examples can be added I guess.<br>
This is a stalemate breaker for when king would have lost his 2-votes passive and it’d be a EK vs 1 BD scenario.</p>
