    <title>Whisper meta costs</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/whisper-meta-costs/51487</link>
    <description>The whisper meta currently in play needs some sort of cost.  I&#39;ve seen streamers putting suggestions out already, and I might have missed some here too.

Examples:
no whispers in first 2 or 3 days
each whisper has a cool down of 5 to 10 secs across the Court, ie the next whisper isn&#39;t available until the CD ends from **any** player
Noble can eavesdrop more than one target (maid stands between 2 players at once)
visible whispers don&#39;t remain in chat history at the end of day - they default to &quot;X whispered to Y&quot;

Any others?

            <p>Not really.  The first issue is that there is no guarantee that there will even be a noble to become the apostle etc.  The second is that there is a low probability a noble would be converted early enough to hear the whisper meta whispers.  (1 in 14 n1, 1 in 13 n2 etc, or 1 in 7, 2 in 13 if there’s 2).  The third is that the whisper meta takes away the ability for players to switch up their claim as the game evolves.  It’s useless having the same info as the BD/neut king if the king will simply expose where multiple claims lie and vote people up on that basis as opposed to bona fide investigative results.</p>
<p>If N2 a sheriff dies and you claimed sheriff, your cover is already half-blown.  You can’t switch your cover to obs for instance, if you were forced to whisper a claim D2.  Being able to hear the whispers won’t change that problem.</p>
<p>UN/CU and NK won’t even have the chance to share the info they learn, let alone act on it.</p>

            <p>I don’t agree with the more drastic changes suggested here; I think whispering (even whispering to the king) is interesting and I’m against anything that would remove it entirely or make it completely useless.  That would decrease the depth of the game, which isn’t desirable unless we have no other choice.</p>
<p>One option is to give evils more ability to hear whispers.  I suggested giving Aristocrats / Apostles the ability to spy on the king in another post.  In fact, it could be expanded to just let them hear <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> whispers, couldn’t it?</p>

            <p>I had a hilarious idea for a counter-play ability - Night of the Long Knives - Attack anyone who whispered during the day.</p>
<p>If the whisper ability was used in line with the design concept, it would be possible to have knights defend, physicians to heal, or observers to follow investigative classes that had whispered.</p>
<p>As it’s being used in the meta, 3/4 of the players in the game would be dead by day 3.</p>
<p>You never know.  They might learn it’s not such a good idea.</p>
<p>If we consider the problem from a real-world point of view, the king would be up the dais on his throne and would be asked if they could grant an audience, or a messenger would approach, and an advisor or two would be at their side.  Everybody else would be in the main room.  He wouldn’t hear the whispers, and everybody would overhear them if anyone tried.</p>
<p>Maybe the classes appropriate should have a “Request Audience” ability and, if granted, they could whisper with the king, and then be released back to the main room (conceptually).  The advisors would be able to hear what was said but not have permission to join in (prince, noble/its converted equivs) for example, OR the king could opt to choose who the advisors were).  I could imagine the impact of that being the king demand the prince or his favoured class to out themselves though if it was literally as I described it, which is again not what we want to happen.</p>

            <p>The idea is that a few BD Social classes would have whispering enabled.</p>
<p>This would obviously take a lot of work to get right, but maybe I’ll sit down and hash out the details sometime.</p>

            <p>Maybe just Aristo/Illus/Apostle, and allow for one return message.</p>
<p>And Possessor. Possibly allow him to have a day ability that allows you to whisper the target you controlled the previous night. (would up his fake claim space)</p>
<p>Having a full day chat might tilt the game too heavily in Unseen/Cult’s favor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real issue is that there’s really not a middle ground between whispers being too risky and rarely used and not being risky enough and used as the predominant form of important communication. It’s one of the reasons I dislike whispering as a whole, as you either have whisper games as the standard meta or they’re rarely used for anything important. Neither situation is desirable from a game design perspective, so they’re probably best left out altogether in my opinion.</p>

<p>Yes. This is more like how we should go about it (this alone will not be enough however). Noble is a little weak and if we nerf the whisper king meta then we will need to buff the Noble anyway to keep him strong.</p>

<p>No. This just rewards players who obsessively record everything and punishes slow typers and people who might look away for a second. Any mechanic that rely’s on Memory or Speed is usually a bad idea (hence why Mental Blur gets so much flack).</p>

            <p>I just listed some counters, and I get that there are some in place. Your post seemed to generalize the idea that good strategies don’t need counterplay, which is what I was responding to.</p>
<p>As for whether this particular case needs any, that’s a matter for individual opinion (well, and Boslof’s stats).</p>

            <p>There is already some counters, for example, you fake logs which is a core part of being evil and surviving even without this meta strat. Don’t see why more counters need to be added tbh.</p>

            <p>Because why the heck would you leave a strong strategy with no counterplay?</p>
<p>Whether it needs to be nerfed or not is a question, but there should always be counterplay. In this case, converted Social classes and the possibility of an Evil King are some of the things the scum have going for them in these scenarios.</p>

            <p>The King whisper meta is a very good strategy imo, I don’t understand the reasoning behind adding a counter to this strategy.</p>

            <p>Eh</p>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of whispers existing whatsoever, so whisper-based metas have always felt really boring, especially when whoever RNG decides is King or whatever basically controls the entire early-game flow.</p>
<p>I expect you’ll get bored of this sooner or later.</p>

            <p>My experience is that king is insisting on everyone whispering claims D2 in 4 out of 5 games.  That has an impact on balance.  On D2, Un or Cult are listening for clues to check that their cover is reasonable.  To be forced to blind claim puts them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>King just writes it all down, finds where he has too many claims and ups them both (or more), asking the prince to jail any survivor if an inno gets killed.</p>
<p>This can potentially happen without a single BD investigative result being reported to the king.  He’s acting on the whispers and the whispers alone in some cases.</p>
<p>in one game, a BD king upped someone day 2 for not whispering, that turned out to be a princess, and blind exed another at night.  Sometimes, BD don’t want to claim or be forced to - Prince or Hunter for instance - because they’re not sure of the king’s own alignment by that point.</p>
<p>So, that’s another issue created by this meta that could be addressed with a relatively simple whisper cost.</p>
<p>So, let’s start tracking games to see how many legit claims are being exed with no investigations to indicate any guilt, and if the problem is serious or minor.</p>
<p>Some common ones are: knight, princess, hunter, and CW.</p>
<p>“Knight claim?  Exe this”<br>
“CW? 2018 claim lol”</p>
<p>being fairly common reactions.</p>
<p>Granted, this is my gut feeling and I haven’t gathered hard data on it yet myself, but we can, and it’s easy to see how much this meta is impacting balance.</p>
<p>My prediction is that it will be close to, if not actually, game-breaking.</p>
<p>I didn’t argue for removing whispers btw, only making them have some sort of cost to them.</p>

            <p>The whisper meta isn’t bad. It makes Noble very useful, for one.</p>
<p>I see no harm in it, and things to gain from it.</p>
