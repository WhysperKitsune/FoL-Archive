    <title>What&#39;s the most OP scum ability?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/whats-the-most-op-scum-ability/79971</link>
    <description>Throughout all of Throne of Lies history (not forum of lies) in your opinion what is the most broken scum ability that has ever existed and why?

Don&#39;t count Evil King for these purposes because EK has inherent OP qualities that make it a boring answer.

If the ability is a Killing ability I would also be curious about the most OP non-killing scum ability specifically as well.</description>

            <p>No. Current mindwarp will give invests framed results but wont frame targets.</p>
<p>Old mindwarp will give flipped results. Meaning that an invest will see scum as NS and non-scum as scum. But also effects non-invests, such as making butler think that the target was immune when they weren’t, or making the physician think their target was attacked.</p>
