            <p>In Town of Salem, Retributionist can confirm up to four town members and can revive the most powerful roles in the game. It confirms the retributionist, the revived town, and any mediums that exist, preventing evils from fake claiming it. Imagine having a fourth of court being automatically confirmed, with other auto-confirming classes.</p>
<p>Retributionist is still useful as it confirms a spot in the limited rolelist and your vote can still be the winning factor. It’s sometimes referred to as RetriBrokenist.</p>
<p>That’s my argument. Also known as; This is way too OP. This and Retributionist are the complete opposite of weak and “sucky” and terrible.</p>
<p>Also, the dead can say information like who an evil is or if the psychic has been converted.</p>

            <p>I’ve played Town of Salem and Retributionist sucks since it’s one shot and then you do nothing. Also the revealing part.</p>

            <p>This is an awful idea … I wasn’t playing this game when Priest was there, but in Town of Salem it’s OP because it confirms TWO BLUE DRAGON to the ENTIRE COURT.  On top of raising someone from the dead …</p>
