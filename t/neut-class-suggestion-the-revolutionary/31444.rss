    <title>Neut Class Suggestion: &quot;The Revolutionary&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neut-class-suggestion-the-revolutionary/31444</link>
    <description>just pulled this idea out of my ass

Goal of the class is to see all classes with royal blood dead by the end of the game.

Abilities: at night, can check to see if class has royal blood. if he finds a bd with royal blood, it tells the unseen the next night, and since unseen wants prince dead as quick as possible, they&#39;ll probably target them

alternatively, if the revolutionary finds a converted unseen with royal blood, it tells the sheriff, who will then out them the next day. 

lastly, has day ability, &quot;revolution&quot;, if all royal bloods besides king are dead, the revolutionary can activate this ability, and the next night the revolutionary bypasses guards/any protection and kills the king, and then revolutionary wins. 

this gives a big incentive for neut kings to want to see the revolutionary dead</description>

            <p>Um… No? Only 2 Unseen at the start of the game. That or 2 cult.</p>
<p>And if you add a king and 2 other Neuts then it only adds up to 15</p>

            <p>how about:<br>
a 1/2 use night ability that when used:<br>
checks if all royals are dead, if they are, revolutionary wins, otherwise the ability fails, and if it runs out of uses, the revolutionary loses</p>
<p>or have it be one use and kill the revolutionary if it fails</p>

            <p>i know, the idea is that the revolutionary’s goal after it kills any royal bloods is to kill whoever is the current king, regardless of whether they were royal blood or not</p>
