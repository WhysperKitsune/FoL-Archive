    <description>**Throne of Lies: The Online Game of Deceit**, or **ToL**, is an online multiplayer video game, heavily inspired by [Werewolf/Mafia (WWM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) and[ Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). ToL was created with Unity (game engine) in 3D with C#.

There will be 3 phases, including the start phase:

* Start Game
* Day
* Night

There will also be 3 factions:

* Blue Dragon (good)
* Black Rose (bad)
* Neutral (chaotic)

We will start with just 1 mode with 15 roles, just called Standard Mode, for now.

Ultimately, the game objective is to discover who has committed treason and execute them before they murder you at night. Some special roles may have exceptions to this or their own objectives, entirely.</description>
