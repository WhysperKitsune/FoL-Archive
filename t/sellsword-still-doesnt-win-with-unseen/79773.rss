    <title>Sellsword still doesnt win with Unseen</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sellsword-still-doesnt-win-with-unseen/79773</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was Sellsword, Unseen won the game, I lost. For the record, I was dead at the end of the game, if that matters.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to win alongside the Unseen.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Play as Sellsword, perhaps die? When Unseen wins bug is reproduced.

#### Comments:
I don&#39;t know if this also affects cult or NK wins. I&#39;d assume so, but don&#39;t have actual ingame experience.</description>

            <p>I assume you don’t still have logs for this since it was a few days ago, but the bug is known.</p>
<p>I believe Sellsword only wins if they additionally live, which should be fixed in the next patch.</p>

            <p>I should add that this also applies to the Inquisitor. This happens even if he isn’t dead at the end of the game.</p>
