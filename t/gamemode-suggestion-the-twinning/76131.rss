    <title>[Gamemode suggestion] The Twinning</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/gamemode-suggestion-the-twinning/76131</link>
    <description>(Just so you know, I was considering something like this as a forum match, so I really want suggestions from moderators in particular.)

&gt;# [color=White]White Soul[/color] :crossed_swords: :shield:  
&gt;*Your soul is bound inextricably to [x], the dark soul. They are vile, but you can’t do anything about it.*
&gt;**Cleanse Soul (Passive) -** You share a private chat with [x]. You cannot directly visit [x], and you are both immune to all forms of attacks. If you lose this bond, you will lose this passive. You cannot be executed, however all players will know you are a Soul if execution is attempted.
&gt;**Test of Purity (day ability) -** Heal a player, curing them of all negative effects. This can be bypassed by ‘Vile Purge.’ (3 uses)
&gt;**Fight Back (night ability) -** Attack the dark soul directly. Cannot be used while *Cleanse soul* is active, nor the day afterwards. Bypasses all forms of defence (1 use).
&gt;**Prevent (night ability) -** Select a player. If successful in visiting the same target as the Dark Soul, their visit will be rendered null - Infinite Uses.
&gt;*Goal: Survive without the Dark Soul.*

&gt;# [color=dimgray]Dark Soul[/color] :crossed_swords: :shield:  
&gt;*Your soul is bound inextricably to [x], the White Soul. They’re useless, but they’re something to use, nothing more.*
&gt;**Dark Rendering (Passive) -** You share a private chat with [x]. You cannot directly visit [x], and you are both immune to all forms of attacks. If you lose this bond, you will lose this passive. You are unable to be executed, however all players will know you are a Soul if execution is attempted.
&gt;**Vile Purge (Day ability) -** Poison a player, causing them to die tomorrow night unless healed. They will be alerted (3 uses)
&gt;**Kiss of death (Night ability) -** Attack a player, killing them if not healed. 1 night cooldown - Infinite Uses.
&gt;**Join Us (Night ability) -** Convert a player to evil. 1 night cooldown, cannot be done night one (3 uses)
*Goal: Survive without the White Soul.*

*note: those converted to evil by **Join us** don’t share a private chat with the Souls.*

&gt;# [color=Skyblue]Magician[/color]
&gt;*You are a skilled practitioner in the art of magic.*
&gt;**Magical Escape (Passive) -** Immune to death at night. You lose this passive after you are first attacked.
&gt;**Exhaustion Spell (day ability) -** Cause a player to fall asleep tonight, occupying their action. This doesn’t work on the Souls (2 uses)
&gt;**Look Inside (night ability) -** Learn if a player is a Soul, or converted - Infinite Uses.
&gt;**Shield Thyself (night ability) -** Protect a player from all attacks tonight. Can select yourself - Infinite Uses.
&gt;*Goal: Survive to kill the Dark Soul and all that support it.*

&gt;# [color=Skyblue]Doctor[/color]
&gt;*You are a medical professional who treats others.*
&gt;**Blood (Passive) -** If someone dies at night, you will know what class killed them, or if they committed suicide.
&gt;**Lethal (day ability) -** Poison a player. They will die tonight if not treated. They will be alerted (1 use)
&gt;**Medical Care (night ability) -** Heal a player, granting death immunity to them tonight - Infinite Uses.
&gt;**Save Thyself (night ability) -** Heal yourself, granting death immunity tonight (1 use)
&gt;*Goal: Survive to kill the Dark Soul and all that support it.*

&gt;# [color=Skyblue]Officer[/color]
&gt;*The first responder on scene.*
&gt;**Stand Down (Passive) -** Your first attack bypasses death immunity. Excludes Soul immunity.
&gt;**Respond (day ability) -** Learn The last action a player did (2 uses)
&gt;**Shoot (night ability) -** Attack a player. If you kill a Town, you will commit suicide (3 uses)
&gt;*Goal: Survive to kill the Dark Soul and all that support it.*

Ah. This is the warlocks ability though;
&gt;# [color=Gray]Warlock (Neutral)[/color]
&gt;**Blue Sparks (Passive) -** If you are killed, your attacker will become the Warlock. A Soul cannot replace your class, so if a soul kills you, no one will be the Warlock. If lynched, a voter will become the Warlock.
&gt;**Harbringer (Day ability) -** Learn if a player is a Soul. Results cannot be prevented or changed by any means - Infinite Uses.
&gt;**Split Personality (Night ability) -** Select a player found by the Harbringer ability. If both Souls are selected, their bond will be broken (2 uses)
***Goal -** Survive to kill ever soul, doesn’t matter which.*
