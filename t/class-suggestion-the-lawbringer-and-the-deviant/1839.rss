    <title>[Class suggestion] The Lawbringer and The Deviant</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-lawbringer-and-the-deviant/1839</link>
    <description>So these roles were inspired by somebody on feedback. Bear in mind that the premise behind this was purely to make a conversion target that would be based on other peoples actions and predicting them. This role will be unique but convertible.

Lawbringer:

Faction: Blue dragon (Killing)

Passive (Reclusion) : If you should vote guilty on a blue dragon member during trial you will not be able to talk untill after the end of the following day.

Day Ability(1 every day) : Choose one player. Should they vote another player today it will unlock the use of your night abilities on that player

Night abilities:

1.Punish (Infinite): The player who voted will be unable to vote or use any day abilities they may have the next day

2.Remove: (Infinite): The player will be unable to participate in tommorow&#39;s conversation and will be limited to one vote which will be used should the player rescind not allowing them to vote again.

3.Banish(1): The player will die but be revived in three days time. Their role will be revealed for the duration.


And their Converted role: The Deviant

Passive: If you vote guilty on a blue dragon member you may choose one player and remove their tongue for a day making them unable to use vowels in their speech.

Day Ability: Choose one player. Should they vote a member of the unseen today this unlocks your night abilities for use on that player

Night abilities: 

1. Plot (Infinite): Have a random player not of the unseen receive a message that the affected player visited the princess ,that they attempted to turn them into a knight or that their abilities have been replaced by fireworks.

2. Scheme (infinite): Every player except the target receives a letter of your writing. 

3. Murder (2): Kill the player affected by the day ability</description>
