            <p>So whats the point of the new king?<br>
I dont get it, it’s worst then the royal blood check, and now king wont die due to guards so bd should just exe every king d4 unless they got a good lead,</p>
<p>King need a social ability, and prevnting from voting doesn’t help bd more then its help cult/unseen.</p>

            <p>Honestly though, the Casual mode, funnily enough, has the potential to be much more competitive than the “base” game.</p>
<p>It will be a much cleaner experience, and I have a feeling that I will enjoy it much more. Especially with no Fool or new Noble.</p>

            <p>Oh boy. My initial reaction to this patch was that of dismay. But I’m willing to wait and see - I tend to overreact and think changes will be a bigger deal than they end up being in reality. That being said:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I argued strongly against splitting the player base and will continue to do so until proven wrong. I think it’s <strong>bad</strong> for the community to split ‘serious’ players with people playing for fun. Although that’s not the intent of Casual, it’s true that it’s essentially an easy mode. For the hard or ‘serious’ mode, an increase in competitiveness --&gt; caring more about winning --&gt; more rage at bad plays --&gt; less fun/enjoyable to play. Also, I think it’s a <em>positive</em> to put new players in the same setting as more experienced players - I enjoy giving tips to newbies and would like to have that opportunity while still playing a complex game. I don’t want to see the kind of “Go back to Casual” insults that infest ToS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t see how the King is very relevant without Allies, and I don’t see why it needed to be removed entirely (couldn’t we have just made Neutrals not show up in the check, similar to Sheriff?). What incentive does the BD have to let the King lead early game, or to claim to him? What’s the incentive not to execute the King at the earliest opportunity? He has to have something to offer the BD either on his own, or through pressure/suspicion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distract change is <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/star_struck.png?v=9" title=":star_struck:" class="emoji" alt=":star_struck:">!  Really looking forward to seeing, making, and suffering under these plays. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Late game order is very strong, especially when combined with kings double vote. It is not as powerful as allies, but it still has a lot of potential, it’s just more nuanced and hidden compared to the in-your-face simple power of allies.</p>
<p>Allies was broken af and a crutch for people who don’t know how to play social deduction games.</p>

            <p>Preventing a single player from voting is really the replacement of the powerful allies? This completely cripples any importance the starting king has and he is more like another noble now, without the powerful snoop. Noone will feel compelled to claim to king and evil king cannot find evil anymore. This change is horrendous in my opinion. The only real problem with allies was that it could find neutrals and there was no claiming against that. NK’s, except the sorcerer, already had a defense against that in the form of chilling/jumping/killing king early.<br>
Do not support this change at all. It is nerfed harder than the “find royals king”, which was atrocious and quickly changed back. It is funny that order even has limited uses.</p>

            <h1>copy-paste from ptr notes</h1>
<p>Hey Boslof, I’ve been giving it some thought, and I think the King needs a bit more tweaking before launch.</p>
<p>Order is potentially strong on the King, but they need to live for a decent amount of time for it to reach its full potential. However, without Allies, I don’t see this happening very often.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - removing Allies is AMAZING. However, which is more valuable - Order, or a confirmed BD King? I’d be willing to bet that our Day 4 King executions will jump up by a lot once this patch hits, simply because Order isn’t really worth it.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much you’ve read of my “Some Ideas” mini-megathread, but I think that the solution to this is to give the starting BD King a few special mechanics. If you give the starting BD King an ability the BD will be unwilling to lose, and you punish the BD for incorrectly executing a BD King, the regicide rate is unlikely to spike as much. My personal suggestions are below, but pretty much anything works as long as it achieves this end goal.</p>

<p>BD Punishment: If a Good King dies to public execution or Butler, the royal bloodline is useless and royals may not step up early.</p>

<p>They aren’t learning the full game though. They are learning the basics, yes, but in reality they are learning a different version, with different classes and with a whole faction excluded. Players who’ve learned in casual and want to move onto normal basically need to learn the full game again, aside from the basics of <em>how</em> the game works.</p>

You are just confusing new players.<br>
People want to play the game.</p>
<p>People Dont Know how to play a game when they start… Its called Learning.<br>
And we All Learn to play…</p>
<p>I learned… like everyone else.<br>
Its part of the Game.</p>
<p>If people arent prepared to learn then dont play.</p>
