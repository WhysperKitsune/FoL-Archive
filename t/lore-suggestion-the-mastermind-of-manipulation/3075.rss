    <description>&quot;Hmmmm Who shall be next&quot; Said the Assassin &quot;Don&#39;t kill tonight .Just forage&quot; Said a dark figure covering his face while looking through the window&quot;Well i found the perfect member.&quot;  Suddenly the dark figure vaulted over window .He then went into the house of the Princess. &quot;Well well.&quot; Told the dark figure &quot;What are you doing over here !&quot;Said the astonished Princess  &quot;I came here to have a chat.&quot;Said the dark figure . Soon the dark figure started telling things about how the people of Castle Adiart didn&#39;t want her to be the queen . &quot;What Why !&quot;  Said the Princess heart broken by her people.&quot;But i can help you .Just join the Unseen.&quot; &quot;I shall help the Unseen now. The Blue dragon have betrayed me and they will pay .&quot; Said the Princess or now called &#39;Duchess&#39;. As the figure was returning to his lair while he let the Duchess have some rest ,he heard a knock he immediately knew it was the sheriff who came to check him .His Assassin was foraging Nightshade outside of the lair so he couldn&#39;t kill the sheriff when he was in, so he hid in the shadows of the lair. The sheriff thought  that no one was in the lair of the unseen so he left . Next day it turned out that his beloved Assassin was killed by someone.He immediately Stole the gear from the Assassin  when no one was looking . When it was night time he promoted his duchess to be the new Assassin  . This time he was trying to think of a way to convert someone .After thinking he decided to check someone and how would they act if they were to join the Unseen .He checked a person next door to his lair only to find that he was actually the Knight and that they would help the Assassin kill and protect the unseen with their heart .This time when he was returning he saw a figure with a bluish tint coming towards him with a sword . The dark figure immediately ran away while the bluish figure was chasing him ,soon he escaped the bluish figure .But you may be wondering something. Who is this figure? What does he do? Well all i have to say is he pulls the strings and is the puppet master or to be exact the Mastermind.</description>

            <p>“Hmmmm, who shall be next?” Said the assassin.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill tonight, Just forage the nightshade.” Said the dark figure covering his face while peeking through the window.</p>
<p>“Well, I think I found the perfect member that can fulfill my goal.” Suddenly, the dark figure vaulted over the window.</p>
<p>He then went into the house of the Princess.</p>
<p>“Who are you and what are you doing over here!” Said the astonishing princess.</p>
<p>“I just came here to have the chat with you.” Said the dark figure.</p>
<p>Soon the dark figure started to tell things about how the people of Adriat castle didn’t want her to be the queen, as people is jealous about her wealth, her beauty, and her lovely voice.</p>
<p>“Wait, why!” Said the princess, feeling depressed.</p>
<p>“But I can help you to become the queen, just join our organization against the people who hates you. Soon after our plan is successful, you could be the queen and no one would ever fight against you anymore!”</p>
<p>“Ok, I will let the Blue Dragon who have betrayed me once and pay me back!” Laugh the evil princess, now as the title of ‘Duchess’.</p>
<p>Soon after the Mastermind recruited the princess, someone knocked on his door.</p>
<p>Immediately, he knew that it was the Sheriff who came by to check him.</p>
<p>Since his assassin was foraging for more nightshade for their glorious rebell against Blue Dragon, so he hid in the blind spot of the lair.</p>
<p>The sheriff thought the lair was empty, so he left the lair.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>The mastermind discovered that his assassin who helped him, the one who he beloved most, was killed, and was left dead on the ground.</p>
<p>His body is limp and still, the light leaved him.</p>
<p>The mastermind found his last will on him, telling him to take his gear to pass it to someone to continue his work.</p>
<p>Immediately, he taken his gear and stored in his lair.</p>
<p>And at that moment, he was determined to take his revenge on this castle.</p>
<p>The one who killed his beloved assassin.</p>
<p>And the whole court of people.</p>

            <p>Yes! It doesn’t need to have beautiful coding; As long as you split it into proper paragraphs, use punctuations correctly, and avoid too many typo, it will be decent enough to read.</p>

The dark figure immediately ran away while the bluish figure was chasing him ,soon he escaped the bluish figure .But you may be wondering something. Who is this figure? What does he do? Well all i have to say is he pulls the strings and is the puppet master or to be exact the Mastermind.</p>
