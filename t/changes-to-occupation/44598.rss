    <title>Changes to Occupation</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/changes-to-occupation/44598</link>
    <description>I have always felt that there are too many occupy immune classes, reducing how useful Butler and Drunk are. I would like to reduce the number of occupy immune classes, and change some other things.

1. You will not be notified if your target is occupy immune.
2. The classes Hunter, Prince, Scorned, and Fool would no longer be occupy immune, and all attempted redirects would function as occupations instead.
3. Drunk, Butler, Servant, Alcoholic, Poacher, Invoker, Sorcerer, Possessor and King would be the only ones to retain full occupy and redirect immunity.

Notes: I think Mastermind doesn&#39;t need to be immune, since they still get kills and don&#39;t trigger the cool down. The Cult Leader works fine without occupy immunity. Prince would get one time occupy immunity.</description>

            <p>I think Ignition is a good ability. It would make Court Wizard less dull.</p>
<p>I don’t think Butler needs more powers. Servant has little need for stopping day abilities.</p>
<p>I personally really like Shadow Brew for Servant, as it’s a good replacement for Nightshade.</p>

            <p>Or we give Butler and Court Wizard day abilities to add more occupation and offense, or at least more flavor into playstyles but still completely fit the theme: (Even though Butler’s gotten two buffs which I consider quite the feat and victory for us ty devs)</p>
<p>Butler &amp; Servant</p>
<p>Drugged Wine: (D) (4)<br>
Choose a player. Prevent them from using Day Abilities today. Does not show message when used, but only shows that they were prevented from using a day ability when the targeted player attempts to use an ability.</p>
<p>Court Wizard &amp; Sage</p>
<p>Ignition: (D) (2)<br>
Choose a player. The next targeting day ability they use will target themselves. (PANTS ON FIRE)</p>
<p>Prince is an exception to both the abilities above, or we could make both abilities just not bypass occupy immunity for coherence.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I do admit that would suck. But I would still like Servant to still be able to stop him. One solution could be to give it a one time occupation immunity (like Inquisitor with Death Immunity)</p>

            <p>A random occupy from a Butler or Drunk usually wouldn’t do anything to Prince, since they aren’t always executing. The real problem is if it was directed at the Prince by Unseen/Cult. But I feel this could apply to a lot of other BD classes. If the unseen/cult know who the Phys/Knight is, they can occupy and kill the Prince or whatever class. I also feel this is a pretty edge case, and would rarely come up. Since the Cult/Unseen need a servant/alcoholic/invoker/poacher. It would also require the Prince not be killed beforehand, which happens a lot.</p>

            <p>The balance issue might not be extremely large, but the un-fun aspect definitely would be. and this is just as important for the devs to consider as balance! The prince randomly getting occupied by BD isn’t fun for anyone.</p>

            <p>I don’t think is a huge balance issue if Prince get occ’d. First of all, if the Prince is outed no BD will occupy them. Cult/Unseen can only take advantage of revealed Prince if they convert one of 3 classes, and they don’t get promoted.</p>
<p>Even if there is, a CW can counter this.</p>

            <p>As for the prince, he’s widely thought of as the blue dragon power class. While him being occupied is an interesting concept, this could lead to blue dragon shooting themselves in the foot in that he can waste charges of his execute when occupied randomly by a butler/drunk. The concept isn’t fun for anyone, really. It’s not fun for the prince nor is it fun for the butler/drunk.</p>
<p>The prince being not occupy immune would tank blue dragon’s winrate a ton unnecessarily.</p>
<p>A change that I DO Think should be made regarding the prince’s occ immunity though; I believe Happy Hour from Drunk and Alcoholic should stop the prince’s execute (it currently doesn’t.) Since happy hour is usually only used when a target is suspicious (due to it’s limited charges) it won’t randomly hit the prince often. But It would allow an Alcoholic to save their fellow unseen from otherwise certain death (if they can figure out who the prince is.)</p>

            <p>Poacher never crossed my mind. Thinking of it, it is absolutely necessary. I don’t think Hunter would have to retain it, since converted classes can have different abilities. I am definitely adding Poacher to the list of immune classes.</p>

            <p>Still, Hunter being occupy immune in addition to Poacher gives the game consistency. Most other classes don’t go from not occupy immune to occupy immune.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure why no one has brought this up yet, <a class="mention" href="/u/nightx">@NightX</a>. But the main reason Hunter is occupy immune IS for a balance reason.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s unseen converted form is the Poacher. The poacher is an occupier! Making the Hunter not occupy immune but the Poacher Occ Immune is a huge nerf! And if you make both not occ immune, you run into problems with occupiers occupying occupiers (the very reason butler/drunk are occ immune.)</p>

            <p>I’m mostly doing it because it reduces Drunk/Butler power. They are useless against Mastermind, Poacher, Scorned, and Fool.The whole point is to suppress evils.</p>
<p>The other ones just feel arbitrary immunity, and reduce Servant/Alcoholic/Invoker power to suppress BD. It would only be a minor nerf, and make these evil classes have more utility.</p>
<p>I thought Sorcerer/Possessor redirect immunity was unneeded, but I wouldn’t mind if that wasn’t removed.</p>
