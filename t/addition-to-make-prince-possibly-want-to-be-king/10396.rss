    <title>Addition to Make Prince Possibly want to be King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/addition-to-make-prince-possibly-want-to-be-king/10396</link>
    <description>As it stands right now it almost never makes sense for Prince to stand as king. Odd considering that completely contradicts the royal hierarchy. So how about a new passive for the Prince.

Heir to the Throne: Prince receives all abilities of a starting king when stepping up to the throne. (i.e. all stacks of &quot;allies)

If that seems too strong (could be in end game) could do this instead:

Prince receives 2 additional uses of &quot;allies&quot; on top of what the previous king had, up to a maximum of 4.

Now BD has the option to vote in someone for extra investigates at the cost of losing the Prince. Prince stepping up becomes a strategic decision rather than an auto lose.</description>

            <p>Generally speaking yes, but that wouldn’t always be the case.</p>

            <p>Hence the ability to add investigate if he becomes king. If Prince loses his ability to execute and get towards the end of the game it may actually be better. It’s about strategy and choice, not just automatic “I can’t take king because I am prince”</p>

            <p>Prince is the Jailor from ToS. If you get rid of the jailor, Town/BD is at a <strong>HUGE</strong> disadvantage. I don’t see why people would step up as king as Prince.</p>
