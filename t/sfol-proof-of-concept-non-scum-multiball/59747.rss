    <title>SFoL Proof of concept. Non-scum Multiball</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-proof-of-concept-non-scum-multiball/59747</link>
    <description>BD Wincon - See Unseen/Cult/NK die with at least 1 surviving BD
GS Wincon - See Unseen/Cult/NK die with at least 1 surviving GS
Unseen/Cult Wincon - See GS/BD/NK die with at least 1 surviving Unseen/Cultist
NK Wincon - GS/BD/Unseen/Cult all Lose (if everyone dies NK wins)

The idea is a multiball between BD, Unseen/cult and a 2nd uninformed majority. GS King has the same ability&#39;s as BD king.

Is this a viable concept? Could something like this work in a future SFoL?

The faction was mostly lifted from @psychoneirik&#39;s Golden Dragon idea. Thanks for inspiring me.

            <p>if you want an idea of mine.</p>
<p>Add in Green Kraken as a chance to appear.<br>
So there are 3 main factions that can appear</p>
<p>helps add in randomness because why not.</p>
<p>and make Private Investigator/Stealthy unconvertable and unique</p>

            <p>I think its fine as is. With your changes to the investigators it means they would get a scum result if they check a member of a different faction. This gives scum the potential to claim they are from GS or BD, depending on which faction checked them.<br>
If you make them not able to win with the other, then they will just execute every player they find that isn’t a member of their faction.</p>

            <p>Cult can use the same conversion rules that they use for BD and BD doesn’t need changes either.</p>
<p>I’m not actually hosting this yet. I haven’t even signed it up. I am just putting the idea in peoples heads and showing how you could go about it (while also having a faction suggestion).</p>

            <p>Part of the reason why I posted this is actually to make sure other people agree that it would make a meaningful difference. If not then I might make BD and GS opposing factions.</p>

            <p>They can win and lose on their own. It’s like Sorcerer as opposed to Unseen. GS and BD lose the second their last member dies or gets converted. This means that they need to prioritize their own members survival over the other factions. Much like with Unseen busing Sorcerer or Alch being ignored by other TP.</p>
