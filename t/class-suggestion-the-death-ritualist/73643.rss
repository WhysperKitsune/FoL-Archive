    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Death Ritualist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-death-ritualist/73643</link>
    <description>**Death Ritualist - Neutral Offensive**
**Win Condition: Perform the Death Ritual to free your soul**

**Passive: An Old Mind** - Immune to occupation and redirection
**Passive: Curse of immunity** - Immune to death. Immune to poison and bleeding.

**Day Ability: Select Victim** - Select a person to die when you get attacked. Does not count as visiting. Bypasses healing. Infinite uses.

**Night Ability: Persuade** - Redirect your target to yourself. They will not know they were redirected. Bypasses redirection immunity. Cannot target the same person twice.  Infinite uses.
**Night Ability: Manipulate** - Force your target to target someone of your choosing. Cannot redirect someone to yourself. 2 Uses. (Basically Debauchery)

In order to perform a ritual, you need to kill 3 people through **Select Victim**. You will die on the same night your third victim dies.

**Notes:**

[details=&quot;Details&quot;]

 - The Idea behind this class is to get Killer classes to do your bidding and basically redirect them to kill 3 people for you.
 - The Death Ritualist hinders both Evils and BD (although not too much): both get wrong results from night abilities via **Persuade** and Unseen/Cult/NK get their attacks redirected.
 - I added **Manipulate** so that the class is more versatile. It allows Death Ritualist to fake claim Drunk as well as potentionally get rid of the current Assassin/Cult Leader so that you can get attacked by the new one through **Persuade**.

[/details]
 **Lore:**

[details=&quot;Details&quot;]
Long ago, a woman was afraid of death itself. She knew how it feels to lose someone close to her, since death seemed to follow her around. Her Family, her friends, they all left her. She was paranoid that this is a sign of her being next, so she decided to find a way to avoid death altogether. She stumbled upon a witch, rumours said the witch was evil, but she gladly helped the poor woman. The witch cast a spell on her, and said the woman is immortal now. The woman thanked her and left.
   A few years pass and the woman discovers that the witch wasnt honest. She was immune to some things that would kill her, but would still die to most things and when she died, she would be reincarnated just after painfully experiencing death.
   Decades pass but the woman couldnt find a way to break the curse. She approached the castle Adiart to consult a local Court Wizard, who took pity on her. He couldnt help her, as getting rid of the spell isnt exactly &quot;moral&quot;, as he puts it. in order for her to die, 3 others must die and be used in a ritual and the Court Wizard isnt willing to help her with that. The woman, however,  isnt capable of killing someone herself, so she decides to seek out killers plaguing the castle and force them to help her.
[/details]
in case you have an idea for a better name, feel free to tell me.

**EDIT: changed the wincon since death as wincon wasnt a smart idea. the intended goal is the same. also changed the name and the lore so that it fits better with the new version.**</description>
