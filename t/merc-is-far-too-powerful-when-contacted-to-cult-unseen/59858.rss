    <title>Merc is far too powerful when contacted to Cult/Unseen</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/merc-is-far-too-powerful-when-contacted-to-cult-unseen/59858</link>
    <description>Here recently, merc has been getting buff after buff to compensate for her inability to get a new contract. However, due to everything she has received, if she is contracted to a cult or unseen member, it heavily tips the balance into they favor, and not on a healthy way. 

The main guard ability for merc has always been rough for investigators as there is no way around it. The bd buff is suppose to be that it prevents death and conversion. However the secondary ability is mostly scum positive as it kills off anyone visiting your target, which is still very likely to be bd. 

The other new ability merc got is that he can auto pardon his contact. This completely nerfs bds main form of killing scum by removing the possibility. Add in if the merc claim isn&#39;t know, it can seem like the king is saving them.

And probably the biggest problem is the merc is a +1 to unseen and cult, which lacks the ambiguity of evil/good king, and still forces bd to waste two days to kill them. Meanwhile whoever the merc was contacted to gets any extra night, which can mean a new conversion, more death, or both.</description>

            <p>The BD Merc in question can then identify scum through your method, because he cannot/fails to recontract them.</p>

            <p>Ok how about this but to also counter the merc not guarding can recontract but only to a member of the contracts faction failure if target dies past n3 you die that way if merc is contracted to scum they cant contract bd  if contracted to bd classes like prince cant be contracted if contracted to a neut current death to merc applies</p>

            <p>I’ve done my best to make that a bad idea for the Merchant at first by making his wincon require going against the winning team. However that’s still not True Neutral even if it is closer.</p>
<p>So ya. It’s a shame but it’s still not that bad anyways.</p>

            <p>I’d consider a class that hurts both sides to be True Neutral in some situations. However overall that line of reasoning gives you the NK’s which we already have. Combine that with “Make the BD fall” being one of the most interesting standard wincon for a neutral and it’s no wonder everyone is suggesting then.</p>
<p>TLDR: I agree with you and I know why that is. Even my Merchant class which is more neutral than most is fairly Scum Sided.</p>

            <p>That makes the class basically aligned to one of the factions, but can win with NK.</p>
<p>It isn’t really neutral, with that you may as well make them BD and Unseen/Cult respectively.</p>

            <p>Okay. It’s not “survive to see the Blue Dragon lose” just “See the Blue Dragon lose”. Never mind, I have no problems with it. I assumed they had to be alive.</p>

            <p>Why would we prevent non attacking players for the Sellsword? I don’t think it’d be overpowered, as it only affects Knight, NK, and Hunter.</p>
<p>Otherwise I like it a lot. I think I’d still give them something to help survive, maybe a day ability like stone skin. Their basic goal is still to “survive” since they have to see the opposite faction lose.</p>
