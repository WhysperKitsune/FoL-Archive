    <title>False positive debauch on mercenary</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/false-positive-debauch-on-mercenary/27294</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was Drunk, another player was Mercenary.

On N1, I debauched the Mercenary and at the same time he guarded his target.  The text for me said that I forced the Mercenary to target me.  The mercenary claims that he was not forced to target anyone else N1.  This falsified my Drunk claim to the other players when I was questioned, and resulted in my execution.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The Mercenary should have been successfully debauched, causing him to target me, and he should have seen text to that extent.  (The wiki page for Mercenary does not say he&#39;s immune to debauchery/occupation.)

#### Steps to reproduce:

Get a Mercenary to guard someone, and get a Drunk to debauch the Mercenary that night.  The Mercenary should see that he was not debauched.  The drunk should see that the debauch succeeded.

#### Comments:

I only know my side of the story.  It&#39;s entirely possible the mercenary was lying and did in fact see that he was debauched.  It&#39;s possible he kept this lie going even after the game ended and I said I was going to file a bug report.  I find this scenario unlikely, but figured I should mention it.</description>

            <p>You can’t make a merc target you as drunk unless they are rebounding</p>
<p>That said, you probably shouldn’t have got a successful result on him</p>

            <p>Stand Guard is not a targeted ability. In other word’s his ability is to make his contract unvisitable. I don’t think this ability counts as a visit itself.</p>
