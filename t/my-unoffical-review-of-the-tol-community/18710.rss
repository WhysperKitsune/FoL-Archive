    <title>My [Unoffical] Review of the ToL Community</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-unoffical-review-of-the-tol-community/18710</link>
    <description>Rating:3/10

Explanation:
The community is just, terrible it&#39;s not toxic or anything it&#39;s just stupid. The forums have 3 sentence posts complaining about the game. The beta testers and guides are just overwhelmed by this shit community. I have heard complaining from people who will remained unnamed, and people have been making demands to demote guide members and complain on Discord instead of reporting the rule breaker. This may seem I&#39;m complaining to complain, but this really just proves my point that you are doing the same thing. While the Mods and Guides try their best to keep in under control, they are undermanned and pure stupidity will trump logic every time. I hope people will fucking get some common sense.

            <p>Eh. This game naturally draws in a specific, unique type of player. Everybody thinks they’re Sherlock or that their “next level” plays of claiming Fool as Prince is just so far beyond anyone’s understanding that they will never get better until they take personal responsibility for their mistakes.</p>
<p>Social deduction games bring in the most egotistical.</p>
