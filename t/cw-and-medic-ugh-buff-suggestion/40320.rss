    <description>CW - give him Reanimate as a day Ability. He&#39;s really borring right now and this can help. 

Phys (seriously, get a better name than medic) - Bring back Exhumain as a day ability that gives it&#39;s results at the start of the night. Make quarantine a day Ability that make heal remove poison and bleed. Give it 2 or 3 uses. MAKE SURE IT CAN BE CANCELLED</description>

            <p>This is a tough time in our kingdom. All the changes that no one wanted are happening(except everyone crying over Kings allies).  Like the princess buff(why)<br>
And the physi…medic nerf. Like he’s already boring as he is. There’s so much more. Hopefully this will get reversed</p>
