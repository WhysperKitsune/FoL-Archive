    <title>I would like devs to confirm this and give me a medal</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-would-like-devs-to-confirm-this-and-give-me-a-medal/19256</link>
    <description>3 games ago I made my name &quot;bronzefish&quot; and my class was Evil King

2 games ago I made my name &quot;silverfish&quot; and my class was Neutral king

Last game I made my name &quot;goldfish&quot; and my class was Good king

Devs plz confirm this and have your minds blown. Seriously what are the odds of that happening?</description>

            <p>Well obviously it was just a coincidence. If it worked like that then it wouldn’t be impressive. But the odds of that just happening to work out perfectly like that have to be astronomical</p>
