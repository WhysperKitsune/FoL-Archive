    <title>Hunter Retribution</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hunter-retribution/6037</link>
    <description>The king told the council that #7 was unseen. So we all voted for him. I did first.

At that time I then noticed the assassin had DIED that night (He was #8) and told the council that there was NO way the king had found unseen since MM shows up as inno for 3 days. I pardoned. The rest of the council guiltied. Turns out #7 was hunter. He used his retribution ability. Since I was the first to accuse him, I was killed even though I was the ONLY one who pardoned him.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I dont know, but its not ok that I died when I was the one to pardon him.

#### Steps to reproduce:

            <p>Hmm how about this:<br>
Retribution(passive): When executed for treason you will kill the earliest accuser who did not rescind their decision either explicitely or by voting to pardon. A Decide Fate will make you target the King instead.</p>
<p>I love this idea. I could get behind this.</p>

<p>Anyone who does this will easily hang the next day lol. It would be SUPER suspicious and they would have to know it was the hunter. Hence I think we can safely rule this problem out <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>After the lynch has already happened it might very well be too late to kill anyone. You just lost two players (both of them potentially good in ToL, unlike ToS) and this kind of stuff normally happens late in the game, the evils probably have majority now.</p>

            <p>Personally I like the ability as it works right now.</p>
<p>I don’t want this to become like the Jester’s hunt is in Town of Salem, where evils can push someone on the stand and then not vote guilty at the last second.<br>
If you are the first one to accuse someone you are probably the one who pushed them up the stand. Simply voting pardon or abstaining shouldn’t be enough to avoid the retribution IMHO. You need to convince everyone else to vote pardon as well.</p>

            <p>Ok, had time to calm down a bit after this.</p>
<p>After thinking on it awhile, I believe the Hunters passive should change to “If found guilty of treason, choose one accuser to kill whom voted guilty at your trial”</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>nope, you still accused them. voting on someone is called accusing in system.</p>
<p>I agree, passive should be clear first accuser dies</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The skill on the hunter states</p>
<p>If found guilty of treason, you will kill your accuser before your execution.</p>
<p>Now it doesnt specifically state your FIRST accuser. And if someone pardons a person, they DEFINATELY arent accusing someone anymore. Hence its a bug. Personal opinion of course, but IMHO it shouldnt work like this.</p>
