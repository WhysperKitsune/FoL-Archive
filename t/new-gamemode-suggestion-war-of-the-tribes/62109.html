<h2><font color="red"> So What’s Different?</font></h2>
<p><strong>New Setting</strong> -The Setting takes place in a Tribal Village.<br>
<strong>Changed Classes</strong> -Each class is changed a bit to have the old feel, but still be a bit different.<br>
<strong>New Antagonist Factions</strong> At some point, you’re going to get bored of the Cult and the Unseen. So, here is the Xeniss’ Conquerers and The Council of the Snakes.<br>
<strong>Pray Ability</strong> -A new System that occupies you for the night, since you are praying to the gods for extended power.  Every day a player can choose to Pray or not, starting on Day 2.  You will have to pray 3 times if you are Yellow Pheonix, 2 times if you are a Conquerer or a Council Member,  if you are a non-nomadic killer, and you only have to kill people if you are Nomadic Killer. (just started, might take a week or 2, I have 227 abilities to buff) You also are able to buff all 4 abilities if you are a Nomadic Killer, 3 abilities if you are a Non-Nomadic Killer, 2 if you are a Conquerer or Council Member, and 1 if you are Yellow Phoenix. Also your points will last through conversions.</p>
