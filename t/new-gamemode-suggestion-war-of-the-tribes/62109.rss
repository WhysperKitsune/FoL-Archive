    <description>**Inspired by Pug’s** **[color = green]Siege on Xed Gamemode[/color]**
**[color = ligblue] Blue Dragon [/color]**= **[color =gold] Yellow Phoenix [/color]**
**[color = purple] Unseen [/color]**= **[color = darkslategray] Xeniss’ Conquerers [/color]**
**[color = red] Cult [/color]** = **[color = darkgreen] Council of the Snake [/color]**
**[color = darkgray] Neutrals [/color]**= **[color = gray] Nomads of Rian [/color]**

I&#39;m accepting the fact this is be over **[color = gold] 1[/color]** **[color = darkslategray]0[/color]** **[color = darkgreen]0[/color]** edits... thats a lot for a single post.

&gt; ## [color = red] So What’s Different?[/color]
&gt;**New Setting** -The Setting takes place in a Tribal Village.
&gt;**Changed Classes** -Each class is changed a bit to have the old feel, but still be a bit different.
&gt;**New Antagonist Factions** At some point, you’re going to get bored of the Cult and the Unseen. So, here is the Xeniss’ Conquerers and The Council of the Snakes.
&gt;**Pray Ability** -A new System that occupies you for the night, since you are praying to the gods for extended power.  Every day a player can choose to Pray or not, starting on Day 2.  You will have to pray 3 times if you are Yellow Pheonix, 2 times if you are a Conquerer or a Council Member,  if you are a non-nomadic killer, and you only have to kill people if you are Nomadic Killer. (just started, might take a week or 2, I have 227 abilities to buff) You also are able to buff all 4 abilities if you are a Nomadic Killer, 3 abilities if you are a Non-Nomadic Killer, 2 if you are a Conquerer or Council Member, and 1 if you are Yellow Phoenix. Also your points will last through conversions.

            <p>Will do second one. Thanks!</p>
<p>Also maybe since this is close to similarity to Xed, mass claiming may be a thing. But I’ll try to rule that out by having Classes with anti whisper abilities.</p>

            <p>I was thinking about doing something like a boar hunt, but that seemed to similar to Xed. How does this sound?</p>
<p>You have to accomplish a certain goal in-game, and once you do, Either you or your team will gain a buff, lasting through conversions.</p>
<p>Sound Good?</p>

            <p><strong>Inspired by Pug’s</strong> <strong><font color="green">Siege on Xed Gamemode</font></strong><br>
<strong><font color="ligblue"> Blue Dragon </font></strong>= <strong><font color="gold"> Yellow Phoenix </font></strong><br>
<strong><font color="purple"> Unseen </font></strong>= <strong><font color="darkslategray"> Xeniss’ Conquerers </font></strong><br>
<strong><font color="red"> Cult </font></strong> = <strong><font color="darkgreen"> Council of the Snake </font></strong><br>
<strong><font color="darkgray"> Neutrals </font></strong>= <strong><font color="gray"> Nomads of Rian </font></strong></p>
<p>I’m accepting the fact this is be over <strong><font color="gold"> 1</font></strong> <strong><font color="darkslategray">0</font></strong> <strong><font color="darkgreen">0</font></strong> edits… thats a lot for a single post.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="red"> So What’s Different?</font></h2>
<p><strong>New Setting</strong> -The Setting takes place in a Tribal Village.<br>
<strong>Changed Classes</strong> -Each class is changed a bit to have the old feel, but still be a bit different.<br>
<strong>New Antagonist Factions</strong> At some point, you’re going to get bored of the Cult and the Unseen. So, here is the Xeniss’ Conquerers and The Council of the Snakes.<br>
<strong>Pray Ability</strong> -A new System that occupies you for the night, since you are praying to the gods for extended power.  Every day a player can choose to Pray or not, starting on Day 2.  You will have to pray 3 times if you are Yellow Pheonix, 2 times if you are a Conquerer or a Council Member,  if you are a non-nomadic killer, and you only have to kill people if you are Nomadic Killer. (just started, might take a week or 2, I have 227 abilities to buff) You also are able to buff all 4 abilities if you are a Nomadic Killer, 3 abilities if you are a Non-Nomadic Killer, 2 if you are a Conquerer or Council Member, and 1 if you are Yellow Phoenix. Also your points will last through conversions.</p>
