    <description>Oh boy a Neutral Offensive class suggestion (not uncommon)

ToS&#39;s Neutral Evil = ToL&#39;s Neutral Offensive (How I view NOs)

**Warrior [color=gray](Neutral Offensive)[/color]**

**Passive: Veteran - You are occupy and redirect immune. If you die at night, you will appear to be a Drunk.**

**Passive 2: Traitor - You cannot become the [color=yellow]King.[/color] :crown:** 

**Day Ability: Enrage - Clash will bypass occupy immunity tonight and Sever will not count as a visit. (2 uses)**

**Night Ability 1: Clash - Select two people. They will be forced to target each other. You can select yourself. (Infinite Uses)**

**Night Ability 2: Sever - Kill somebody at night and take their place in the castle, making them appear as yourself and vice-versa. You cannot target the King. (1 use) [Possess but you can&#39;t target King. They would appear to be a Drunk.]**

**Goal: Survive to see a minority faction win the game. (Unseen/Cult/Neutrals) [Cannot win with BD]**

**-Convert Immune**
**-Unique :shield:** 

A major function of this class is to make drunk claims more sus, as only a few classes can redirect. (CW, Drunk, Alchoholic, Invoker) CW is already a very scummy claim, and Invoker almost never claims Drunk. This makes people a bit more suspiscious of drunk claims.

Claiming drunk and having the king die is a problem though, as you can&#39;t step up at all. This will most likely get you executed.

--Ideas, need feedback--

If you redirect a killer to yourself, then you will occupy them. (For Clash)

--Changelog--

Reduced Sever&#39;s uses to 1.</description>

<p>Well many classes have that sort of thing to them, as long as it’s moderate, for example</p>
<p>butler can kill king using his nightshade wine ability, so does that mean butler should be a killer class?</p>
<p>alch can use his yolo potion ability and kill a player, so does that mean alch should be a killer?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Basically what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Do you have any feedback for the class itself?</p>

            <p>I like it. A tip:</p>
<p>Sever is powerful, especially on a hostile class. Maybe reduce to 1 use?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The second night ability’s main purpose is to assist him in surviving to the end of the game, while still assisting evils in the background. Also, Merc/Sellsword are Supports and they have a one-time use killing ability.</p>
<p>I’ll see about changing Enrage after I get a bit more feedback on this.</p>
