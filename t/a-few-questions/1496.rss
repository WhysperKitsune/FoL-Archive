    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-few-questions/1496</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new to the game and I really like it. I have some questions about the mechanics.
1) How does the apostle passive work? Its like priest passive?
2) When someone is in prison has immunity as in Town of Salem?
3) Can the Prince in the Prison kill anybody who has night immunity?
4) If the Cult leader converts someone the same night as Paladin is investigating him, does Paladin kill him?
5) Can there be more Noble couples in the game at once?
6) When the Cult leader uses Blood of Mithras, will the observer see him as a visiting cult member?
7) I noticed that a few Wiki information is incorrect. Can you fix it?
Thank you for the answers and apologize for bad English.</description>

<li>I <strong>think</strong> it should still work if you’re jailed. I don’t get your second question though. If the priest is lynched, they can talk to the dead like any other dead person.</li>

<li>Yep.</li>
<li>Yep.</li>
<li>Yep, the execution goes through night immunity.</li>
<li>I <strong>think</strong> not</li>
<li>There will always be two nobles; no more, no less (Unless the game has less than 10 players, then there will be none)</li>
<li>I don’t think it does. Not sure though.</li>
<li>If you find mistakes in the wiki you can either inform us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/qQazm4j">Discord</a> or change it yourself (As long as you’re not trolling there is no problem with that)</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope I was helpful =) Have a nice day. Also I would suggest you join the discord if you haven’t already by clicking <a href="https://discord.gg/qQazm4j">here</a>.</p>
