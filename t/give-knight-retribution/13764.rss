    <title>Give Knight retribution</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/give-knight-retribution/13764</link>
    <description>The Knight is borring to play right now. I feel like you should be able to play more agressivly than you can. Given the themes and mechanics of the Knight it would make more sense to give the Knight retribution rather than the Hunter. In fact I would even go so far as to give an auto counter attack on a night kill like this

&gt; Passive: Retribution - If you are executed kill your accuser. If you are attacked at night then counter attack your attacker. Will fail if the attack Peirces night Immunity. Does not peirce night Immunity.

This means that the Knight will almost always take someone down with him which is his theme with sacrifice and cold steel. This also give him the ability to be more active and thus get more information for cold steels

The Hunter can be active too but for a different reason. He has a bear that makes him more survivable and a wolf that makes him provable and thus does not need a retribution on top of that.

To compensate I would give the Enforcer the night part of the passive except it Pierce&#39;s night Immunity like sacrifice.</description>

            <p>I feel like that would encourage him to not guard. I would suggest that it be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day ability: Retaliate - If you are attacked tonight then kill your attacker (2 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would fulfill the purpose and adress your concern.</p>
<p>Do you have a problem with the daytime effect?</p>

            <p>Retribution in the original post would make Knight far too OP. And that for a class that is not even unique.</p>
<p>Also, it is copying part of a Hunter ability and adding something extra to that. So the accusation part I would keep with Hunter.</p>
<p>The auto retaliate at night is OP by itself. Just like <a class="mention" href="/u/newarkinvaders">@newarkinvaders</a> said in his post above. So I would not like to see this suggestion in the game. Would really hurt Cult/Unseen too much.</p>
<p>I like <a class="mention" href="/u/newarkinvaders">@newarkinvaders</a>’s suggestion of being able to guard yourself as knight, but not unlimited. This goes against the selfless nature of Sacrifice and… it still is really, really powerful. Part of the deal with sacrifice is you just might use Sacrifice and end up guarding people that were converted or were evil to begin with. Being able to target yourself would mean you know 100% certain you are guarding a BD.</p>
<p>So while I like the suggestion, I would make the buff to Knight even smaller:</p>
<p><strong>Daytime ability: Retribution (2 uses)</strong><br>
Your Sacrifice may target yourself next night.</p>

            <p>Still means that the only way to take you out is to<br>
a) get a bd to put you up for ex first<br>
b) lose an evil team member .</p>
<p>or for neutral killers<br>
possessor - enjoy  free snacks<br>
reaper - sacrifice lives .</p>
<p>For me as far as I would like to see any change would be to see the ability to “guard” yourself .</p>

            <p>No. He still dies. He would only ever kill the assassin, cult leader or whoever the Possessor possessed anyway.</p>

            <p>So… Immune to death other than Execute? Is basically what I’m reading? Apart from the odd few times Reaper etc bypass.<br>
Anyone who attacks him at night dies to counter attack.</p>
<p>Seems a little OP?</p>

            <p>I agree to something similar, but I do not know about killing attackers at night. Maybe a function where they can guard themselves.</p>
