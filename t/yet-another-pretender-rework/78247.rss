    <title>Yet Another Pretender rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/yet-another-pretender-rework/78247</link>
    <description>**Pretender Neutral Special**
**False Identity** (Passive) - Immune to death once, this passive is removed upon class changing.
**Stolen Actions** (Passive) - You&#39;ll gain the amount of limited use abilites they had left.
**Tailor** (Night) - If that target is killed during the night you’ll become that class - Infinite.
**Double Dress** (Night) - Select two targets, if one is killed you’ll become that class, if both are killed you’ll become the first one you select. - 2 uses

Goal: Become a new class and complete their objectives.

Notes (Strange interactions).


[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
-If possessor jumps, Pretender will not become the class of the jumped.
-Can&#39;t become reaped targets.
-(Debate if you think they should be able to become classes that where jailed).
-Will bypass assassin or second cult member on become the CL/MM when they die.
-Being debbed into a dead king will not become king, Pretender can never become king unless stepping up.

<p>Alchemist wants scum out as soon as possible for the quickest win sam-ish with pret I feel like my argument still stands</p>

</aside>
<p>I guess it works both ways. In my eyes, letting Prince die as Alchemist is optimal. But I suppose if you want scum out ASAP, Prince staying around is good. But by letting BD die the game ends pretty fast, but you do have more chances to die… guess my own playstyle isn’t optimal hehehe</p>
<p>Pretender is weird. I don’t like debating Pretender because I really do think they need a <em>massive</em> rework. But as it stands, Pretender is pretty BD sided. Pretender King usually favors scum, but not always.</p>

<p>Maybe we could change it to not be able to copy unique-Bd classes, I think it becoming classes like Sellsword/Assassin would be good if it wasn’t able to remeber evil unique classes it would be mega bd sided. as the only real evils that aren’t unique is Fool(This is even debatable), Non-CL cult and third unseen members</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I could sort of agree with that. Not being able to copy Prince allows for a lot more diversity, because copying Prince would be optimal more times than not.</p>
<p>I do have concerns with copying cultseen and the faction cap, having a 3rd potential MM, etc etc. Having a third MM seems pretty insane, after all. Dno how others would feel about that.</p>

</aside>
<p>If this Pretender could copy the Prince, then I still think copying Prince would be optimal <em>most</em> of the time. But lets assume they can’t.</p>
<p>I said most of what I said before without considering it’s one time death immunity, with that it can safely think about what to copy for a bit. Probably 3-4 nights. In that case, you’d absolutely be correct. Optimally you just try to side with whoevers winning and let them snowball even more. The problem being you have to pick the right person in the right night… <em>unless</em></p>

<p>Execution targets is definitely overkill… jailed targets though… just maybe.</p>
<p>At least I can confidently say we both agree that Pretender needs a massive rework <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>

<p>Fool can absolutely crush Possessor and CL. But generally, Fool favors scum more than BD. Scorned can go either way though. If the Scorned is outted, I’d say they’re 50/50 with where they lean.</p>
<p>People play Alchemist like a BD neut, but I’m still of the opinion that optimal Alchemist play is anti-BD, but can be pro-whoever-is-winning. Pretender is kind of weird. Pretender King is very anti-BD most of the time, but Pretender is super pro-BD. But that’s a different issue altogether imo.</p>

<p>Not really because you’ll be outed pretty much soon once you become prince unless you don’t jail and fake claim when your upped for not claiming ect, evils could easily tell a pret became a prince. This is effectively a heal, maybe more powerful but in total alchemist can save the prince multiple times I think your argument falls flat because bd doesn’t really gain a member they just have a new one for exchange of a death, same goes for unseen/Cult.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Shrug. You might be right. I think this proposed Pretender would still be a super-support, but I can’t argue against Alch being able to save the Prince multiple times. (I can, however, argue that that’s bad play… which I already did above <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

<p>No it needs a overhaul it doesn’t work as a class. Every other neutral can become king it’s not interesting to have a class based around that, it’s not fun to be a pretender it’s not fun to be a king in a pretender game and it’s not fun to be a royal that wants to step but theirs a pretender in game so you can’t pretender fundamentally is a broken class just by their win con this isn’t even considering how horrible Bloot test is, being a Di princess ect.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Trust me, I hate current Pretender quite a lot. I think it needs a major rework. But I do think the concept <em>can</em> work. And if not, I’ll concede to being wrong there.</p>
<p>Overall, this discussion has made me grow to the idea a little more, honestly. I still think being able to copy a unique class is bad, but other than that it’s growing on me.</p>

<p>Yes, but wouldn’t it be the same for this class? it can latterly only become a class once (which saves someone) while alchemist can heal multiple times, kill people ect, I feel like alchemist would have a bigger effect.</p>

<p>Uh no? any neutral like alch, merc current pretender can play like a bd slave, this is also a big no while yes you can become prince this would make the current prince die which alchemist can heal <em>MULTIPLE</em> times it doesn’t reduce/gain a bd count because you’ll basically be killing a bd or cult or unseen ect. they will become that class so in all effective purpose it’s as effective as a heal so no it’s not 99% more significantly easier to do.</p>

<p>and duplicating a role is powerful. You’re also moving the Prince from one number to another, and if you’re not outted you’re doing much more than “protecting” once.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not really because you’ll be outed pretty much soon once you become prince unless you don’t jail and fake claim when your upped for not claiming ect, evils could easily tell a pret became a prince. This is effectively a heal, maybe more powerful but in total alchemist can save the prince multiple times I think your argument falls flat because bd doesn’t really gain a member they just have a new one for exchange of a death, same goes for unseen/Cult.</p>

<p>Like I said. I dislike Pretender in its current state. But I don’t think it’s bad conceptually. It just needs some tweaking.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No it needs a overhaul it doesn’t work as a class. Every other neutral can become king it’s not interesting to have a class based around that, it’s not fun to be a pretender it’s not fun to be a king in a pretender game and it’s not fun to be a royal that wants to step but theirs a pretender in game so you can’t pretender fundamentally is a broken class just by their win con this isn’t even considering how horrible Bloot test is, being a Di princess ect.</p>
<p>Overall I see your point but this hardly has the effect you make it out to be.</p>

            <p>This feels less like a rework and more like a class suggestion, since this has absolutely no similarities to current Pretender. Personally I don’t think an Amnesiac styled class has much room in ToL.</p>
<p>And the ‘pretender to the throne’ class makes more sense than ‘pretending to be this dead guy’, imo.</p>
