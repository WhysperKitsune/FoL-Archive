    <title>On the Knight and Trolls</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/on-the-knight-and-trolls/60868</link>
    <description>The way Cold Steel works is designed to prevent trolling with it. However it makes it far too risky to be used on anyone besides confirmed Unseen. And those are always executed in the day or by Prince first.

However there is another problem that cold steel has: it doesn&#39;t truly solve the original problem, it just moves it from knight to everyone else. All you have to do is try and be obnoxious to the Knight and he will CS you and die. You could do this with both knights and the Prince all in the same game if you wanted.

So if that trolling potential is still there then why is the fix? It&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t precident for CS not suiciding. It&#39;s exactly what CC does for it&#39;s Vig equivalent.</description>

<p>Not enough. 1 vote isn’t (usually) enough to give someone a serious problem.</p>
<p>And unless you are either fake claiming or are sheriff no one is going to care what you say without credible. Hence why confirmability is a key trait for this.</p>

            <p>King:</p>

Leverage - Telepathy</p>

Confirmability - Follow</p>
<p>Paladin:<br>
Defence: Smite</p>
<p>As you can see the only classes with absolutely no leadership potential are the sheriff and the Knight. However the Knights CS and Armored Ability’s can be reworked to solve this.</p>
<p>Sheriff could use some help here too, probably something bring his confirmability up to the level of Princess. I’m thinking that Targeted Seach Ability I’ve suggested before.</p>

            <p>In my mind everyone should have some kind of tool for encouraging claims to them. Things that qualify are:</p>
<p>Confirmability (people will claim to you if they know you are good)<br>
Defence (You can push harder, longer and on more people if you can survive the kills it draws in)<br>
Leverage (people will claim to you if not doing so carries risk)</p>

            <p>That’s actually not why I have a problem with it (unlike RHcube). The issue is that it causes you to lose CS as a critical barging tool as it doesn’t work on BD thus removing their reason to cooperate.</p>

            <p>Honestly I’m okay with the current Cold Steel. I think people are making too big a deal of it being ‘omniscient town killing’ because it’s really not. It basically kills town if you hit town with it, which imo is a good enough trade-off</p>

            <p>It may not solve the problem, but this solution is just as bad. Besides, it forces the bad Knights to suffer the consequences of their misjudgements rather than the people they kill.</p>

            <p>The way Cold Steel works is designed to prevent trolling with it. However it makes it far too risky to be used on anyone besides confirmed Unseen. And those are always executed in the day or by Prince first.</p>
<p>However there is another problem that cold steel has: it doesn’t truly solve the original problem, it just moves it from knight to everyone else. All you have to do is try and be obnoxious to the Knight and he will CS you and die. You could do this with both knights and the Prince all in the same game if you wanted.</p>
<p>So if that trolling potential is still there then why is the fix? It’s not like there isn’t precident for CS not suiciding. It’s exactly what CC does for it’s Vig equivalent.</p>
