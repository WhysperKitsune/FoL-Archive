    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Baron (Neutral Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-baron-neutral-social/71241</link>
    <description>**Unique Neutral Special or Social Class**
_**The Baron**_
**Win condition:** Eliminate everyone with royal blood and the starting king.

**Life insurance (Passive):**
Whenever you are attacked redirect your attacker to a random bribed player if there are any. Become occupied for the night.

**Money talks (Passive):**
You will see all whispers to and from anyone that is bribed.

**Bribe (Night):**
**Unlimited uses.**
Bribe someone from the court. You will see the feedback of their night abilites. If they have royal blood they will not be able to step up in the royal phase.

**Counterfeit (Night):**
**3 Uses.**
Target 1 player, they will receive wrong feedback on their abilities tonight.

**Buy votes (Day):**
**2 Uses.**
Force everyone you bribed to vote on the same person you did with the same fate. You will lose all bribes after use. Can be used while voting for a new King. Cannot be used on self.

Life insurance protects the Baron from dying before achieving their goal.
Having bribe should give evils more claimspace when they are pressed for ascending the throne in the royal phase to prove their royal blood, as well as make those with it suspicious of being evil when they can&#39;t.
Counterfeit obviously gives misleading information helping him get someone executed.
Buying votes can be used to rally vote to execute a confirmed good king or confirmed bd, while the evil faction still hasn&#39;t achieved majority.</description>

            <p>Honestly this RNG wouldn’t be too bad. But maybe you can select who your Life Insurance targets out of your bribed targets.</p>
