    <title>Drunk debauche, knight coldsteel interaction</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/drunk-debauche-knight-coldsteel-interaction/12255</link>
    <description>So I just finished a game where something happened that I hoped was wrong...

In this game [07] claimed alch. Seeing as a poss was still in the game I decided to coldsteel [07] as the roles were pretty much narrowed down and this story did not fully add up.

During the nightphase I decide to coldsteel [07]

[07] was debauched by a drunk, I get ridirected to the drunk and I take my own life.

I do not mind taking my own life if I gamble wrong, that is totally a fair interaction. But I do feel that this interaction is wrong, I did not target the drunk at all.

So I do feel that this needs to be changed as it creates an interaction post patch that pre patch was not possible. Knight is already a pretty boring class because they basicly have only 1 ability and if I can&#39;t safely use my niche 2nd ability due to possible bad interactions it&#39;s a bit too iffy imo.

The worst thing is that I log who I coldsteel... and since I am dead they think that the person who I tried to coldsteel is a BD</description>
