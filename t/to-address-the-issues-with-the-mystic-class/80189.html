          <p>The Mystic has been a point of contention in the portion of the community that cares about balancing the game. I’m firmly on the ‘Mystic needs to change’ team, and here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Minds (and Conduit to a lesser extent) serve as a means to gather information from other players. Mainly their claims. Once all players have claimed, this use becomes (mostly) null. The abilities then shift to fulfill the task listed in the following bullet-point.</li>
<li>Link Minds and Conduit are the last remaining mechanical confirmation abilities left in the game(Aside from Prince’s Imprison). Such an ability goes against the spirit of the game, where everyone’s identity is supposed to be deduced. Once the abilities can no longer realistically be used for their intended purpose of gathering and sharing information, they become almost exclusively tools used to confirm yourself to the strongest BD claim (Usually Prince), choosing the same target every night.</li>
<li>The Mystic’s night abilities’ last purpose is to coordinate your actions, much in the way the main evil factions have their shared night rooms. This use is very narrowly applicable, as there’s no coordination you can do at night that you can’t already do during the day. But, at least this function of the abilities are in line with what is acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ‘fix’ the issue discussed in the second bullet point is to remove the other uses of the mystic’s night abilities, which is where I feel the most push-back against such a change is coming from. Those uses are fun and engaging.</p>
<p>It’s been suggested in the past to give Link Minds to different evil classes, so as to make it not an auto-confirm ability, and that’s a quick and easy solution I could get behind, but has been shot down repeatedly by opposition.</p>
<p>Instead, I will be exploring the possibility of completely overhauling the Mystic. Sadly, this means Link Minds and Conduit would have to be severely nerfed, or removed entirely. I’ll try to create a version for both of these possibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Design Space</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of ‘Mysticism’ is very broad, and I’d like to reach deep into this concept for the Mystic’s new abilities. This might mean the class will change its type, but I’ll try my best to keep it a Social class, if possible.</p>

<p>Feedback is appreciated. (Is this still a Social class to you, or has it shifted too much towards being Investigative?) I’ll gladly answer questions related to choices I’ve made in the designing of the class.</p>

          <p>In the case of the link minds nerf: Parking really only happens after n3 or so, so disabling the ability entirely (let’s pretend the mystic ran out of power), that problem goes away.<br>
It’s not an elegant change, but it’s the only way I could think of to keep the ability around and still keep its intended use…sort of.</p>
<p>That said, the class really isn’t that good outside of its current night ability, so I wanted to give it some more stuff to do.</p>
