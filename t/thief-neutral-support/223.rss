    <description>Night Ability 1: Graverob - Choose a dead player to gain one use of their limited use ability, if they have more than one, you take the one with more uses, if there is a tie you take neither because you spend too much time deciding and the gravekeeper caught you

Night Ability 2: Housebreaking - Choose a living player to take their things, occupying them, you will be able to use the ability they were intending to use on the next night

Passive: Scavenge - You go rooting around the Undertaker&#39;s place every night, so you know how many uses each player had of their limited use abilities

Objective: Survive

Lore: IDK

Comments: This will probably be a nightmare to code RIP
Also it&#39;s Convert Immune</description>
