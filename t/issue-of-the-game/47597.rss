    <title>Issue of the Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/issue-of-the-game/47597</link>
    <description>Now I just want this thread to be A-a place where we discuss the problems of ToL and B-Set up some form of change. I just want to know what everyone thinks are issues.
Personally speaking I like this game and don&#39;t think it NEEDS a rework but without one the game would become stale. I personally am in favor of new classes or even a new faction.
Some reworks on some classes might be needed or might make them better or more unique.
But have at it I can&#39;t wait to see this thread.</description>

            <p>I think the main issue is what is already being discussed in another thread, the thing about the game being too much like sudoku / minesweeper and not enough room for lying / social deduction</p>

            <p>Problems:</p>
<p>Court Wizard is too boring. I’d say focus it on Tornado.</p>
<p>Psychic is too similar to Prince.</p>
<p>Evils have little claim space. Maybe open up Hunter/Mercenary as a claim?</p>
<p>Just for starters (I do have solutions on my megathread in classes/lore)</p>
