    <title>Single Player Sandbox Mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/single-player-sandbox-mode/36743</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to learn the game and a sandbox mode where I can start a game by myself, pause the game and swap the player that I&#39;m controlling would be incredibly useful. With this, it would be much easier to reproduce bugs and learn what combinations of abilities will generate what feedback.</description>

            <p>I should program a calculator on what feedback people would get from doing certain abilities.</p>
