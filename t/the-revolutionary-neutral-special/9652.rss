            <p>So how does this work with the mercenary? I would make the Call to Arms passive be all UNCONVERTABLE Neutral classes share your wincon. Same with the midnight gathering. That way the merc isn’t converted and outs all the Neutrals or has his contract die twice and dies even thought he can still win. Other than that I think it is good. One question thought. What happens if the Revolutionary dies without choosing someone to promote?</p>
<p>Overall I like this class!</p>
