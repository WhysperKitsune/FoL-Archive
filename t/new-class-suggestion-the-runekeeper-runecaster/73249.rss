    <title>New Class Suggestion - The Runekeeper/Runecaster</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-suggestion-the-runekeeper-runecaster/73249</link>
    <description>Yeah another phone suggestion. But this class will probably suck early game. Late game. Better.

---------

The Runekeeper - Blue Dragon Offensive (Support?)

Rune Of Determination (Passive) - Immune to occupation, redirection abilities.

Rune Of Protection (Day Ability) - Immune to death tonight (2 uses)

Rune Of Empowerment (Night Ability) - Prevent visits to a target. They must be a certain class type.

Rune of Stunning (Day Ability) - Prevent any further abilities used by target and further voting from them (3 uses)

--------

The Runecaster - Unseen Offensive.

*Keeps the Rune of Determination*

Rune Of Instinct (Night Ability) Prevent all players of the same princess flirt result. You will learn if they are K/O, S/S, S/I. You can not target fellow unseen members. 

*Keeps Rune of Stunning but now with unlimited uses*

--------

Ok I tried to balance this out... I think unseen is OP a bit
This class is non-unique, Convertible.
This class is Immune to death, Occupation, Redirection</description>

<p>That is quite literally how every offensive class functions</p>

<p>Rune Of Protection (Passive) - Immune to occupation, redirection abilities and death. If this class is attacked and is death immune. This passive is lost.</p>

</aside>
<p>Reword this to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rune of Protection (Passive) -</strong> Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Night immune once. Once attacked, lose this passive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making this class night immune once presents a major roadblock for the unseen/cult. Being night immune once as a BD class is really annoying for evils.</p>
<p>I would remove the death immunity, and add a day ability with maybe 2 uses that would function similarly, giving death immunity for the night.</p>

<p>How I’m assuming it works is that the player selects the class type that cannot connect. If so, this is pretty balanced. I would have no problems with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rune of Stunning (Day Ability) - Prevent any further abilities used by target and further voting from them (3 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A major problem with many classes is being easily confirmed. I would add that the target of this ability will not know that their abilities/votes aren’t working.</p>

            <p>Well. In my point of view.</p>
<p>Rune Of Stunning is a single use target. It will not stop player from talking. But voting and ability usage.<br>
I also think noble should override this ability</p>
