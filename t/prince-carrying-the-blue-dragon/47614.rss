    <title>Prince carrying the Blue Dragon</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/prince-carrying-the-blue-dragon/47614</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always disliked the Prince&#39;s role in Throne of Lies. It feels it has a disproportionate amount of power. For one, it is by far the most powerful Blue Dragon class. I find this makes it a little swingy if it dies the first night.

I also predict a certain meta: Prince outs themselves day 1, gets every Physician and Knight on them, and can then precede to basically become the King, since if they lie, the real Prince kills them.

I&#39;d like to find a way to nerf the Prince and make it not guaranteed, but I have no idea how to do that.</description>

            <p>I definitely like the idea of making it so Distract causes the target to miss whispers, although that would be most powerful if they weren’t aware they were distracted.</p>
<p>What if Distract caused all messages you send and all whispers to you be <span class="bbcode-i">silently</span> discarded, with no indication to you that it’s happening?  Granted, it would probably need some other limiting factors, but making it like TB in that it can lead to miscommunications if people aren’t alert for it could be interesting.</p>
<p>(In this case it would probably still have to last only 10 seconds.  Distracting someone on the stand would be pretty overwhelming.  Or it could fail to work on someone who’s on the stand?  But “instantly distract someone when people start voting them up” would be devastating either way, if it lasted all day.)</p>
<p>Maybe just make it so people on the stand can always talk (although still not send / receive whispers successfully.)  People could use that as a workaround, but really, do you want to vote up the Prince just to be able to let them talk?</p>

</aside>
<p>Cult and NK can get the tools to deal with these things reliability because of how cult conversion works. The real problem is with the Unseen. The first step to helping that is making distract Prevent the target from whispering or hearing whispers (to them or not) for the whole day instead of it’s currently useless effect.</p>

            <p>The Psychic is entirely capable of doing 90% of what the Prince does in the Prince meta anyway.  They can’t execute or RB, but if you’re directing the entire court, those abilities aren’t as important.  I think the real danger here is whisper games, not the Prince specifically; the Prince is just an obvious person to use for them because of his power and ease of confirming.</p>
<p>If we want to prevent it, though…  perhaps something like the ToS blackmailer?  Super-buff Distract?  Give a whisper-listening day ability to the evils?  (Maid Spy is ok, but the chance of them having it at any point is low.)  Maybe even an evil ability that reads your entire whisper history, so evils can recover whispers retroactively - making whisper games more dangerous for the BD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, give evils more reliable access to a one-shot ability that auto-bypasses defenses.</p>
<p>(Part of the issue is that these tools <span class="bbcode-i">theoretically</span> exist, but practically the evils rarely have the converted person they need when they need them.  Other than the general “people can fake their old roles”, convert abilities have almost no impact on the meta.)</p>

            <p>ngl the Prince meta was literally <em>the</em> meta in my games in the whole Tournament For the Throne thing</p>
<p>BD won handily</p>
<p>However, I’m not convinced that means “nerf Prince”.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Prince is intentionally more powerful than other BD roles because doing so makes the NK / evil victory dependent on how fast they find the Prince, which in turn rewards them for smart play.  If every BD role were equal, choosing who to kill wouldn’t be nearly so important, and deduction wouldn’t matter as much for the evil side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also predict a certain meta: Prince outs themselves day 1, gets every Physician and Knight on them, and can then precede to basically become the King, since if they lie, the real Prince kills them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current meta seems to be much more biased towards the Prince trusting the King to protect them, for some reason - a side-effect of making the kings much more frequently good while also giving them 6 guards and nothing else to do (unless they have an identified evil to kill.)  This is risky if the King is evil, but the benefits if the King is good are pretty high.</p>

            <p>NK’s are currently decent examples. Reap bypasses healing and can bypass guards too. Possessor can use Knights against them and sorc can CoD everyone at once as I already said.</p>
<p>Enforcer and Sage are good examples for unseen classes that get get around the protection.</p>

            <p>I would like that idea. Some example ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot be healed of bleeding/poison twice.</li>
<li>Add more unstoppable kills.</li>

<p>Probably not great, but I think they could be a good starting point.</p>

            <p>Then we should try and deal with THAT problem instead. The threat of a sorcerer and the lack of initial coordination potential early on (and the fact that an assassin sacrificing himself to get in the way of that coordination is worth it) are examples of things that keep it in check.</p>

            <p>But in general you SHOULD reveal as Prince. That keeps protectives on you and guarantees your survival. If this becomes common play, it won’t be interesting anymore.</p>

            <p>He does serve the important purpose of being a big and obvious target for everyone involved however. He’s the only class that is so important that Unseen/Cult considers him “KILL IMMEDIATELY AT ALL COSTS!” And BD “PROTECT AT ALL COSTS!”. That may sound like a problem but it actually leads to lots of interesting Dynamics with the Unseen/Cult trying to find the Prince while everyone else is too but no one dares reveal him to the public.</p>

            <p>I have no idea. I’d personally like to see the Prince nerfed in some way bringing him down to power level, without a drastic rework, make him convertible and no longer guaranteed.</p>

            <p>Maybe Unseen needs a rampage attack too? (Enforcer frenzy anyone?)</p>

            <p>Besides that, even if the Prince doesn’t reveal, I feel the Blue Dragon has an over reliance on the Prince. No class should be too powerful, especially if it can’t be converted or evil, and I feel the Blue Dragon shouldn’t have him as a crutch.</p>

            <p>Not until night 3 at least. And besides, you can distribute the protection per night, Knights on n1, Physicians on n2, King on n3, etc. And that’s only if there is a Sorcerer.</p>
