    <title>ISO would be an awesome feature</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/iso-would-be-an-awesome-feature/77598</link>
    <description>Imagine this: You&#39;re an Observer and you are trying to decide who to follow. It&#39;s mid game so a bunch of people have their logs out, but the chat was going fast and you were active so you couldn&#39;t examine them closely. It&#39;s already night so you don&#39;t have a lot of time to examine the entire chat log to find the claims you missed. What do you do?

Or say your a Possessor and you are trying to predict who the Prince might be. There are subtle cues that might give this away but there is so much noise with everything at once it&#39;s hard to pick them out from just one person.

Or lets say you are a sheriff and you want to figure out who to check using someone&#39;s voting patterns. While you can search all system messages in general, you want to see if a specific player is worth checking based off of multiple trials and if they openly argued for or against specific lynches. 

All of these situations and more all have 1 thing in common. They require quickly knowing everything a specific player has said or done. From there you can try and pick out patterns and tells that might say what class they are and what faction they are, or just find something you missed from the chat going by quickly. 

Viewing all messages involving a selected player would allow all of these things to be done quickly and efficiently. 

All that would need to happen is a button in the chat history button where you can select a player to filter by messages that include that player. Specifically:

Messages said by that player
System messages by that player (votes, trials ect)
Ability&#39;s that include the player in the results (such as seeing them in follow or targeting them)
Whispers to an from that player

Further filtered by the tab you are in (public, system ect) 

Right now this is the feature I want the most. Even more than any specific balance change or rework or whatever.</description>

            <p>That was the conclusion we also came to on the discord, <s>and we explained it there, but apparently the solution was to go straight afterwards to the forum instead of addressing it</s></p>
<p>Edit: Yeah forget it, my memory is clouded. Bump was in the same time in both.</p>

            <p>In any case, with the current timing of the cycles, and the overall pressure for information, this would overall hurt the scum faction’s ability to win, as their mistakes would be more noticeable. In the Ideal game of mafia, you should be able to enter a game and have an equal chance of winning as a major faction as any other major faction. This laughably isn’t the case. And with an ISO feature, you would not only help the evils in obscure ways, but you would massively nerf them for every mistake that they made. This game is supposed to be fun. Sure, the BD faction does make mistakes. But the difference between the BD and evils is that BD has numbers to burn through, while evils do not. The NK has to play perfectly enough to not be noticed as evil. If you ISO the NK, you would probably see them making many mistakes, which the general noise of the court hides. While ISO would be helpful, it would give BD another advantage over evils. And quite frankly, the BD already wins over half of the time.</p>
