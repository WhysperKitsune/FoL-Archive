    <title>Merc living past 2nd contract</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/merc-living-past-2nd-contract/9246</link>
    <description>#### What happened?  It said I would commit suicide, I didn&#39;t.  Next night... I didn&#39;t.  Then they killed me because they thought I was lying.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?  I should have died after 2nd contract died

#### Steps to reproduce: No idea, started with Invoker (1) as contract, got Seeker (6) and second.  Maybe Seeker was converted?  No way to know.

#### Comments:  At least it was funny.</description>
