Co-host is Jane

## Rules
Follow the https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244, and the https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926. Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.

## Gameplay

* Day 1 lasts 24 hours and will not have an execution.
* Days last 48 hours, or until a majority is reached for execution. Nights last 24 hours.
* All actions must be sent to the host.
* This game features multiball with classic FoL cult points Mithras versus new ToL inspired Corax versus Blue Dragon. This means Mithras Cult can use cult points for abilities and Corax Cult cannot.
* Neutrals, Sheriff and Unseen cannot spawn. 
* Cults will talk through a special Discord server or forum message.
* If both Cult Leaders try to convert the same player, the Mithras Cult has priority.
* Neither Cult can convert the other Cult and they will get the same feedback as hitting a convert immune.
* Both cults show up as the general cult upon faction check.
* The Priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server or forum message.
* The Priest and Mystic may both spawn this match.



## Executions

* To accuse someone say “/vote [player]”. Please make the life of the hosts easier by bolding it (by putting ** ** around it)
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.
* When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.
* Voting &quot;/no execute&quot; is an option.
* You may self vote now.


## Picking a New King

* If there are less than 4 players a new king will not be selected.
* When the king dies a 24 hour period starts. In this, players may vote in their class PM for who they want to become the next king.
* Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned king. If votes are tied, a king election will be held the next day to determine it.


## Action Results

You find all possible night feedback here: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-hosting-feedback-guide/75082

[details=&quot;Action order&quot;]

Night abilities will be processed in following order/priority:
1. Visit Prevention
2. Occupation
3. Targetted redirection
4. Non targetted redirection (like Tavernkeeper)
5. Killing
6. Protection
7. Miscellaneous Effects (like Bounty)
8. Investigation 1 (Faction checks, type checks, etc)
9. Conversion
10. Investigation 2 (Every kind of investigation which checks for abilities used *this* night)

In case there are conflicts on the same level (example: two Drunks try to redirect the same player), all these conflicting effects are canceled.

(thx Geyde)

[details=&quot;Cult Points explanation (only applies to Mithras Cult)&quot;]
&gt; # [color=orangered]Cult Points[/color]
&gt; Cult Points are a system for deciding what abilities you gain when you are converted to the Mithras Cult. Each ability varies in cost (though they usually cost 1 point, and you usually have 2 points) and you are able to take any ability you once had from your former class, with some exceptions. **You are still limited to a maximum of two passives, two day abilities and two night abilities, including the ones from your new cult class.**
&gt; 
&gt; Cult Alts are abilities that have been altered to be balanced on a cult class. Most classes have at least one Cult Alt, and can buy it and/or normal abilities within Cult point maximum. You can not take the normal variant of an ability from your class if it has been modified to be a Cult Alt.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, if you were converted from The Archer you would have 2 Cult points, and could use them to pick a Day and Night ability from the possible Cult Alts. As you are limited to 2 day and 2 night abilities, your choices would be:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Archer Choice A&quot;]
&gt; &gt;# [color=orangered]The Mithras Acolyte :crossed_swords:  [/color]
&gt; &gt; [color=orangered]**Cult Killer**[/color]
&gt; &gt;**Spirit of Mithras (Passive)** - Starting with the second use of the Cult Leader&amp;rsquo;s Blood of Mithras, if you would be sacrificed, the first time you will not die.
&gt; &gt; **Flesh to Flesh (Day)** - Choose 2 players. If one of them is attacked tonight by a non-cult member then you will attack the other. - 2 uses
&gt; **Sacrilege (Night)** - If the Cult Leader’s conversion fails or they use Blood of Mithras, you will shoot their target for them instead. Does not count as a visit. - 2 uses
&gt; &gt;**Curse of Mithras (Night)** - If the target is bled tomorrow, they will die in 1 night instead of 2 nights. - 1 use :crown:
&gt; &gt;_Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and the Corax Cult._
&gt; [/details]
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Archer Choice B&quot;]

&gt; **Ancient Curse (Night)** - Mark a player for death. If a player has two marks, you will learn their exact class. If a player has three marks, you will kill them bypassing everything. - Infinite uses**
&gt; &gt;**Curse of Mithras (Night)** - If the target is bled tomorrow, they will die in 1 night instead of 2 nights. - 1 use :crown:
&gt; &gt;_Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and the Corax Cult._

&gt; **Armored (Passive)** - Your first successful use of Defend will not kill you, if the attacker doesn’t die to Defend.
&gt; **Defend (Night)** - You will guard the target player tonight, giving your life to kill their attacker(s). - Infinite uses :crown:
&gt; &gt;**Curse of Mithras (Night)** - If the target is bled tomorrow, they will die in 1 night instead of 2 nights. - 1 use :crown:

<p>i suppose what could happen is on even days, if there is no majority vote, then the top two wagons will be yeeted by plurality</p>
<p>but if a wagon hits majority then they get yeeted and if a bounty triggers then it could just act as normally, and allow a second execution in place of the first one</p>

            <p>Hunters are being overvalued in this thread as well I think. Blocking a conversion, in the event that it happens, isn’t the end of the world for a scumfaction. It doesn’t kill the converter. It’s bypassable. Most players are quite obvious with their class as well, so a block isn’t super likely in the first place. Here it would be funny, since the converter will likely think the hunter is the other scum faction.</p>
<p>Hunters are very fakeclaimable. If “bleeding to prove” they open themselves up for conversion, so their confirmation lasts just that day. The game is arbitrarily lengthened and so far nothing seems to give them more limited uses as well. This was one of my gripes with the 18 player change, but I’ve been gone since then so. <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>

<p>I’ll break my lurk for this, since it was my baby. This was more of a fun transitional game to fix up cult and have a game out of it too. From my perspective, the largest lesson I had was that in a larger game with multiball with things like conversion, you need more unconditional town power.</p>
<p>This could easily be adjusted in having one of these for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>1.5 executions, every even day has an extra execution</li>
<li>ITAs of some kind (quite similar)</li>
<li>2 Princes</li>
</ol>
<p>I would most prefer option 1, since nothing interacts with ITAs, it is a bit random to add that. Having power be in everyone’s hands and socially swayable is more fun than multiple Princes. I am aware town won, but it was very close and not really that deserved in my opinion. Have to remember that one scum faction died early.</p>
<p>Mithras was also badly outclassed in terms of balance in the original and that could use fixing if you’re actually going to run this (which I still think isn’t a great idea <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:">), because old Cult was just… <em>problematic</em>. Having to kill one of their own to be able to attack, unless they have some conditional converts… Having less kill power on top of that. Only thing mildly in their favor is slightly more power in their other abilities.</p>
<p>Disclaimer is that I have very little idea of how (Corax) Cult changed since then, so I’m not going in depth.</p>

<p>the more i think about TK alts the more i think this shouldn’t be a 2 pointer</p>
<p>bypassing redirection immunity in this case doesn’t actually change much so that being the metric for it being 2 points is kinda meh</p>
<p>like, the only real cases the bypassing has is preventing offensives from targetting a cultist or something, or very situationally stopping an archer from multi-shotting a cultist</p>
<p>this can be used to effectively strongman a kill but the bus driver ability can also do that nearly as well but with a 2nd use</p>
<p>meh</p>
