    <title>Court Wizard Rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework/46081</link>
    <description>Court Wizard is a pretty boring class. After discovering its roots, I have come up with this:

&gt;**[color=blue]Court Wizard (Unique Blue Dragon Support)[/color]**
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability: Tornado: Swap two players, making anyone who targets one of them target the other. Unlimited uses. Bypasses occupation immunity.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Magic Barrier: Prevent all negative effects on two targets besides death tonight, and the next day. 2 uses. Does not prevent death, poison, or bleeding.

Sage would remain the same.

Change log:
1: Barrier does not stop bleeding.
2: Made Unique
3: Formatting</description>

            <p>It is better than the Court Wizard, but I’d prefer something of more substance. Like a day ability, or some meaningful passives…</p>
<p>Overall, The whole concept of Court Wizard just seems like a boring class.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s good.</p>

<p>The significance is that it is a day Ability. Occupy Immunity bypassing isn’t a problem for jail as an example.

Putting it on the ability itself would not resolve the issue because there would still be the question of what happens if you swap yourself into an Occupy. Here it resolves before the Occupy has a chance to do anything so it would fail. At most you would just need to tweak the wording until it worked.</p>

<p>The only classes that need it for a balance reason are King and Prince, and Prince doesn’t visit target with execute, and it’s not a huge disaster if Guards! changes targets. The main problem is switching an Order Execution, but you should generally coordinate with King about that.</p>

            <p>Occupy Immunity isn’t for benefiting a certain class. It’s to stop either weird situations (2 Butler occupying each other) or balance reason (like the King).</p>
<p>There is no circumstance where we need to consider making sure occupy immunity is still useful.</p>

<p>If the former version was too powerful, that doesn’t mean a weaken version of it won’t work.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It actually wasn’t too powerful. People just found it a Negitive utility most times to tornado. Personally I disagree and making the CW have 2 Ability’s means that either approach works and a limited use empower means that you can effect OCC immune classes without removing the impact of having Occupy Immunity.</p>

<p>I think it is better if it can always bypass immunity, since otherwise many classes simply aren’t subject to it (occupiers, Drunk, Alcoholic, Hunter, etc.</p>
<p>Even so, I would be okay with your suggestion.</p>

            <p>We already had a more powerful version of this. Personally I’d just make tornado infinite and give a 2 time day empower that makes it bypass Immunity. Nothing else would be changed exept for giving Sage the same empower.</p>

            <p>Most abilities can lead to unfortunate outcomes. You can check a framed target. You can Cold Steel a blue dragon member and die. Are they bad abilities due to their fallibility?</p>
<p>I don’t think the chance for error is a reason to dismiss the ability.</p>
<p>Also can’t Drunk also cause Knight to suicide due to Cold Steel?</p>

            <p>Even when used this way it often led to unfortunate outcomes. Swapping a confirmed BD with a likely evil could lead to a Hunter/Alchemist being redirected to the BD and getting them killed. Even worse is when a knight CSes an evil and commits suicide because they were redirected, “confirming” the evil as BD.</p>
<p>I do support the idea of a CW change, but I’m not sure giving back infinite swaps is the way to do it</p>

            <p>Sounds like it should be unique then.</p>
<p>Also, it’s hard to see how a clever Court Wizard could fail to be useful. An example would be switching a high priority Blue Dragon with someone you think could be evil. Then if the BD is attacked, you protect them and take out an evil. It probably would be a more complicated class to pull off, though.</p>

            <p>Non-unique court wizards with infinite tornadoes was a thing a while back and wasn’t very fun, especially since back then occupy immunity didn’t stop the redirect and being redirected 3 times didn’t give immunity. It wasn’t uncommon to have your target switched two or more times a night and it was incredibly annoying for invest classes who would often end up being redirected to the same player multiple times over the course of a game. People also complained even when they were playing a court wizard, since it never felt like you achieved anything by switching people.</p>
<p>I guess it could be different now, since being redirected 3 times gives you immunity to it, but I’m not sure</p>

            <p>Court Wizard is a pretty boring class. After discovering its roots, I have come up with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><font color="blue">Court Wizard (Unique Blue Dragon Support)</font></strong></p>
<p>Night Ability: Tornado: Swap two players, making anyone who targets one of them target the other. Unlimited uses. Bypasses occupation immunity.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Magic Barrier: Prevent all negative effects on two targets besides death tonight, and the next day. 2 uses. Does not prevent death, poison, or bleeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sage would remain the same.</p>
<p>Change log:<br>
1: Barrier does not stop bleeding.<br>
2: Made Unique<br>
3: Formatting</p>
