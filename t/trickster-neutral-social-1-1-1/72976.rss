Don&#39;t think there are any others correct me if I&#39;m wrong. 

If you get a prevented message it won&#39;t effect investigates they will still get results, if you get &quot;forced&quot; you will think you targeted that player.

Class info:

[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
The Trickster is a &quot;Social&quot; Neutral Class.

The Trickster must see Blue Dragon lose, letting them side with the Unseen/Cult or Neutrals, making them a great ally for both alike.

The Trickster can Create false Information and mess around with the votes to cause chaos also preventing day actions, they can make players appear evil or to appear good, also can learn information in rare situations using false feedback or disguise to help find there allies or other information.

<p>Seems useless NGL, why would someone ever use this besides faking noble, as well it doesn’t help with they can  confirm 100% as noble because they aren’t looking for NE they are looking for the apostle.</p>
