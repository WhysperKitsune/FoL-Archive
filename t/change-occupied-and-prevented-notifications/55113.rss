    <title>Change occupied and prevented notifications</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-occupied-and-prevented-notifications/55113</link>
    <description>I believe that if you are not able to perform your night action, whether you were occupied or prevented from visiting them, you should get the same message. &quot;You were unable to perform your night action.&quot; or something similar. I believe this could give scum more options when writing their fake logs, as well as make social deduction more important. For example, if you know someone tried to visit a jailed target, you can write in your logs that you occupied them. This could also help add more abilities that prevent visits in the future without making them too confirmable.</description>
