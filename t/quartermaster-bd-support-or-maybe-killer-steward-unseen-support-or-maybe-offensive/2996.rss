    <description># The Quartermaster
**Blue Dragon Something**
**Recognisable Craft(Passive)** - You will know when someone uses an ability you gave them and who they use it on
**Falsify(Day)** - The equipment you give tonight will fail to perform its purpose - Infinite Uses
**Give Shield(Night)** - Give a shield to a player, during the day they may choose to exchange their night action for &quot;**Use Shield(Night)** - Use your shield to protect a player or yourself&quot;, if the Shield was falsified then it will not protect anyone - Infinite Uses
**Give Sword(Night)** - Give a sword to a player, during the day they may choose to exchange their night action for &quot;**Use Sword(Night)** - Use your sword to kill a player&quot;, if the Sword was falsified it will not protect anyone - Infinite Uses

# The Steward
the same but the sword is a dagger that occupies but the people you give it to still think it is a sword(will do proper writeup later)

            <p>That’s an interesting point – is the sword or shield a one time use Jammy?</p>
<p>If it was it’d be better, but it would also discourage players with 2 night abilities from accepting it as often.</p>

            <p>and even so, the swapping is voluntary<br>
i do agree though, it doesnt look like the items are one-shot, but i think they should be, or at least a one-shot if falsified<br>
and i just thought: does giving a sword/shield work if the target doesnt already have a night ability</p>

            <p>I think it’s great! You can buff weaker roles while giving you a good amount of info at the same time.</p>
<p>Some other uses: Give a shield to a bd King and to the Prince and have them guard each other.</p>
<p>Give a fake sword/shield to a suspected evil to make them lose an ability.</p>
<p>Give a Sword and Shield to your merc. You will know if they are converted now</p>
<p>Give the priest a shield after having res someone to protect that person. If the priest is converted then the protection will stop.</p>
<p>Basically. If someone has a limited use ability and they are out then give them a shield. So much protection means not that meny deaths</p>

            <p>The Quartermaster IS pretty bad in this iteration.</p>
<p>Is your point that it is so weak that the only reasonable use is to test others with a false sword or shield? While the information of how the sword/shield is used, it does not definitively prove somebody guilty or innocent. Real BD players will make mistakes and you’ll mislynch them, and smart evil players will use their sword/shield intelligently and win your trust.</p>
<p>Your argument is incredibly flimsy. Just remember that changing your mind is an important part of Throne of Lies.</p>

            <p>The quarter master is terrible as a support.</p>
<p>He has to give people swords or shields, making them replace an ability for it. It costs another person to protect someone.</p>
<p>Same for the sword.</p>
<p>It clearly was made for the purpose of reading what people were doing.</p>

            <p>Correct but not social in terms of roles. Scum Reading is more of passive thing that everyone can use.</p>

<p>half the talk here is about using it to scum read. It is the ultimate scum reading class (besides king). Scum reading is social, so might this class.</p>

            <p>I just realized how good this role could be for confirming some roles such as CW or Knight since they have no reason not to use it. You could also do something like gave a fake sword to a phys claim. If the person is an Assassin claiming CW/Knight/Phys then if they want to kill off important BD like outed Prince they have to reveal that they aren’t protecting him. And since it replaces a night ability then if for example you give it to a CL… Awkward much? Conclusion: this role is better than you might think if your good at scumreading. This is not a bad thing btw.</p>

            <p>Question.<br>
When using a falsified item, will it still appear to the user as if they had used an actual item, and that they targeted someone, or are they “mysteriously occupied”, and, do they <em>actually</em> visit the target, but the ability has no effect?</p>
