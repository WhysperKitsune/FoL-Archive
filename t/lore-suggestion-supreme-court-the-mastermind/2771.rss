The frail old man walked throughout the icy wasteland as he just got kicked out of Castle Demwir with his determined servant, of whom, would do anything to see his master not only survive but to thrive.

They eventually after around a week, surviving using only what they could find through foraging and hunting, found Castle Adiart. The castle was small when they found it, however, it quickly grew in populous.

Although the two had been in the castle for so many years, they got shunned from the senior court. Because of this, they plot revenge against the senior court, of which eventually was to be called the Blue Dragon. Because the servant was willing to do anything, he began killing off those who were in the senior court, starting with the Butler. 

Eventually, they got accepted into the Senior Court, however, there was malice in their hearts from having killed so many to get into the court, hence the reason why they have never stopped killing. We shall seek out the Sheriff for the interrogation on this mysterious group.
