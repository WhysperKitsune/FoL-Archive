    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Pretender (Offensive Neutral) (Unique)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-pretender-offensive-neutral-unique/40822</link>
    <description>&gt; ## [color=tan]The Pretender[/color]
&gt; **[color=gray]Neutral Offensive[/color]**
**No Allegiance (Passive)** - Upon becoming King, you start with 0 charges of Guards!
**Royal Blood (Passive)** - You can put your name forward for nomination to become the next King before non-Royals.
**Diplomatic Agreement (Day)** - Your trial vote will match the majority. An even split will make you abstain instead. - 3 uses
**Ballot Mixing (Day)** - Reverse the King&#39;s vote during trial. If they voted to execute, they will instead pardon and vice versa. Affects Decide Fate. - 2 uses
**Family Matters (Night)** - Discover the King&#39;s faction. You will be unable to whisper/speak the next day. You will appear suspicious to Investigative classes for the rest of the game. - 1 use
**Subterfuge (Night)** - Inhibit the King’s day abilities. The King will be unable to use Point Finger or Decide Fate for 1 day. - 2 uses
_Become King and stay King for either 4 days or until the end of the game, whichever comes first_

I designed this class with some feedback and help. Thanks Ashe for the ability idea! Let me know what you think!

This class is meant to be a relatively diplomatic class where you gain the trust of the court, rather than working against them. I am open to creative criticism.</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t help the Pretender to learn the Kings alignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m open to other ideas. I actually thought about making the Pretender suspicious for the rest of the game if he was to use Family Matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fratricide makes it almost impossible for the Starting King to live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ability was designed before the King changes. Now that starting King is much more powerful, the original idea behind Fratricide is twisted. I think it will humble the starting King. There is also a massive cooldown on the ability, so the longer it takes to use it, the less time you may have to step up. This is countered by the fact that the King may use his Guards on himself. Fratricide is blocked by Guards! and Knight, and can be seen by Observer. The King will know this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be interesting if he had measures to deal with other Royals, like nullifying Royal Blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge comes in having the court vote you up and then let you live for 4 days without the ability to guard yourself. This class is meant to be challenging. If you had an ability that could basically say “lol nope” to the other royals, there wouldn’t be much challenge.</p>
<p>I appreciate the feedback though. Family Matters may need to be ripped out entirely.</p>

            <p>Hi TinyDeer, thank you a ton for the feedback.</p>
<p>I’ve made a few changes based on your feedback:</p>
<p>Fratricide will now take a day to work. The initial visit can be prevented by a Knight, and seen by Observers/Nightwatches, but it can’t be healed at any point by an Alchemist or Physician. It will recharge two days after the murder attempt. I’m keeping the name because lorewise, it holds more weight. He was cheated for succession by his brother.</p>
<p>Ballot Mixing is a difficult one to fix. Before I posted this, there was no second day ability, and I felt like a Social class needs two day abilities. Ashe actually came up with this ability, so I am looking for ideas for other fitting day abilities.</p>
<p>For Family Matters, I considered your idea, and I think we can find a happy medium. Any investigative ability that works on the King needs a decent downside. So how about one day of silence, and two days of showing up as suspicious to an investigative.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your incredibly fair review of the class. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Honestly, I love this idea. Like, a <em>lot</em>. It’s a more interesting and subtle version of vote manipulation with a unique and challenging goal. I think what you have is <em>great</em>, but here are my reactions, for whatever they’re worth:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="anon98616575" data-post="1" data-topic="40822">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>No Allegiance (Passive) - Upon becoming King, you start with 0 charges of Guards!</p>
<p>Royal Blood (Passive) - You can put your name forward for nomination to become the next King before non-Royals.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>These are fine. The only drawback is that it’ll be pretty easy to get killed as King before the four days are up, but that’s part of the challenge: you would have to convince the protector classes to guard/heal you or get Evils to think you’re evil. I suppose that the feel of the class wouldn’t be functionally different than Neutral King, but I don’t see that as a problem since this class is all about disguising yourself.</p>

<p>I. Love. This. Ability. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=9" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"> It’s subtle and can help keep you in the background. It also doesn’t reveal that the Pretender is in the game.</p>

</aside>
<p>At first I thought this was unnecessary and would instantly reveal that the Pretender was in the game, but now I see it’s a way to throw suspicion onto the King. The only serious issue I see is that it’s confirmable, which I think is best kept at a minimum in ToL. I would be disincentivized to use this ability because it would make people suspicious of an unreliable Royal Blood claim. It’s hard enough to get elected with a fake claim as it is - I don’t see how this helps. Removing this ability (and perhaps giving an extra charge to Dipl. Agreement) would preserve Pretender as a plausible fake claim as well. Of course, an Evil King could always fake claim that a Pretender changed his vote to exe a BD, so this comment’s arguments may be moot. Confirmability is something to keep in mind, though.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem with this ability is that you would <strong>always</strong> use it the first night. Also, the two-day speech ban is pretty significant. Instead of limiting your speech, what if the cost of discovering the King’s faction is that you appear Suspicious/Unseen/etc. to all investigative classes for two nights?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fratricide (Night) - Prevent all visitors to the king besides himself, and attack him. - 1 use, can not be used before night 3</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Consider renaming it <strong>Regicide</strong>. Fratricide = killing a brother, Regicide = killing a king.</p>
<p>I’d be curious to see how this would work in practice, as it makes the king’s survivability very difficult. What if it went through healing (phys, alch) but not a Knight? That could both boost the Knight’s relevance early/mid-game as well as make it harder for the Pretender to guess when the King is vulnerable.</p>
<p>That being said, I think it’s an interesting possibility to have Pretender games tend to lead to kings dropping left and right. It might be too much chaos, but the Pretender may not win the first election. If he loses the election, maybe his charges for Regicide/Fratricide could be reset to 1? If it doesn’t go through Knights, then the risk is still there, and this gives him another chance as well as makes him more directly influential as the game progresses.</p>
<p>Again, I <em>love</em> this idea. I’d want to see it put in the game next week, and I’m usually quite bearish on the viability of class suggestions.</p>
