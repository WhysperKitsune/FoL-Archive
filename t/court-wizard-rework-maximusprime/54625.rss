    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework-maximusprime/54625</link>
    <description> &gt;[b][color=blue]Court Wizard (BD Support)[/color][/b]
&gt;
&gt;Passive 1: Arcane Armor - If you would die(at night), you will instead start bleeding and die the next night unless you are healed. Can only be activated once
&gt;(Note: I can also change this to make it so he dies one night later, so it&#39;s simply unhealable)
&gt;
&gt;Day Ability 1: Poof! - Tonight anyone trying to target the person you selected will be prevented. Cannot target king (2)
&gt;(Note: basically ice ward lol, dunno why I changed the name)
&gt;
&gt;Night Ability 1: Charm - Your target will be unable to use abilities on the person you select tonight. Can select self as second target. (attempts will fail, it will show as prevented to the Charmed tarhrt). (Infinite)
&gt;(Note: I can just make this Magic Barrier, but lots of people think it&#39;s not fun to use, so I tried giving a different ability)
&gt;
&gt;Night Ability 2: One Way Portal - Redirect anyone visiting your first target to the second. Cannot select the king. Bypasses occ immunity (3)
&gt;(Note: Different than Tornado, gives reliable defense to him or an important BD class. Can reduce uses if it&#39;s too OP)

&gt;[b][color=purple]The Sage (Unseen Support)[/color][/b]
&gt;
&gt;Passive 1: Forbidden Magic - If the assassin was attacked(at night), you will use up your life force and heal him. You will die the next night but you get a charge on all abilities and cannot be occupied. Cannot be healed.
&gt;
&gt;Day ability 1: Transfigure - Make your target appear as the class of your choice if they are executed the next day. Cannot target king. (Infinite) 
&gt;(Note: basically a day defile and helps unseen with fake claiming)
&gt;
&gt;Night Ability 1: Paradox - Your target will be unable to use abilities on the Unseen tonight. All attempts will be shown as prevented. (3)
&gt;
&gt;Night Ability 2: Dark Dimension: Redirect anyone visiting your first target to the second. Does not affect the Unseen and cannot select the king. Bypasses occ immunity. (2)

BTW I got the &quot;One Way Portal&quot; idea from RawkHawk

Changelog:
- Added explanations and possible buffs/nerfs to the abilities(3/26/18)
- Changed Paradox, removed Steal Voice, and made charm a night ability(3/26/18)
- Changed wording slightly of Charm/Paradox and made Paradox 3 uses. Also changed passive back to original name cause I thought sorc passive was called Arcane Armor and not Mage Armor lmao(3/27/18)
- Added &quot;Forbidden Magic&quot; passive to the Sage</description>

            <p>I guess he could, I was thinking that it wouldn’t be useful much because it frees open a conversion slot and allows him to make bolder plays and have more powerful abilities. Besides it’s only useful against alch yolo(rarely), knight can(unlikely), or possessor attacked him(also unlikely). I guess I could make it so that if the assassin is attacked, you heal him and die the next night?</p>

            <p>I was thinking about it not giving him feedback from it, so it’s not as powerful. Also a lot of people have been asking for a day defile, and I think it is pretty fun. Night defile already barely gets used anyway. I guess I’ll try to tone him down a bit lol</p>

            <p>Personally, not a huge fan of giving cw 2 day abilities and 2 night abilities. While it’s definitely a way to make him more interesting, it also makes him incredibly powerful. I don’t think the current abilities are too strong except magician’s secret. This basically makes him a better investigator, since he can just get the feedback from his ability and know who he copied. And if he failed he knows they’re scum. I personally have wanted an ability like this, but I think it has to be on a neural for it to work.</p>
<p>As for the Sage, steal voice is a free miss lynch since you can make them say anything. I think it might be more balanced to have it work like blackmail in ToS. Transfigure is a little under powered, but overall I don’t like the idea of changing classes during the day. I think execution should stay a confirmed source of information.</p>
<p>Overall the biggest problem I have with Sage is it doesn’t emulate your court wizard at all. Almost all unseen class are copies of their bd class excluding Hunter and Sheriff, and this will make fake claiming as sage more difficult.</p>

            <p>I like One Way Portal because it basically gives Invoker a BD claim aside from Drunk.</p>
<p>Charm is interesting but too confirmable. Poof is probably too strong.</p>
<p>Sage is nutso strong but it’ll help stop the pronce meta so I’m cool with it.</p>

            <p>Well I guess it is slightly obvious when there’s a covert sometimes. I guess I can make it so the person won’t know their voice was stolen and won’t see anything the sage says. Besides Unseen need to kill off members if they aren’t being found because having stale members is never a good idea. It also pairs well if they are on trial, and you used Transfigure the day before, so you don’t just randomly use it’s the beginning of the day, as that makes it too obvious, so you need to play smart.</p>

            <p>I really like the arcane armor passive, but I feel like a few of your abilities might be too revealing. Steal voice, for example, BD would immediately know the next day that their is a sage, assuming you don’t kill whoever you stole from.</p>
