          <p>So you are scum again, huh? And you are being called out by someone? How do you get out of it this time? Maybe the below scenarios and tactics might keep you alive one more night - which could be enough.</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> A psychic sends a message saying ‘X is <font color="purple"><strong>Unseen</strong></font>’</p>
<ol>
<li>You die. Pretty much no way out of this unless unseen have majority - or enough to block the vote.</li>
<li>Claim to be a victim of an <font color="purple"><strong>Illusionist</strong></font> and claim your role and faked night actions. This will only be possible to pull off if an illusionist has already tricked someone this game. It is literally your own defence here, and until <font color="blue"><strong>Psychic</strong></font> is nerfed, or illusionist can send telepathic messages (Hint, hint developers <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png!v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">) you are pretty much dead for sure.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B)</strong> Someone steps forward and claims to be a Psychic and claims ‘X is <strong><font color="purple">unseen</font></strong>’</p>
<ol>
<li>This is still pretty likely to lead you to die, and will only happen if the psychic has already used two messages. You probably die at this point. Your best shot is to Counter Claim the Psychic and bait them into using the Misdirect ability and make someone vote. The only problem is, they are likely to make them vote for you, and a real psychic can’t make someone vote for themselves. If the Psychic is out of all day charges, Counter claiming them is your best bet.</li>
<li>Follow the same Illusionist strategy as before.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C)</strong> A Psychic, either by message or in person steps forward and claims “X is <font color="grey"><strong>Neutral</strong></font>”</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are a <font color="grey"><strong>Fool</strong></font>, play your cards right and you might just be able to get a win</li>
<li>If you aren’t a Fool, and are a Neutral Killer, consider if the game has evidence of a Fool in it, then make sure you sell to your accusers that you are a Fool and should not execute you. This however is risky, as it may not work (even if a Fool is in the game) and you are likely to be executed by a <font color="blue"><strong>Prince</strong></font> at night or attacked at night by a <strong><font color="blue">Knight</font></strong> - both of which are likely to spell your doom. Avoid doing this if a Prince is alive and can still execute.</li>
<li>If you are <font color="grey"><strong>Mercenary</strong></font> or <strong><font color="grey">Alchemist</font></strong>, and have done things to prove your role (Blurred people/defended your Contract etc.) considerer claiming your role and hope someone backs you up. This is a safer bet for Mercenary than Alchemists, as Blue Dragons are more likely to lynch Alchemists as potential threats, and if you have murdered any Blue Dragons, they are likely to take a dim view on this as well. It is not advisable as a Neutral Killer to claim to be these roles, as you will be expected to provide evidence - which you will be unable to. However, they might be your best shot if all else fails. Sometimes people take pity on Neutrals - sometimes at least.</li>
<li>If they stepped forward rather than use a message, the same sort of strategy can be tried as in the Unseen example and Counter Claim them. However, it is much less likely to work, so I’d advise against it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>D)</strong> A Sheriff accuses you of being a member of the <strong><font color="purple">Unseen</font></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you haven’t had your role claimed in public (Been forced to or had it a Prince’s will) the most affective strategy is to Counter Claim as the Sheriff - You will need a very believable will however to pull this off, and will need to be quick. It won’t probably save you, but if the Prince is dead and you are convincing you can get a freelo mislynch in the bargain.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can try claiming to be a victim of an Illusionist as in the Psychic example - Also unlikely to work unless an Illusionist has been confirmed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>E)</strong> A Princess accuses you of being a ‘Killer’</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the least threatening claim to deal with - as Princesses are not unique, and their results not so reliable. You could claim <strong><font color="blue">Knight</font></strong> and submit a believable will. This can work, but you do soft confirm the Princess as ‘legit’ in doing so.</li>
<li>Call the Princess and liar and either counter claim or submit your faked role and journal. This will be a battle of the most believable and  you actually want to avoid lynching the Princess too early into the game, but later on the mislynch could be invaluable. If nothing else, it might prevent your death.</li>
<li>Claim to be a victim of an Illusionist. Same flaws as any other time, will also confirm the Princess as ‘legit’ to - although you can at least try to accuse them of being the Illusionist.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>F)</strong> An Observer tracks you to a killing/evil activity</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim a role that is benign to those it visits (Princess/Observer/Sheriff[Will get you counter claimed so be prepared for it!]Noble[Will require assistance from your converted twin/a willing team mate]). Do not ever claim to be a Knight, Alchemist or Physician as that would require you to have healed/protected the target (unless you are accused of converting them). Butler can work if the target is dead as they can’t claim they weren’t occupied. This however, will make the Observer ‘Legit’ so be warned.</li>
<li>Claim the Observer is lying, and submit your faked role/will. This can work, as long as you are convincing! Observer is a common scum claim, so you might be able to use it to your advantage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>G)</strong> An Observer watches you kill someone</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are the only visitor, your only defence is the accuse the Observer as lying, using the advice in the example <em>F)2)</em>
</li>
<li>If their are multiple visitors, claim the other visitor/s were the killer and state your benign reason for visiting. Make sure you push the other person as hard as you can.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>H</strong>) A Sheriff is able to note that they could not convert you to a Knight</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim to be Neutral - specifically Mercenary or Alchemist. The Sheriff, if not yet revealed, is unlikely to out himself over that.</li>
<li>Claim to be a Princess or Noble - These are roles that also can’t be made into knights, however be wary of claiming to be a noble as that will require you naming someone to back your claim as your twin.</li>
<li>If the Sheriff dies the night they try and convert you (and note they did) consider claiming to now be a knight as that could keep suspicion off you.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Helping fellow scum being accused by an investigation result</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pick your battles. If it is early on, and the Mastermind can convert a new member, let them die a hero to the cause!</li>
<li>Listen to their defence - if it is plausible enough, urge others to vote innocent. If they accuse someone else, start a ‘counter wagon’ to try and split the votes as much as possible and get either someone else up or nobody up.</li>
<li>Consider stepping forward with alternative results - then make as much noise as you can pushing your lead instead. Hopefully, this will enable even more vote splitting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope these basic tips were helpful - I’d be delighted to here some of your tactics in the comments!</p>

<p>I’ll always fondly remember getting hanged D2 by Psychic when I was MM.<br>
Psychic was like a mini-Prince who could get classes at night<br>
Or act as a better Sheriff<br>
Who could also confirm themselves to 100% be BD</p>
<p>…but those days…are behind us thankfully.</p>
