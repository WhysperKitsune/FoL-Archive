    <title>Less than 16 player games - suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/less-than-16-player-games-suggestion/18211</link>
    <description>Hello All,

I would like to request the ability to remake a game when it starts with less than a full team. This seems to be happening more and more frequently and it is very un-fun to play as Blue Dragon in these games. I understand that coding in a remake system may be a lot of work so can people at least leave a 14 player game without penalty? The worst is playing BD with and evil king - it is nearly impossible to win. 

Let me know your thoughts.</description>

            <p>Both suggestions are good.</p>
<p>Majority vote to start, plus double-checking that there are 16 players.</p>
<p>Also NKs shouldn’t spawn with under 13 or so players - the amount of kills gets too high and BD insta-loses</p>

            <p>I think the system just needs to double check 16 people actually joined the game before starting. It usually auto starts, and the person who joined is kicked out before joining properly.</p>

            <p>Yeah, 14 player games are nearly impossible when they happen.</p>

            <p>I second this, IMO one of 2 things should happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>starting with less than 16 people, should be restricted to private games. 9/10 times when the game starts with less than 16 people, there’s also like 5 leavers n1, because most people don’t like those games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make starting early a democratic option… if there’s 14 people in the game, 7 or more need to vote for an early start, for the game to start.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As it is right now, one person overriding the decision of the other 13 in the room, is just silly.</p>
