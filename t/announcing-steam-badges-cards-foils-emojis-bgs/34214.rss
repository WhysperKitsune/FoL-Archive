Introducing Steam Trading Cards + badges + emojis + backgrounds of different rarities! 

Collect and trade via Steam just by playing the game, purchasing gold, or trading. Who will be the first to earn them all?

Existing players may find new inventory items, too! It seems that it considers your existing playtime :)

There&#39;s also a new **#trading-cards** channel in our Discord @ https://discord.gg/tol</description>
