    <title>{Class suggestions} Vampire (my attempt for a vampire class in TOL)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestions-vampire-my-attempt-for-a-vampire-class-in-tol/53051</link>
    <description>**Name - The Vampire** 
**_Class - offensive_** 
**_Faction - Neutral_** 

At the start of the game you are given two targets, similar to scorn. The targets CAN&#39;T have royal blood. Meaning your targets can&#39;t be Drunk,Noble,princess, prince, etc...

**Passive 1:** 
_**Quick escape**_ - you are immune to death once. 

**Passive 2:** 
_**Failure**_ - (similar to merc) if both your targets die then you will parish.  



**Day Ability 1:**
_**Injection**_ - give someone royal blood. When you do this it will appear as you whispering to the player. (0 uses)

**Day Ability 2:** 
_**Bat messenger**_ - all whispers to and from your target or any converted player will be hidden from the public.(unlimited uses)

**Night ability 1**
**_Just a bit_** - suck someone&#39;s blood. If they have royal blood then you will keep it and gain a use for your Day Ability 1. Suck a players blood 3 times and they will die, goes through all kinds of immunity. (Unlimited uses). 

**Night Ability 2** 
_**Hypnotizing glare**_ - convert a play into one of your severest. They will remain their original class but three things will change. (Two uses) (normal conversion rules are applied) (if you cant convert then your ability will not take a use)
 1) they will appear Neutral to checks. 
2) their win condition will change to &quot;help the Vampire win at all cost&quot;
3) When they are converted, they will know who the vampire is. 

**Win condition** - have one of your targets become the king. Then you must help them win with their current faction

Notes: 
- if your target becomes the king and then dies afterwords then you still have to help the faction he was apart of. Unless other target becomes king. 


**_Why does he have so much stuff??_**
**Answer**: you must consider that it is going to be very hard for this class to win. Here are the steps;
1) find a player with royal blood. 
2) hope your targets don&#39;t die or hopefully you converted a knight to help guard a target. 
3) give royal blood to your target without being suspicious 
4) get current king killed 
5) get your target to be king. 
6) help his current faction win.</description>

            <p>Also i want to hear your feedback about the double conversion. Say vampire converts the Drunk. Should unseen/cult be able to convert the drunk onto their side after that first conversion or would they be immune?</p>

            <p>That was a typing error. Only suppose to be 2 day abilities and the third passive was supposed to be deleted also. I probably forgot to delete it</p>

            <p>Also something to be careful about. You have 3 day ability’s and 3 passives on the class. You can only have 2 of each ability type (passive, day and night)</p>

            <p>Conversion immunity affects this class too. If someone is convert immune then they can’t be converted by vamp either. And that includes Unseen/Cult.</p>
<p>Also make it a night ability somehow, It should also be affected by CW barrier, Sheriff scout and Pally Smite ect.</p>

            <p>If you convert a MM then you won’t need to worry about that. It’s far more likely that at least one of your targets is BD in which case you would go with that one and lynch all the Unseen so you can win. And you know who all the Unseen are because the MM you converted would just tell you.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes but it’s far more likely he’s just going to vote up one of the BD targets and then Bus the Unseen for the win.</p>

</aside>
<p>Can you convert Unseen, Cult or Neutrals? I think it’s interesting, but I don’t think we should have converting neutrals, the main faction does that. However, it might be interesting to have a power that makes someone vote for your target to be King.</p>

            <p>no you make a good point. But say the vampire converts the MM. The MM then can convert the vampires target to unseen and then help get him to become King. That way he will be evil king and vampire is now helping evil win.</p>

            <p>Tell me what you think. Too OP or not powerful enough? Would a class like this fit into the game? To difficult to win/lose? Or just stupid <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"><img src="/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=9" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:">.</p>

            <p><strong>Name - The Vampire</strong><br>
<strong><em>Class - offensive</em></strong><br>
<strong><em>Faction - Neutral</em></strong></p>
<p>At the start of the game you are given two targets, similar to scorn. The targets CAN’T have royal blood. Meaning your targets can’t be Drunk,Noble,princess, prince, etc…</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1:</strong><br>
<em><strong>Quick escape</strong></em> - you are immune to death once.</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2:</strong><br>
<em><strong>Failure</strong></em> - (similar to merc) if both your targets die then you will parish.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1:</strong><br>
<em><strong>Injection</strong></em> - give someone royal blood. When you do this it will appear as you whispering to the player. (0 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2:</strong><br>
<em><strong>Bat messenger</strong></em> - all whispers to and from your target or any converted player will be hidden from the public.(unlimited uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong><br>
<strong><em>Just a bit</em></strong> - suck someone’s blood. If they have royal blood then you will keep it and gain a use for your Day Ability 1. Suck a players blood 3 times and they will die, goes through all kinds of immunity. (Unlimited uses).</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2</strong><br>
<em><strong>Hypnotizing glare</strong></em> - convert a play into one of your severest. They will remain their original class but three things will change. (Two uses) (normal conversion rules are applied) (if you cant convert then your ability will not take a use)</p>
<ol>
<li>they will appear Neutral to checks.</li>
<li>their win condition will change to “help the Vampire win at all cost”</li>
<li>When they are converted, they will know who the vampire is.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Win condition</strong> - have one of your targets become the king. Then you must help them win with their current faction</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>if your target becomes the king and then dies afterwords then you still have to help the faction he was apart of. Unless other target becomes king.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Why does he have so much stuff??</em></strong><br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: you must consider that it is going to be very hard for this class to win. Here are the steps;</p>
<ol>
<li>find a player with royal blood.</li>
<li>hope your targets don’t die or hopefully you converted a knight to help guard a target.</li>
<li>give royal blood to your target without being suspicious</li>
<li>get current king killed</li>
<li>get your target to be king.</li>
<li>help his current faction win.</li>
