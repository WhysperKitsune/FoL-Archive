    <title>New Player Game Giveaway</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-player-game-giveaway/44387</link>
    <description>Hi everyone! Coin the Newbie Guide here, with a special treat! As everyone knows, I run new player friendly games where our new players can come play with the pros and voice chat to ask questions and get strategy advice in a salt-free environment. Well, I have some Steam codes for the game and a platform, why not do a giveaway? Players of all skill level are welcome, and in post-game chat, I&#39;ll roll a 1-16 random number generator, the winner of which will receive a free Steam code for the game to get their friends in! Please sign up using the link below, and keep an eye on the forum and on discord for more information!

            <p>I’m still waiting for a full game to do the giveaway. Only had 6 bites so far. Once I get my headset fixed and start streaming newbie games again, I will probably get it filled up. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
