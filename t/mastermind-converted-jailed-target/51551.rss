    <title>Mastermind converted jailed target</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mastermind-converted-jailed-target/51551</link>
    <description>What Happened:
So, I&#39;ve been having weird connectivity issues that are probably due to my side. However, it&#39;s caused some weird situations. Just now I had a game as Prince where I had jailed the slot 3 player, a physician. In the middle of the night, I lagged out for a moment and when I reconnected, it was day and the slot 16 Sheriff was claiming that his Scout on 3 was triggered by a conversion. Obviously this seemed impossible, so I dragged him to jail and executed him for being a Scorned. But he wasn&#39;t. He was actually a sheriff and 3 actually was converted while in jail.

What Should&#39;ve Happened:
Obviously, the physician should&#39;ve been safe from conversions because being stuffed in my cozy little cell is supposed to act as a prevention. Instead, they were in a state of jailed, but not.

Steps to reproduce:
I&#39;m not sure when the game recognized that I had disconnected and attempted reconnection because I could talk just fine while 3 was jailed. My log reverted back to before I input that I jailed 3, but I did that at night. As far as reproducing it, I have no idea.

Comments:
Side Note - I also got pushed on because a Butler loudly proclaimed I had to be NK for being occupy immune. That was weird and added to the confusion.</description>

            <p>That’s because of a bug. The ability is SUPPOSED to be not including them on the list of possible converts when randomly selecting one.</p>

            <p>What Happened:<br>
So, I’ve been having weird connectivity issues that are probably due to my side. However, it’s caused some weird situations. Just now I had a game as Prince where I had jailed the slot 3 player, a physician. In the middle of the night, I lagged out for a moment and when I reconnected, it was day and the slot 16 Sheriff was claiming that his Scout on 3 was triggered by a conversion. Obviously this seemed impossible, so I dragged him to jail and executed him for being a Scorned. But he wasn’t. He was actually a sheriff and 3 actually was converted while in jail.</p>
<p>What Should’ve Happened:<br>
Obviously, the physician should’ve been safe from conversions because being stuffed in my cozy little cell is supposed to act as a prevention. Instead, they were in a state of jailed, but not.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:<br>
I’m not sure when the game recognized that I had disconnected and attempted reconnection because I could talk just fine while 3 was jailed. My log reverted back to before I input that I jailed 3, but I did that at night. As far as reproducing it, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Comments:<br>
Side Note - I also got pushed on because a Butler loudly proclaimed I had to be NK for being occupy immune. That was weird and added to the confusion.</p>
