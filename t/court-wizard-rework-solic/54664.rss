    <title>Court Wizard Rework - Solic</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework-solic/54664</link>
    <description>In a nutshell: Day ability that disrupts the enemies faction&#39;s day abilities and on successful usage empowers the various barrier forms in unique ways, yet still keeping Court Wizard unconfirmable and thus fake claimable. EDIT: Now also has Magical Barrier &quot;frame&quot; any enemy investigatives/offensives to give them unreliable results, possibly making it easier to out them with faulty logs and making it harder for them to find Prince.

**Court Wizard - (Blue Dragon Support)** 

**Day Ability:** 
Dispel - Negate neutral/scum day abilities on your target except poison/bleeding. Empowers magical barrier on a successful Dispel . (3 uses)

**Night Ability 1:**
Magical Barrier - Protect a player from all negative effects and conversion. Scum will get &quot;framed&quot; results on going for this target. Grants death immunity when empowered. (Unlimited uses)

**Night Ability 2:** 
Tornado - Swap two players’ positions causing all players targeting one of them to target the other. (3 uses)

The major new ability here is Dispel. Physicians can heal attacks and heal poison/bleeding. Court Wizards can protect against conversion, the other side of the coin, but nothing else. Enter the new ability for Cult Leaders replacing sacrifice (if they want this to be reused again, it needs to be revamped heavily anyways) and a new ability for Assassins (or MM) replacing Distract.


**Cult Leader/Assassin** 
**Day Ability 2:** 
Bewilder/Distract - Silently prevent your target from using any day abilities. (4 uses)

This ability finally gives an out to any nobles/psychic&#39;s that cannot force a vote or use telepathy and opens up a noble fake claim for the possessor for instance. Dispel counters Bewilder/Distract and many other abilities. Dispel will work on Possessor&#39;s Facelift, Reaper&#39;s Chill and Sorcerer&#39;s Magic Dust/Magic cloak. Dispel could also work on Stoneskin Potion, trollbox and mercenary&#39;s contract, depending on balancing issues. The Court Wizard can, through clever use of Dispel, empower his barriers and also make his targets death immune on top of conversion immunity. Note that the target that is possibly saved from death will still not be informed, similar to blocking occupations. If it is still too weak the empowered barrier can also make the Court Wizard himself death immune. This gives claimspace for all death immune classes as well.   

Magical Barrier also makes the target show up as support, no visits to and from, inverses occupy/not occupy immune, shows up as neutral (only for scum classes!). This makes it the first misleader of evil. 

As for the converts:

**Sage - (Unseen Offensive)** 

**Day Ability:** 
Enchant - Negate BD/neutral day abilities on your target. Empowers Wall of Fire on a successful Enchant. (3 uses)

**Night Ability 1:**
Wall of Fire - Summon a wall of fire at a player&#39;s door, preventing everyone but the Assassin from visiting them. When empowered it kills any visitors to the player except for Assassin. (2 uses)

**Night Ability 2:** 
Tornado - Swap two players’ positions causing all players targeting one of them to target the other. (infinite uses)

**Ritualist - (Cult Support)**

 **Day Ability:** 
Charm - Negate BD/neutral day abilities on your target. Empowers Brotherhood on a successful Enchant. (3 uses)

**Night Ability 1:**
Brotherhood - 	A chosen Cult member appear as a member of the Blue Dragon tonight. When empowered it kills any visitors to the chosen Cult member. (3 uses)

**Night Ability 2:** 
Tornado - Swap two players’ positions causing all players targeting one of them to target the other. (3 uses)

The same dynamic applies for the converted counterparts, empowering Brotherhood/Wall of Fire to now have a similar effect to the Sorcerer&#39;s Circle of Death. 

This rework would keep CW as a valid fakeclaim, would make smart CW&#39;s a lot more powerful and opens up claimspace for evils, but simultaneously it allows more framing of BD. It makes two effects, death immunity on a class that doesn&#39;t normally have it and Sorcerer&#39;s Circle of Death have more causes than the usual one, making the game smarter.</description>

            <p>Is a Physician’s heal not a lot more than just a protection against an attack, because it can also heal poison/bleeding? The Physician can stop killing and poison/bleeding. The Court Wizard can protect against conversion and the other new secondary Distract/Bewilder abilities of scum. They are the BD support classes so their comparison is most valid.</p>
<p>Dispel also works against every NK and can work against all neutrals (all of them except inquisitor have day abilities), if it is really underpowered. Evil just does not have any more day abilities. If Dispel still does not have any usages to go for, we can make occupation also disable day abilities the next day possibly. The Court Wizard also still has all his usual tools. This is a straight up buff, so I don’t see why you would find it so underwhelming.</p>
<p>Regardless I made a change to Magical Barrier, buffing it by confusing scum investigatives on top of its usual usages. Grieving all those pesky Seekers/Invokers/Servants/Poachers/Nightwatches/Marshal’s/Duchesses</p>

            <p>griefing generally refers to harming with no benefit to yourself or your own team. Killing or getting an alchemist killed is a tactical decision, as you have to weigh whether he’s likely to go with or against you (regardless of which side you are on).</p>
<p>Killing an alch is a good or bad decision. It isn’t griefing, even if he isn’t healing/bombing, he’s either voting with you, voting against you, or abstaining all of which have huge impact on your win chance…</p>

            <p>So Dispel is only useful against new assassin distract? Kinda UP imo, especially when the CW’s entire kit revolves around that.</p>
