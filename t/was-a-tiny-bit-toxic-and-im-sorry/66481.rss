    <title>Was a tiny bit toxic and I&#39;m sorry</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/was-a-tiny-bit-toxic-and-im-sorry/66481</link>
    <description>I was King named &quot;Fiveskin&quot; and all D2 and D3 this guy was trying to execute me because he said my name meant I was Evil King (?), ignoring the guy who had the same name as me except one number less (lol).  So I order executed him, he got healed, and I get executed for doing that.

Of course this tilted me in the extreme and I called all exe votes &quot;trash players&quot; and I&#39;m just posting here because I&#39;m sorry and I don&#39;t want to get penalized for it, he said he was reporting me.</description>

            <p>The apology/hindsight to your actions is appreciated.</p>
<p>You’ll see whether or not your actions were deemed punishment-worthy or not somewhat soon (if you receive a warning or something of the sort), so you’ll just have to wait for that.</p>
