    <title>Possess is incurable?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possess-is-incurable/67509</link>
    <description>So Possessor is my favorite class and I probably complained about him being underpowered more than any other single person.  And I&#39;m very happy now that he has 3 uses of Possess again and that the dead chat can no longer out him to Mystic.

But I am not happy with Possess being incurable.  I know some people asked for this, but bypassing healing seems to be a Reaper niche, Possessor doesn&#39;t need this.  I successfully predicted a Possessor attack as Phys and self-cared but I was &quot;unable&quot; to heal myself, then someone in dead chat told me Possess is no longer curable?  Wtf?  

I mean the same people who asked for Possess to bypass healing wanted it to bypass death immunity even more, but instead of bypassing death immunity he was patched to bypass only healing?

I am very confused by the reasoning that went into this tiny change.  To be clear I do not want Possessor to bypass healing nor death immunity, I think a smart Possessor must get death immunes executed during the day, it&#39;s not like he can&#39;t jump into a credible person to make his accusations effective.  

I am also happy he gets a refund on failed uses of Possess BTW.

I&#39;m very happy with EVERYTHING about the new Possessor except this bypassing healing thing.</description>

            <p>If they get a “but you were prevented!” message, it could be a lot of things (most likely merc/sellsword on you), which you can set up yourself by claiming merc, making a fake will, say you visited your target and if a healer was on you, claim the merc must have prevented the healer.</p>

            <p>I just realized something.  Possess being incurable  is a sort of nerf because it makes it more risky, since if your jump could get healed you could just try again the next night.  But if you jump into someone who’s being healed, the physician will get a “You could not heal” notification, right?  So the Possessor will instantly be outed.</p>

            <p>It’s not weak by itself, but compared to other protective abilities it is.  Heal cures bleed and poison and protects against OE. The only real advantage guards has over heal is against reaper, but that is easily bypassed by empowered reap.  Defend only works twice, but protects the target and kills any attackers visiting the target.  Shield can protect against any single attack.  Stand guard prevents all targeters, so it can protect against conversions and negative effects as well.</p>

            <p>I agree that it shouldn’t bypass healing, but there’s nothing wrong with it bypassing death immunity.  Possessor needs a way to kill the MM/king.</p>

</aside>
<p>No.  Guards is already weak when compared to other protective abilities.  I would be fine with limiting self-guard though.</p>

            <p>How is this different from a reaper reaping a MM? Both NK’s would use a powerful limited ability to overcome death immunity. Possessor can just jump away again, so there would be no problem for him. Typically MM would be very unconfirmed and would be a bad option anyway for a jump. It is very hard to read when a king would guard or not, so I think that would solve king’s near invulnerability to Evil factions, but not to Possessor.</p>

            <p>It’s probably because then it would allow Possessor to possess MM, which would seriously cripple an Unseen team in late game, and any Possessor who possesses an MM would get screwed over by other Unseen</p>

            <p>I have never found King’s guards to be worth complaining about as Possessor, but I certainly do understand your complaint.  Personally I would prefer a different solution, if this is deemed a problem, than letting Possessor bypass death immunity.  For example I’d support King losing yet another use of Guards.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to say that I am one of the people that would prefer it going through death immunity and not through healing, so they have some way to deal with the King lategame. Not to mention that not being able to finger is a dead giveaway anyways, so it would not even largely buff him. It is also very hard to discredit an active king through simple logs upon dying. (Since if you make it blatant, he can just order execute you and OE goes before Possess)</p>
