The Mafia have a factional douse, and a factional ignite. They may be used on the same night.
The Mafia are not allowed to ignite Night 1.
The Mafia have three ignites over the course of the game.
When the mafia ignites, all people who have been doused will die.
Lynches are majority only.
The Mafia&#39;s douse night action is compulsive and will be randomised if not picked and ignite is not selected.
A minimum of five posts per irl day is required, if you do not meet this requirement twice, you will be replaced out.

            <p>I was thinking about it during class today and I think the strategy for winning this one starting at SoD2 would have been to kill Eevee at night, say that since he had died at night he must have been right about something, and use that to break up the towncore.</p>
