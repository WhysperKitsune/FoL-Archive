    <title>Suggested buff for Knight</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggested-buff-for-knight/11260</link>
    <description>The knights Sacrifice ability is a pretty good abil for later in the game. In the early days though it really sucks to die.

My suggestion is to change the ability to this.

If the target you guard is attacked within the first 3 days, you will kill the attacker, but it wont kill you.

After those 3 days, back to norm. You kill them, and they will kill you.</description>

            <p>Death Knight is even better than Knight lol</p>
<p>Can kill up to 3 people by himself</p>
<p>Sure he rots in 3 days, but the regular Knight has a chance of dying within those 3 nights anyway, so what’s the difference?</p>

            <p>Yeah me neither lol Knight is fine as he is imo and this game has been getting more and more complex recently with random rules and ordering which actually reduces that amount of strategising you can do.</p>

            <p>Knight is horrible against possessor. I feel that what knight needs is sacrifice to be altered so it still fights killers, but if no killers are present, it stops one of the following in this order - one occupation, one possession, one debauch, one redirection, one framing, one mind warping, one conversion.</p>

            <p>I literally never Sacrifice unless Prince is outted or there is a key BD target that must be protected at all costs.</p>
<p>I treat Knight as a vigilante who can protect if necessary and that seems to be the optimal way to play him.</p>

<p>I mean…it just redirects the kill lol</p>
<p>Sacrifice is actually fairly weak. Knight is only good against NK classes. Sometimes killing the Assassin just frees up the MM to convert somebody else.</p>

            <p>IMO, maybe a bit of a compromise. I do agree that early game, a 1:1 trade against say unseen or cult, is actually a double whammy.</p>
<p>Knight kills assasain, knight and assasain die, MM gets a new conversion N3, random cult becomes assasin, some other BD becomes the new converted, Cults just as well off as they were before.</p>
<p>That being said, I’d also say killing a cult, assasin for no cost, is also too strong. Maybe a better starting point, for the first 2-3 days, knight negates attacks. He neither auto dies, nor kills the attacker.</p>
