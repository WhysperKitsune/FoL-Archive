    <description>Class-Rebel

Neutral Special (I guess)

Passive: Rebellious Leader: You cannont be converted. When you die, the oldest follower will be the new Leader.

Passive: God of the Rebellion: You know who your followers are and they know who you are. They don&#39;t know who each other are.

Day Ability: Rebel Revolution: Make all Followers vote for someone. When they vote will be random. 2 Uses

Day Ability: Rebel&#39;s Secret Plan: Inform a Follower who all the CURRENT members of the rebellion are. 3 Uses

Night Ability: Dark Thoughts: Make someone a Follower. They keep their role but now, they are in the rebellion. They will be informed of who you are. They won&#39;t be informed of who else is in the Rebellion. 1 Day cool down. If someone became the new Rebel, they&#39;ll have to wait a day. Unlimited.

Goal: Everyone alive is in the Rebellion. (Everyone in the rebellion wins)

----------------

Class-Monk (Can only appear with the Rebel)

Neutral Special

Passive-Calm Mind-You can&#39;t join the rebellion.

Night Ability-Peace-Remove someone from the rebellion (You&#39;ll kill the Rebel instead if they&#39;re the rebel.)

Goal-The rebellion loses.</description>

            <p>Because he can see that someone whispered someone else<br>
Maybe dark thoughts can be read as “the rebel has whispered to their rebellion”?</p>

            <p>this needs to be it’s own faction, not one that exists along with the unseen/cult.</p>
<p>I like the monk, as it gives a good reason to not let all members know who each other are. However, I think peace should have limited uses. Also, rebels shouldn’t know who the rebel is. Lastly, why can’t the leader just whisper to his members who the other members are, instead of using dark thoughts?</p>

            <p>I’d assume it’s because not knowing who other members are helps to somewhat balance this conversion role. Besides, if the Rebellion can have infinite numbers than that’d make conversion potentially broken(as if conversion wasn’t already). However since they can have infinite members, after a few days BD is in dire danger if they haven’t lynched a rebel yet.</p>
<p>EDIT: Fixed accidental double space and 3 typos.</p>

<p>They aren’t informed because the rebellion can have unlimited members and it would be too strong if they knew who each other are. Also rebellions are supposed to be chaotic</p>
