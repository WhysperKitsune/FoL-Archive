            <p>I’d go further to say it’s only a throw if the phys is not trying to win .<br>
sticking with healing the revealed Prince rather than   jumplng of to a poison bleed claim of a half confirmed bd that you are not sure about should always be  the right for the player to choose.</p>
<p>Even not healing someone because you don’t personally believe their claim is your choice.   it may not be tactically the best move . but players need to be able to make choices and make what others consider mistakes  without it being considered throwing</p>

            <p>Context matters in these situations.</p>
<p>I’ll give an example in a game I played recently as an Unseen:</p>
<p>A Prince was forced to reveal himself early because of a misunderstanding, we tried to attack him but he was being healed by a Phys.</p>
<p>I decided to announce the next day that an Assassin had poisoned me (I was Assassin) and that I desperately needed a heal. We attacked the Prince successfully the next night because the Phys tried healing me.</p>
<p>It cost me my life but because the Phys robotically healed any request for a heal it cost them the Prince in return.</p>
<p>This applies to neutrals being poisoned too. It’s only a throw if they are confirmed BD and they deliberately chose not to heal them.</p>

            <p>How do they know you’re BD?</p>
<p>What if they heal a more valuable class?</p>
