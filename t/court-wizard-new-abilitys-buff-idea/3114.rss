    <title>Court Wizard new abilitys/buff idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-new-abilitys-buff-idea/3114</link>
    <description>So i&#39;m pretty sure most people think that the court wizard is pretty useless. I have some ideas that might make him a bit more funner/useful

Bring back Paints on fire for a day ability. if you didn&#39;t know what this ability did it caused whoever you targeted to switch there target to themselves when they use a day ability. 

Replace magic barrier with Transportation Magic.

Transportation magic would be unlimited use and does the exact same thing as transporter in town of Salem expect when transporting someone it would break off any night immunity (this doesn&#39;t include the reaper however.) 

Hover Description: Transport 2 people switching there targets and breaking night immunity if one of the two targets have this.</description>
