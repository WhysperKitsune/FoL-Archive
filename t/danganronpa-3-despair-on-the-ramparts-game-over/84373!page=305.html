<h1>The Truth Of The Killing Game Revealed.</h1>
<p>Written by <a class="mention" href="../../u/icibalus.html">@Icibalus</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>Our story begins in Japan. An international group of scientists, lead by the eccentric academic Andrew Zinoviev Raphael, began investigating a town which had experienced a statistically significant increase in both suicides and violent crime. They quickly discovered the cause to be an extremely advanced nano-virus, and set out to create treatment. Unfortunately, they also discovered that one individual left the village, and there was the potential for a pandemic to wipe out humanity.</p>
<p>Using a series of connections, they established the MEDIGO Project to investigate the source of the infection under top secrecy.  One thing they discovered is that while ordinary individuals reacted normally to the virus, individuals less ordinary reacted in more unpredictable ways. The other thing they discovered was an underground pool of an incredibly disturbing viscous liquid- a small amount of investigation revealed two things-</p>
<ul>
<li>The liquid was alive. That is, it contained structures that <em>heavily</em> resembled the neuron activity of a human brain.</li>
<li>The liquid was the source of the infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation became urgent, as the MEDIGO staff, constantly innoculating themselves, realised that they could not save the rest of the world in a simmilar way, especially if, as they suspected, the Wellspring was operating with the explicit intent of destroying humanity. Things were worse than they imagined. The Wellspring had caused one individual, to succumb totally to despair, and to merge with its’ mind. To become the Vessel, seeeking only to make humanity experience blissful despair. And the two, united, set out to make MEDIGO unintentionally destroy their own mission.</p>
<p>MEDIGO gathered 16 individuals with extraordinary talent and unique psychologies from across the world to begin extensive testing. They constructed a faux medieval castle at their cloaked headquarters containing a tiny sample of the Wellspring being continually sucked through the walls silently, in order to gague the effects on individuals. Some of them were somewhat unstable, but MEDIGO considered it neccecary to see how the psychovirus affected highly dangerous and abnormal individuals in order to develop a cure for them. Unfortunately,  the Wellspring’s Vessel managed to sneak their way into the programme in the second batch of test subjects.</p>
<p>The situation outside the compound worsened. World War III began to tear through the world. The Mastermind, as they would come to be known, made preparations for their true objective- eliminating MEDIGO, their greatest threat, then using their facilities to make the virus unstoppable. To inspire a fearful abandonment of hope that would make the virus unstoppable. To run and broadcast… <strong>The Killing Game</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the scientists at MEDIGO began to suspect something was going wrong, and the Mastermind was forced into a corner at quite a few points. Fortunately, they were able to outsmart the scientists at MEDIGO using one key property their total infection granted them- the ability to completely fool all scientific instruments. MEDIGO considered terminating them, but unfortunately chose not to. Using contacts within the government, they arranged an edition of the circular newsletter to be sent- which contained a sample of the Wellspring’s water. When this sample reached MEDIGO, they tried to deal with it by placing it into a waterproof box, tearing it to pieces, and then leaving it in the Fountain Room. Unfortunately, there was a leak in the box. That is how ??? ended up in its’ current state, filled with a diluted sample of the Wellspring.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, the majority of MEDIGO staff were weakened with the virus such that they left the project of their own accord. Some of them committed suicide, some of them did not. The only one left behind was Andrew Zinoviev Raphael, the leader of the project. However, one day, he found most of the subjects under anaesthetic. Terrified, he hid in his office and turned the lights off. His rare fish went dark. There was no way anybody could find him, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Mastermind found them. Using their superhuman strength and their sense of dramatic irony, they thrust AZ Raphael’s hands into the fish tank. Betsy bit her owner, and her poison acted extremely rapidly. A younger man would’ve survived with only minimal illness. AZ Raphael was not a young man. He died quickly. Then, to gloat, the Mastermind took a single picture of the crime scene- using flash phtoography on the camera they carried with them everywhere. The little bit of light was enough to keep Betsy glowing for weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>They created an AI-operated robot named Monokuma to pose as running the Killing Game, and decided to use MEDIGO’s headquarters as the seat for the killing game, then administered amnesia-causing drugs to their fellow 15 test subjects. That is how you, the 16 participants, got to be in this situation. The Mastermind remained in the game for one critical reason- they fully intended to publicise their presence in the game in order to give a last bit of fleeting hope to those watching, knowing full well that they’d orchestrated everything from the start. MEDIGO’s choice of volatile personalities went against them, as cults and personal vendettas ravaged any chance of survival. The world could do nothing but watch helplessly.</p>
<p>Because, as mentioned earlier, the Mastermind was one for gloating, they left  a large amount of information that pointed to them as the true perpetrator of this vile game available to the participants. A bulletin board concerning the actions of the Ultimate Conman, explaining the motive behind their killing. A diary by the Ultimate Survivor proving their past to not be fabricated, and their drive to survive no matter what. Emails explaining their ability to prevent investigation through direct means. The last plans of AZ Raphael. Scrapbooks of the Ultimate Escape Artist. Details on how his fish functioned. Hell, they even left behind repeated references to their jobs in journalism placed there explicitly to taunt onlookers with how obvious the Mastermind’s connection to journalism was.</p>
<p>The Mastermind was among you the whole time. Their true identity was none other than…</p>

<hr>
<div align="center">
<p><strong>Reality.</strong></p>
<h6>this isn’t very good so if Ici shows up later with a better one consider that one the canon version</h6>
</div>
<hr>
<p>PKR, Whysper, and TL stumble together out of the castle. With the glass wall removed, maybe they still have a chance. Maybe they’ll be able to escape the Mastermind’s clutches.</p>
<p>Yet as they run down the bombed-out remains of the city around them, they find that, for all most of the people in it are dead, the city is no less dangerous. As they reach the center square, the ground beneath their feet grows hot. They look around them in confusion, only to discover that the city center has burst into flames.</p>
<p>TL pushes the other two out of the ring of fire, mouthing a final warning to them. The flames begin to consume them, as though they were being roasted over a fire.</p>
<p>PKR and Whysper continue running. Yet as they run, a mob of people wearing Monokuma masks – the last sign of human life – catches up to them, armed with kunai. One of them throws a kunai straight towards Whysper’s heart.</p>
<p>PKR dives in front of it, stumbling a little. As he stumbles, the remaining members of the mob pelt him with kunai. Whysper glances back for a moment, but as she realizes she cannot save him, she continues running.</p>
<p>Whysper decides that her only chance is to hide somewhere the Mastermind cannot find her. Somewhere the Mastermind won’t think to look. She doubles back towards the castle, and makes her way to the second floor. As an Escape Artist, she could hold her breath for minutes on end as part of a stunt, longer than was ever supposed to be possible for humans. She takes a deep breath, and dives into the pool.</p>
<p>Yet as the water surrounds her, the light of the surface begins to fade away. A minute passes, then another, then another. She looks toward the surface, knowing that she could make her way back to it and take a breath. But maybe the Mastermind was right. Maybe it is easier to accept despair after all.</p>
<p>The last thing she hears as her eyes close for the last time is the Mastermind’s high, cold, laughter.</p>

          <p>ok so the theory behind that book was that basically everyone’s character had been mentioned at some point in the lore, if everyone whose character was literally ever mentioned was automatically clear the PoE would be, like, Amelia and ?maybe? PKR (I was also not totally sure of who had been greenchecked by the lore pre-Ici and I taking over), I tried to ensure that there were multiple clues to make it clear that the Amelia lore wasn’t a 100 percent greencheck (the book was explicitly described as a few years old, with lore confirming that the Mastermind had once been an Ordinary Student, the book doesn’t say anything to indicate a non-Mastermind attitude, whereas a lot of the other lore either explicitly talked about fighting the Mastermind (e.g. Italy’s) or was written from a PoV that was clearly not the Mastermind (e.g. the diary that was supposed to greencheck Emilia, also the bulletin board although Min was already clear), we also put in other clues linking Amelia’s talent to the Mastermind (such as the newspaper article, I was actually worried that was too obvious</p>
<p>if I were doing this over a second time I would leave that particular lore item out, I think it made it too scumsided</p>
