            <p>Demolition seems ridiculous and almost impossible to play around.</p>
<p>Beyond that, even just traps seem like they’ll lead to too many random / arbitrary deaths.  A neutral that isn’t even NK shouldn’t be causing so many deaths - it makes the game too random.  They <span class="bbcode-i">certainly</span> shouldn’t have a power that nearly ends the game on the spot.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a really fun class but I think the rework should be longer, That seems a little to OP. Also maybe a notification will be released when the Engineer does rework, for example, “The Castle seems fresh, newer even.” Just some suggestions.</p>
