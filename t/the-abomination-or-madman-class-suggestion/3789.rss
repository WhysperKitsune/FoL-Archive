    <title>The &quot;Abomination&quot; or &quot;Madman&quot; [Class Suggestion]</title>

    <description>The &quot;Abomination&quot; or &quot;Madman&quot; is a character that is hated by the entire village, city, or kingdom due to his insane lifestyle. 

**Neutral: &quot;Abomination&quot;**

The abomination is a NEUTRAL character that nearly functions identical to the Fool. However, his role specifically involves ensuring that the King is executed. Since the abomination is hated by the village, the &quot;abomination&quot; hates the King. 

**Night ability #1 - Distract the Guards:** (x3 - x4)

The abomination targets a player for the purposes of distracting the guards that are examining the player. Thus, if the King sends guards to himself, the guards will be distracted from the King. Distracting the guards results in leaving players vulnerable to being assaulted by any &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;killer&quot; class.

**Night Ability #2 - Disgust** (x1):

Disgust a player by throwing tomatoes or vomiting on the player, causing the player to remain inactive at the table for one turn.

**Day Ability: Troll-box (Unlimited):**

Produce a statement that is under another character&#39;s name (identical to the fool)

------


The Unseen: The Madman

**Night ability - Frighten (Unlimited):**

The Madman frightens a player, causing the player to remain within their room during the night.

**Night Ability - Stabbing (One use)**

The Madman assaults a player during the night. However, the character&#39;s role is disclosed to one random player within the table.

**Day Ability: Disruption (One use):**

The Madman undergoes a tantrum at the table, preventing each and every player from SPEAKING or ACCUSING an individual of treason. His role is revealed to the entire table.</description>

<li>Occupied  (correct usage of the term)</li>
<li>Madman assaults Court Wizard. Thus, Madman’s class is revealed to one player within the table (since the madman made a loud noise that attracts the attention of another player)</li>
<li>Agreed, the table undergoes silence for five seconds with the statement “The Madman disrupts the courts/tables” prior to transitioning into the night.</li>
<li>Abomination targets A. Guards are sent to A. Thus, the guards are ineffective, leaving the target vulnerable.<br>
Abomination targets A. Guards are sent to B. Thus, B remains guarded.</li>
