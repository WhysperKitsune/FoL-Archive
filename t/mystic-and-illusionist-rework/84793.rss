    <description>&gt; **The Mystic** :star:
&gt; **Blue Dragon Social**
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; **Conduits:** Players you have linked have access to a private chat with you. You will keep this passive as long as your class doesn&#39;t change to King.
&gt; **Busy Mind:** You are immune to occupation and redirection. Keep this passive when your class changes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day:**
&gt; **Link Minds (inf use):** Link your mind with a player at the end of the day, allowing them to talk to you at all times afterwards. You cannot have more than 2 players linked at once.
&gt; 
&gt; **Night:**
&gt; **Reject (inf use):** Release a player from your conduit.
&gt; **Clear Gaze (2 use):** Make all investigatives bypass frames tonight. Cannot be used twice in a row.

&gt; **The Illusionist** :star:
&gt; **Unseen Social**
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; **Conduits:** Players you have linked have access to a private chat with you. You will keep this passive as long as your class doesn&#39;t change to King.
&gt; **Busy Mind:** You are immune to occupation and redirection. Keep this passive when your class changes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day:**
&gt; **Telekinetic Wall (3 use):** Make a player believe they were occupied tonight. Their ability will still succeed. (occ rules apply)
&gt; **Mental Force (3 use):** Make a player believe they were redirected to their final target tonight. (deb rules apply)
&gt; 
&gt; **Night:**
&gt; **Mindwarp (inf use):** Target player will receive framed results from using investigative abilities tonight. 
&gt; **Mental Gymnastics (inf use):** Examine the logbooks of your linked players.

And I guess a small Apostle change too:
Apostle Telepathy replaced with Trollbox (2 use).</description>

<p>Just kept the current passive. Actually, you could probably screw over the Mystic if you redirected him to the Prince or someone on a Reject night. Might consider removing the passive honestly.</p>

<p>Librarian vibes. But well, this doesn’t really solve the core problem of mystic, in that it’s just used as an IC. Also day chat. Granted, I think it works BETTER than current mystic, in that it can foster Conduit more easily.</p>

<p>This ability seems amazing on paper, but all it really does is screw over scorned, fool, and the occasional aristocrat. Unless it also includes mind warps, in which case add apostle. Countering frames isn’t really necessary, and it’s omniscient so fweh</p>
