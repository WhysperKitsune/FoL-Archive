    <title>Priest converted form change</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/priest-converted-form-change/3123</link>
    <description>The thing I like about the unseen is each converted form is very similar to it&#39;s previous class, with a few exceptions, one of those exceptions being priest.

Here is a way to keep the priest similar when converted:

&gt;**The Monk**
unseen support
**Passive ability: Luck of the faithful**
Immune to death once
**Passive: Whispers of the grave**
You can speak and listen to the dead at night as &quot;priest&quot;
**Day ability: Bind soul**
(1 use) your target will be immune to death tonight.
**Night ability: Reanimate**
(1 use) select an unseen player (possibly yourself), a class from a pop-up menu, and a dead player. If the target unseen member dies, they will appear to be the class you selected, and the dead player you selected will be revived. If they are a convert able class, they will become their unseen version.

Note: I do not know if this is balanced or not. I think it is?</description>

            <p>soul catcher is fine, I just don’t like that it came from priest.</p>
<p>I think this class would be more interesting</p>

            <p>I wanted to change soul catcher because the point of unseen conversions is the classes are basically the same. The problem is that this is not the case for a few of them, such a priest and hunter.</p>

            <p>This is pretty balanced but to be honest their is something that makes it go over the limits aka whispers of the grave . Which basically makes you seem as priest and would be very hard to find like really hard to find .  Reanimate again another ability which makes it very hard to find and of course bind soul  i am fine with that.  But overall i think Soulcatcher is better.</p>
