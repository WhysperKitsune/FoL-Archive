    <title>What is stopping Multiple Account Users/Cheaters?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-is-stopping-multiple-account-users-cheaters/63624</link>
    <description>I used to think that the fact you had to buy your game was stopping these types of players. And maybe it does for some of them. But recently I found out that a certain well known torrenting site has a copy of this game on it. 

What do you have in place that stops cheaters/throwers from just dling an illegal copy and making up a new email address, then jumping in to ruin games for people? Ive had several people throw who seemed certain that : They wouldnt get caught. They wouldnt care if they did. They would be back if banned.

Im just asking because its frustrating as hell for the average player (and probably even more so for the competitive players).

Ive also heard you ban per IP. But that shouldnt work with those of us (Myself included) who use a VPN, correct? Im computer literate, but in no way a hacker so I imagine there are myriad ways Im not even thinking of that would bypass the basic security I know of. Im just wondering if you have more ways out there to help us, and if not, is there a reason to bother reporting the obvious trollers? The ones with all &quot;l&quot;&#39;s for a name? Or the name of &quot;gamethrower&quot; as a user name?</description>

<p>This wouldn’t work as it requires you to log in through steam directly.</p>
<p>But we DO have a system that catches people who try to make alt accounts, yes. Even if they use a VPN, we can still detect if you’re an alt or not.</p>
