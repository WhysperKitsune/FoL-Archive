    <title>Sorc/Inq rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sorc-inq-rework/33712</link>
    <description>Honestly they&#39;ve taken a few steps in the right direction, and a few in the wrong directions with these classes. Currently as it is, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a huge glaring problem within the classes. The biggest is inquisitioner. It is totally useless while the sorcerer is alive, and waay too strong in cult games, AFTER he&#39;s already won.

First off pointing out the old problem, and where I think the direction of the fix went totally wrong.

In the past, when sorc was first added, he was on his own the least capable NK... then had the added challange of being both weak to anything that could harm either existing NK, plus his own added challange of the neutral that was after him.

The attempted &quot;fix&quot; for this, was to massively buff his skill to fool the neutral that was after him. Magic dust went from framing 1 target, to framing the whole court.

-- why this sucked

In short. it makes inquisitor 100% useless for trying to find the sorcerer. I mean assuming an average lifespan of 9 nights for these classes, 3 total court frames, means a 33.33_% chance of false positives, and that&#39;s before adding in things like psychics, CW&#39;s pali&#39;s etc... You&#39;d be an idiot to do anything based on a positive magic user check. Fortunately the BD is more than capable of taking out the sorcerer, so in regards to BD vs sorc it&#39;s a positive change, in terms of justifying the existance of the inqusitioner, it&#39;s awful. The inquisitor as he is now... is waay too good after he has no motivation to be good (especially in cult games), and flat out useless, when he actually has a goal to do... which is pretty much backwards. He&#39;s only useful when he has no incentive to be useful.


If you ask me some modifications.

1. revert magic frame back to 1 target. or remove it. The inquisitors ONLY true purpose is to hunt the sorcerer. Making him the worse choice to use to try to hunt the sorcerer, is just backwards.

2. Give sorcerer better cover from BD investigatives. Probably make him show as BD to king (assuming you can&#39;t take that ability away from king to begin with, or make the &quot;allies&quot; ability more like a sheriff/pali check, IE it finds unseen/cult but does not reveal neutrals, which I still am strongly in favor of).

I do strongly approve of the &quot;sorc avoids knights&quot; recent change, as well as the not killing unseen/cult. But I would say on the whole, sorc is too easy to find for BD to justify a whole class to hunt it, and I&#39;d say completely making the class that hunts it incapable of hunting it, as a pretty unwise decision.

and lastly, I would say inquisitor seriously needs to not have such a strong impact on the game AFTER the sorcerer dies. He either becomes a cult hunting mega BD ally, sits on his butt and does nothing, or becomes a pain in the butt BD sabatoger killing all psychic/cw claims, as he no longer has anything to worry about no matter what the outcome. Normally finding out someone&#39;s class is supposed to at least give you some input of a motivation they work towards. IE an alch, cares about staying alive. Won but still hanging around classes though, aren&#39;t really fun for anyone in the game other than that person. They are wildcards that really only can be predicted with out of game information (IE the personality of the player), as they no longer have an in game goal to guide their actions. I really don&#39;t think he should still have abilities after he doesn&#39;t have a win condition anymore.

Just my opinion here, but I must say I like the sorc/inq concept in theory, but in practice right now, I fricking hate every game with them in it. Sorc is still the least capable NK IMO, and the inquisitioner is just a royal pain in the butt after the BD wins the game for him.</description>

            <p>Ok fine. Mastermind is a hardcounter to BD and merc. My point is that the sheriff effects enough classes that calling him a hardcounter is meaningless. The sheriff is clearly a soft counter because he effects a group of classes rather than an individual class. The fact that all of those classes happen to have the same faction is irrelevant.</p>

            <p>Mastermind can also affect neutrals though.  Knight can affect killers from any faction, and has an ability which doesn’t rely on killers.  Sheriff and paladin, however, can only affect the unseen and cult.</p>

            <p>He’s a hard counter to an entire faction. That’s like saying that the Mastermind is a hardcounter to BD or that Knight is a hardcounter to all killers.</p>

            <p>aren’t we kind of beating a moot point here though… least in the concept, we are looking to get rid of magic dust… prefferably with glamor. Making the sorc more vulnerable to Inquisitor, less vulnerable to BD. Which is the goal I’m shooting for. I’ve heard it both ways on magic dust/ruthless efficiancy, and haven’t really been in a scenerio to witness it to give a judgement one way or the other. But I’d like the whole dynamic to go away etiher way.</p>

You can win the game by simply clicking the right person at night (as well as ruin that person’s game), with no possible countermeasures. Usually Investigative classes need to convince the rest of the court to trust them and vote with them. The Inquisitor doesn’t even need to do that, once he finds the Sorcerer it’s an automatic win for him.<br>
(Also Ruthless Efficiency isn’t deceived by the Sorcerer’s Magic Dust, so it gives you three checks you can trust. Between its results and the people who are already dead, you can find the Sorcerer 100% of the time. Pretty much the only way you can lose as Inquisitor is if you die early.)</p>

</aside>
<p>The main thing is, king is the one investigative that is guaranteed to be in every game, and more or less one of the only detect neutrals ability. As we’ve mentioned though, the glammer “learn the faction of the target, and appear as that persons class to all BD investigatives, works for me as well”.</p>
<p>Observer’s follow I’m not really sure of a way to make something hide from that, shy of moving the inquisitioners visits aren’t shown passive. Peak itself is pretty uncommon, as observer isn’t guaranteed, is convertable, and only has 2 uses of that ability.</p>
<p>king itself is what I’ve always defined as the neutrals bane…from what I’ve seen almost half of games I’ve played, the king is the one to catch the NK. Hence why NKs that know what they are doing take whatever risk necessary to kill the king first.</p>

            <p>It works for them. I’m not saying that the classes don’t need a rework but having a class that’s effect only matters for 1 class is no big deal as long as the class is always there. Do you think that Scout and Smile are bad ideas for Ability’s?</p>
