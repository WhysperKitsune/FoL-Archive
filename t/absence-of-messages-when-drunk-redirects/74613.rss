    <title>Absence of messages when Drunk redirects</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/absence-of-messages-when-drunk-redirects/74613</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
1) I played Drunk and redirected Poacher to myself. The only message I got was that I successfully redirected him to myself. But this could not be correct because either Poacher didn&#39;t use any ability so I would get message about that he was immune/empowered/occupied/reaped/used ability with no target or he used one of his abilities so I should had be given a message that someone tried to occupy me.

2) There is an evidence that Prince doesn&#39;t get message &quot;someone tried to redirect you&quot; when Drunk redirects him. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Messages were supposed to appear, but they did not.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1) Drunk redirects Poacher to himself.
2) Drunk redirects Prince.
