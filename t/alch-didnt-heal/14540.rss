    <title>Alch didn&#39;t heal</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/alch-didnt-heal/14540</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
well I was alch and healed king and apparently he was never healed and it didnt prompt me that the heal was a success or failure, or that i was occupied or anything.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The heal should of worked and it should of prompted me with something

#### Steps to reproduce:
seemingly the only thing that happened was me healing the king while the king sent guards to protect me

#### Comments:
here&#39;s an image of what the prompts looked like

            <p>This is true. But it is still a question that may or may not matter for the steps to reproduce</p>
