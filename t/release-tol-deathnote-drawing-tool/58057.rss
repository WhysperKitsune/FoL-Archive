    <description>**Throne Of Lies Deathnote Tool - By: Dewblackio2 (aka Krohdo)**

_**This program has been approved for public release by i42-Xblade as of 4/13/2018:**_
&quot;The .au3 file is officially approved for use in-game. 
While only the .au3 file is approved, use the executable at your own risk.
(the .exe file exists so you don&#39;t have to download AutoIt)&quot; --i42-Xblade

**Terms Of Use**
Using this software to draw any form of obscurities or NSFW content on your deathnote, will result in a flag against your Throne of Lies account and may result in a permanent suspension. By using this application, you agree to these terms.

**Updated to Version 1.3**
- GUI Overhaul (thanks to Shrike &lt;3)
- More Config Options Saved
- Grey, Orange, Teal Colors Added
- Extreme optimizations to image processing speed
- Option to now select background color, with tolerance to allow for images with white backgrounds to ignore background, but still contain white in the image itself
- Donation button added for my buddy shrike, since he helped IMMENSELY with improving this project &lt;3
- Some minor optimizations to prevent &quot;rouge lines&quot; as much as possible, varries based on Computer performance
- GUI now has minor AI logic to remeber positions it was last in and making the usage as friendly as possible

**Updated to Version 1.2**
- Aspect ratios for images are now locked to prevent distorting images.
- Input pattern, speed, and threshold values are now saved in a config file.
- Tool now has an update check feature.
- Draw image size, now displays the bitmap of the image rather than a rectangle.

            <p>Hey can I get some help with this tool?<br>
The window of the tool appears huge for me and I can’t reach the bottom of it.<br>
Also when I try to execute a drawing it starts from the top of the screen in paint before the drawing page starts, in the top bar.</p>

            <p>No problem, if you are still encountering an issue regarding colors being skipped when they aren’t intended to be, or just can’t get the tray tips to appear, let me know. I can always create a custom build that uses message boxes or a overlay prompt to indicate the following steps/commands to execute.</p>
<p>If everything got resolved, well that’s good to hear!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using the tool &lt;3</p>

            <p>Seems you aren’t receiving the Tray Tip notifications that should be popping up between stages… I did make a tutorial on how to fix this problem if you are on Windows 10</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the deathnote drawing tool</li>
<li>Open any jpg image inside the tool</li>
<li>Press Apply and let the image process</li>
<li>Once it is done processing, Type in your search bar (next to start button) “Notifications” and press enter.</li>
<li>check to make sure “Get Notifications from Apps and Other Senders” is ON.</li>
<li>Next, scroll down to the bottom, until you find “ToLDeathnoteTool.exe, or ToLDeathnoteTool.au3 if using the AutoIt version”</li>
<li>If you dont see the ToLDeathnoteTool.exe in there, hit apply in the app again to re-process the image again, and refresh the notifications &amp; actions settings</li>
<li>Make sure that is is checked to ON and then click on the label itself to open its other notification settings</li>
<li>Set the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth ones to ON (all except the third option)</li>
</ol>

            <p>I am curious now, if you’re doing different colours what is the order? I keep messing up and adding the colours in the wrong places. It also seems to skip colours if they’re not there?</p>

            <p>You are very welcome. I put in a lot of time and effort to bring the tool up from nothing, and then shrike came in and made all my sloppy spaghetti code into an elegant piece of art. Personally i love making stuff like this so if you have anything you wanna see done id be happy to give it a shot when i have the time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind words ill be sure to forward them to shrike as well since i dont believe he is on the forums here.</p>

I appreciate your dedication and interest in this tool, without this post, I wouldn’t have known.

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>I just wanted to clarify a few things since i’ve been receiving a lot of messages regarding my whereabouts for the past week, and wanted to clear up the speculation and concern about the current state of the tool and the future.</p>
<p>I am a college student currently, and its approaching May, which as many of you who live in the states know is considered the “Exams Month”. I haven’t been super active due to focusing on my studies and getting things under control in my real life. Regarding the future of the tool, I do want to produce more and more updates and changes to it, and with the help of someone I randomly came across on the ToL Discord (Shrike), I plan to have some immense user friendly updates, and feature additions and optimizations coming very soon!</p>
<p>I’m really happy to have finally been able to share this work with you all after wanting to for so long, and am loving all the feedback and kind words i receive on a day to day basis. It means a lot to me since i’ve never been one to produce content for others like this in the past. Thank you all so much for your support and I hope you enjoy using this just as much if not more than I did creating it!</p>
<p>TLDR; I’ve been busy with school, exams are coming up, and I will have updates and stuff ready once everything in my real life calms back down &lt;3</p>
<p>Sincerely, Krohdo (aka Dewblackio2)</p>

            <p><strong>Known Issue in v1.0 &amp; v1.2:</strong><br>
If you have a drawing paused, and attempt to resume, some PC’s with lower specs may have trouble resuming properly. What this means is, when a drawing is resumed, the mouse moves back to its last position in the drawing, then a sleep function is called for 10 milliseconds, and then it sets the primary button of the mouse down.</p>
<p>This can cause “rouge lines” to be drawn by lower spec pc’s because the mouse move command doesn’t get processed fast enough, causing the mouse down to occur before the mouse reaches its logged position.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to fix this issue, and i will have an update out this weekend changing the sleep to a higher millisecond value, likely around 1000 ms (1 second). I will also allow users to modify this amount of delay in ms so higher end pc users can keep the sleep value lower to allow for that extra second of draw time, since every second counts.</p>
<p>(This will not be the only change coming in the next update, i have a few more additions coming to the tool in the future patch as well)</p>
<p>Happy Drawing <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/0b0975c67e4535bb3ee9dd8d1eb5a6c13c575757.png?v=9" title=":king_good:" class="emoji emoji-custom" alt=":king_good:"></p>

            <p>Time passes, things improve, and peoples requests make ones ambition to provide something greater. Originally at that time i spoke to Xblade wanting to release this back when it had 1 pattern a simple load and close button, that was it. However, he had denied my request at the time, likely due to the game still being in early stages, leading me to be forced to say i would not be releasing the tool.</p>
<p>I never had plans to stop working on it though, and i guess you could say i felt proud of the work that i did, and put out those images to tell people looking for something like this “hey, i exist”. I was eventually going to speak to Xblade about it again to see if he changed his mind, which he did, and i’m grateful for that.</p>

<p>*Disclaimer This was obviously not hand drawn, i’td take anybody &gt;10 nights to draw something like this. I coded a program to draw deathnotes for me, and NO I will not be making it public, for deathnote ToS reasons. The program provides no harm to the game, if used responsibly, and i’d like to keep it that way. I hope you can understand <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Speed really only affects the time and quality of the image, i usually always draw at 5 mouse speed, since its not super slow, but not too fast that the drawing looks like random scribble lol</p>

            <p>Update planned for release within the next 24 hours if everything goes well, aspect ratios will now be locked to prevent setting image sizes manually, along with the fact the image size gets loaded on its own (no longer having to manually change).</p>
<p>I also plan to store users last used mouse speed &amp; pattern settings in a config file, but just waiting to hear back from Xblade to ensure im allowed to write the file to the users PC.</p>
