    <title>Can&#39;t Open Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cant-open-game/24497</link>
    <description>**What happened:**
Whenever I try and play the game now, the fullscreen option opens to a blank [orange/yellow screen as though loading and then turns black](https://i.imgur.com/uzLaYtQ.png). 
A windowed option is simply invisible, in other words, aside from the title bar there&#39;s nothing on screen. (Unfortunately, I can&#39;t screenshot that since, in making it fullscreen, I&#39;ve disabled any apparent ability to turn it back to windowed mode since I can&#39;t access a settings menu.)

I&#39;ve tried uninstalling the game multiple times; following any instructions on Steam regarding similar issues (verifying the integrity of game files); even uninstalling Steam a few times but nothing is working.

I don&#39;t actually know what caused this to happen as I was playing one day and the following day I tried to play again and it wouldn&#39;t work.

I also know that there don&#39;t seem to be any files for the game saved anywhere? [These](https://i.imgur.com/GxAjzCK.png) are the files I appear to have.

**What was SUPPOSED to happen:**
The game should start.

**Steps to reproduce this issue:**

1. Opened Steam
2. Clicked &#39;play&#39;
3. Game opens to black screen</description>

            <p>Sorry, just to say that I took a look at the graphics settings and everything because of what you said and I’m not sure what I did but it’s working again!</p>
<p>So thank you so much for your help <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>

            <p>Heya, can you send me a “last resort” set of logs again with the latest patch? Most issues before you see the main screen has to do with Unity engine, which is not so friendly with Macs (tbh, not with Windows either -_- we’ll probably use Unreal our next game haha).</p>
<p>However, it’s mostly strange that you could run before and not now.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice was that your graphics chipset is significantly under the minimum requirements:</p>
<p><a href="https://technical.city/en/video/Iris-Plus-Graphics-640-vs-HD-Graphics-5000" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://technical.city/en/video/Iris-Plus-Graphics-640-vs-HD-Graphics-5000</a></p>
<p>Because it’s under minimum requirements, each driver update may either improve or drop support – that’s my <strong>best guess</strong>… Pre-login screen issues are left to the mercy of your graphics card/drivers and Unity behaving.</p>
<p>I’ll still take a look at your logs, but if we can’t get this working and you played over 2 hours, let me know on Discord ( <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a> ) and I’ll personally refund you through PayPal or something.</p>

            <p>So I don’t know if the patch you were referring to came out yet or not because there’s no recent patch since November 29th listed on the Steam updates for me, but my game did just update tonight and I can confirm that as of that update it’s still not working.</p>

            <p>Well we should have a patch out tomorrow. Can you try again once the update is out, and let us know if the game is working?</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t be able to say for sure that it started directly after an update but I do know that having tried to play  after the update, it didn’t work, so probably?</p>
