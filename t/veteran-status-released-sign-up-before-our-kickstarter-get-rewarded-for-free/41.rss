    <title>Veteran Status released! Sign up BEFORE our kickstarter, get rewarded.. for FREE</title>

    <description>Our team has posted on several sites (read: Reddit) announcing  giving away our keys.

Veteran Status will appear later as an inventory item and will grant you free alpha keys and beyond later. Not just alpha: Every phase! We spoil our vets.

Expect our Kickstarter in September, alpha keys for our Backers in October, and our Vets will get keys shortly after them.

Veterans and Backers will have DIFFERENT exclusive in-game items (aesthetics) and you can be BOTH a backer AND a vet to receive all the exclusive items of both.

Thanks for signing up early and we&#39;ll be sure to spoil you. We &lt;3 you.

**NOTE:** I&#39;m getting reports of registration issues from 1 out of every 50 people and told that refreshing your browser does the trick. If anyone has more info on this, I&#39;ll fix it ASAP if I know what your browser is and steps you took to register - and what you see when stuck.

Cheers</description>
