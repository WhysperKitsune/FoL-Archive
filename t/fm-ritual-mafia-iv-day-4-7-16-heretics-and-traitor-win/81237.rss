    <description>## :skull: [color=darkred]Welcome to Ritual Mafia IV[/color] :skull: 
In Ritual mafia The Congregation (town faction) must fight against The Heretics (mafia faction) in order to gain the favor of their gods. How do you gain their favor? By sacrificing your own teammates on a ritual, of course!

## All credit for the creation of this setup (which is identical to Ritual Mafia III) as well as the approval to use it here goes to @psychoneirik. Thank you again; it really is a great one haha.

### :skull: [color=darkred]Gameplay[/color] :skull: 
* Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch Phase
* There won&#39;t be a Ritual phase on Day 1.
* Ritual Phase lasts 24 hours
* During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.
* Ritual votes are done privately through your classcards.
* Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.  
* &quot;The Ritual was interrupted&quot; message means that the player&#39;s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.
* Self-voting is allowed in both Ritual and Lynch phases.
* Lynch Phase lasts 48 hours or until majority is reached.
* Voting /nolynch is a valid option, and if majority is reached the day will end without a lynch.
* You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.
* Players have until the end of the next night to submit their ritual effects. (Ritual of Leadership must be submitted before the lynch phase ends or it will be lost)
* If the sacrificed player hasn&#39;t picked their targets on time their ritual ability will be skipped. If said player is a heretic, other heretics will be able to choose a target for them. Ritual of initiation cannot be skipped this way, and if no one picks a convert target for any reason it will be picked randomly.
* During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched. **Edit from Ritual Mafia III: EoD Plurality is now enabled as well as majority. If there is a tie vote at EoD, the lynch will be randed.**
* Nights will be 24 hours long
* During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.
* The Heretics have a factional kill. One of them can perform it once per night instead of their normal abilities.
* Soul Rip, Dark Portal and Mask of Death count as the factional kill and only one of those abilities may be used on the same night. You cannot perform the factional kill on a night where someone uses one of those abilities.
* You cannot target yourself with an ability unless stated otherwise.
* Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.
* The Heretics will have a day/night chat.
* The most recent version of your logs will be shown when you die.
* You can submit deathnotes on kills. These can be text or pictures.
* There can be a maximum of 3 of each non-unique classes.
* There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get &quot;You died&quot; as feedback. The exceptions are the following:

[details=&quot;List of night results&quot;]
If you use an investigative ability and you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.
_If an investigative ability or an ability that usually gives feedback fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action._
_If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target&#39;s class type is [class type]._
_If you receive a private message because of the Confession day ability: Someone sent you an anonymous message [message]._
_If a Medium uses Seance on a dead player: You got the following message from your Seance: [message]._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!_
_If one or more of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;At least one of your targets is a member of the Heretics!&quot;_
_If none of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;None of your targets are members of the Heretics&quot;_
_If you successfully predict a death with Oracle&#39;s Prediction: You gained 1 extra use of All-seeing Eye._
_If you use Clairvoyance on a player that didn&#39;t visit anyone: Your target didn&#39;t visit anyone last night._
_If you use Clairvoyance on a player that visited someone: Your target visited [Player(s)] last night._
_If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that wasn&#39;t visited by anyone: No one visited your target last night._
_If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that was visited by someone: Your target was visited by [Player(s)] last night._
_If an Oracle uses All-seeing Eye on a player: Your target is the [Class]._
_If you get a new ability from a Ritual: You have gained a new ability: [ability description]_
[/details]


### :skull: [color=darkred]Other mechanics and interactions[/color] :skull: 

[details=&quot;Other mechanics/interactions&quot;]
* Conflicting abilities will be cancelled. For example, two Enchanters trying to redirect the same player to different targets would cause said player to not be redirected at all.
* Enchanter can only redirect targeted abilities.
* Dying because of Voodoo Link counts as a suicide.
* Self-killing or suicide abilities cannot be healed or prevented in any way except being occupied or by Voodoo Link.
* Traitors can also be converted with &quot;Ritual of Initiation&quot;. This will change their class to a Heretic class of the same type and add them to the &quot;Heretics&quot; chat.
* If you are prevented from visiting one of your &quot;Change of Faith&quot; targets you will not be notified and get a result based on the remaining players.
* If you are redirected during &quot;Change of Faith&quot; you will know you were redirected, but not to which player and get a result based on the new target.
* If an enchanter redirects an ability that targets more than 1 player, only the first target will be redirected.
* Martyr&#39;s Penitence changes effect when used on a target, whether it was successful or not.
* If your limited use ability fails for any reason you will still spend an use.
* If a Chanel Spirit&#39;s target is changed the ability will fail.
* A target of Channel Spirit will not get notified when the effect ends due to conversion.
* The medium will visit the targets of the channeled spirit.
* If the last Heretic is sacrificed, Town will NOT win, since the conversion triggers immediately (unless their Ritual abilities are disabled somehow).
* If two Witch Doctors use voodoo link on each other and one of them dies, then both will die.

            <p>Yes<br>
It’s a very annoying role in IRL Ultimate Werewolf, as I learned the hard way at Deceptacon<br>
But it generally isn’t a thing in Forum Mafia</p>
<p>it just still irks me though when the two are confused.</p>

            <p>there’s something that’s been irking me which I need to clarify.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ChopChop">@ChopChop</a></p>
<p>The Traitor in this game IS NOT a Lone Wolf. It’s a Lost Wolf.</p>
<p>“Lone Wolf” is very different from “Lost Wolf”.</p>
<p>“Lone Wolf” is a role in werewolf who is on the wolf team and is otherwise a regular wolf but must be the only wolf alive at the end in addition to reaching parity with the town in order to win the game.</p>
<p>“Lost Wolf” is a role in werewolf who is a member of the wolf team but does not know any of the other wolves, and none of the other wolves know them (there can be variants but that is the standard way to run it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>strat replacing is hellishly hard to prove which is the problem</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Frankly this is an idea that I’ve been having since a long time.</p>
<p>Each play gets two or three replacements that should only be used in complete emergencies in a semester. If they pass the maximum amount of replacements then they will get sign-up banned until the end of the six-month period.</p>
<p>This should prevent strategic replacements as people will be required to use their replacements for actual serious shit rather than “I’m wolfread, better replace out.”</p>
<p>Hammering down talking about replacements helped a lot since that FE game, but strategic replacements still obviously happen here.</p>

Summary</summary>
<p>Last wolf game I played it didn’t have wolf day chat, and it was so frustrating.<br>
We would form a nightplan, and then our JOAT would pop in 2 hours before SoD (due to timezones) and say modbot wouldn’t let them use actions we asked her to do.<br>
And it happened 2 nights in a row, because everyone thought they knew how the role worked, except not really.</p>
</details>
<p>Yeah healthy and active scumchat is a big deal.</p>
