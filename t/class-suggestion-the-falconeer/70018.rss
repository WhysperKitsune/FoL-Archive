**Lore:**
The pride and joy of the kingdom was the festivals. Everyone showed off their talents, including the falconeer. His birds were trained to be expert delivery birds. So why would the unseen target this teenager? The answer was simple. Sending Messages.
His bird picked up a letter the day after the fesivals were over. It read,

_Dear Robert,_
_We have noticed your extraordinary talents as a bird trainer. I am willing to have you as a part of our business to be a delivery boy. It may not sound like much, but it is vital to our team, and you will get good pay for your time. Consider wisely your oppertunity,_

_The MM_

**Notes:**
This class is used mostly to eliminate who a person could not be. Paired up with another investigative is where this class really shines, as you can&#39;t get much info on your own.

EDIT1: Buffed day ability of birdwatcher, will now be notified of visit and who they visited
EDIT2: Adjusted the ability categories</description>

<p>Should I move defend and heals into a “protective” category perhaps? Or are the categories good as is?</p>
