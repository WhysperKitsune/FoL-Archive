    <title>Choose cult/unseen game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/choose-cult-unseen-game/14344</link>
    <description>I think it would be great if we could choose cult or unseen.
For example, I hate cult games, and I can&#39;t avoid them, 

Also I would love a third option, like a team with no convertions but more bad guys</description>

            <p>I dont think its that important, by day 2-3 everbody know the truth, and which class would act differently?<br>
Maybe the only class is the king because if it’s unseen then you should wait with checks untiil you can find MM</p>
<p>You can also make a third random mode.</p>

            <p>Also randomised enemy means it is harder to predict/make a counter strategy.</p>

            <p>The option thing would need to be another mode. It makes it static what the evils are which is BD sided. The third faction would be cool but it would need to have some strong classes (not a problem. Just an observation)</p>
