    <title>Agent &amp; Double Agent</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/agent-double-agent/74425</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried to come up with an unconfirmable, yet fun Blue Dragon social by merging Merlin &amp; Retribution with an already-proposed feedback-intercept ability.  I think the end result seems fun and balanced ... on paper at least.

Killing a player during the day is obviously confirmable, but because of the ability for Unseen/Cult to easily convert or kill an outed Agent, it&#39;s counter-productive if not used to eliminate the very last evil.

I admit I don&#39;t have any precise idea for elegantly implementing this insta-convert/kill feature.

&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;]The Agent[/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;]Unique Blue Dragon Social[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt;**Eavesdrop (Passive) -** You can read Unseen/Cult night chat, but speakers are unlabeled and anonymous from your perspective.  They are notified an Agent is eavesdropping.
&gt;
&gt;*You are also notified everytime a day ability is used, but not who used it or who it was used on.*
&gt;
&gt;**Undercover (Passive) -** The Unseen/Cult are given one opportunity to blow your cover.  If they identify you, you will be instantly converted (or killed, if there is no room).
&gt;
&gt;**Impersonate (Night ability - Infinite uses)** Trollbox the Unseen or Cult chat.  If you mistakenly impersonate a Blue Dragon or Neutral player, your trollbox will simply be labeled &quot;Agent&quot; from their perspective.
&gt;
&gt;**Neutralize Target (Day ability - 1 use) -** Kill a player during the day.  If they are Blue Dragon, you will also commit suicide.

&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;]The Double Agent[/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;]Unseen Social[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt;**Eavesdrop (Passive) -** You can read prison chat.
&gt;
&gt;*You are also notified everytime a day ability is used, but not who used it or who it was used on.*
&gt;
&gt;**Undercover (Passive) -** You appear not suspicious to Expert Investigation.  You do appear as Double Agent to Surveillance, though.
&gt;
&gt;**Impersonate (Night ability - 2 uses)** Trollbox prison chat as either &quot;Prince&quot; or the prisoner.
&gt;
&gt;**Intercept (Night ability - 2 uses) -** Occupy any investigative classes visiting your target, and receive the feedback they would have received.

Daytime class flips were once infallible, but Disguise changed that for the better.  So why must nighttime evil and prison chat be infallible?  Just imagine how funny the trollboxes would be in those circumstances ...

Someone may object that this will silence the evil chat and prevent them from communicating entirely.  But I don&#39;t believe this would be the case.  If the Agent reacts too transparently to what he learns from night chat, he can be identified and insta-converted/killed.  You can also feed him false information.</description>

            <p>don’t feel too bad on this… 80% of town of salem players thought it was a good idea when it was in… however almost every one of them that stuck around to discuss changed their mind after debating with orange or others active on the blank media forums, and then when the "comprimise (IE mafia was made aware of the games that didn’t have a spy), made people aware of how useful scum chat could be when you didn’t have to assume a spy was listening… it then was finally overturned and removed.</p>
<p>I know hearing me and orange ripping at every arguement for it may seem like we’re tearing down a firefighter level bad idea (or ToL equivelant, a class soley made to defuse sorc bombs). but it isn’t as obvious to someone who hadn’t spent a year playing ToS, and analyzed how much the spy shifts the meta.</p>
<p>and yeah I know you invited me to the topic specifically… but yeah I’m sure you probably also know, I’m universally one of the toughest critics on almost all class sugestions, and it being very similar to something I spent 3 months fighting against, well that was inevitable there.</p>

</aside>
<p>Of course you do… but telling the truth in scum chat isn’t the way to do that… If you say you are converting 13, and then someone claiming sheriff says he scouted 13 and saw the conversion… it could be an agent, or it could be a sheriff (they do still have scout right, man I’ve been away a while).</p>
<p>OOOOR…</p>
<p>You could convert 13… but say you are converting 2… now asside from a scorned or something, the only way someone just turned on 2… is if he was in fact the agent.</p>
<p>The main thing is… if you want to catch the agent… you shouldn’t use your chat to say anything truthful ever. Just like in town of salem mafia chat degraded into nothing but spy baits.</p>
<p>“Oh but if they aren’t expecting it… maybe you’ll trick them by sliding actual plans through while being watched” you say… no because your teammate will think you are BSing the agent, so he’ll be ignoring it also.</p>

            <p>It’s debatable whether flipping as Unseen when executed by Prince would be effective in destroying the credibility of your logs.</p>
<p>But I insist that spying on scum chat will not mute it if they are notified it’s being watched. The insta-convert thing forces you to be extremely careful with how you utilize your knowledge.  I do not understand why you say there is no inbetween.</p>
<p>Say an Agent spies Unseen saying they are converting 16.  Whoever throws suspicion on 16 is now a possible Agent.  And you still don’t even know if 16 was converted.</p>
<p>Maybe there is the misconception that less communication while an Agent is spying is objectively, universally always optimal play.  But that is not true, since you want Agent to accidentally out himself.</p>

            <p>anything else is just as likely to be killed by prince…</p>
<p>also if you don’t cost prince’s executions… then you accomplish agents actual purpose… DIE to give some of his information out there… doesn’t matter if it’s trustworthy or not… it’s at least checkable, sheriff can see if X was converted on the day they said “convert X” etc…</p>
<p>Unless of course the unseen wasn’t idiotic… and adapted the way we all keep saying they are going to, by functionally considering their chat not really existing if it isn’t secure.</p>
<p>You have 2 possibilities for a scum chat reader</p>
<p>Either… you finally succeed, you make enough caveats that reading scum chat doesn’t put unseen/cult at a disadvantage if they use their chat… in which case you’ve nerfed the class down into something nobody would ever want to play.</p>
<p>B. The class has potential to be strong in certain cases… in which case… the unseen/cult should never use their chat in games where it is possible it is being tapped.</p>
<p>There isn’t an inbetween there.</p>
<p>I get what you are going for, you are trying for what effectively is a BD scorned. IE someone who actually knows the evils, but has to trick people into thinking he’s a sheriff or something to try and actually get people to act on them. But in the end, the sane counter is simply don’t use the chat… unless you nerf it to the point where there’s no chance he can succesfully act on that information… but if you succeed there… what are you left with?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>which solves what exactly? Obviously the logs are going to say it’s an agent claim. Agents are probably going to preffer to die via execution which negates fool flipping. In the end they are going to know when they see that log that either, it’s an agent with all the unseens information… or a trick in which an assasain or similar fake put agent in his will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Assassin or Double Agent flip works better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>look in order to save your class, you have to render it so useless that everyone possible would hate to be… in order for reading scumchat to be balanced, you have to render it in a way that you eliminate any loophole in which people would ever believe it…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agent has to utilize his knowledge without exposing the source of his knowledge.  It’s challenging but not impossible at all.  Unseen do it all the time to out the NK, and you don’t even necessarily have to lie in order to do it.</p>

            <p>So is most claims. You don’t fake claim to Prince just because your class isn’t provable</p>

            <p>Because Agent is a cheap scum claim to Prince, and Mystic can out you, especially if they get converted.</p>
