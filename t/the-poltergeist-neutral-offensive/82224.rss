    <title>The Poltergeist (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-poltergeist-neutral-offensive/82224</link>
    <description>**Poltergeist - 1st form**

Neutral offensive

**win condition:** die and then have the player responsible for your death lose

**passive:** if you die for any reason, instead of going to the graveyard, go to your second form. The person responsible for your death is now haunted by you. 

**Night ability 1 (inf use):** tornado (exactly like court wizard)
**Night ability 2 (2 uses):** frame yourself and redirect someone to you

**Day ability (inf use):** pick a class; if you die for any reason your body will appear as that class



**Poltergeist - 2nd form**

**win condition:** the person you are haunting loses

**passive 1:** You are exactly like a dead person except you don&#39;t have access to dead chat and still have abilities. You may only interact with the game via your abilities.
**passive 2:** While the hauntee is alive, you can see everything they see (including their class, whispers, cultseen chat and night feedback) 

**Night ability 1 (inf use):** tornado
**Night ability 2 (same number of charges as you had of first form night ability 2):** if the hauntee is still alive, frame them and redirect someone to them

**Day ability (3 uses):** silence
**Day ability (1 use):** force someone to vote for someone else and prevent them voting for the rest of the day

Special cases: 
* If several people are responsible for your death, one of them is chosen at random to be haunted. 
* If you died by trial, it&#39;s randomly chosen among the people who voted execute.</description>

            <p>because then you disguise yourself on trial and then boom that one person just gets killed incredibly quickly</p>
<p>or well something like that</p>
<p>just think its a really strong abil</p>
<p><s>though maybe not in ToL</s></p>
<p>just might make the poltergeist think more about what they choose</p>

            <p>Why should your body disguise only have limited uses? What’s even the logic behind limiting its use? The poss has a similar ability and it is infinite use (only difference is poss’s only triggers when the poss jumps; this one triggers if you die for any reason)</p>
