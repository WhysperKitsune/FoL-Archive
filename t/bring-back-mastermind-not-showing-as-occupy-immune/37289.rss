    <title>Bring back Mastermind not showing as Occupy Immune</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bring-back-mastermind-not-showing-as-occupy-immune/37289</link>
    <description>I was interested in this change initially, but after playing a _lot_ since then, all Unseen games are becoming a bit predictable with literally everyone claiming Butler. The Mastermind showing as occupy immune is leaving him able to claim: Drunk, Butler, or Hunter (unless he gets lucky enough to not get targeted by a Drunk or Butler). Hunter has been a long-time easy scum claim, and any Drunk claim is instantly outed as soon as the King dies and he doesn&#39;t step up during royal blood.

So The Mastermind is most likely claiming Butler, the Assassin likes to claim Butler because of his poison, and you have the chance of also converting a Butler. It&#39;s just very boring, and makes playing Mastermind a drag because you don&#39;t get to claim anything fun. At least before you got to try with Princess, Sheriff, Alch, etc, and Observer for the daring.

Please reconsider the change you made; NO MORE BUTLERS. &lt;3</description>

            <p>I think the mastermind should definitely not show as occupy immune, because right now only characters that are killer/offensive and fool/scorned are occupy immune, which makes the mastermind easy to spot (i.e not killer/offensive and occupy immune).</p>
<p>Although claiming court wizard barriered you helps.</p>

            <p>I’m starting to feel that the Butler should flatly never get feedback on whether his target was occupied successfully or not.  He’s not supposed to be an Investigative class.</p>
<p>…however, that might weaken him too much, so we might <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> want to consider removing occupy immunity from some classes, or weakening it slightly (eg. a Mastermind is only Occupy Immune when converting, but can be occupied when using Foresight - although really, if you’re a Mastermind and you’re being occupied repeatedly, you’re already screwed.)</p>
<p>To be honest…  how necessary is the Mastermind’s occupy immunity in the first place?  It would lead to occasional feelbad moments where you’re occupied N1, but unless you’re completely outed it’d probably only slow you down for one night.  The Assassin’s lack of Occupy Immunity doesn’t seem to be catastrophic (and rarely gets them caught).</p>
<p>The problem is that giving Occupy Immunity to almost everyone important risked making the Butler pointless…  unless you gave the Butler the ability to see occupy immunity, which is actually often <span class="bbcode-i">worse</span> for evils than missing a night.  As he is now, just flatly removing occupy immunity from the Mastermind would probably be a buff, especially if paired with removing all feedback from occupies.</p>
<p>I mean occasionally an obsessive Butler will occupy you from the start despite having no evidence or reason to do so, but a jailor could do that anyway, and it doesn’t really happen that often.  Why does Throne of Lies give Occupy Immunity to so many people, basically?  The lack of occupy immunity only occasionally seems to be a problem for the Cult Leader or Reaper.</p>

            <p>I was thinking only showing as not occupy immune on the first 3 nights, as with his investigative “in the shadows” passive.</p>
