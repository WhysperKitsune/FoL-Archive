    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Vessel (Cult Class)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-vessel-cult-class/10777</link>
    <description>The Vessel - Special

The idea for this class is to essentially be a powerful trick that the Cult can pull. I think the idea is good, though I don&#39;t know how powerful it is. Recommended changes are more than welcome.

**Passives**: 
A New Vessel
 - Upon death, the current Cult Leader can choose to become the new Vessel. Number of charges carry over to the new Vessel. Second Vessel does not have this passive.

Overwhelming Power
 - The Vessel will die after three days.

**Abilities**: 
Demonic Grip: Night Ability
 - Prevent a target from taking any action
 - Player will be aware that it was a grip that effected them
 - Has 2 charges

Corax&#39;s Shroud: Night Ability
 - Causes all Cult members to appear as non suspicious for the night
 - Has 2 charges

Curse of Mithras: Night Ability          (this one is attributed to grahfite, who suggested something like this [here](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/cult-games-are-slow-speed-them-up-by-giving-cult-killing-abilities/7033))
 - Attack a target, giving them bleed
 - Any players that visit or are visited by your target will also gain bleed. The affected will die after 2 days if not cured
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vessel must be created by the Cult Leader, via this new ability:

Blood Ritual
 - Cultists sacrifice 5 charges as a whole to transform the Cult Leader into a Vessel. Another Cultist will become the new Cult Leader
 - Charge is carried over to every Leader; once it is used no other Leader may use it (not sure if this is necessary)</description>
