    <title>Knight Rework-Duel</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/knight-rework-duel/30408</link>
    <description>Right now knight&#39;s guard is REALLY bad and I mean REALLY bad.Here&#39;s my Idea for a change.
Replace Guards with Duel.Night ability 1-Duel-Go to someone&#39;s door dueling one person who visits them(Prioritizing attacks first)-Infinite uses
What dueling means.That night you and your opponent will duel.This will occupy them bypassing occupy immunity.If the visit was an attack you will both walk away with bleeding wounds that will kill both of you in one day(Bypassing night immunity).You also both know who each other are.(So you will know you dueled 8 last night)(and 8 will see you were dueled by a knight)
What this means is you trade one for one but you can be saved and are super good when confirmed.
The other thing that should happen with this to get rid of perception.This will make the Possessor bleed instead of the person possess.This would effectively
make guarding a risk so decision making.It also makes you able to finally prevent kills and not have to trade one for one.It makes you willing to kill an assassin,CL,and any NKs as you can be saved.

One thing that I would like but might be too overpowered is making knight able to kill sorcerer and reaper but that might be a tad too strong which is why i think this is fine.Effectively a late sacrifice but as your dying you can ask for heals and out the attacker.</description>

            <p>The point of the ability is cover from all of the dangers that come from attacking someone. Observer I’d have to say is the weakest of the defences. Because the odds are about the same of the person you attacked being observed, as the person you posses being observed. With observer you only change who they have to watch, rather than protect yourself from being watched. If the observer is watching you, or the person you control, you are still going down to observer.</p>
<p>Knight and hunter are the 2 that controlling people actually protects you from.</p>

            <p>isn’t the point of the ability against observers?</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t change how it interacts with Possessor. You already made it so that you can save the attacker if they were possessed. Don’t negate the point of the ability.</p>
