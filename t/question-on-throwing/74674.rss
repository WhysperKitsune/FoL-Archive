    <title>Question on Throwing</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/question-on-throwing/74674</link>
    <description>Hey all! Just a weird game outcome and Im not sure this was throwing or no. Im really stymied on it lol.

I was possessor (#5) posing as prince (Just taken over him so he was confirmed)
#4 was MM
#9 was Unseen King
#15 was butler

I told them I was jailing #4. Butler said &quot;Well then I guess Ill occupy 5&quot;. I said &quot;Dont, occupy 4 just in case I mess up&quot;.

TLDR - Butler occupied me, MM converted butler, and they voted me off the island.

Fine, I dont mind dying. But to me, the butler threw by occupying a prince instead of a known evil (There was a dead NK in our list and no one suspected the NK was still alive) just to get converted since we knew King and 4 were unseen.

Anywhoo - Just wondering on your thoughts?</description>

            <p>Sorry for the long delay in answering -</p>
<p>In case I mess up means -</p>
<p>In the last 10 seconds of the day you cannot jail someone. I was playing for time by saying in case I bugged or couldnt get the jail to work. It was a Just in Case of shit happening to make sure - type of situation</p>
<p>Also, yeah I know what you mean by you cant be confirmed. What I meant by that was I was as confirmed as I could be under the circumstances. The other guy was 100% MM. And NK was in the death logs (I had swapped with someone and made it look like Prince had killed poss).</p>
<p>Either way.</p>

            <p>I don’t get the claim there… “In case I mess up?” Did I miss an update, how can one mess up jailing? I don’t think I’d have followed that order either way.</p>
<p>Maybe if you tried to talk him into partying you’d have given him a good excuse</p>
<p>Also always silly when people call gamethrowing under the “But I was confirmed *****” when you were the exception to the confirmation. Confirmed ___ means there’s no possible way you aren’t. If it’s a possesor game… and the occ immune prince was acting afraid of being occupied, that’s pretty fishy.</p>

            <p>Yeah what Firekitten said.  I was Pretender that game (<span class="hashtag">#14</span>).  You were the only person the Butler could occupy, so he did it to prove to you that he was Butler.</p>

            <p>It all depends on the intention. Clearly his motivation was one not of seeing his own faction (BD) lose by occupying you.</p>
<p>Bad play (occupying a confirmed prince) <strong>doesn’t</strong> equal gamethrowing.</p>
