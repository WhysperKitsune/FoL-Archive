    <title>Observer can&#39;t see rebound</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/observer-cant-see-rebound/9575</link>
    <description>I observed when a Mercenary rebounded on another player but it showed up as the mercenary not visiting anyone. Not sure if this is intentional but it did throw the game off a bit. Not sure if this is working as intended but don&#39;t think it should be.</description>
