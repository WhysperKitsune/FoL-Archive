          <p><strong><em>So Fade and I brought this beautiful piece of lore idea to life and this is what we get, so here you go a little lore idea c:</em></strong></p>
<p>The goddess of light was first a mortal much to anyone’s surprise. She was a benevolent leader who cared for her people deeply however, not everything was well. One day a conspiracy arose lead by the cult of Mithras. They sought to murder her in the name of the blood god and at the time there was no one who could stop them. So they were able to get they wish and Queen Photine was killed that fateful night.</p>
<p>Later when Photine died she was surrounded by nothing but darkness and whispers she could see nothing. She wandered alone for weeks on edge not hungry not thirsty for she was already dead. She had no idea what to do and started to despair. As soon as she begins slipping and losing herself to the darkness and madness she sees something in the darkness as clear as any painting. It was all her people everyone she loved everyone she ever cared for. Where she thought to find anger from them she found only kindness. The same kindness they she gave them. As all the shadows that was consuming Photine began to rush out of her trying to escape the light that radiates from Photine. Ending the sea of darkness that was around her. Photine looked at her hands they were translucent and shimmering a slight gold, she pulled her hair forward to reveal that they had also transformed from a brown colour to a bright golden slightly shocked about the transformation, yet the power her people gave her the strength to move on.</p>
<p>As the darkness began to lift she sees a few familiar faces it was her old friend’s who was also where killed by the cult it was Breya and Zedekiah they said they had wandered the darkness for many years only now do they see clearly as they did before. However when it had turned night in the realm of the living so did it turn night in the afterlife as strong as it was before Photine power came. She could not bring light when the world is deep in shadows<br>
For many months Photine began to test her new power to figure out what she was able to do in her new form. She still held a deep hatred for Mirthas the blood god. She vowed she would end every work he would do as long as she exists she will stop him.</p>
<p>As Photine learns everything she could do she speaks with Breya and Zedekiah, she gives them each a blessing. The Blessing of spirits to Breya that lets her speak with the dead and bring them back. And for Zedekiah the blessing of justice that allows him to find and combat the work of Mirthas.<br>
After they all say their farewells Photine returns them to the world of the living.where they starting spreading the word of The goddess of light and begin to combat the cult to threatens to harm the people, innocent people</p>
<p>A thousand years later the story and blessing keeps getting passed down from mother to daughter a wisp symbol dance along their backs, and from fathers to sons an image of a flaming sword stands vigilante on their arm, all the worshipers the god of light has and always will pass on the legend</p>
