    <title>Other chat commands?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/other-chat-commands/29549</link>
    <description>I love the /w whisper command. Was wondering if there were any others than could make it so I have to mouse around even less. 

Are there commands to open your journal or use an ability or move the cursor to the chat bar?

If i could hit something to open journal, type what I was gonna do, hit something to close journal, hit something to put my curser in the chat bar, and type out /n 13 to use my first ability on 13 that night thatd be much better than moving my mouse around every time I wanna open close or start typing. Also a command like /a 2 to accuse 2 during the day? 

I know it sounds lazy and stuff but when you type fast it is so much better to be able to do a lot with chat commands.</description>

            <p>Well you would want /execute and /pardon too since that’s what they’re technically called <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>i agree, but with some particulars:<br>
/journal or /j - journal<br>
(escape key to close it)<br>
/a or /accuse [player number or name] to accuse<br>
/guilty and /innocent (maybe /g and /i) for obvious<br>
/n[ability number from left to right] or /night[same condition] [1st targets name/number] [second targets name/number] for night abilities<br>
/d or /day, with same format above for day abilities</p>
<p>just to make it specific</p>
