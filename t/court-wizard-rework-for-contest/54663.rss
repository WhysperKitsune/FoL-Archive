    <title>Court Wizard Rework for contest</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework-for-contest/54663</link>
    <description>&gt; Is it gone yet?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well I&#39;m just sending my idea
&gt;
&gt; https://forum.imperium42.com/t/court-wizard-contest/54572?u=htm

&gt; [color=lighblue]The Court Wizard, BD, Support :heart:[/color]
&gt; =
&gt; Passive 1: Magical  Magic: You will be occupy/redirection  immune the first time someone occupies or redirects you
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Ice ward: Your Abilities will prevent all visitors to your target in addition to it’s other effects, 2 use, (idea by NuclearBurrito)
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 2: Enhanced: Select a player, the player is allowed to pick 2 people to target with their main ability, only works on certain classes, the player will not be notified, 2 use, 2 day recharge time, (idea by NOBLE1, slightly tweaked though) 
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Magic Barrier: Protect a player from all negative effects, if someone tried using a negative effect on him a message will come up, saying you&#39;re target has been visited by a negative effect, this will not come up to your target unlimited uses
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Empowerment: Empower a player&#39;s abilities to go through attack/occupation/redirection immunity, this will not inform you&#39;re target, (example, butler occupies someone occ immune going through his occ immunity, it will just tell him he served wine to him), 2 day recharge time, unlimited uses

I&#39;m adding sage cause why not?

&gt;  [color=lapurple]The Sage, Unseen, Support :dagger:[/color]
&gt; =
&gt; Passive 1: Dark Magic:  You will be occupy/redirection immune the first time someone tries to occupy/redirect you
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Slither Snake: Make assassin&#39;s poison take a shorter time to kill the target, 2 use 
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 2: Ally Empowerment: Make unseen immune to all negative effects at night, 2 use(idea by SabreOverdrive)
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Tornado: Same
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2:  Fire Ward: Make only the assassin able to visit your target, 2 use
&gt; 
&gt; Feedback/suggestions are appreciated
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Enhanced will not work on:
&gt; Evils
&gt; Neutrals
&gt; King
&gt; Prince
&gt; Hunter
&gt; Mystic
&gt; Drunk
&gt; or Knight</description>

            <p>A good CW would, but Sage doesn’t know if they were protected or not, making every time he uses it a gamble if king were to ask for logs(unless he doesn’t include protected or not, but only scum do that)</p>

Only negative effects that can target your allies are occ/redirect on assassin anyway, so the ability is fairly useless. It also outs them if they show up occ immune unless it’s secret like the MM’s.<br>

<p>They will think CW barriered him since sage is most likely claiming CW</p>
<p>Edit: That’s strange why did it do that?</p>

            <p>The “Enhance” part from NOBLE1. Also being an offensive convert, that makes 4 offensive converts(herbalist, servant, alcoholic, and now sage) vs one support convert(enforcer). Now the MM knows that anyone shown up as support in Foresight is a knight, which might give too much info.</p>

<p>Anyone have an idea for a day ability? I will give credit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So I suggested this idea</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong><br>
<em><strong>Enhanced</strong></em> - select a player. The chosen player is allowed to pick up the two people for their primary night ability tonight (the unlimited night ability if they have one or the ability on the left). {they will not be notified of this action} (unlimited uses) (2 day cool down)</p>
<p><em>Ex. CW picks physician. Physician can now heal two people instead of one.</em></p>
<p>I want to hear feedback on it. It could either replace the ice ward or be kept as the second day Ability.</p>
