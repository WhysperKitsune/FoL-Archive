&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Special [/color]**
&gt; Passive: Astral projection - Unseen may chat privately in a separate tab during the day
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: Soul Bind - If target player dies after this ability is used on them you will gain their soul. Cannot collect a non-BD player&#39;s soul (Unlimited)
&gt; Night Ability 2: Necromancy - Use the primary ability of target dead player on your second target. You may only use the ability&#39;s of players who either were spirits or who&#39;s soul you gained. Does nothing if the ability required 2 targets or had no target. (Unlimited)

Note: Soul Bind may not target King or use a King&#39;s ability&#39;s 

Thank @Shrimpy for the revive ability that made this class possible</description>

<p>Except it’s effectively like the Priest is the one with the ability. After all if you go for her then the killer is gone. Death Knights had issues that don’t apply here (needless confirmation, no skill required to gain one, no method for scum to remove one)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with having dead interaction on evils though?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The fact that dead players are not part of the game. It’s like having an ability that looks at private notes, you just don’t do that.</p>
<p>Basically people in the dead chat shouldn’t need to worry about giving away info to other dead players (Ex: Prince identity as dead Mystic). Just in case a soulcatcher eventually exists for the evils to give the info to. And you can’t just have Unseen that die AFTER the soulcatcher spawns be apart of it because if an Unseen dies then you lose the soulcatcher 9/10 times.</p>
<p>So you would have to remove the dead chat entirely for the entire Unseen just on the off chance of a soulcatcher spawning. No one wants that</p>

<p>Because otherwise it would outclass every other convert in the game. Also some secondary’s have balance issues in being too strong, while ability’s being too weak is counterbalanced by having so much flexability</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Only if there are no restrictions for it, which I have a few ideas for.  And converts would still have day abilities and passives.<br>
btw here are my suggested changes in a class card:</p>
<p><font color="lighblue">Priest</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive: Light Sanctuary - Spirits may preform night actions and may speak to you at night in a separate tab. During the day they may speak under your name. Spirits die when you die or get converted. Spirits may not target you with ability’s. Unseen/Cult spirits count towards their factions limit and do not count as dead for promotions, they may commit suicide at night and may talk with their faction like normal</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: Channeling- Consume two souls to gain the passives of a captured soul.  Lasts until you target another soul.<br>
Day ability 2: Dismiss(Uses:Unlimited)- If  you have at least 1 soul left then choose a spirit or yourself.  Choosing a spirit will consume one soul to instantly kill them, bypassing everything. If you have no souls left or choose yourself then Spirits may not speak through you for the rest of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 1: Revive(Uses: Unlimited) - If target player would die for any reason then they will instead become a spirit, and you will gain your soul.  They will appear to flip as their starting class. Cannot save players that did not start as Blue Dragon.<br>
Night Ability 2: Rise- Consume 1 soul to use a night ability of target spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="Purple">Soulcatcher</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive: Dark Sanctuary - Ghouls may speak to you in a separate tab at all times. Ghouls die when you die or are promoted.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: Channeling - Consume two souls to gain the passives of a captured soul.  Lasts until you target another soul.<br>
Day ability 2: Denial(Uses: Unlimited) - Consume 1 soul to immediately kill target ghoul, bypassing everything.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Bind(Uses: Unlimited) - If target player dies after this ability is used on them you will gain their soul.<br>
Night Ability 2: Necromancy - Consume 2 souls to use an ability of target ghoul.</p>

            <p>Maybe a limited use day ability that makes a soulbound/spirit visit instead of the assassin, countering knights/hunters/princesses to a degree, weak to observers.</p>

            <p>Lets put it this way. If the Soulcatcher could use secondary’s and get passives ect. Then why would you ever convert a butler over her for example? When you could instead just convert the priest and then soulbind the butler</p>

            <p>She’s not a real JOAT, as she’s very restricted in what she can use, only once and from a dead player whose soul is collected. Can you give some busted examples, because right now I think she’s very weak.</p>
<p>Unique converts feel like they should carry some more power as it’s way harder to fakeclaim one, so to balance for that it should be attractive to convert them, so they still aren’t trusted THAT much. Sadly this doesn’t work too well for Hunter due to bear and Illusionist got nerfed, but that’s my take on them.</p>
