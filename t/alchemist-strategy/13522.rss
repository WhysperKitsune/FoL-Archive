    <title>Alchemist strategy</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/alchemist-strategy/13522</link>
    <description>(only works if there is another alchemist)

When the other alchemist reveals themselves, whisper that you are alchemist and you should heal eachother

Every night heal eachother

if you want to cure a bleed/poison or kill someone, whisper to them to use stone skin. They should still heal you. They can do the same for you

If it turns out they are NK, team up with them, as that is one less person who can kill you. Use your poisons to speed up their victory.

--------------

I did good with teaming with another alch, but have not tried the second part with the NK yet.

Keep in mind that the alchs are a sizable voting bloc in this and will likely vote together, so cult could win after getting 4 members, an evil king, and the alchs on their side with a staggering 6-7 Bd left!</description>

            <p>As Alch I usually just out to the King N1. Unless they’re completely new or a massive douche this works fine.</p>
<p>A simple “Hey King, idc what team you’re on, i’m Alch i’ll heal you till you give me an order”.</p>
<p>I’ve won i’d say 90% of the time doing this as Alch. And if the King dies, side with the new king.</p>

            <p>not a bad idea overall, though I do have to say as alc, things that kill in the night are usually the least likely things to kill me. Usually it’s that darn starting king.</p>
