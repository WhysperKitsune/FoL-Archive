    <title>#Off-Topic Pending Port to Discord (for reasons inside)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/off-topic-pending-port-to-discord-for-reasons-inside/81409</link>
    <description>## The Gist

Love you guys, but #off-topic is starting to burn a hole in the wallet: To host Discourse (this forum backend) on a VPS to get the quality you see, it costs me **$106~130ish/mo** to maintain these forums:

As these forums have been up since 2017, that&#39;s roughly $3,600 spent~

Since #off-topic is mostly treated like realtime chat, such as:  

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/54321st-poster-gets-a-cookie-mods-out/266/

This is bloating up the VPS, messing up trust levels, breaking search priorities, and overall realtime chat should really be in Discord instead of here ~ 

## The Plan

1. We&#39;re going to create a Discord ( https://discord.gg/tol ) **#fol-off-topic** channel for a familiar feel of faces.
2. #off-topic will either be locked, deleted, or hidden.
3. Optionally, #off-topic can turn into a **[Thronepass](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/new-thronepass-patreon-community-perks-forum-name-colors-titles-flairs/76833)**-exclusive section - let me know if you want this. If server costs are being held up, no problem.

## Alternately...

1. Here&#39;s my bill this month (below) - this is pretty much bare minimum:

**If our Patreon meets this monthly goal** (we won&#39;t calculate Patreon % fees), I&#39;ll reopen #off-topic. As of this moment, we&#39;re at $54/mo.

2. Later, I may be able to experiment with ads *only* in #off-topic , which may work, too; but have never experimented with ads before. Maybe after every x scroll you&#39;d see an ad.

Our Patreon sub gets *you* perks, too. Custom titles, special colors to stand out (with dark+light theme support), and even Discord stuff, too, so it&#39;s not just a 1-way street :slight_smile: Learn more here:

________________ 

## TL;DR
**Forum&#39;s expensive!** I&#39;ve been paying it for 3 years, now ~ need some help :/ #off-topic seems to bloat the servers more than any other, so we&#39;re porting this section Discord ( https://discord.gg/tol ) with it&#39;s own channel. 

However, we can unlock it if we make a group goal that equals+ my monthly VPS bill via [Thronepass (Patreon)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/new-thronepass-patreon-community-perks-forum-name-colors-titles-flairs/76833).
