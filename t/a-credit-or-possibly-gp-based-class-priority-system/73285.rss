    <description>Just throwing it out there,  a class priority system letting you spend a currency to have the system prioritize a class you want to play, and whoever spent the most would get that class, whether through GP, or perhaps a new type of currency. This would incentivize playing more, give us something else to spend GP on (if you use that or perhaps a credit based system on games played or mvps earned), to give players a chance to target a class they want to play as from a chosen priority list they can customize.</description>

            <p>That just removes the incentive to buy one, meaning it’s useless. 5% is a tiny amount compared to 10k GP. The highest cost weapon is 2k less then that(bowl of nails)</p>
<p>Since it’s useless and no one will buy it due to cost, then there is no point to putting it in. It’s just extra work when they could be doing bug fixes and new cosmetics</p>
<p>Plus, what marl said. It’ll be seen as pay to win.</p>

            <p>Or you can make some statue suck as:<br>
-You can equip up to 3 statue.<br>
-You can only equip 2 statue of same faction.<br>
-Each statue is 10000GP cost can only buy once.<br>
-Each statue increase your chance getting a class by 0,5% but will be disabled for a game after you got that class.</p>
