    <title>Copying death notes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/copying-death-notes/4704</link>
    <description>One of the things I like about ToL is not knowing what class killed someone unless the physician exhumes them. However, death notes stop this. I cannot make players think that someone was killed by the reaper if the reaper leaves a death note, as my computer is too slow to handle such precise drawing.

This is why I want to be able to copy another death note on a body onto your own death note. Adds more flavor to the game, more uncertainty, and more strategy for bad guys.</description>

            <p>Tryphon made some point about the artists having the rights tot he drawings made in game.</p>
<p>They don’t.</p>
<p>Also, luxx, you are acting like I want to plagiarize your death notes for the glory of it. I don’t, I want to copy them so people think I am you, if that makes sense. I want to confuse the BD as an evil.</p>

            <p>I don’t understand why you would argue that death notes must either be copyable or disabl2d for ranked .<br>
currently there are strategies that are possible within the current system and changing the system would make different strategies available .</p>
<p>but the crux is their is no inherent issue with the current system . it is a flat and level playing field and any player can use their own deathnote or not as they tactically choose to do so . They cannot however use other people’s death notes .This is a rule of the game .  This is no different to any other established rule in the game.<br>
the tactical advantages gained and lost by this being an established game rule make no difference to a casual game or a competitive game .<br>
You have yet to prove why it is a detrement to the game and equality of play , but are alreadylooking to implement a change to fix a problem that does not exsist</p>

            <p>This is what me and try were talking about in the back when I was thinking about doing that lecture with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/370920903493681153/370922758915227653/236C2VN.png" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/370920903493681153/370922758915227653/236C2VN.png</a></p>
<p>(perhaps the law should be reworded and come under public games as well?)</p>
<p>So yeah. If this was implemented, it would then cause really bad issues. I think from the evidence that I just showed you will suggest that this will likely not go ahead at all.</p>
<p>I think the best thing we can do from this point is move. Laws are made to be followed. Break it and face the consequences.</p>

<p>It’s not any sort of major problem, but good points are being made, and if a competitive mode is ever added (for some God-forsaken reason) death notes should either be disabled or have a feature like this.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem is you cannot make a system based on copying someone else’s work and make it discourage art theft at the same time.</p>
<p>Unless you make it so you auto-lose if you do it, there’s no way to make it possible.</p>
<p>I would also like to direct you all to my class suggestion Artist <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-artist/2949/" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-artist/2949/</a><br>
The whole idea of the class suggestion is to cause people to question “who killed who” based on death notes alone.</p>
<p>And idea like that wouldn’t work if <em>everyone</em> could access the ability of stealing someone’s death note.</p>

            <p>It’s not gonna happen.</p>

Make your own death notes.<br>
Don’t be lazy.<br>
Don’t be a thief.</p>
<p>Then there won’t be a reason to implement a system that encourages stealing! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
