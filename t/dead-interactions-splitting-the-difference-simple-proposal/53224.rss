    <title>Dead Interactions - Splitting the Difference (Simple Proposal)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/dead-interactions-splitting-the-difference-simple-proposal/53224</link>
    <description>If there will be *zero* dead interactions, here is a simple proposal:

   -  **_Allow the dead to see all whispers._**

Here is what this would accomplish:


 -  Allows dead to better observe/comment on gameplay choices and to openly discuss the game between factions.
 
 -  Something to look *forward* to after dying. (&quot;Damn, I got killed - let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on behind the scenes!&quot;)

 - No risk of this knowledge impacting the game, since there are *zero* interactions between living and dead.

This would make death more interesting as well as increase the opportunity to analyze and discuss gameplay.</description>

            <p>You and I sharply disagree on this issue, and I appreciate your pushing for what you believe so strongly.</p>
<p>I need to experience firsthand that the removal is a disaster before pushing Bos to reverse his decision. If I’m wrong and it’s as bad as you say, then I will certainly admit my mistake.</p>
<p>If he won’t reverse his decision, though, then I would love to see this proposal implemented. Other than taking cheaters into account, I don’t see any harm whatsoever in letting the dead see what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>Absolutely not.  This will only confuse people further when the dead-interaction patch gets reverted; the game shouldn’t be designed or balanced around untenable changes.  The important thing now is to keep pushing, <span class="bbcode-i">hard</span>, to stop the changes from happening, and to keep pushing hard to get them reverted when they role out, not to try and accommodate them.</p>

            <p>Yeah, unfortunately the existance of cheaters makes it a no-go. Stream sniping and intentional out of game communication make giving extra information to the dead a solid no go IMO.</p>
<p>I’m much more in favor of post game replay downloads that announce everything etc… which I know while they don’t give more fun to waiting for the game to end, they do give an awesome way to review all sides of a game, with effectively 0 risk of it being abused by cheaters.</p>

            <p>I forgot about the gambling. Probably because I never use it, ha. But yes, if there’s a setting somewhere in the client, that’d be good.</p>

            <p>True. An option somewhere to disable gambling and enable whispers is something I’d definitely go for.</p>

            <p>Maybe it could also replace gambling for that game because of how much easier it is.</p>

            <p>This is a GREAT idea…</p>
<p>…sans cheaters.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is making it an opt-in program with increased consequences if you’re ever reasonably suspected of abusing the privilege.</p>

            <p>Sounds good to me. I could see being dead a lot more interesting with this in play.</p>
<p>Note: Don’t let them see scum chat unless they are scum. TOO much possibility for cheating while at least whispers are already not foolproof so they are already careful about what they say there.</p>

            <p>Definitely would be nice, although dead interaction shouldn’t be removed.</p>
<p>As long as it is happening it would be good, though.</p>
