    <description>The tavern of Castle Adiart was bustling, the court had spent a long hard day doing...something, the barkeep wasn&#39;t really sure what it was the court did, but that didn&#39;t matter now, it was a time to relax and be merry.
Unless of course you&#39;re part of the tavern staff.
The staff were rushed off their feet as usual, and worse of all, *he* was here.
&quot;Wahey!&quot; came a raucous uproar from the corner of the tavern, the center of attention was the black sheep of the royal family, dressed in a ridiculous mismatching outfit with ale dripping down the front of his tunic, he slammed the tankard down on the table and let out a mighty belch, along with a cry of &quot;another!&quot;, the exasperated barkeep signaled to a waitress who brought over another round, the beer-soaked prince took the tankard and *glug glug glug* it was gone as soon as it came.
&quot;Wahey!&quot;
*Belch*
&quot;Another!&quot;
*Pour*
*Glug Glug Glug*
&quot;Wahey!&quot;
and so on.
The barkeep rolled his eyes, &quot;I know he&#39;s a Prince of the Realm but would it kill him to pay his tab once in a while&quot; he thought to himself
&quot;Wahey!&quot;
*Belch*
&quot;Another!&quot;
Suddenly the bar fell silent, a stunning figure stood at the doorway, his luscious hair and perfect jawline almost shone with the dim light of the tavern&#39;s lamps
&quot;Brother! Our Father wishes to speak with you, so cease these ridiculous antics and make yourself presentable&quot;
Two guards took the younger prince and escorted him to his chambers, where his butler was waiting with a change of clothes, his older brother tossed a sack of coins to the barkeep, &quot;This should be enough to pay for the drinks&quot;.
As the older Prince left the tavern he could have sworn he heard the barkeep mutter the words, &quot;I wish&quot;</description>
