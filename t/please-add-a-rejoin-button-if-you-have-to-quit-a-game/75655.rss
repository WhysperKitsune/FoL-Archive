    <title>Please add a rejoin button if you have to quit a game</title>

    <description>Hi,

I&#39;d really, really like to see a rejoin/reconnect button if you are forced to quit the game for whatever reason.

I&#39;ve recently [been having trouble with my graphics card in a few games](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/game-breaking-bug-game-makes-graphics-card-restart-causes-black-game-window/75546), and have had no option but to exit the game after the contents of the game window goes black.

There have been other times where I have been unable to rejoin, e.g. connection issues.

I would be very appreciative if a re-join button was added to the game.

If you&#39;re scared of players leaving/rejoining as a form of troll, you can just add it as a valid report reason.

LoL has a rejoin button, so why can&#39;t ToL?</description>
