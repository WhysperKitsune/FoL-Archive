    <title>CW change suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cw-change-suggestion/12719</link>
    <description>CW is bad AND boring now because every one kept complaining. Here is my suggested change:

-Recharge becomes infinite uses with 2-day cool-down  (cannot be used multiple times on same target)
-Ice ward gets 3 uses with no restriction (can even target king)


recharge is the most fun ability of the two, so make it the main one</description>

<p>Yes and ice ward also can be confirmed but that doesn’t mean its easy to confirm. You cant say that a 1 use ability is just as confirmable as an ability you can use an infinite amount of time which also requires no other person to prove it like ice ward does.</p>

            <p>It is horrible as Knight again.(which means that Knight is the only <em>good</em> fakeclaim again, except Sheriff and Pala; but those cannot last too long and are horrible at endgame, now that Physician is too confirmable, CW is a horrible gamble, and Observer was never a good fakeclaim since they track both. This mostly harms Unseen via MM(as the MM needs a longterm fakeclaim)</p>
