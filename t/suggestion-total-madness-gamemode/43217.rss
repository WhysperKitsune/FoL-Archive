    <title>[Suggestion] Total Madness Gamemode</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-total-madness-gamemode/43217</link>
    <description>**Total Madness** is a gamemode idea made by me.

It works like this:

**20 players** needed to start the game.
There is **no Fool or Scorned.**

**Both Cult And Unseen Spawns**, If Cult Leader or Mastermind tries to convert the other faction members, it will fail, if both factions tries to convert the same Blue Dragon/Mercenary in the same night, it will also fail.

**Layout:**

-----------------------------**The King**

60% Chance to be Blue Dragon
20% Chance to be Evil
19% Chance to be Neutral
1% Chance to be Psycho
If the King is Psycho, there will be only 1 other Neutral Killer (See below)

-----------------------------**Blue Dragon**

**2** Princes (They know who is getting targeted by the other Prince, they know each other at start and they cant jail the same person, they also cant target the other prince

**8** Blue dragon members (1 confirmed Sheriff with a 2nd Sheriff chance and 1 confirmed Paladin with 2nd Paladin chance)

**If there is a Psycho King, there is 9 Blue Dragon members instead of 8**

**Blue Dragon can have 3 of the same class if not unique**



-----------------------------**Evil And Neutrals**

**1** Mastermind
**1** Assassin
**1** Cult Leader
**1** Random cult member
**2** Neutral Killers
**3** Neutrals, If there is a Sorc, Inquisitor is in the game, if not, there is Mercenaries and Alchemists.


**Whats the point of Total Madness gamemode?**

Total Madness will be a super fun mode to play. Nobody will know whats happening the first days. Its a challenge to all veteran players and a new way to play Throne of Lies!

**FAQ** 

**Unseen and cult has to defeat each other?**
Yes.

**Neutral Killers can side to erradicate all 3 factions?**
Yes.

**Why no Fool or Scorned?**
Trollboxes in a 20 player game is too OP.

**Can Paladin find a Unseen member and Sheriff Cult members?**
Yes. In this gamemode, both investigators can get evil members.

**Smite kills the Mastermind?**
No, but the Paladin gets a notification saying Mastermind tried to convert. Mastermind will fail the conversion. Paladin does not know who is the Mastermind.


**Hope you like the Idea!** if you like it, I would love to see your feedback. Also **if you have a suggestion please tell me so!**



**ChangeLog**

King is no longer 100% BD
Changed the 3 of the same a bit
Added second prince
Fixed the empty slot if there is a Psycho King</description>

            <p>Why would this be a bad thing? You can just claim prince to each other. Jailing is super verifiable. If they both jail the same target, that’s the only problem. Just make it so whoever uses the day ability first, gets to jail the target, the other one gets a failed message.</p>
<p>I mean 2 NK’s can also attempt to kill each other right? So why is having some prince collision any different.</p>

            <p>I think 3 confirmed Physicians won’t give as much claim space as you think. I think merely increasing non-unique BD spawns to a max if 3 is better</p>

            <p>I think the confirmed BD king can just ask everyone to claim to them d2, and then whisper the king exactly what they did on the previous night, and the king can just exe anyone who won’t claim (of course, they won’t be fool, so it’s not risky).</p>
