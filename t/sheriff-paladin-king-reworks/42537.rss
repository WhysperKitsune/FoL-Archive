    <title>Sheriff, Paladin, King Reworks</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sheriff-paladin-king-reworks/42537</link>
    <description>Okay, the problems we did need were fixed, but it&#39;s my opinion that the game could be even better if polished and honed. I don&#39;t like the awkward way that we have two different investigatives that are just soft counters for different factions. And the King, in his current state, wields too much direct power that letting him loose, even at a 20% chance, is a liability.

Both the Sheriff and the Paladin should be able to appear in all games.

At least one Sheriff or Paladin will appear in every single game. (Similar to how at least one Physician or Alchemist will appear in every single game.)

So, these are my rework ideas. (I do not expect everyone to agree with this, I&#39;m just experimenting and see what ideas people may have on this topic.)

            <p>Not necessarily. Most power roles dont claim until mid to late game. You can try to counterclaim them and get them mislynched in a push for majority. (You kind’ve already see this with hunter.)</p>

            <p>Eh… You’d feel really bad about rolling a pally in an unseen game or a sheriff in a cult game though. I don’t think that’s good game design.</p>
<p>Whearas if they are BOTH Unique and 100% spawn rates only in their respective games, it makes you feel important and powerful.</p>

            <p>Okay, I see what you’re going for. Kinda was hoping to have them both appear in all games though, I feel that would at least give a buff to Unseen/Cult bc being Sheriff or Paladin doesn’t confirm the existence of what faction you’re facing.</p>

            <p>Yes, completely unconvertable but ALSO unique. The unique is important. Adding an extra unconvertable bd (for the first 3 nights, aka the most important nights to get converts) is going to drop the unseen’s win % a ton.</p>

<p>Sanctification: (D) (2)</p>
<p>When you use Smite tonight, you will attack the converter. Does not bypass night immunity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IMO The FoL day ability for paladin is so much better than this. I suggest you take a look at the FoL Class cards, they’re really interesting.</p>

<p>Protect a target from conversion. If anyone tries to convert either you or your target, they will be silenced and unable to use their night abilities tomorrow.</p>

<p>Once again, too much conversion protection is NOT a good thing. Court Wizard already has this gimmick!</p>
<p>Paladin needs to be able to check people at night, or there needs to be a new investigative class for cult games.</p>

            <p>The changes to the sheriff; I’m not a fan of because it’s power creeping the blue dragon EVEN FURTHER. Marshal will likely never to be played still, and a non-unique bd class that is immune to conversion like that is ABSOLUTELY degenrately strong.</p>

<p>An interesting twist on the prince’s jail ability, but I feel as if there will be too many prevented results on abilities. I don’t like this as well. I would just keep royal finger instead of this. Royal finger is ABSOUTELY necessary for endgame.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Okay, the problems we did need were fixed, but it’s my opinion that the game could be even better if polished and honed. I don’t like the awkward way that we have two different investigatives that are just soft counters for different factions. And the King, in his current state, wields too much direct power that letting him loose, even at a 20% chance, is a liability.</p>
<p>Both the Sheriff and the Paladin should be able to appear in all games.</p>
<p>At least one Sheriff or Paladin will appear in every single game. (Similar to how at least one Physician or Alchemist will appear in every single game.)</p>
<p>So, these are my rework ideas. (I do not expect everyone to agree with this, I’m just experimenting and see what ideas people may have on this topic.)</p>
