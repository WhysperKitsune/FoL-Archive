    <title>The Necromancer [Neutral Killer]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-necromancer-neutral-killer/78274</link>
    <description># *&quot;Many have come, but many more have went. What a large supply of power that lies around. How wasteful of them.&quot;*

&gt; # The Necromancer [Neutral Killer]
&gt; ## Passives
&gt; **Dancing with Death** - *Bleed* immune. If a *Reanimated* is controlled, they die instead of the Necromancer, and the Necromancer will be prevented from doing their action.
&gt; **Prepared** - You start the game with one *Reanimated* under your control.
&gt; ## Day Abilities
&gt; **Deathly Influence** - Force a player to accuse another. *(2 uses)*
&gt; **Untapped Power** - Choose a dead player that has not been *Reanimated* before. They will become your new *Reanimated*. *(Inf use, 1 day cooldown)*
&gt; ## Night Abilities
&gt; **Create Power** - Attack a player. If they are guarded by a Knight, the Reanimated will die. *(Inf use)*
&gt; **Last Rites** - Gain 1 use  of any one of the *Reanimated&#39;s* abilities. *(Inf use, can only use this once per Reanimated)*

&gt; ## Notes
&gt; The starting *Reanimated* does not have any abilities to use.
&gt; You do not have to use Last Rites&#39; ability gain immediately, and there will be a third box on each cycle that allows you to access these abilities.
&gt; If there is demand for it, I will add that the *Reanimated* will &quot;Decay&quot; in a certain amount of days.</description>

<p>And can you have more than one extra ability at once by reanimating someone else before using the ability?</p>
