    <title>[Class Sugesstion] Director (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-sugesstion-director-neutral-offensive/3071</link>
    <description>I love the Control Freak in Camp Cadaver, so I thought I&#39;d make a class based on that.

**Objective**: Cause three deaths. (This can be redirecting or bait and switching a killer into a different person, or an execution that gained majority due to your personal vote and/or your micromanage vote, but not a vote that would have successfully executed regardless of your votes)

Passive - Focused
Immune to Occupation.

Day Ability - Micromanage (2 uses)
Force a player to vote execute or pardon on a current vote. They will be locked into this choice (meaning they can&#39;t change to a different option).

Night Ability 1 - Redirect (Infinite uses)
Control a player, causing them to target another with their chosen night ability. There will be no effect if the ability they were using can&#39;t be used on that target, or they didn&#39;t use an ability.

Night Ability 2 - Bait and Switch (2 uses)
All players who visit you tonight will have their chosen night ability redirected to a target player.</description>

            <p>I feel like this would be easy to win as. Just find a killer.</p>
