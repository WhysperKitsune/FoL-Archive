    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-king-type-merciless-king/10426</link>
    <description>&gt;[color=black]**Merciless King - Neutral Faction**[/color]
Win Condition: Watch until the end to see all main factions die.
*has all abilities that king should usually have. except there&#39;s some Scorned like stuff in here to help get people killed.*
**Day Abilities:**
Trollbox: 3 uses. self explanatory.
**Night Abilities:**
Frame: Makes target appear suspicious to investigative classes.
Corrupt Knight: 2 uses, can only be used if the current Neutral Killer is dead or there is no Assassin or Cult Leader currently present in the game.
Who becomes the merciless king?
Can be there at the start of a game.
If people would want. NKs would become this, Scorned would become this too if that is the case.</description>
