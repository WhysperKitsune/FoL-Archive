    <title>Suggestion: Dayvig Mechanic for Unseen</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-dayvig-mechanic-for-unseen/52265</link>
    <description>I want an evil class to have a dayvig ability that immediately kills their target and outs yourself to the court. 

Something like:

**Day Ability - Desperate Strike (1 use)**: Murder your target in plain sight of the entire court. They are killed immediately and you are automatically voted up to trial.

**Why Dayvig for Evils?**

This will make D1 Prince claims very dangerous. This would be the only true threat to an early Prince claim as poisoning or bleeding a Prince doesn&#39;t work since there will almost always be an Alch or Physician to heal them. But killing them straight up in cold blood over the discussion table....sounds scary.

It&#39;s a great ability if you have majority or think you have majority with neutral support. It won&#39;t happen every game as the MM needs to convert a Knight, but the mere threat of an Enforcer on D2 could be enough to scare Princes from claiming.

**Who should get this ability?**

The Enforcer. The Enforcer is fairly mediocre once he uses his Frenzy, so sacrificing yourself after a Frenzy usage won&#39;t feel as bad if he had better night abilities. Preventing visits to an Unseen is pretty good though, so you&#39;ll have to weigh your options and make interesting choices between wanting to protect long term or go for the short term, high profile kill.

**Overpowered?**

Probably. Simply because it allows Mastermind to convert somebody the following night after the Enforcer is lynched. However, _BD doesn&#39;t have to lynch_ the outed Enforcer if they don&#39;t want that to happen.

**Thoughts?**</description>

<p>This tradeoff isn’t reasonable if they are the NK.<br>
Dayvig needs to also include ‘If your target is immune to death, your attack will fail and the entire court will be aware of the attempt.’</p>

<p>I don’t think so. No jails is less important than no converts (they are both important tho). It is not a fair trade. Not even close.</p>

            <p>Agree with Hip on all accounts here, honestly</p>
<p>I don’t want the Prince to NEVER be able to claim, I just don’t want D1 auto-win claims. I want it to be a delicate balance.</p>
<p>If Mastermind is given the dayvig ability, he should not be able to allow another Mastermind to take his place. A Prince for the Mastermind sounds fair.</p>

            <p>You’re right.</p>
<p>Thematically it doesn’t make sense for Nightwatch, Duchess, Sage, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe Poacher? Poacher is super good too.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no room for a dayvig with the current classes.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with this idea. However, i think this should be changed.</p>
<p>What would i change?</p>
<p><em>Add the dayvig killing ability for Assassin.</em><br>
Imho, it should be a replacement for Distract. And maybe add the Distract for MM instead.<br>
This would make that it’s always dangerous for Prince to out himself.</p>
<p>But honestly this ability should be also added for Cult. New Cult Killer class?</p>
