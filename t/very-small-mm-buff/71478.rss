    <description>if you use dirty work to become the Assassin you will still retain the can&#39;t touch this passive this makes mm-Assassin a much more dangerous threat at night as most direct attacks cant kill you which I feel is I fine tradeoff for no more converts</description>

            <p>Dirty work’s only real intention is for a lone MM not to be crippled against a set of unconvertable players like Good king, NK, alchemist, Prince and Scorned that already won for instance.</p>

            <p>That’s not a small MM buff, that’s a MASSIVE mastermind buff because unseen will have a massive advantage in NK vs MM situations as the mastermind can become the assassin and simply bleed the poss or reaper and force a draw in certain cases, the point of being able to become an assassin is the ability to kill at night, which is better than the ability to convert in certain situations ie GK vs MM where king is out of guards</p>
<p>Tl;dr I disagree with this change as the uses of it are limited and the only win rate change will be a slightly lesser NK win rate and a slightly higher unseen win rate</p>
