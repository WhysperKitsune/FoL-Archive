    <description># The Lunatic - Neutral Wildcard

_Passive: Deranged Visions_
Kills everyone that visits him at night. If he kills somebody, he will drink Black Wine to forget, but also causing him to speak improperly

**Night Ability: Medicinal Herbs - 2 uses**
Disables the effects of deranged visions, you won&#39;t kill anyone that visits you. The herbs you use are included in the Alchemists Tar Potion, thus causing you to lose your vision throughout the day at random moments.

**_Goal:_** Survive

**Lore**
War. Many people live through war and never come out the same. This was said about many knights and dames of Adiart. War. It changes lives and not for the good. The only good that comes from war is the aftermath, the peace. One in particular had his world shifted into a life of agony and pain. He couldn&#39;t stop himself most of the time. People that visited would be met by a deranged man spewing words about death and destruction. He would often hide their bodies within the pigs grub, the perfect place and undetectable. Afterwards, to forget what he did, Black Wine would be his pick of the poison. Stumbling throughout the Castle, he would find himself unable to speak to his peers. However, help was given to him in the form of herbs that stopped his visions at night. The alchemist that served the King would induce him into a calm sleep, however, came at the price of his vision, as he would go blind at times throughout the day. Thus, is the life of The Lunatic.

**NOTE:** _I had this idea at 5am, so there are probably things that can be improved. Also **huge thanks** to @ThePlex for helping make this class what is is now._</description>

            <p>Agreed.<br>
I think you need an ability that makes him useful to both factions.<br>
Otherwise he will just die the moment he claims.</p>

            <h1>The Lunatic - Neutral Wildcard</h1>
<p><em>Passive: Deranged Visions</em><br>
Kills everyone that visits him at night. If he kills somebody, he will drink Black Wine to forget, but also causing him to speak improperly</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability: Medicinal Herbs - 2 uses</strong><br>
Disables the effects of deranged visions, you won’t kill anyone that visits you. The herbs you use are included in the Alchemists Tar Potion, thus causing you to lose your vision throughout the day at random moments.</p>
<p><strong><em>Goal:</em></strong> Survive</p>
<p><strong>Lore</strong><br>
War. Many people live through war and never come out the same. This was said about many knights and dames of Adiart. War. It changes lives and not for the good. The only good that comes from war is the aftermath, the peace. One in particular had his world shifted into a life of agony and pain. He couldn’t stop himself most of the time. People that visited would be met by a deranged man spewing words about death and destruction. He would often hide their bodies within the pigs grub, the perfect place and undetectable. Afterwards, to forget what he did, Black Wine would be his pick of the poison. Stumbling throughout the Castle, he would find himself unable to speak to his peers. However, help was given to him in the form of herbs that stopped his visions at night. The alchemist that served the King would induce him into a calm sleep, however, came at the price of his vision, as he would go blind at times throughout the day. Thus, is the life of The Lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>I had this idea at 5am, so there are probably things that can be improved. Also <strong>huge thanks</strong> to <a class="mention" href="/u/theplex">@ThePlex</a> for helping make this class what is is now.</em></p>
