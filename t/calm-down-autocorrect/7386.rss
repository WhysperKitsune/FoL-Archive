    <title>Calm down, autocorrect</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/calm-down-autocorrect/7386</link>
    <description>So I love most of the changes with the new patch, but one thing that really bothers me is the overactive autocorrect. It automatically changes things like &quot;role&quot; to &quot;class&quot; and &quot;town&quot; to &quot;BD&quot;. I can understand wanting to limit profanity, but &quot;role&quot; and &quot;town&quot; are not dirty words. It&#39;s more than a little annoying that you&#39;ve decided what I should be forced to call bits of the game, especially a game that&#39;s all about communication and deception, where the specific things that I type determine how well I do in the game. I feel that a game like this pretty much requires full freedom in what we type, aside from things like profanity or slurs and the like.</description>

            <p>Also I feel like there are times when I actually want to use the term role in a conversation. “The roll of the Hunters wolf is to force claims in the day without vfc and to prove yourself. Not just to kill”</p>
<p>That first part corrects to: “The class of the Hunters wolf”</p>
<p>Also I am waiting for the day when someone says in game: “Give me some logs to sell so that I can roll up to the mafia and pay them off in cash doc!”</p>

            <p>Yeah, good point.  Didn’t look at it like that.  Basically you’re saying you have a journal that you write everything that you’re thinking into, and part of that journal (The part where you write what you actually did) is the informal “logs” section of the journal you’re keeping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From their explanations on the steam forums, basically the dev’s are saying they’ve seen a boatload of games in which new players are getting killed in jail etc… because they don’t understand what it means when the prince asks them role and logs.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>New players are still going to be killed, though, because they’re still going to make new player mistakes. Like not even keeping logs, for one, among any number of other newbie mistakes people make. I guess I just don’t see why new players can’t learn the same way the rest of us did, by playing.</p>
<p>As for logs, “logs” and “journal” are not the same thing. When I ask for your logs, I don’t want your whole journal, I want specifically your logs of what you did each night. So it’s not even correct terminology there.</p>
<p>I dunno, maybe it’s just the individualist in me, but I just don’t like people trying to tell me what I can and can’t say when it’s not related to things like profanity. If you’re really worried about people not understanding what “role” means, add a line in the tutorial saying “Some players refer to your class as a role.”, and maybe even explain the difference between your logs and your journal. That is, I think, a far better option than forcing my language to conform to how you want me to say things.</p>

It’s more than a little annoying that you’ve decided what I should be forced to call bits of the game, especially a game that’s all about communication and deception, where the specific things that I type determine how well I do in the game.

<p>From their explanations on the steam forums, basically the dev’s are saying they’ve seen a boatload of games in which new players are getting killed in jail etc… because they don’t understand what it means when the prince asks them role and logs. As the tutorial pretty exclusively uses the term journal and class, basically there’s no way for the new player to understand what they are asking for, and  many of them are killed in jail before getting a good explanation, which leads to a really crappy first impression of the game.</p>

            <p>So I love most of the changes with the new patch, but one thing that really bothers me is the overactive autocorrect. It automatically changes things like “role” to “class” and “town” to “BD”. I can understand wanting to limit profanity, but “role” and “town” are not dirty words. It’s more than a little annoying that you’ve decided what I should be forced to call bits of the game, especially a game that’s all about communication and deception, where the specific things that I type determine how well I do in the game. I feel that a game like this pretty much requires full freedom in what we type, aside from things like profanity or slurs and the like.</p>
