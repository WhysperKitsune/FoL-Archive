    <title>Minor King Change</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/minor-king-change/52549</link>
    <description>Id love to make a small change to kings abils.

The king gets 4 guards and some exes IF hes the original king.

Id like to suggest making it so if anyone attacks someone guarded by the king, the kings guards kill that person. This would carry over to anyone stepping forward to be king as well.

Ive had a few games where I was converted into a loss on a day the MM was hung, NK was dead,  and I was Evil King. Having no way to kill makes it a waiting game to lose pretty much.


Either this, or give kings that step forward any remaining exes.</description>

            <p>What about just allowing for the exes to carry over then? Instead of adding death to the guards?</p>

            <p>Your suggestion only kills evil and alchs (noone else can attack king)<br>
Evil king along will lose most of his games, his job is to make sure he is not along.</p>
