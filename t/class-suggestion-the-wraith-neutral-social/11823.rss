    <description>**Win condition**
Bait killing roles into killing you twice.

**Passive ability**
If you are attacked at night (all forms of attack work, including poison, hunter revenge and prince execution) you will possess the body of your attacker, even if they are healed, guarded or night immune.Your attacker cannot be revived or talk to the psychic.
The second time you possess someone you will win and die immediately, and all killing roles (including prince) will be unable to use their abilities for the next night. 

**Passive ability 2**
You cannot be healed or guarded at night. If someone attempts to heal or guard you they will get the &quot;Something prevented from visiting your target&quot; message.

**Day ability**
Trollbox (same as fool and scorned). Infinite uses.

**Day ability 2**
Listen to the prince tonight. Infinite uses. If you don&#39;t use this ability, you will listen to the cult/unseen instead.


**Night ability 1**
Trollbox a member of the cult/unseen. If you are listening to the prince, trollbox the person he jailed instead. Infinite uses.

**Night ability 2**
Prevent people from accusing you of treason tomorrow. 2 uses.

**Comments**
This is a class whose goal is to bait people into killing them at night. They should be careful to attract the attention of a killing role but avoid being hanged. They possess their victims in order to prevent cheesy wins by baiting the same faction twice or being randomly attacked two times. If for example they bait the unseen/cult they will possess whomever attacked them, which means they will have to bait either a neutral killer or a BD killing role into killing them if they want to win.

To bait someone, they have access to two versions of trollbox, and they can protect themselves from being accused if they think they are at risk of being hanged.

Notes: I added the &quot;Your attackers cannot be revived or talk to the psychic&quot; part to prevent dead people outing you, but Im not too sure about it.</description>
