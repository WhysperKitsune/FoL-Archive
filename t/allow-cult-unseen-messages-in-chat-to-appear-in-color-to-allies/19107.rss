    <title>Allow Cult/Unseen messages in chat to appear in color to allies</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/allow-cult-unseen-messages-in-chat-to-appear-in-color-to-allies/19107</link>
    <description>I was thinking it would be useful to have fellow cult/unseen messages show up in their respective font to their allies.

The font color would remain the same for non-allies.  But allies could easily recognize when one of their own types a message.

There are times when chat moves fast and if one of your evil allies are trying to say something it would be nice to quickly see it so you could offer supporting messages.  That would be faster than looking to the right and then back to the left and trying to cross reference it.

Thanks again!</description>
