            <p>I have the same issues with this as I did with NuclearBurrito’s Court Wizard idea: copying someone’s abilities gives you a strong, almost decisive idea of what players are. That delves a little too much out of support and into the realm of investigative classes, for my liking. Ricochet is a neat idea for a night action, though.</p>

            <p>Sage should be offensive. If it was support, it would directly help Unseen which it doesn’t.</p>
