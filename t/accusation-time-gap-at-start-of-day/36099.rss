    <title>Accusation time gap at start of day?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/accusation-time-gap-at-start-of-day/36099</link>
    <description>Can we get a small time where accusations can&#39;t go through at the start of the day?

Reasoning being that things like Noble abilities and Reaper Chill don&#39;t really work because someone can click your name faster than you can click the ability and then click the target.

It makes those abilities less useful at the times when they are most critical.

With a small time delay before people can hammer accusations at least those abilities have a chance of working.  Currently you can accuse _before the UI even loads abilities._  

Example:  Reaper vs 2 cult remaining.  Before Reaper can click chill, cult can accuse him.  Chill literally isn&#39;t rendered on the screen and he&#39;s already up for the trial and he loses.  Whereas with a couple seconds of delay he at least as a chance, if he&#39;s quick, to click them first.  Currently his ability wont even appear on the screen before he loses.

Same thing happens with Noble abilities or really any ability that affects voting.

I think a small window of 3-5 seconds at the start of the day where no one can vote is reasonable and would help classes with those abilities do something before being locked out.</description>

            <p>I do not like Snoop either. It makes Noble more of an Investigative Class. I will consider making a rework suggestion for it.</p>

            <p>About Noble</p>
<p>I suppose this is a cool idea too though, give it like 20 seconds even. Or more.</p>

<p>What about allowing people to use day abilities during the showing of who died (and extend that period if no deaths occurred)? It won’t add to the length of most days and won’t make the UI feel unresponsive by preventing people from taking actions when they feel they should be able to (like clicking to vote and having nothing happen).</p>

<p>Also make it so people can’t talk during the phase. That way the Reaper can ensure that the person says nothing.</p>
