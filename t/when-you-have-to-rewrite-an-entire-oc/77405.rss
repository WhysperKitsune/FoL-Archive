    <title>When you have to rewrite an entire oc</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/when-you-have-to-rewrite-an-entire-oc/77405</link>
    <description>Rewriting something is fun because it takes so much god damn time.

Overall I mainly want to tone down on a few of the more edgy aspects and flesh out major parts of the character.

Currently it feels like &quot;point a to point b&quot;

The more I talk about this character, I end up hating what I did even more.</description>

            <p>Character writing doesn’t need a lot at the start, I’ve found; you build on it as you go.</p>
