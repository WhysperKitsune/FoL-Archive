    <title>Physician can revive people who left the game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/physician-can-revive-people-who-left-the-game/10451</link>
    <description>I played my first game as the new physician, and I didn&#39;t know who to revive because  I could revive people who left the game.

I think you should allow physician to only revive people who are in the game, because unlike priest they can&#39;t talk to the deads and know who is in the game right now</description>

            <p>Brillant idea. Also block people from reviving people they can’t revive (neuts and evil). Its a bit annoying when you’re new at phys, you try to revive your merc and it says “sorry you can’t” the next night. Just make it newb friendly and don’t allow us to revive people we can’t revive.</p>
