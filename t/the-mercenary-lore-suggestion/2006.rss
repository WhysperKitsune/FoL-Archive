    <description>&quot;Professionals have standards. Be polite, be efficient, have a plan to kill everyone you meet&quot;-The Mercenary

A veteran of a war to the public that ever happened. The mercenary has learned many fighting disciplines. but they disregard the peace part of it. Now selling their services to the highest bidder, an unknown payer has contracted them to a person in the king&#39;s court the person they are contracted to have no clue about it. 

They mercenary asks the king for a place in his court and the king obliges due to the mercenary being a war veteran that saved lives. Being in the court learning about the hectic court politics, the back stabbing, and the Unseen and Cult. They decide that their contract&#39;s life is more important than their own.
