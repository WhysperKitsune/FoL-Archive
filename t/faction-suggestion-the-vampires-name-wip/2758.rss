    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-vampires-name-wip/2758</link>
    <description>only available in games with 16 players.
someone please leave a suggestion what this should be called, didn&#39;t want to call it the coven.
there are 2 blood lines of the vampires: the shepherds and the wolves. The master leads the shepherds, and the alpha leads the wolves . Each bloodline has a maximum of 3 members.
Both bloodlines share a night room.
Spawn with the master and the alpha.
Both bloodlines share a blood bank, which starts with 0 blood.
Both bloodlines win together.

------------------------
&gt;The Master
Vampire special
_passives: immune to death once, appears not suspicious to the slayer once_
**Night ability: Propagate**
Attempt to convert the target into your bloodline. If they have royal blood, they will become the count. Otherwise, they will become the youngling. -infinite uses, 1 day cool-down.
**Night ability two: Hematophagy**
Drink the target&#39;s blood, adding two more blood to the blood bank. -infinite uses

&gt;The Count

_Passives: royal blood_
**Night ability: Beguile**
Make someone target another player of your choosing. -costs 2 blood from the blood bank
**Night ability 2: Hematophagy**
Drink the target&#39;s blood, adding two more blood to the blood bank. -infinite uses

&gt;The Youngling
Vampire support
**Night ability: Hematophagy**
Drink the target&#39;s blood, adding two more blood to the blood bank. -infinite uses
**Night ability two: Ascend**
If there is no master, become the master. -costs 2 blood from the blood bank

-----------------
&gt;The Alpha
Vampire special
_passives: immune to death, appears not suspicious to slayer once_
**Night ability: Proliferate**
Attempt to convert the target into your bloodline. They will become the spawn. If you fail to convert them, you can use this again the next night. -infinite uses, 1 day cool-down
**Night ability: Hematophagy**
Drink the target&#39;s blood, adding two more blood to the blood bank. -infinite uses

&gt;The spawn
Vampire killing
**Night ability: Slaughter**
kill the target player -costs 1 blood from the blood bank.
**Night ability two: Decimation**
kill the target player, and bypass death immunity -costs 4 blood from the blood bank
**Day ability: Inherit**
Become the alpha. -costs 5 blood from the blood bank

------------------------------------------------&#39;
You can use an ability as long as there is enough blood in the blood bank. If there is 3 blood, then two different vampires can sue an ability that costs two blood; the blood bank would have -1 blood in it after. However, you would not be able to use an ability that requires 4 blood if the blood bank only has 3.

The master/alpha can&#39;t use their conversion abilities if there is negative blood in the blood bank.

Player&#39;s are informed if Hematophogy is used on them. multiple vampires can&#39;t use Hematophogy on the same target. If they attempt to, only one vampire will add blood to the blood bank from it.

---------------------------
&gt;The slayer
Blue dragon killing
_passives: (garlic) Kills any vampires that attempt to use Hematophogy on him_
**Night ability: Hunt**
Determine if your target is a vampire or not.
**Night ability two: stake out**
stake out in the player&#39;s room; if a vampire attempts to use Hematophogy on them, you will kill the vampire.

------------------
Lore: Any debate among the vampires is one of two things: territory, and the shepherd and the wolf philosophy.

Members of the Shepherd bloodline believe that vampires should guide humanity, and raise them like livestock humanely.
Members of the wolf blood line believe they should just take from humanity, as humans are basically ants; they live to short to come to any moral worth.

previously, one blood line ruled over the others after violent conflict. However, they face imminent destruction by the blue dragon and various rogues if they don&#39;t work together. The question isn&#39;t IF they will fight each other again; it is WHEN.</description>
