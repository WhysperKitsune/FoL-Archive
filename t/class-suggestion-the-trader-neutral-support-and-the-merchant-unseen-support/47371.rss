    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Trader (Neutral Support) and The Merchant (Unseen Support)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-trader-neutral-support-and-the-merchant-unseen-support/47371</link>
    <description>_Okay, so, I&#39;ve been lurking around on ToL and pretty active on the discord, yet I&#39;ve procrastinated on creating a forum account. So I did that, and now I present my terrible class idea! (Please don&#39;t be too harsh on me D: )_

Trader

Neutral Support

Passive 1: Determined - Immune to Occupation at Night.
Passive 2: Bankruptcy - If you do not trade for more than 3 nights in a row, you will go bankrupt, and be unable to use any night abilities anymore.

Example: If you don&#39;t trade N1, 2, or 3 (By closing up shop or not doing anything), you cannot trade anymore.

Night Ability 1: Trade - Trade with a fellow court member, occupying but also healing them. (Infinite Uses)

Night Ability 2: We&#39;re Closed! - Close up shop during the night, preventing any visits to you. (3 Uses)

Day Ability 1: Advertisement - Anyone that visits you will buy your goods, preventing them from conversion. If an evil visits you, they will be protected from all effects, but they will not perform their night action on you. The advertisement will be announced during the day when this ability is used. (2 uses)

Advertisement message: A shop has opened its doors, come down and buy supplies!

Goal: Survive Until the End of the Game, and must successfully perform 3 trades. (Can still win if you go bankrupt afterwards)

**Then we have its unseen conversion.**

Merchant

Unseen Support

Passive 1: Determined - Immune to Occupation at Night.

Night Ability 1: Repair - Repair a fellow unseen&#39;s belongings, healing them and redirecting any visitors to you. (3 Uses)
Night Ability 2: Lock Up - Prevent all visits to you, but prevents you from using your day ability. (2 Uses)

Day Ability: Production - Give a player a new resource, occupying them the next time they perform a night ability. Bypass occupation immunity. (Cannot be used on King, 2 uses)

Goal: Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.

Now to hide in a corner and await feedback.

(Yes, I am aware that Trader is kinda like Alch/Fool, but that&#39;s what feedback is for.)</description>

            <p>My personal suggestions to improve these roles.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="#CD853F">The Trader</font></h2>
<p><font color="lightgrey"><strong>Neutral Support</strong></font><br>
<strong>Entrepreneurial Spirit (Passive)</strong> - Becomes immune to occupation after being occupied twice (rather than three times).<br>
<strong>Bankruptcy (Passive)</strong> - If you do not trade at least once every three nights, you will go bankrupt and be unable to use any night abilities for the rest of the game.<br>
<strong>Advertise (Day)</strong> - Excite somebody about your product, making them immune to occupation and allowing you to Barter with them through occupy immunity for the next night - 2 uses<br>
<strong>Barter (Night)</strong> - Trade supplies with another player, occupying them but also protecting them from being killed. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>We’re Closed! (Night)</strong> - Nobody will be able to visit you tonight. Does not affect occupy immune classes. - 3 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to survive the game without going bankrupt.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Converts into <font color="purple">The Broker</font>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="purple">The Broker</font></h2>
<p><strong><font color="purple">Unseen Support</font></strong><br>
<strong>Greed (Passive)</strong> - Immune to occupation.<br>
<strong>Con (Day)</strong> - Rope somebody into a grandiose moneymaking scheme, occupying them through occupy immunity whenever they next attempt to use a night ability. - 2 uses<br>
<strong>Contract (Night)</strong> - Occupy a player, but prevent any other Unseen from visiting them. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Counting Change (Night)</strong> - Nobody will be able to visit you tonight. Does not affect occupy immune classes. - 2 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to Eliminate the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who stand against you</em></p>
