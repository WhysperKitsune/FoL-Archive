    <description>&gt; # Possessor
&gt; **Neutral Killer**
&gt; Passive 1: Black Shield - Immune to death at night
&gt; Passive 2: Mimicry - You have the passives of the player you currently are possessing unless it has an effect that triggers on execution or an effect that changes your own class
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 1: Mind Control - Force your first target to vote for your second. They cannot vote for the rest of the day (2 uses)
&gt; Day Ability 2: Mind reading - See whispers to and from target player for the rest of the day (2 uses)
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: Puppet Strings - Kill target player. Your first target will appear to attack them instead of you and you will see their night results. (Unlimited)
&gt; Night Ability 2: Possess - Kill target player and choose a class. You will take control of their body and your old body will appear as the chosen class. If successful you may read the possessed players logs and you will heal yourself. You will also learn their class. Otherwise regain the use. Bypasses healing (3 uses)</description>
