    <title>Please make yolo kills less attractive for alchs</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/please-make-yolo-kills-less-attractive-for-alchs/14310</link>
    <description>Those yolo alchs are so anoying, its like every alch strategy now.

**few points about it:**
1) Hunters, prince, knights can&#39;t attack before n3, so why alchs can?

2) You should make it weaker, how about making it kills the alch when he is attacking a knight or a physician for example? that could make the alch consider his actions before just killing randomly. 

3) Another option is limit their kills to 1, but dont count them  if they were occupied. That could make them save their kill for a strategic moment.</description>

<p>Well it’s kind of a cyclical thing… alc has very little chance of winning while prince is alive. Dunno about you but I’ve had quite a few games where I’ve been down to wire, where I’d bomb near the end because I had a pretty good idea, I’d hit an immune knowing I found the mastermind… I’d out myself to call it, MM doesn’t get voted up, prince jails and kills me and assasain kills prince.</p>
<p>Siding with BD while the prince is up… is consistantly shown to be a bad idea when playing as alc… dosen’t matter how hard you try to help BD, there’s a very high chance it will bite you in the but.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d say this one is self evident. BD can’t kill before n3 because it’s unreasonable to assume they know the evils before n3. Non BD can, because killing evils is an OPTION for how to reach their goal, rather than their goal. When it comes down to it an alc’s real goal is for the game to end as fast as possible, via any means. Heck in some ways is almost contradictary to their goal if it didn’t raise their odds of being kept around.</p>

            <p>I’d say more accurately, alcs are adjusting their strategy to what the BD forces them into. so many games I reach near the end in a tight knit game… more or less get myself confirmed before the prince decides to jail me, say neuts out, and die to the unseen the same night and BD gets crushed.</p>

            <p>BD more than deserves yolo bombing right now. Every time I don’t kill BD, I end up regretting it because some idiot prince executes me or something. As it stands the unseen/cult are several orders of magnitude more trustworthy. I can almost always trust the unseen or cult not to betray me. Definitely can’t say the same for BD, not even close.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for most neut classes. Every time I have tried to be a faithful merc to BD, I am betrayed. I have not been betrayed a single time when I have gotten an unseen or cult contract.</p>
<p>Might as well complain about the reaper randomly killing BD. It’s part of the game. Nerfing alch potions to 1 would be beyond stupid and make the class much worse.</p>
