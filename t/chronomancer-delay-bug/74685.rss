    <title>Chronomancer Delay Bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/chronomancer-delay-bug/74685</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was Chronomancer. I was bled on n3. I had no delays. N4 passes just fine.
On n5, I was healed AND another chrono delayed me. I only saw the heal.
n6 passes just fine. N7 I died from chrono delay.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

N7 - I lived

#### Steps to reproduce:

Bleed a chrono, have a healer heal them and a chrono delay them on the night the bleed would take effect.

#### Comments:

            <p>Normally, Heal would come first then Delay.<br>
You just met a rare bug, and that seem to be unfixable.</p>
