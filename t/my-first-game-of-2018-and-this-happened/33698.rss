    <title>My first game of 2018 and this happened</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-first-game-of-2018-and-this-happened/33698</link>
    <description>So poss possessed me into the same target I was guarding and I killed myself xD. I had no idea that could happen to be honest. Also, can someone explain why it also says I killed someone while guarding 7 (me) while it also says &quot;You died guarding (6)&quot;. Is that a bug?

            <p>well you see. You were guarding 6. You killed someone guarding 6. The person you killed guarding 6 was you so you died. You were guarding 6 when you died and also you died as a result of guarding 6. Therefor you died guarding 6.</p>
