    <title>Rework Priest &amp; bring it back along with Soul Catcher! [Plus other Suggestions]</title>

    <description>Priest was the most comfy class to play in the game, and I sorely miss it with it being removed from the game. The problem wasn&#39;t Priest itself. No, I actually remember it being a tolerable class when it wasn&#39;t guaranteed to spawn &amp; was convertible. Those two changes pushed it over the edge to becoming overpowered.

I suggest the following for a Balanced Priest:

**Class**: Priest
**Faction**: Neutral
**Convertible**: YES
**Unique**: Yes
**Converted to**: Soul Catcher by Unseen. Ritualist for Cult. (No changes whatsoever are needed for Ritualist)

**Passive**: Devoted
**Description**: Night Immunity once

**Passive**: Call of the Dead
**Description**: Allows the Priest to communicate with the dead at night.

**Night Ability**: Revive
**Description**: Revives any /non-reaped/ player in the game People that were Cult or Unseen are restored to their previous factions prior to conversion. You can not revive: Mastermind, (original) Assassin, Neutral Killers, King, Prince.
**Conversion immunity for those revived**: No!

------

**Class**: Soul Catcher
**Faction**: Unseen
**Convertible**: No
**Converted from**: Priest

**Night Ability**: Soul Harvest
**Description**: Harvests the players soul at night if they die, storing it for later use.
**Uses**: Infinite

**Passive**: Death&#39;s Apprentice
**Description**: The Soul Catcher&#39;s &#39;soul bank&#39;, essentially. Infinite capacity. Starts at 0.

**Day Ability**: Sorrows of the fallen
**Description**: Drives the target mad, making them unable to take action the following night. The player this is used on will be able to hear the cries of the recently parted the following night, however they can not speak directly to them and ghost names appear simply as &quot;Ghost&quot;. They are forbidden from making journal entries during this period, and should they die the night they are afflicted by this, the following day their journal will be filled with a short text of the Soul Catcher&#39;s choosing. Similar in ways to the Forger from ToS.
**Uses**: Infinite
**Required Souls**: 1

**Day Ability**: Reanimate
Description: Revives any player belonging to the Unseen faction as a Death Knight after the Day&#39;s completion. Whether they were reaped or not does not matter.
**Uses**: 1
**Required Souls**: 2

------

**Class**: Psychic
Simply revert back to pre-1.08 Psychic and automatically link the King -- should there be one whenever the Psychic links, too. There&#39;s just too much &#39;paperwork&#39; for Psychic to do right now.

------

**Class**: Physician
Revert back to pre-1.08 Physician. It was honestly fine, if a little boring to play.

------

**Class**: Death Knight

**Night Ability**: Retribution
**Description**: Kills the target player. This is only usable on players that either directly murdered the Death Knight in their previous life or accused them of treason the day they died.
Uses: 1

**Night Ability**: Sacrifice
**Description**: Guards an Unseen player at night. Preventing anyone from visiting them. Should their target be attacked, the Death Knight will give up their own life and kill whomever attacks them.
**Uses**: 1

**Passive**: Rotting
**Description**: The Death Knight dies the following night after being revived.</description>

            <p>I’m with Jammy here.</p>
<p>The Priest is still a BD role here in everything except name, and reviving a converted person as their original faction is going to be the most powerful ability in the game by a very large margin.</p>

            <p>What’s the objective?</p>
<p>What’s the point, even?</p>
<p>“I was revived I was cult the cultists are X, Y and Z”</p>
<p>This is basically “press a button to fuck the evil faction”<br>
And <em>why</em> is it Neutral!?</p>

            <p>Reviving an Unseen/Cult straight up may prove to be too powerful. If that person is revived anyway, they’re immediately sus and so is the Priest.</p>
<p>The Death Knight route is more stealthy, and forces the Soul Catcher.strategize on making one. It’s more balanced, too, as it MAY grant a kill but not a vote during the day time.</p>
<hr>
<p>The reason I suggested it be made Neutral was to help rid the game of the “Neuts Out” philosophy Blue Dragon has adapted.</p>

            <p>Death Knight is 3 days not 1 for rotting.</p>
<p>Also, Id suggest keeping Priest as a BD class, not neutral. Either that or make priest able to rez evil/neut chars. Otherwise whats the point of being neutral?</p>
