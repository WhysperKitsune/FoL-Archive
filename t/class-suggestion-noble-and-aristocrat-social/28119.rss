    <title>[Class Suggestion] Noble and Aristocrat (Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-noble-and-aristocrat-social/28119</link>
    <description>Oh goodness.

The new Noble is almost game-breakingly intrusive. What was even the point of giving players private notes if they&#39;re still forced to keep one claim (and only one claim) in their will? Why even bother? Snoop on a BD class is kind of ridiculous, especially one that isn&#39;t even investigative.

Now, I&#39;ve made suggestions for both the Priest and the Noble before, but it turns out that people really like Maid Spy. I don&#39;t like it at all, but as long as you can&#39;t spy on the King, I can definitely live with it. And so, I figured I might as well figure out a way to appease pretty much everybody.

Here&#39;s my basic idea for improving the vote-control Noble variant that was the cleanest the game has yet seen. Linked below, you will find my Priest suggestion, which includes a renamed Maid Spy. I think this has a lot of potential to fix a bunch of issues in one go, so please let me know what you think of both of these suggestions. Thanks.

&gt;**Espionage (Passive)** - You see all votes cast in real-time during a trial or election.
&gt;**Bureaucracy (Passive)** - You are able to use more than one day ability on any given day, and may use the same ability multiple times. 
**Political Pressure (Day)** - Force a player to accuse the same person as you for the rest of the day - 3 uses
**Pull Rank (Day)** - An extra vote will be added to your vote for execution or pardon - 3 uses
**Royal Decree (Night)** - Make a player immune to accusations the next day - 3 uses
**Order (Night)** - Negate the votes of a target player the next day - 3 uses

Points of potential improvement:
-This will be really strong, and will probably need to be nerfed eventually. However, this is necessary at first to quell excessive complaints of the Noble being &quot;underpowered&quot;.
-Noble is no longer Royal. However, nobility in general is not usually royalty, and with so many Royal Blood classes I think we can afford to drop Noble from their ranks. If for some reason it is *necessary* that the Noble have Royal Blood, just fold Espionage into Bureaucracy.
-It may be best to replace order removing a player&#39;s ability to vote with giving the target a vote that counts for twice as much. Let me know if you agree in the poll below.
-Open to further suggestions/improvements. Don&#39;t be afraid to be harsh!</description>

            <p>That’s basically one decide fate. That’s a king ability, and shouldn’t be in another claim.</p>
<p>If maid spy is still in the game, I don’t mind what other power Noble has.</p>

            <p>Your total ability usage is capped - if you force one trial, that’s all you can do for the whole game, pretty much.</p>
<p>Also, Maid Spy is in my Priest concept instead.</p>

            <p>I see no need to replace Maid Spy. It sees whispers, but doesn’t make them completely unusable. Order is alright, but not nearly as good. Replacing Snoop seems fine, but I think Bureaucracy is too powerful. You can force basically any trial, short of a King’s Pardon. Might be better if you capped abilities per day to 2 or 3.</p>

            <p>The reason for this btw is that vote manipulation only matters if you overturn majority unless it’s being used to prove yourself. That means he either needs something else to make it more meaningful (Information gathering ala current noble) or he needs more survivability. Since giving him defensively powers just means your sitting around for half the game anyways (still not fun) meaning you need to go with the other solution.</p>

            <p>If you spam PP then you are getting them on the stand and with 3 people forced to abstain. My point being that if you can get someone on the stand this way then you can get them guilted. Making it give someone else a vote is also much more interesting.</p>
<p>The other thing I would like to say is that he NEEDS something other than vote manip. Unlike other core consepts vote manip is not fun to use on its own.</p>

            <p>You can actually spam the ability and get up to 4 votes for Exe/Pardon</p>
<p>That’s pretty useful imo</p>

            <p>They can do that in DN or last words. Also pure vote manipulation is not fun. The king has guards and Ally’s at night. The ToS Mayor has his unrevealed state and the fact that he is always town. The psychic with misdirect only had it as a secondary ability, Ect…</p>

            <p>+1, the only issue is send order.  It should just prevent them from voting and speaking, and possibly be unlimited.</p>

<p>But Noble should be about vote manipulation, snoop and maid spy don’t have anything to do with vote manipulation.  The night abilities should be given to other classes, abilities should fit the theme of a class.  Plus snoop is a bit overpowered for a BD class, evils will no longer be able to out night and convert immune players.</p>

            <p>I feel Political pressure should be unable to target the king, and you should be able to control the person’s vote the whole day (With like a small note about that person being forced to vote x). To make it fast, It needs to force your victims to copy your vote and should also have a box so you can select people in big groups IMO</p>

            <p>The spy maid and crier should be back, if you think spy maid is too powerful then you can make it not be able to target king (but can hear wishpers from and to king from the target)</p>
<p>Crier is a great way to give messages without outing yourself. should have 2 or 3 uses</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pull Rank (Day) - An extra vote will be added to your vote for execution or pardon - 3 uses<br>
Royal Decree (Night) - Make a player immune to accusations the next day - 3 uses<br>
Order (Night) - Negate the votes of a target player the next day - 3 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are very boring, only usefull in the end of the game, and still weaker then king finger</p>
