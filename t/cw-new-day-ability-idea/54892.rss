    <title>CW New Day Ability idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cw-new-day-ability-idea/54892</link>
    <description>This is my idea for a CW day Ability. I know it makes the CW confirmable but would it work with the CW? 


**Day Ability 1**
_**Enhanced**_ - select a player. The chosen player is allowed to pick up the two people for their primary night ability tonight (the unlimited night ability if they have one or the ability on the left). {they will not be notified of this action} (unlimited uses) (2 day cool down)

_Ex. CW pick physician. Physician can now heal two people instead of one._

<p>The devs donâ€™t want confirmable abilities. So no.</p>
