    <title>Questions regarding Princess and possible bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/questions-regarding-princess-and-possible-bug/53342</link>
    <description>I just have a question regarding the mechanics of the Princess. Say a Princess flirts a class (example would be sheriff) and they turn out to be Special/ Investigative. Suppose an MM were to convert that sheriff the next night. If a Princess were to late flirt the sheriff(now turned into Assasin) again, would he still remain Special/investigative or would he change into a different category such as Killer/Offensive? 

Feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated, as I believe that an answer to my question could lead me to discover a bug(Or not).</description>

            <p>You see them as what they currently are.<br>
If they are an Assassin, you see them as Killer/Offensive.<br>
If theyâ€™re a Marshal or a Sheriff, you see them as Special/Inves.</p>
<p>The only exception is when a scorned or fool frames someone. Framed targets always come up Killer/Offensive.</p>
