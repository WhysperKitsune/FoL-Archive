    <description>Faceless - Neutral Special

Passive 1: Stubborn - if converted into the Unseen/Cult/Whatever you keep your class Ability&#39;s regardless of what faction you were converted into. Instead of changing Ability&#39;s, identity check gains unlimited uses and Usurper has 0 uses.

Passive 2: Retroguard - Any immunitys you had before you still have now. You also have Royal blood if you had it before.

Night ability 1: Identity check - Check to see if your target is Unique. (4 uses)

Night ability 2: Usurper - Your faction is changed to your targets and you swap classes with them (in that order). Won&#39;t consume a use if it fails for any reason. (1 use).

Goal: Same as your starting class. If this is your starting class then it is that of the first class you usurped. (Second part is for if you get this class a second time)

Notes: Usurper swaps classes with your target but does not change thier goal. It can be used on any role except for the King and the person who now has it can use usurper themselves making the class a hot potato until the unseen/cult get it. It&#39;s other ability is for finding a strong role to take the place of and also having a use in of it self.

Just to clarify, the prince can be usurped but if he is then he keeps the convert Immunity as well as both of his passives.</description>

            <p>Would be kind of problematic for a former cult member to be able to become a prince etc… which has the goal of stopping cult, and then he starts out with the knowledge of who all the cult is.</p>
