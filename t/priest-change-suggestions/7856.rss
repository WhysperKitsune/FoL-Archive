    <title>Priest change suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/priest-change-suggestions/7856</link>
    <description>I think some of the following things would make priest more interesting:

1) Revived players take the priest&#39;s body
Makes it more interesting, and priest a little better as prince stays anonymous. Not only that, but if priest still has temp death immunity, so will revived player.

2) can speak with revived player from beyond grave
make them a little more fun
alternatively, can do a seance like medium in ToS</description>

            <p>I feel like the priest should be able to talk to the revived when dead for as long as they want, but they can’t see dead chat for as long as they are talking</p>

            <p>1 is actually probably a great idea, although I’m not sold on keeping the immunity just yet</p>
