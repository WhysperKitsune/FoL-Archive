    <title>Pretender Rework! Already</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/pretender-rework-already/72308</link>
    <description>In my opinion pretender has a claiming problem you can&#39;t claim neutral because you won&#39;t get voted king, you can&#39;t claim any invest claims because you have no results or info, and nobody will vote physician especially as they haven&#39;t cured anyone as they are too important for bd, and nobody will vote knight because of the same. Basically pretender is like a bite without bark able to kill those who stand in her way but never really becoming king due to the lack of claims she can do this hopefully allows pretender to claim more classes and perhaps even convince bd she is good. 

&gt; # The Pretender
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt;
&gt; Royal Blood - Your vote to become king will count twice.
&gt;
&gt;No Allegiance - Death immune at night. Upon becoming king, you will loose the death immunity.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Abilities:**
&gt;
&gt;Family Allegiances - You will see all whispers to the king.(3 uses)
&gt;
&gt;^This could possibly end the whispering meta, and if not allows pretender to fake claim classes noble, princess and even observer if used with skill or luck.
&gt;
&gt;Ballot Mixing - blah blah blah same
&gt;
&gt;**Night Abilities**
&gt;Family Matters - Discover if a player has royal blood, and their class if they are(infinite)
&gt;
&gt;Royal Revenge:
&gt;Choose from a variety of options to regain your rightful kingdom:
&gt;Seduce - Occupy a player.(3 uses)
&gt;Kinslayer - Attack a player with royal blood or king, doesn&#39;t have to be checked.(2 uses)

            <p>but if two class type options appear then you could only claim princess but with the whispering ability it allows you to claim noble and observer if lucky I added Seduce so you could claim butler and allowed family matters to find out there actual class so if they are evil you could claim sheriff all and all it allows you to claim 5 roles instead of being impossibly before</p>

            <p>Kinslayer is the only thing that they need (the killing royal blood)</p>
<p>Just buff their investigative ability.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p>Check a player to see if they have royal blood, two class type options, and to see who they visit.</p>
<p>Maybe just the visit or class type both sound a little much</p>
