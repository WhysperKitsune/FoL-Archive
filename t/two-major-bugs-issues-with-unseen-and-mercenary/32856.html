          <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>There were two major bugs in a game I just played (username: TinyDeer). I was unable to take screenshots but will describe them in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was playing as Mercenary. Around night 5 I received a prompt at the end of the night that player 10 was converted to the Unseen. Discussing afterward, we had no answer to this major issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the game ended, when I asked Unseen players why I saw that, the Mastermind said that he had tried to convert me a previous night but it had “bugged out”. Also, Unseen said that I appeared to them as Unseen the entire game even though I was Mercenary. They said “your name was purple”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I should under no circumstances have seen as a Mercenary (not Sheriff, not Unseen) that another player was converted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My role should not have appeared next to my name for Unseen players, and I should not have appeared to have been a part of their faction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>I don’t know how we would reproduce this issue. Perhaps take a look at the coding regarding how Unseen see Mercenaries to see if there is some small loophole somewhere. If it helps, I was player number 1.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>I’m sorry I can’t provide screenshots. I could only see issue 1 - issue 2 was told to me by the Unseen after the game ended.</p>
