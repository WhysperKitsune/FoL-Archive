    <title>New Class: Kingsguard</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-kingsguard/71775</link>
    <description>The Kingsguard:
Faction: Neutral, Support. Unique, Immune to Conversion
Win Requirement: Ensure that the starting king survives until the end of the game. You do not need to be alive at the end.
_Passives_: 
**Sworn Sword** - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing. You know how many more uses the King has of their Guards! ability.
**Redemption** - **_I currently am unable to think of a replacement for the old one, I especially want feedback on how the Kingsguard could redeem itself._**
_Day Ability_ - 
**Convene Meeting** - At night you will be able to speak to the King. He will know your name.(2 uses)
_Night Abilities_ -
**Preside Over** - You will protect the King with your life tonight. If he is attacked the attacker will instead target you that night. You and the attacker both are dealt a lethal blow. This bypasses death immunity and redirection immunity. _(3 uses)_
**Inspiring Leader** - Tonight you rouse the spirits of the King&#39;s guards. The king gains one use of Guards! _(Two uses, but has a one day cool down)_

All feedback is welcome! Please write what you think about this.</description>

            <p>My personal opinion, instead of having a redemption for the Kingsguard after the original King dies, I’d have them suicide the night after, much like how the Scorned would suicide if both of their targets were killed before they could be publicly executed.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Correct. The issue here is that depending on the number of Kingsguards in the game then this would mean that there will be an additional one to <strong>four</strong> players locked into in either faction based on purely RNG alone. Allies mixed in with Convene Meeting essentially means that by the second day the Unseen/Cult can potentially have 3 players, 1 EK, along with 1~3 Kingsguards at their side, <strong>essentially turning the game into a 7 Scum v 8 Town v 1 NK with the possibility of putting the game past LyLo the first day depending on how the night kills go.</strong></p>
<p>If the King is good and several Kingsguards spawn, this essentially means that the BD King cannot be killed at night which makes it impossible for scum to win.</p>
<p>In short, this class is stupidly swingy.</p>

<p>But the identity of the King is determined by RNG.</p>
<p>It’s like if Mercenary and Sellsword were one role, and you just had to guess which side you were supposed to help win.</p>
<p>Not to mention the King is already strong enough without a neutral class guarding him. Alchemist pretty much already fills that void.</p>

Player should be warned that they should step as king when they are have no choice… in order to avoid them outting the evil king… Like, Hey the king has 3 guards, not 5, so he’s evil.</p>
<p>passive 1 and 2 can be fused together.</p>

            <p>I like the idea. However I think the Ability “Convene Meeting” will be too strong.<br>
If king is evil you will have to deal with 2 evils as bd. And cause of “Convene Meeting” you are even confirmed and the king can trust without any doubt.</p>
<p>I don’t like the Redemption as well. Sellsword should stay an unique class.</p>
<p>And you can’t side with the NK as this Neutral class. Thats bad. Maybe change his win condition to -&gt; … or if the Psycho king wins the game.</p>
<p>And how can you prevent the butler poison? Maybe change “Convene Meegin” to “disable the butlers abilities at the day”.</p>
