    <title>New Scum Faction without Conversion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-scum-faction-without-conversion/71439</link>
    <description>[color=#409000]**The Herald Faction**[/color]

A conversion-less faction that instead relies on delayed kills through bursts of poison, disabling the abilities of their enemies and even injecting themselves with their own poison to feign innocence. Each Herald class is tailored to synergize with each other, making each loss of a teammate damaging. 2 of the 3 members are night immune to offset their lack of conversion.

The ranking order in the Herald is as such:

Emerald
Cerberus
Prognosticator 
(Herald Investigative class?)

If any member dies, their class changes and moves up a rank.

A WIP. Looking for criticism and things I missed.
__________

[color=#409000]**The Emerald**[/color]
[color=#409000]**Herald Killer**[/color]

Passive: Camouflaged - Immune to death at night.

Passive: Antivenin - Immune to death from poisoning (this doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent poisoning.)

Day Ability 1: Last Stand - Kill a player during the day. You will be revealed to the Court (1 use).

Night Ability 1: Envenom - Poison up to 3 targets tonight. They will die the following by the following day if not healed. This does not bypass night immunity and may target yourself and fellow Herald members (3 uses, 1 night cooldown.)

Night Ability 2: Reclaim - Kill a player (infinite uses).

________________
The &quot;Assassin&quot; of the Herald, relying on delayed killing but being able to potentially kill 3 players every other night if left untreated. The Emerald relies on synergy from the Cerberus to prevent visits from healers and ensuring the death of the Emerald&#39;s target. It is up to BD to decide which target may be healable and left untouched by the Cerberus.

The Emerald may also poison himself or his own teammates to appear innocent. Even though they won&#39;t die from the poison, it still enters their body and a physician or alchemist can still know that they successfully healed a poisoned Herald target. Be wary of this plan as if nobody heals you and still finds you alive in a couple days, you will be highly suspicious. 

In between poisonings, the Emerald may kill as a normal assassin, or choose to kill a high priority target if poisoning is too slow or uncertain.

This might be too much KPN, but it might also not be **enough** KPN due to Alchemists and Physicians. It is wildly variable and definitely can be tweaked a lot. 

____________

[color=#409000]**The Cerberus**[/color]
[color=#409000]**Herald Offensive**[/color]

Passive: Unperturbed - Occupy immune. Immune to death at night.

Passive: Antivenin - Immune to death from poisoning (this doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent poisoning.)

Day Ability 1: Silence the Forest - Prevent all Treants from voting for the day (1 uses).

Day Ability 2: Awaken the Forest - Force all Treants to vote your target for treason and force them to vote execute on the trial (1 use).

Night Ability 1: Woodland Embrace - Prevent all visits to your target tonight (infinite uses.)

Night Ability 2: Treebark Touch - Convert any players visiting your target into Treants. Neutral Killers, King and Prince are immune to conversion. You will not know who was converted (1 use.)

__________

A mix of support and some Mastermind &quot;conversion&quot;, the Cerberus assists in preventing healers from helping their poisoned allies or protects his own teammates from investigation or death. Choosing which poisoned target to Woodland Embrace is important, but also deciding to use Embrace on yourself or a teammate can be important and situational.

Treebark Touch is a powerful, one shot ability that requires good timing to be effective. Instead of converting enemies to your side, it converts them into almost useless Treants. While this ability is not as powerful as straight conversion, it can hit multiple enemies if used wisely. 

Treants are still BD or neutral upon conversion, and retain their original win conditions. They have a 1 shot night occupy ability, so if a player gets converted to a Treant they aren&#39;t completely useless as they can still hinder who they believe is scum for a night. Treants may still vote, but can be manipulated by the Cerberus. 

The Cerberus can force Treants to accuse and vote execute on a player if that player is put on trial. While this may give away to BD who was truly converted to Treants, it is a powerful one time ability that can turn the tide during the day.

_________________

[color=#409000]**The Prognosticator**[/color]
[color=#409000]**Herald Social**[/color]

Herald Social

Passive: Royal Blood - You may step up as King as nobility.

Passive: Antivenin - Immune to death from poisoning (this doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent poisoning.)

Day Ability 1: Hushed Dread - Prevent players from whispering for the day. They will be notified they cannot whisper if they attempt to do so (2 uses).

Day Ability 2: Telepathy - Send an anonymous public message (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1: Nature&amp;rsquo;s Network - Link your mind with two other players, allowing you to anonymously talk to them the rest of the night (infinite uses.)

Night Ability 2: Mute - Prevent all Treants from talking tomorrow (1 use.)

_____________

Literally a rip-off of BD Mystic, but the Mystic could use a nerf anyway. I don&#39;t like this class very much and would be interested in a social class that interacts with the Treants in a fun, meaningful way, but there isn&#39;t much point talking to your enemies very often. Anybody got ideas?

I&#39;d like to also introduce a Herald Investigative that could replace the Prog instead. I wouldn&#39;t want 4 Herald members to spawn, I think 3 is fine, but maybe the 3rd Herald class can be randomized between a social and investigative role.</description>
