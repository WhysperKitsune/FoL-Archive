    <title>Amazing idea I found on steam (Melusca&#39;s idea not mine)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/amazing-idea-i-found-on-steam-meluscas-idea-not-mine/51228</link>
    <description>Okay so I heard this amazing and simple idea on steam and I just love it so much I had to put it here, btw I did not make this idea a person did called Melusca 

He/She said this on the steam post

Noble&#39;s Maid Spy should color-code whispers from chosen player

As it is now it&#39;s pretty hard to distinguish whispers from players you&#39;re spying from the rest. Particularly when there&#39;s a burst of them like everyone claiming to the King.

Again this is not my idea it is Melusca&#39;s idea</description>
