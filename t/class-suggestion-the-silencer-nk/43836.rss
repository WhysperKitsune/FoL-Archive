Silencer (Neutral Killing)

Passive 1:
**The Penny Stays**- Attempts to kill or occupy you will fail. It will show as a success to the player.

Passive 2:
**Marking**- Anybody who occupies you or investigates you will be marked for death. The player will not be aware of this. Marking a player thrice or more makes them immune to this form of death.

Day Ability 1:
**Shush**
Silence a player. They cannot talk unless put on trial , and if they talk before then , kill them in the day. If someone dies by this method, you can&#39;t use this ability again.
(3 uses)

Night Ability 1:
**Silent Night** Kill a player. Mark all those that visit them.
(Infinite Uses)

Night Ability 2:
**Sleep Tight**
Kill all marked players.
(Infinite Uses)

Goal: Same as Poss/Reaper</description>

            <p>very good idea, and probably fairer than mine , but it does make alot of the silencers set redundant once you use it.</p>
