          <p>Sorry for the delay, last night was too late and I had work this morning. Here’s my updated reads list:</p>
<p>Townlean</p>
<details>
<summary>
Anagram</summary>
<p>After what happened close to EoD yesterday, my views have completely changed on this slot. Reading their posts, they have some good takes and they’ve moved away from the advice giving and seem to be focusing on analysis, which I really like. It still feels weird that they are talking to themselves in thread, but now it seems a lot more like they are trying to be productive with what they have and giving reads instead of focusing on the lack of content. Bargaining sometimes pings me as off, but I can write that off as being self-prez.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Raven</summary>
<p>Their content is still relevant and their reads list definitely had some reasoning there, although I can’t say I agree with some of it. This is another slot where I can write off some EoD actions as self-prez.</p>
</details>
<p>Nulltown</p>
<details>
<summary>
Wazza</summary>
<p>I think their takes and analysis were good yesterday, but I wish they would’ve acted more on it. They mentioned not being able to start things for Moleland or Yawn, but then clearly started the Zone wagon which got some traction there. I do understand wanting to help your townreads, but I wish they went a bit harder on their reads.</p>
</details>
<p>Nullscum</p>
<details>
<summary>
Yawn</summary>
<p>I like some of their takes and analysis, but there are a few things that ping me as off here. They seem to have contradictory views on agenda. They didn’t like Zone for not having more of an agenda, and then initially liked Wazza’s lack of agenda? And then they flip on Wazza for having agenda, which I really haven’t seen from that slot since they weren’t really pushing anything.</p>
</details>
<p>Scumlean</p>
<details>
<summary>
An_Gorta_Pratai</summary>
<p>I like that this slot actually has some content now, but it all feels very weak. It’s not at all clear to me if they actually caught up in the thread or just started going without reading at some point. They made takes, but they dissociate from them, calling them gut reads, and they seem too willing to abandon them if anyone has a dispute. I don’t like that they don’t own their opinions.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Trivial</summary>
<p>Nothing has changed here for me, and they’ve only had one off-topic post since my last reads list, so they aren’t going to look better in my eyes anytime soon.</p>
</details>
<p>A Weird Case</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zone</summary>
<p>I’m actually really conflicted on this slot right now, and I’d like to note that I’m placing them here because they are either hardtown or hardscum but I’m not entirely sure which. Everything since my last reads list shows a blatant lack of effort. They don’t really read the game anymore, they did the hammer at EoD without any reasoning besides wanting to sleep, they want to be sent to Heaven or Hell and they don’t really care as long as they’re out. And I’m not sure what to do with that? I should really hope that someone in the town would actually want to succeed and put in some effort, and scum I think would definitely put in more effort than this, but also why wouldn’t they care about being sent out during the Hell phase?</p>

          <p>I did think about you and Moleland being W/W when they started offering you votes without much reason to get you off the block, but I don’t like to get too much into W/W stuff without more information.<br>
You didn’t have a good view of Moleland, and obviously you voted for them so there wasn’t good feelings there between you two. The only reason I could think that you would place that vote on another scumteam member away from Raven would be if Raven was also scum, so the only possible benefit would be maybe splitting the wagons. At that point I resolved to wait until Moleland flipped.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn’t help much in retrospect, can’t really link town in the same way you can link scum.</p>

<p>Gorta is also quite weird!</p>
<p>It seems like he doesn’t really have any actual thought process behind his reads.</p>
<p>Specifically, he hard scumreads Zone almost the whole day but I scanned through his ISO three times, and I couldn’t actually find any reason for it! He keeps pinging Zone, asking him why he is voting Wazza, but I don’t  believe gorta ever actually made a read on Wazza either!</p>
<p>His read on Mole is also off. He mentioned Mole is similar to the last game he was scum, however when prompted he says he has to case Mole, indicating he hadn’t actually looked at his posts before.</p>
<p>His earlier posts feel like a wolf struggling to generate content, asking questions but never really following up on them.</p>
<p>Really, the main thing I find super weird is he seems very concerned about people voting Wazza, scumreading Wazza, but  never makes a solid read on Wazza or talks about Wazza alone.</p>
<p>Both gorta and Wazza are in my solid do not vote today pool.</p>

<p>Thie is before Moleland placed a vote on Wazza. It’s an individual wolfread, free of association. (As in, they weren’t grouping Mole with me at the time)<br>
Then we get into the mindset change, where they view me/Mole as potential W/W, based on his vote.</p>

<p>You say that, but it doesn’t really make sense? At this point there’s not any real case for Moleland being town, but you refuse to vote them because they won’t get lynched?

Darth votes Mole over us, when we absolutely coulda been the lynch there since our vote was removed from Raven.<br>

<p>At this point, there are now two wagons tied for top. Us (who we have TMI as being town), and Raven (who <em>could</em> be scum).<br>
So the question is, why Mole over us? We know Mole isn’t a wolf, now. So here are some scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Raven/Anagram/Mole are V/V/V</strong><br>
In this scenario, Darth voted Mole as a genuine scumread of theirs, and Darth is a villager.<br>
or<br>
Darth is a wolf who decided to push LHF. This is the less likely of the two, as it would be much easier to just stay on us, or move to Raven for a 4/5 wagon, and have a guaranteed townie death here. They coulda sat pretty on our wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Raven/Anagram/Mole are W/V/V</strong><br>
Scenario one includes a town Darth, who voted Mole as a genuine scumread of theirs.</p>
<p>Scenario two has Darth as a wolf with Raven. In this case, Darth <em>moved off of a top wagon</em> and onto a wagon with a single vote, leaving their scumbud as top wagon with 3 votes. Thats dangerous. All they have to do is get a single vote on us and bam, we die there instead of Raven.</p>
<hr>
<p>The only real world I see w!darth is a world with w!raven, but even then it just… makes so much more sense for darth to be a villager here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did think about you and Moleland being W/W when they started offering you votes without much reason to get you off the block, but I don’t like to get too much into W/W stuff without more information.<br>
You didn’t have a good view of Moleland, and obviously you voted for them so there wasn’t good feelings there between you two. The only reason I could think that you would place that vote on another scumteam member away from Raven would be if Raven was also scum, so the only possible benefit would be maybe splitting the wagons. At that point I resolved to wait until Moleland flipped.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn’t help much in retrospect, can’t really link town in the same way you can link scum.</p>

</aside>
<p>This response fits so perfectly into the narrative of v!darth who genuinely believed I could have been w/w with Mole and Mole was trying to save my ass yesterday.<br>
Its so hard to fake this view as a wolf and stay consistent with it throughout the chaos of an EoD and the madness that is a CFD, and I’m pretty much ready to put darth into my towncore.</p>
<p>I am fine with a darth vote today, but I won’t be voting for quite some time because I’d rather people not sheep votes, and actually attempt to do solving of their own.</p>

<p>One thing that stood out to me as towny from Trivial is their overall stubbornness when arguing and challenging us (Anagram). I feel like, with the thread presence we had, a wolf would be hesitant to challenge and stand their ground arguing with us like they did above.</p>

<p>These two posts stood out to me individually, the first one being towny because in my experience town make the types of “I don’t like how ___ is reading me” more often than scum.</p>
<p>The second one because it stood out to me as kind of weird, why would they be concerned about people trying to guess at their identity while they’re away more than other matters?</p>
<p>Just random thoughts.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thing that concerns me a lot about the slot is that they didn’t have a presence at EOD and, if I am looking correctly the slot only has one combined post today.</p>
<p>Their activity has dropped significantly and I really don’t like it.</p>
<p>They had a towny D1 but they are slipping the longer they go without doing anything</p>
<p>Probably would vote darth over them today.</p>

          <p>I will be continuing my re-evaluation posts in a short while.<br>
However, it’s rather upsetting that almost <em>nothing</em> has happened while we have been away.</p>
<p>I don’t know how else to get people to play the game, and I don’t know how we are expected to win if nobody contributes.<br>
I get that some of you hate our playstyle and the “mentoring” we seem to be doing, but nobody else is attempting to lead town, and I would like to win.</p>
<p>Today we are focusing on finding consensus villagers and forming a towncore. Not just for today’s execution, but so that we have a better understanding of who trusts who, and we can stop all doing our own things, and start working as a damn team.</p>

<p>I like that this slot actually has some content now, but it all feels very weak. It’s not at all clear to me if they actually caught up in the thread or just started going without reading at some point. They made takes, but they dissociate from them, calling them gut reads, and they seem too willing to abandon them if anyone has a dispute. I don’t like that they don’t own their opinions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am like that and I was also trying to save my rear in Sfol 63, but when I get up I want to work on a complete read list. The part about me dissociating with my takes is that I wasn’t super confident in those. If I feel confident in a take/read I die on that hill</p>

<p>None-- actually, I think I like darth as well for making me ISO Mole. I can’t read Wazza just as much as how he can’t actually read me, so I give up on him. I didn’t bother reading gorta at all since “his inactivity is NAI”. I already mentioned how I scumread Raven, and… I dunno what to think of Trivial.</p>
<p>–wait. Something is wrong. I only have two scumreads. …meh, I’ll just put either gorta or Trivial as the third scumread.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, I don’t like how insistent you are on sending me to heaven, tbh it really just seems like you don’t care which one of us are sent to heaven because if I’m sent to heaven, you think you’ll get a bunch of town cred and then be sent to Heaven in the next one or you believe you can get sent instantly today.</p>
