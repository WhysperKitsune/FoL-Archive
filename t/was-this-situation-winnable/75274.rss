    <title>Was this situation winnable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/was-this-situation-winnable/75274</link>
    <description>My team just flamed me for losing, but I am curious if anyone can imagine a way to actually win where I couldn&#39;t.

These were the players:

- Me, CL claiming Scorned
- Invoker (I JUST converted him from Hunter)
- Good King (Who JUST died to bleed but got delayed)
- Chrono (Who JUST delayed King)

The Invoker was particularly infuriated that I helped vote him up.  But I do not believe it made a difference.  Maybe someone else disagrees.

The next day, I did not eradicate (since of course the Chrono will delay King), and they executed me since it wasn&#39;t convert night and I couldn&#39;t convert the chrono.</description>

            <p>Well, a better try would have been to convert the chrono, to accept A execution and hope the converted chrono does not  attack in order to the king to execute the hunter.</p>

            <p>It seems he just recently converted the Invoker, so he couldn’t have converted the Chrono</p>

            <p>Probably should’ve converted the Chronomancer and had the King take the bullet if at all possible lol, but with the Invoker I agree you were dead</p>

            <p>Well, you said the Invoker got voted up yes?</p>
<p>It wouldn’t have mattered, as King could’ve Royal Fingered, and Chrono and King both slam the Invoker</p>
<p>After that point, If it wasn’t convert night, then yeah, you pretty much lost, as even killing the Chrono still means the King can vote you up</p>
