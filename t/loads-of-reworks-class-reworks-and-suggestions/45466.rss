    <description>Reworks and Class Ideas

Maid and Squire are from FoL with a few adjustments
Noble as a pure Vote Manipulator
Scribe to take on role of whispers, messages, and logs
And Priest Revival to properly rework Psychic and Physician

But otherwise, please critique and enjoy!

I have combined the Phys, Priest, Psychic reworks with this thread. I&#39;ll refer the two threads to one another here.

**Social Reworks**

Psychic: Night Communication
Noble: Vote Manipulation
Priest: Dead Communication
Scribe: Whisper and Message Manipulation
Apostle: Vote, Whisper, Logs, and Dead Communication

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a> It feels like not a great reason to never play at all. It might not be an ability that should be in the game, but usually it’s not gonna ruin your experience. You have to be unlucky enough to be the target of it, and be evil. And Noble isn’t always in the game, and if it gets converted you don’t have to worry about it.</p>

            <p>Well, I’d like to say that the Prince can jail anyone except the King, so I thought it would be fitting for the Scribe to share information or withhold it with the King, the one person the Prince can’t talk to at night. (And arguably usually the most pivotal player in the entire game)</p>
<p>And alright, thanks for the stuff, I replaced Mind Scan for Illusionist with Mind Warp (we need more Mind Warp imo)<br>
And I lowered Spy from 2 to 1</p>

            <p>You don’t need to maid Spy 2 people. Also with Mind Scan you get info dumped.</p>
<p>I object to Advisor, since it’s just limited Link Mind</p>
<p>Other than that it is good.</p>

            <p>Anyways, how about the Social classes above?</p>
<p>There are adjustments, and I feel like Priest is a bit more of a Social class now.</p>

            <p>That’s why you would only see the left half. The right would be for alternate claims.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t care if it wasn’t in the game, but it seems like a valid ability.</p>
<p>3 social classes could work fine.</p>

            <p>I don’t know but Evils get royally done over if they have two separate claims, and then they release the claim not seen by Scribe and Scribe outs them</p>
<p>It restricts evil claims imo</p>
<p>Also snoop on BD is keeping <a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a> out of ToL last I heard</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>You’d have to give Scribe more uses of Snoop or whatever if it became their main ability. Also, I think it might be nice if you only saw the left half of the logs, so you could save some information for when you die, that you don’t want Scribe to see. Most BD will have the left halves of their logs, to give info to Scribe, and thus evils will have to.</p>

            <p>Link Minds is just like Private Matter, just stuck to one person. There is such a thing as whispers you know.</p>
<p>Audicial Projection would give the class some uniqueness, but the limited uses hinders the number of times it would be used. Even though it does differentiate from Imprison, it still serves the same basic purpose even if it is more powerful.</p>
<p>I feel the desire to hang on to the Psychic is just inertia, and that doesn’t really help with anything. Prince serves the same purpose, even though it is a killer, and there is not much use for redundancy. While I think your version is better than the current one, I still think the solution is to completely change its purpose.</p>
