    <title>Why I think the current ToL state is bad</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/why-i-think-the-current-tol-state-is-bad/71960</link>
    <description>Hi.

**Just for start: I dont think the game overall is bad, and im not saying ALL changes in the patches are bad.**
**This is just my opinion, and im not saying I dont understand the point of these changes.**

This is just a **respectful opinion and feedback** I wanted to post.

Lets begin with **The Mercenary and Sellsword** changes:

They make sense, but it ruins the basic purpose of the Merc: Protect a target. It was really fun to contract somebody and protect him, and even if the &quot;Revenge Kill&quot; with 1 charge was pretty useless, it felt really nice to use it.

Now Mercenary has to beg for some sucessful defenses, making it more Luck based rather than skill based.

I think the best change would be the possibility of picking the first contract before Day 3 and go from there.

Sellsword is actually a Neutral Butler who can side with neutrals and evils, the only problem I got with Sellsword its pretty simple: **It just feels pretty useless when you play it**, you just see how 1 factions wins while you try to **help people you dont really know who they are**. One more time, luck based instead of skill based.


Swear Fealty: Just get linked by a Mystic and there you go, **Immune to conversion + Guarded by king Investigator.** And you can say &quot;Well maybe king is evil and you just exposed yourself as Mystic&quot;

But here is my next point:

Neutral king no longer being able to start the game and current chances of King faction:

**King** is no longer a &quot;Box of Surprises&quot;: He is now Good most of the times and when he is evil, its too obvious because different kings now have different abilities.

Neutral King chances made the game more different between matches, since he can side even with the Neutral Killer and **people needs to have in mind the king can be Neutral.**

Also, I think the king is now... **Just a Mercenary before the patch**: Some guards and a 1 use ability, it was pretty fun to execute somebody at night and shocking the entire court.

And my last statement and the thing makes me feel really sad about:

**Alchemist and Scorned:**

Lets start with **Scorned:** Now its just luck based: Frame somebody and pray for it being investigated, or just go afk and pray for people getting executed in court.

Before the patch you could just keep punishing the same person and go for it, but now you just need... Luck.
Also, a detail: Now the Scorned lore makes no sense.

Alchemist: **Now we have a Superhero in the court**, a SupportOfensiveKillerInvestigative goddes what can do anything.

**This one is really skill based, and thats pretty good.** But she can do anything by herself! before she had to side a faction to get protection but why if **you can just do what any class can do for you in the game.**



I want to say, even if this changes are not good, there are a lot of this I really like: **Court Wizard feels amazing, Neutral Killer changes are awesome, and there are a lot of other things who are pretty well made.**

My conclusion: ToL is now a **&quot;Have Luck and you will win&quot; game and not a deception one.**

Thanks for reading and remember **this is just my opinion.**</description>

<p>Pretender king doesn’t need guards, go to Person A. Who’s butler, ask them to claim knight and that they are guarding you out loud, tell them to party that night, therefore he would catch a person trying to kill him.</p>

            <p>I agree that Pretender dying upon being unable to win is a necessary rework to stop her from being swingy when dead or alive.</p>
<p>As Pretender king, your threats are the unseen/cult and butlers. The BD poses no threat apart from numbers and a poisoned chalice. This is why heading into the endgame you can blackmail the evils into voting you for king, with your royal blood, you can challenge most BD steps and force the informed minority to coordinate with you whilst the BD suffers from either having to vote an unconfirmed RB or see if they have a numbers to up say a confirmed CW</p>
