    <title>Reaper 2nd Night Ability [Suggestion]</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaper-2nd-night-ability-suggestion/32325</link>
    <description>A small buff to increase the potency of the reaper by giving him a new defensive mechanic. 
Since I personally feel that with recent changes the Reaper is dragging behind on the Possessor and Sorcerer. 

**[Dead Men Tell no Tales]** 

_The Dead are unable to speak with the living this night. You can hear what the dead say to each other this night.(In effect the moment you click the button)._ 

Since you can only use one night ability at the time you cannot use Reap the same night naturally. 

This will allow the reaper to prevent Psychics from instantly confirming the &#39;&#39;reaper&#39;&#39; game. Allowing the Reaper to perhaps claim to be an Inquisitor of some sorts instead. Furthermore the Reaper could utilize the information the dead are sharing with each other.</description>

            <p>The reaper should just be able to hear the dead as a second passive instead.  The second part of this ability is too specific as the only BD class that can speak to the dead is the psychic.</p>

            <p>“BD died and didn’t leave, must have used Dead Men Tell No Tales” Is an example of how this ability is countered and just harms the reaper more. Especially that he can’t reap.</p>
