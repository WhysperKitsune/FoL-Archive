            <p>All of my friends stopped playing this because people are “slow.” I’m trying not to but it’s so damn frustrating.  It’s a social deduction game but everyone are sheep. One person votes without saying anything and everyone follows.</p>
<p>The new trend is accuse for logs and claim. There is no deduction in 80% of the games I play. Just random accusations and people who exe because king said so. Everyone looks to king for what to do. It’s crazy. Also Good luck claiming princess, knight, sheriff, or any neutral. Dead soon as you do because of the meta.</p>

            <p>Cool.<br>
You know you could just, y’know, not play it anymore? If that’s how you feel?<br>
Nobody’s going to try and convince you to stay after making a thread with a title like this.</p>
