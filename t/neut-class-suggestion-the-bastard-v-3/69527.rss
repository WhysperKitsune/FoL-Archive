    <description>

**Lore**: You slowly realized that you&#39;re father was caring less and less about the war between BD and Unseen. As you accuse him of staying neutral in the war, he gets furious and exiles you from the kingdom.  You swear that you will come back and kill your family for what they did. 


&gt;**Name - The Bastard (Fallen Prince)**
_**Faction - neutral**_ 
_**Type - offense**_

&gt;**Passive 1**: _**hidden in the chamber**_ - you hide in the jail the first time someone tries to attack you, making you immune to death once.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2:** _**taking what’s mine**_ - when the original prince dies then you may choose to kill anyone with your night ability &quot;_execute_&quot;
You will also gain **3 more uses** of _imprison_  

&gt;**Day Ability 1**: _**imprison**_ - jail a player at night, when you speak, you will appear as prince _**(3 uses)**_, gains **3 more uses** when/if prince dies
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability 2:**  - _**Disturbing thoughts**_ - pick a player and tell them about the prison, they will be occupied tonight _**(4 uses)**_

&gt;**Night ability 1**: _**execution**_;
&gt; - execute the player in jail. _**(1 uses).**_
&gt;- (If the prince is dead) kill anyone **_(3 uses)_** _[if you kill someone without royal blood then you are not able to execute anymore, but is still able to jail]_
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2**: _**lit candle**_ - lite a candle revealing the faction of the person who is jailed, **_(3 uses)_**

&gt;**Mechanics** - this class can be jailed interrupting any day abilities. This class cannot jail the prince. You will be given a message that _&quot;[player name]_ is the prince&quot;. If both the prince and bastard jail the same person then the prince will succeed and the bastard will get a message saying _&quot;[player name] was taken away before you could jail them&quot;._

&gt;**Win condition** - Kill anyone with royal blood and the starting king.

Extra lore: you are not given royal blood because your family doesn&#39;t consider you one of their own.</description>

            <p>If you jail a person and use the night ability lit candle to find out their class, maybe they could be a scum and you guys could work together.</p>
<p>For the prince… we all had games where prince dies day 2. If that’s not the case then strategizing with the evil faction in that gane to kill the prince could work too. Say you know that a Phys is guarding the prince. Whisper to a scum buddy you found and tell them to kill prince tonight while you jail the Phys. More random strategies come from this class similar to that, that’s why I thought it would be cool to see him in game.</p>
