    <title>The Skin Thief (my NK submission)</title>

Here is my slightly altered submission for the NK contest if anybody was curious to go over it.

Basically I wanted a NK that had a very high skill ceiling with a decently low floor, one that has extreme lows and extreme highs of gameplay. The ST can only kill every other night, averaging a 0.5 KPN with Suit Up. However, you can increase your KPN if you Suit Up a killing class like Knight/Assassin/Prince and use their ability when Suit Up is on cooldown. This also means you can perform two kills in a single night once Suit Up is off cooldown and you can use your stolen killing ability. After doing the math, the Skin Thief still performs an average lower KPN at 0.8 compared to other NK roles with a 1.0 KPN abilities.

I also wanted a NK role that would have a dynamically different game each time. Sometimes you don&#39;t know what abilities you will be offered when you Suit Up on a target. 

I also like the fact you can somewhat hide from investigative roles if you play your cards right. Suit Up a BD member and you&#39;ll be hidden for a little while. Suit Up a Cult or Unseen and you&#39;ll be sweating for a couple nights. 

Overall, the class has some low lows and high highs, and no game will ever be quite the same for a Skin Thief. Using Face Reader intelligently is crucial to victory, as is knowing which class you plan on killing and how best to utilize those abilities you steal.</description>

            <p>I’m mostly trying to achieve a laugh, but in seriousness pointing out the discrepancy of your logic in disqualifying me. You shouldn’t get defensive because I didn’t mean for it to be an attack, more of a playful jab. I don’t care about losing the contest at all since I already own the game and regularly buy keys for other players anyway</p>
