    <title>Neutral Showdown Preview</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-showdown-preview/74156</link>
    <description>I plan to host a non-bastard version of my &quot;Anniversary Mafia&quot; game soon, however I&#39;d like some feedback and/or balance suggestions before that. So here is the new setup:
* Everyone is a Neutral Killer with a goal to be between the last 3 players standing
* There will be plurality lynches.
* Both Day and Night will last 24 hours.
* Players can private message each other, as long as they invite the host to the conversation.
* This game will have up to 24 player slots

Here are the class cards, some of them where rebalanced and there will be new class cards as well.

            <p>That’s one of the reasons I was thinking of lowering goal to 2 living players instead of two, so whoever allies the twins still has a number’s advantage but not as big.</p>

            <p>Ok, Ive changed several classes and here are the rules that I’ve decided to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last 3 players alive win (Twins count as a single player for this)</li>
<li>Game will be flipless</li>
<li>Game will have plurality lynch only, both day and night will last 24 hours.</li>
<li>People can send private message to each other as long as they invite the host.</li>
<li>There will be normal feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Im still debating whether it’ll be better to change the goal to last 2 players instead though, 3 seems a bit too much. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>There are many classes that become more powerful when specific targets are lynched so people would have to keep that in mind as well when picking a lynch target.</p>
