    <description>&gt; # [color=steblue]The Citizen[/color]
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Social[/color]** 
&gt;
&gt; **First Amendment (Passive)** - You may chat as freely and often as you like without being restricted by character limits, spam filters, bans, or suspensions.  
&gt;
&gt; **Visit (Night ability)** - Pay somebody a friendly visit. (Does not count as visiting) 
&gt;
&gt; **Icibalus’s Wet Dream (Night)**  - Remove Fool from the game. If Fool is removed from the game it can no longer ever exist ever and it will be announced as such in the patch notes. (0 uses) 
&gt;
&gt;**Recharge (Day)** - Gain a use of Icibalus&#39;s Wet Dream. (0 uses)

&gt; # [color=purple]The Traitor[/color]
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Social[/color]** 
&gt;
&gt; **Overpowered (Passive)** - You may not speak in chat or accuse anyone of treason. The entire court will be notified that you are **not** reaped or chilled.

&gt; # [color=red]The Disciple[/color]
&gt; **[color=red]Cult Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt; **Cafeteria Cultist (Passive)** - You will fail to attend the nightly meetings. 

This post is the fruit of many laborious hours of blood, sweat and tears so please I appreciate any and all thoughts about my unique idea.</description>

            <p>Only traitor is balanced.<br>
You see, the color of the role name “citizen” is blue and very calming, so you can stare at it for a while and forget to type so you can feel calmed. This can AND WILL get you mislynched.<br>
Contrarily, “disciple” is in red, and red isn’t nearly as calming as blue, so you avoid looking at it because the sight of it gets you really pissed that your color is no longer blue, and because you don’t look at the color of your name you focus much more on the game than you would as citizen.<br>
“Traitor” is colored purple and it’s a middle ground. You won’t look at the role name as much as “citizen”, but you will look at it more than “disciple”, and as such is the most balanced.</p>
<p>For people that can not comprehend my vast array of knowledge: Nerf disciple, buff citizen. Traitor is balanced.</p>

            <p>I think the Traitor should have the Overpowered passive changed to this instead:</p>
<p>Overpowered (Passive) - You may use both Night Abilities in the same night.</p>
<p>And would gain the following abilities</p>
<p>Visit (Night) - Pay someone a friendly visit<br>
Relay (Night) - Visit the Mastermind or Assassin, relaying an important message. Does not count as visiting</p>
<p>easy</p>

            <p>You are right, I should remove the traitor’s ability to speak in chat and accuse people of treason.</p>
<p>And I’ll give citizen a visit ability as a much needed buff.</p>

            <p>Ngl. I think citizen could use a little more work. The traitor seems a little too op imo. And the disciple is balanced.</p>
<p>8/10 just balance it a little more.</p>
