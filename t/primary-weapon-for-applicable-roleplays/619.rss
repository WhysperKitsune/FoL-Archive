    <title>Primary Weapon for Applicable Roleplays</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/primary-weapon-for-applicable-roleplays/619</link>
    <description>A record of said user self designated weapons 

(please attempt to keep these semi-medieval themed, to at least somewhat belate to Throne of Lies) 

Template to make things easier:
______(your name here)&#39;s _______(weapon model, type, forge, etc.) has the effect of ______ _____(if it has some magical effect put what it is here, if it just does melee damage put something along the lines of &quot;brain damage&quot; or &quot;broken bones&quot; - you get the point). 

Example 1: @Queen_Alfa&#39;s ban hammer has the effect of banning people from Discord, causing them depression.  
Example 2: @robflop&#39;s body has the effect of banning people  by hugging them (idk?) 
Example 3: @Dooku&#39;s curved sith lightsaber has the effect of slicing and dicing one&#39; s body (that&#39;s not really medieval themed though, but meh medieval isn&#39;t required more like recommended I guess)   

Template to be taken lightly, just try to do something along the lines of it.

Post below what your weapon is and have it forever immortalized in the Throne of Lies forums.</description>
