    <title>Maid (BD Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/maid-bd-social/52317</link>
    <description>Here is a suggestion for another social class, based on some of the old noble&#39;s abilities like hearsay and secret message, which I thought were really fun and interesting abilities but sadly got removed.

&gt;[Color=blue]**The Maid**[/color]
&gt;**Day Ability 1: Eavesdrop**
&gt;Select a player. You will be alerted if said player speaks tonight. (Prince, Jailed player, Gossip, Psychic, Linked players, Unseen/Cult, etc). 2 uses.
&gt; **Day Ability 2: Expose**
&gt; The next whisper from anyone will be made public. 3 uses.
&gt; **Night Ability 1: Gossip**
&gt; Ask all players for gossip, up to three people will be able to send an anonymous message to the Maid. Unlimited uses.
_(This is my attempt to make Noble&#39;s hearsay come back. It would work like this: As soon as you click the ability, everyone would get a message saying &quot;A Maid is looking for Gossip!&quot; and all living players would get a box like the one for whispers. Every player can write one message in the box, and the maid will be able to read only the first three messages sent. The Maid will not know who is sending her the messages)._
&gt; **Night Ability 2: Secret Message**
&gt; Allows a player to write an anonymous message that will be displayed at the beginning of the day. 2 uses.

&gt;[Color=purple]**The Housekeeper**[/Color] (Placeholder name)
&gt; **Day Ability 1: Trollbox**
&gt;Select a player and whisper a short phrase into the trollbox. It will appear as if that player said it. 2 uses.
&gt; **Day Ability 2: Expose**
&gt;The next whisper from anyone will be made public. 3 uses.
&gt; **Night Ability 1: Gossip**
&gt; Ask all players for gossip, up to three people will be able to send a message to the Maid. You will know who exactly sends a message. Unlimited uses.
&gt; **Night Ability 2: Cleanup**
&gt; Select a player, if they die tonight their class and logs will be hidden. 2 uses.</description>

            <p>Ok, with the changes to the Psych… ermm “Mystic” the old gossip ability was redundant, so I changed it for something else. I’m trying to bring back the old Noble’s hearsay but making it a bit less random. The converted maid has the same ability but the messages are not anonymous to her.</p>
<p>Please give me any feedback/suggestions you might have.</p>

            <p>Ok, I swapped Secret message and Eavesdrop. Does it look better now? I also gave the converted maid trollbox (with limited uses) because I think it would be interesting to have an evil class with trollbox and it fits the theme of spreading misinformation of the converted maid.</p>

            <p>I actually like Expose a lot.</p>

<p>Only one class needs Telepathy</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This would make psychic not as confirmable since a converted maid could fake telepathy on one of her unseen members, also allows investigative classes to give leads or information without fear of being outed. (Maid would know who sent said message though).</p>

<p>Then ask if they were linked or jailed, and they’re insta outed if not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This ability is powerful but it has 2 uses and you can waste it if you use it on someone who hasn’t talked. Would also make unseen/cult cautious of what they say at night. If its too powerful I can change it to 1 use or change it for a different ability. Would appreciate suggestions!</p>
