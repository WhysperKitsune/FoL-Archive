          <p>So I literally just realized I can ISO people way easier by going to the player list and clicking on their icon instead of hunting for a post they made in the thread lmao. I’m annoyed how much time I’ve wasted before this trying to find posts to click on to ISO people.</p>
<p>Also this took ages to type up lmao, I’m not sure it was worth ISOing all 9 people but here you go. 2 hours or so of freaking ISOs, and thank god I didn’t have to ISO myself.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Wind's current readlist</summary>
<details>
<summary>
Kyo</summary>
<p>Null at the moment. He was pushing Seth on whether or not he believed his own reads, which I can see as reasonable. Kyo also calls the thread a continued disaster. He says he doesn’t really care whether Marl and I are town so much as hoping that Shurian randed town, which is a bit of a weird statement, but I think it’s just NAI especially considering we all had an alliance earlier in the game. There’s nothing else worth noting from Kyo today that I can see.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Gorta</summary>
<p>Null because of an utter lack of posts to read lmao. He came into the thread saying he “sadly got vt” and complained that ISOing people was going to be a pain, caught up on the thread, went for dinner, and then said he’d be back tomorrow. He’s not producing any content whatsoever but it’s NAI for him since he always gets lost in the trees. I think we really need to pressure him to post if he doesn’t come back and give reads before EoD.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Marl</summary>
<p>I started ISOing him thinking he was GTH town, but I have a lot of doubts again about his slot now that I’ve ISO’d it and I’m throwing him into my PoE again. I said not too long ago that if it’s between Rome and Marl, I’d GTH town Marl, but I’m now thinking they’re just distancing by pushing on each other.</p>
<p>In Marl’s favor, I think his wim at the start of the day was good, even if NAI, and he’s been questioning other players’ reads. He questioned why YBW put LiLi as locktown and pressured YBW to answer. He also claimed he didn’t get his stats until he asked for them, like LiLi and YBW, but I think as soon as YBW outed it it shouldn’t have counted as a way to clear anyone else, so I’ll take it as NAI. Another small thing that looked good for Marl was when Zone asked him who he’d vote to self-pres and Marl said he didn’t need to self-pres, he just needed to vote a wolf.</p>
<p>Marl mentioned that if Rome flipping mafia clears him, we should yeet Rome, but a while before that, he also pointed out to Seth that if he were mafia, Rome would also have to be mafia due to the kill not going through on Rome, which is a contradiction that I’m not a huge fan of. However, because there’s always the chance that neither one of them is the killing mafia regardless of the other’s alignment, that earlier post from Marl becomes much weirder. If he and Rome are distancing, this set of posts is yikes because Marl would be trying to clear himself by bussing his scummate, and the same goes for Rome.</p>
<p>He continues to keep Rome in his PoE (along with Kyo, YBW and Gorta), which is pretty tunnelly at this point. I know he tunnels as town, but I’ve also seen him spew his teammates as scum by bussing them (thinking of EFoL 4 and 3/4) and I realize I can’t actually TR him for tunnelling. When I ask for him to elaborate on his Kyo and Gorta reads, he says that Kyo is less wolfy than Rome and Gorta is just gone, hence they’re in his PoE. I want more specific reasons from him on their slots because it just looks like he’s throwing some suspicion on them without backing it for any discernible reasons that I could see so far (at least from my pov since they’re both nullreads for me).</p>
<p>He also asked YBW and LiLi to sheep his vote on Rome, which actually now that I’m looking at it, isn’t such a great look. Then Marl says if he’s wrong on the Rome scumteam, Gorta or Zone is mafia, which as I understand he said has to do with player association, but I’m not quite there yet on <em>why</em> those associations exist.</p>
<p>Another thing that is probably less important now but that I’ve kept in mind is that Marl claimed to be 100% town on D4 already. It’s not impossible but I had doubts about it (as well as doubts about everyone who claimed to be 100% town other than Derps).</p>

<summary>
Shurian</summary>
<p>Shurian’s ISO is full of honestly sketchy posts, but considering I think this in every game that Shurian is town, it might be NAI. I think I’d put them at nullscum or scumlean, though, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible that Shurian claimed to no-action N3 and N4, but on the other hand I’m not sure if I believe them. They also claimed 100% town yesterday which I’m not sure was the truth.</p>
<p>I think Shurian’s interrogation on Seth looked decent, and not in bad faith, but it was mostly mathematical because Seth was forgetting how quantum worlds collapse. Shurian asking me to death tunnel them was funny, maybe a bit weird, but mostly NAI. The catchup posts where they explained exactly why YBW’s clear on LiLi made sense looked good, though.</p>
<p>Shurian gave a gutread that the scumteam is Rome/Zone/ChopChop but then immediately<br>
discredited it by saying their gut is usually wrong on people they aren’t familiar with. They said that Seth’s opening looked really bad and controlled the thread (which is actually true, and something I didn’t actually realize until they pointed it out). I can see where Shurian could have arrived at a scumread on Seth, even if I’m not sure that I agree with it. Then Shuri said that Zone’s actions have been NAI so far but the paranoia that Zone/Seth is a scumteam is why they think Zone might be scum (I’m assuming this has to do with associations but I’m not quite sure I see it). Shurian says Rome is a prime target for a yeet mainly because of being 100% alive, which is a decent reason but also honestly not a read. Out of their three gut scumreads, basically only one looks like they came up with a believable reason. Shurian continues to push on Seth later in the day by saying that probably half the thread would want to jump on him and that everything about him is scummy, then complains that he just completely poofed from the thread (which I assumed was NAI).</p>
<p>On the subject of sheeping, Shurian said that they want to hardclear LiLi for sheeping as well as the aforementioned derpclear about the night actions that YBW also cleared LiLi for. I don’t really think sheeping is a good reason to clear people, since some players really like sheeping as wolves, but I guess at the very least it means they aren’t pushing agenda, and that someone else on the scumteam would have to be doing the agenda pushing in that case. On the other hand, Shuri is hesitant to clear YBW since he wasn’t one of the first to claim 100% like Jane the day before.</p>
<p>Relating back to the early in-game alliances, Shurian asked Kyo if they were both town with Marl and me, would Kyo be happy, which is when Kyo responded he didn’t care what Marl and I were but wanted Shurian specifically to be town. I’m not sure whether to read into this more or not, but it’s just something I’m making a note of for now.</p>
<p>The last thing I see from Shurian is their extremely wide (half-asleep) PoE which includes 8 out of 10 players currently alive and more or less functions as a dartboard as far as I can tell. I want Shuri to reply when they’re awake and explain exactly why they grouped the players as they did (YBW / Gorta, Rome/Zone/Marl and Chop/Wind/Kyo, each group having one scum according to them).</p>

<summary>
ChopChop</summary>
<p>This ISO felt like a headache to read, honestly. Basically it’s just Seth not really understanding how collapsing worlds works, and then tunnelling Marl and me for a while and telling Marl to vote me if he’s town, but saying that one of us has to be the killing mafia while Rome must be 100% mafia and not the killer. Once I posted a wallpost that honestly should have been considered NAI, he suddenly flipped to a TR on me and then admitted he simply didn’t want me to get ML’d because I have a streak of never getting day voted (which as I pointed out in response, and I’ve pointed it out to him a couple times before as well, is a really bad reason not to want to vote me). The entire premise of his SRs on Marl and me was just that we claimed to attack Simon N2, which isn’t a great reason since the killer probably lied and claimed to have attacked someone else anyway. If they didn’t claim to attack Simon before, they certainly wouldn’t claim it now.</p>
<p>In response to Rome mentioning that he was tempted to push for Seth’s lynch, Seth said to go ahead and do it because he’d feel good if scum ganged up on him (which I didn’t quite understand, but I assumed it meant we could read the wagonomics; that being said, he’s never today’s yeet). Seth chose to clear YBW and Zone for unspecified reasons and then said he’d probably clear Kyo as well due to being a CW to PKR when PKR flipped mafia, which is flawed reasoning as people’s roles hadn’t settled yet (but it’s Seth-reasoning so eh).</p>
<p>After deciding that he TRs me, he said his GTH scumteam is Marl/LiLi/Rome. I didn’t really think much of earlier, but considering what I saw in Marl’s ISO, I can understand why a Marl/Rome team would make sense. Not really sure why he SRs LiLi, though. He then swapped to SRing Shurian and mentioning that Shurian in LyLo isn’t a good thing because their slot has nothing going for it and might be the attacking mafia (which I don’t think we can prove or disprove at this point). He also says that either he or I will probably die tonight (which I think he kind of says in a lot of games we’re in so I don’t really think it means anything one way or another, especially since neither of us have ever died on a night he said he thought we would lol).</p>
<p>Anyway, Seth’s ISO is long and full of a lot of conclusions that I think in a lot of ways might be incorrect, but I also think he believes he’s pushing the right slots judging by his attitude and tone, and he’s well within his town meta from what I can tell, so he’s still one of my highest townreads right now.</p>

<summary>
YBW</summary>
<p>(I’m starting to get really tired of ISOing everyone and it’s been an hour, help-)<br>
I ISO’d YBW earlier so I’m going to restate what I said before because I’m lazy. I don’t think low activity is anything more than NAI, but not paying attention to the thread seems anti-town. I think his derpclear on LiLi’s night actions looks like an authentic enough clear on LiLi, but it still doesn’t clear YBW since I don’t know whether I can take his word for having done the same thing as LiLi (or if he was just saying that). I think sheeping someone else’s reads/votes is also pretty anti-town, but as Rome pointed out, if you sheep the right person I guess it could be a good thing as it gives them an extra vote.</p>
<p>The thing is that from what I remember in other games with YBW, he has kind of low confidence in his reads as town and he does sheep quite a bit, but when he offers his own unique takes on reads they’re worthwhile. I’d like to see him putting in more effort to read before EoD, though, because right now I feel pretty comfortable keeping him my PoE for today.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Zone</summary>
<p>Most of what I see from Zone today just looks NAI and doesn’t really ping me one way or another, but if he’s been posting while I’ve been writing this, then I haven’t seen those posts yet lol. Anyway, his slot is at a null for me right now.</p>
<p>Zone started off by reminding people that it’s highly likely people continued lying from D3 onward about their stats, and that it’s probably better to just think of today as a new game as we can start reading people since this is like a 7v3 mountainous. NAI but I agreed with his statement.</p>
<p>He faults YBW for sheeping him and says he doesn’t want to be used as a scapegoat, which I think looks somewhat worse for YBW than it does for Zone. On the other hand, he agreed with Seth’s idea that either Marl or I must be a wolf because we both attacked Simon N2 (which Seth also claimed to do, but it looks like Zone TRs Seth?). He points out to LiLi that because she has no wolf meta, there’s really nothing saying that she couldn’t be a wolf here, but since she’s not pushing anyone like an agenda push her slot doesn’t look so bad. Zone probes further to find out when exactly Rome asked for his alignment, but I don’t really see any further discussion on it after that.</p>
<p>Zone was quick to vote Marl when Seth said I should be thunderdomed with him, but considering that Zone said he gets impatient and likes for things to move along, I guess it’s  NAI. His interaction with LiLi regarding how she interpreted his vote seemed a bit off, but it also looks like LiLi genuinely misunderstood.</p>
<p>Zone claimed that my recap of D4 and the PR claim conflict was basically an empty post, which I obviously argued against, but I can also (unfortunately) see why he said that. (Now that there’s more activity, though, I think i can just work with this instead.) His response to my reply about that post seemed ok, though, although I think I actually forgot to respond to his question and that’s entirely my fault because I just saw it when looking through his ISO now lol.</p>
<p>When Zone pointed out that the thread is actually in a really bad state if Seth was controlling the thread as Shurian originally said, I think it was a completely valid point (sorry Seth!) because it’s something that basically never happens, or at least not that I’ve seen before.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Rome</summary>
<p>So I ISO’d Rome earlier in the day to see if he had any wolf equity and I’m doing it again to write down all my thoughts on his slot and why I actually think he’s a likely wolf now.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize at first that his opening post (“Hello, fellow mafias”) was essentially a meme until LiLi filled me in on that it’s a common thing on MU. The question on why Jane was killed I think has a chance of being genuine, as Rome doesn’t know what Jane is like as a player, but on the other hand it would be a very easy thing to ask to gain a bit of a townlean.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, too, clearing Kyo of having the same percentages as himself and Eli is a weird and invalid clear imo as it doesn’t really mean that all 3 of them would have randed in exactly the same way (and, in fact, we know they didn’t because Eli flipped as voyeur). Rome claimed in response that it’s only a temporary clear and he might go after them tomorrow, but I really don’t see a point in “temporary clears” since all it does is give potential scum another day to live.</p>
<p>He pushed back a lot on Seth which is pretty NAI as anyone in that spot would likely have done the same, although Rome specifically says that Seth is probably unfortunately town, but that he’s tempted to push for a Seth yeet anyway (his vote, however, is not on Seth). He also contradicted LiLi by saying that she doesn’t really sheep and instead nags/grills her targets thoroughly. I don’t know whether that means he thinks LiLi isn’t in her town meta, or if it was just a remark.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much to believe in his claim that he no-actioned and asked Eevee for his rolecard before deciding whether to submit a night kill. I feel like anyone could claim doing that (unlike LiLi’s reverse order of submitting an action and then being told she was VT). When I mentioned that sometimes the most innocent-looking players are the wolves, Rome’s comment was “makes you want to go for them more”. I don’t really know if that was encouraging me to SR LiLi but it seemed like an odd comment. Probably NAI but I’m keeping it in mind because I really didn’t know how to interpret it.</p>
<p>When I specified that Marl/Rome could be w/w with the third mafia being the killer, Rome said he wanted to emphasize that they could simply be two VTs targeting each other and that we shouldn’t bother yeeting him because he’d be a “defenseless vanilla town”, which imo is basically empty words since anyone could say that.</p>
<p>Rome’s response when I asked why sheeping could possibly be a good thing was interesting. He said that if you have a good leader who’s a townie, the game becomes less chaotic, but if you choose the wrong person to sheep then it’s dangerous, so it depends on the situation. But I feel like this could very well be encouraging people to sheep whom they think are strong leaders while possibly enabling deepwolves if we have any. I don’t think it’s a good thing at all to encourage, especially when I personally know that YBW is capable of giving good reads on his own.</p>
<p>When I said earlier that Rome’s ISO was meh, he just said “tell me about someone who isn’t meh” which… doesn’t really say much imo. It’s a strange statement because I can definitely say that not everyone’s ISOs are straight-out “meh”. There are people who are significantly less “meh” than Rome, and it just looks like a dismissive response from him because he doesn’t <em>want</em> me to form more of an opinion on him other than just a “meh”. I just don’t like this response from him.</p>
<p>I’ve seen Rome claim multiple times that he’s VT and insist he’s VT and that we’ll all regret voting him when he flips, and it kind of feels more scummy than not to me. I think town at this point would stop trying to hard insist they’re town because their rolecard says town on it every time they’re pushed, because they know it’s a weak argument with absolutely no proof until they flip. He also says to Marl that the moment Marl decided he was a wolf, was the moment Marl was wrong, and that Marl might be a wolf following Seth’s tunnel on him. While I still think Marl and Rome could very well be w/w, this seems like a cocky and somewhat unnecessary statement that, again, anyone could claim. He also accuses Marl of scapegoating him and says he doesn’t like how Marl is handling things.</p>
<p>Rome was the first to post a full readlist today, and he reiterates that he’s ignoring Kyo for today, Marl is a nullscum (despite Rome hard accusing Marl of pushing him), TL on Shurian assuming Shurian was telling the truth, TL on Seth, TL on me for being active, TL on LiLi for being innocent, and null on everyone else. It’s not the worst readlist, but it does have a lot of nulls in it as well as that weird temporary clear on Kyo that I don’t like. It also looks like Marl is the only read he has that’s anywhere close to a scumread.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
LiLi</summary>
<p>LiLi’s tone has actually been consistent the entire game, and she’s been playing toward a town wincon the entire time as I understand. Tonal consistency is a huge point in her favor imo. That little bit of paranoia that I have that she’s actually just deepwolfing hasn’t gone away yet, though, but considering that both YBW and Shurian wanted to clear LiLi for the night action thing, her slot looks like a decent townread. I would still take her into consideration in LyLo, however, because last time I stupidly dismissed the player I thought had the most innocent tone and the scumteam won the game lol.</p>
</details>
</details>
<p>Now that that’s out of the way, I gotta go cook dinner lol.</p>
