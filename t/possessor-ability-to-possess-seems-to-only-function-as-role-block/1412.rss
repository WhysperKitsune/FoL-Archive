    <title>Possessor ability to possess seems to only function as role block</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-ability-to-possess-seems-to-only-function-as-role-block/1412</link>
    <description>So, just played a game as Possessor and one night, I controlled playerA into playerB. B was guarded by a knight and both me and A got killed. 

First, I was surprised because I was assuming that even if the target was guarded, only the possessed player dies. And even if I do visit together with my possessed slave, I have night immunity - so why would I die.

That was confirmed as not true by a dev on Discord. Working as intended.

So knowing that, and assuming I died because I visited together with A - Possessor effectively works in this way: playerA gets role blocked (and killed if the target is guarded, but why would I care about that if I die as well and I&#39;m neutral killing) and playerB gets killed.

It just feels... a bit pointless from lore standpoint?

Thoughts?

EDIT: role block = occupied</description>

            <p>Dev confirmed it as not a bug.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this is a bug or a game balance issue.</p>
<p>It’s just that the wording on abilities is confusing and you essentially have to find out how they work by trial and error. And I have no doubt that people in the future will post this as a bug every time, because that was my first reaction as well.</p>

            <p>Well it’s just my perception that is at fault then.</p>
<p>I kind of assumed that Possessor controls a person to do their bidding - but effectively there is no difference whether they kill the target or you do.</p>
<p>Like I said, it’s just like you choose to drag one person around with you when you do the killing, but the ability says “Possess a player and make them kill for you.” It’s not intuitive (at least it wasn’t for me) that I would go along with them. I would assume I visit playerA, possess A and they visit playerB and kill B. Now I know that I guess I visit both? If observer was watching where I’m going would he see that and automatically know I’m possessor because it’s the only role that visits two people?</p>
<p>EDIT: + it’s again not intuitive that night immunity doesn’t work if you are killed by a defending knight during night. (Also, I just want to emphasize I am completely not talking about this in terms of any sort of balance, it’s just that between how mechanics are worded and how they work out, it’s confusing)</p>
