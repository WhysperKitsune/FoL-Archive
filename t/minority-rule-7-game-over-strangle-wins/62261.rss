    <description>Welcome to Minority rule 7!

*The rules are pretty simple. I will present you a choice of several rooms—just choose one to enter! If you pick the room with the most people, you will all meet a horrible demise!*

**[color=#000080]How to play?[/color]**
Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. If you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated. **Only one room can have majority. If there is a tie the room which is higher up on the hierarchy has majority.** The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. Do **/Join** to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me.

## Rooms
**[color=skyblue]Air [/color]** - All pickers become light. 
**[color=#801080]Betrayal [/color]**- If this room is tied for the minority, it gains infinite picks and becomes the majority.
**[color=black]Death [/color]**- Everyone who picks this dies, even if it is not the majority.
**[color=#DFDFDF]Dice [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status.
**[color=#BFBF00]Divide [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as half.
**[color=#505050]Duplicacy[/color]** - Takes the effect of the room with the majority, after all other room effects are applied.
**[color=lightbrown]Earth [/color]**- A random picker becomes heavy.
**[color=#800000]Evil [/color]**- All pickers become cursed.
**[color=#FF00FF]False [/color]**- This room does nothing, but it takes the name of another random room.
**[color=#BD B7 6B]Feast[/color]** - All pickers gain a tangerine.
**[color=#8000FF]Force [/color]**- A random person who did pick this will change to a random room in the current pool.
**[color=darkred]Graveyard[/color]** - If this room is the minority, or tied for the minority, 3 random dead players will be revived
**[color=#BF0080]Gravity [/color]**- A random person who did not pick this will change to this room.
**[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]**- A random picker becomes a saint. All other pickers become cursed.
**[color=#800080]Illusion [/color]**- This room takes the effect of another secret item before the start of the round.
**[color=#808080]Insanity [/color]**- All pickers becomes insane.
**[color=#00BFFF]Life [/color]**- If nobody picks this, everybody dies.
**[color=green]Luck [/color]**- If this room is the majority, then one random picker will survive. If this is not the majority, then one random picker will die.
**[color=#FFBF40]Multiply [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as two.
**[color=sienna]Mundane [/color]**- This room literally does nothing.
**[color=dark]Murder [/color]**- One random picker becomes a Serial Killer
**[color=#509090]Protection [/color]**- All pickers are immune to death this round for any reason other than the majority. A random picker becomes a bodyguard.
**[color=#0080FF]Purity [/color]**- Everyone who picks this loses all statuses.
**[color=#FF0000]Rejuvinate [/color]**- Everyone who picks this becomes healthy.
**[color=#00EF00]Spite [/color]**- A random picker will becomes cursed.
**[color=Steelblue]Secrecy[/color]** - All pickers become cultists.
**[color=blue]Unity [/color]** - If all players pick this, nobody will die due to the majority.

## Statuses
[color=#408000]Bodyguard [/color]- Nobody who picks the same room as you can die for any reason other than the majority. If anyone who would die without your intervention is saved, you will die instead.
[color=Steelblue]Cultist[/color] - If there are any cultists, then there will be an item that only its members may pick. It will be denoted in [brackets].
[color=#804080]Cursed[/color]- You will die next round unless your status is removed or your death is prevented. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=#FF0000]Healthy[/color] - You cannot die for any reason except for the majority. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#808080]Insane[/color] - Next round you must pick the majority or you will die. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=skyblue]Light[/color] - You do not count as a picker for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=lightbrown]Heavy[/color] - Your pick counts as two picks for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=Cornflowerblue]Saint[/color]- You are immune to death. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#0000BF]Serial Killer[/color] - A random person who picks the same item as you will die.

**[color=#000080]Order of application goes:[/color]**

New Statuses

## Extra Rules

1. This game will be played on your own. No partners. Sorry. 
2. Each round one room will have a tangerine in it :tangerine:. If there are 2 players left alive at the end whoever has the most tangerines :tangerine: wins. If both have the same it is a draw. 

## Changes

There are several changes within the rooms and statuses this time. The aim was to try to reduce RNG a bit (only in a few rooms where it wasn&#39;t necessary) and make more rooms present interesting scenarios. There is still the same amount of rooms. Look at the Change Log for precisely what was changed.

The way the game works is fundamentally different in this one. The rooms will be drawn in an order, and if multiple rooms are tied for majority only the room first drawn (highest up on the list) will be eliminated. 


[details=&quot;Example&quot;]
Rooms are drawn in a hierarchy. For example in round 1 the rooms could be:

1: **[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]** (4 people chose this)
2: **[color=lightbrown]Earth [/color]** (3 people chose this)
3: **[color=black]Death [/color]** (1 person chose this)
4: **[color=green]Luck [/color]** (4 people chose this)

Normally both everyone in  **[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]** AND everyone in  **[color=green]Luck [/color]** would be eliminated as they tie for the majority. However, with the new hierarchy rules ONLY the people in **[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]** are eliminated as it is higher up than **[color=green]Luck [/color]**. 
[/details]

This will make the game last longer so you do not need so many people, and reduces the chance of a draw. It should also make the game more tactical hopefully, which is the main aim of most of the other changes.

[details=&quot;Change Log&quot;]

- New Hierarchy rules in play (see above). 
- Removed Majority. Very similar to Unity just worse. 
- Removed Mystery. It is a less satisfying version of Dice
- Removed Permanency. It is incredibly boring every time it is rolled and adds nothing interesting. 
- Added Unity. An interesting room suggested by Sketch. 
- Added Graveyard. It&#39;s a fun room suggested by Sketch. 
- Added Feast. Nice to have a room related to the :tangerine: mechanic.  
- Added Duplicacy. A very interesting room suggested by Burrito. 
- Changed the Insanity room and the Insane status to reduce RNG.

            <p>U of M is actually the second-cheapest of anywhere I was accepted, after Michigan Tech.</p>
<p>Granted, I also applied almost exclusively to, like, Ivy League colleges, so</p>
<p>As for AP World, if you’re trying to do anything in your last 24 hours, the website Get A Five has some pretty decent (if not particularly entertaining) videos</p>
<p>And this is <strong>required</strong> watching</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs</a></p>
<p>It was released the day before the AP World exam last year, and basically goes through the whole textbook</p>

            <p>I took Biology freshman year, Physics and Chemistry this year, AP Physics C: Mechanics last year, and independently studied AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism this year.</p>
<p>Teaching myself the Physics C: E&amp;M curriculum went decently, but U of M requires a 5 and I’m not confident enough I can hit that to take the $100 cost of the exam.</p>
<p>So I’ll be entering next year with 32 credits, and so what if I have to “only” take sophomore-level physics my first year lol</p>
