            <p>In what way is it less useful than the current Herbalist?</p>
<p>Also, Invoker because in the case that these buffs are given, Invoker would be closer.</p>
<p>Also, Cult conversion works exactly this way. Multiple roles are changed into one if converted.</p>

            <p>What’s the point?</p>
<p>This is arguably less useful than the current Herbalist and also forces the Assassin to forage, which it shouldn’t do</p>
<p>Also why Invoker?<br>
That goes entirely against how Cult Conversion is supposed to work</p>

            <p>Well, I added some changes to the Black Rose and Cult version, switching from Ritualist to Invoker and changing that instead.</p>
<p>Also changed it again to reflect the new changes.</p>

            <p>I agree with this thread, Physician instantly is killed when converted to Cult/BR. Herbalist needs a minor change, not a full on buff. I agree on keeping the ability to identify players’ death for Ritualist  as well.</p>

            <p>Yes. While changes can’t be made at the moment, it is always great to get this stuff down.</p>

            <p>Suggestions don’t though - if we come up with a Cult change like that now, then it can be changed and tweaked until the game is ready.</p>
