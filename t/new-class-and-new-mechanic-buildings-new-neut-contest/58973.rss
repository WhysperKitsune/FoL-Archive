    <description>                  ‚Ä¢Builder 

            **_Work in progress_** 

&gt;Description: this is a class built heavily around different constructions and when to make them. Each construction has different attributes and is dangerous to visit.  

&gt;Mechanics - only one builder per game, the builder will only spawn in 16 man games. If the builder dies with a construction still up then the building will still remain.  
&gt;
&gt;All constructions cab be built in anyone&#39;s room. Everyone can visit that player as normal but depending on the building something else could happen 

&gt;**Type - special** 
&gt;**Faction - Neutral** 

&gt;‚Ä¢The Builder will know what faction he is working for. 

&gt;**Passive 1:**
**_Hard worker -_** can use both day abilities on the same day
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2:**
**_Long hours_** - When you are attacked your first time, you will be immune because you spent extra hours at work. If you are brought to jail then the construction will be stalled for a day. 

&gt;**Day Ability 1:**
**_Construction_** - select a building to start working on, it will be finished the night you select it. Then select a player to build the room in. (Unlimited uses)(1 day cool down) 
&gt;
&gt;_Church_ ‚ù§Ô∏è - If any BD member visits the room where the church is then they will be healed of any poison/bleeding. If any unseen/cult visit then everyone else who visits the church will die that night 
&gt;
&gt;_Blacksmith_ ‚öîÔ∏è - anyone who visits the blacksmith will regain all uses of their limited abilities and occu immunity for the next night. 
&gt;
&gt;_Stable_ üê¥ - if the builder selects the stables at night then the time will be increased for an extra 10 secs during the day and is able to have an extra trail during the next day. 2 time use per construction. If a player selects this then they will hide in the stable preventing anyone from visiting them. 
&gt;
&gt;_Dungeon_ üóù - If king sends a guard to the dungeon then the prince will be night immune. If any unseen/cult visit the dungeon then the prince can&#39;t exe his target that night. If a neutral or BD visit the dungeon then they can hear the prison chat for the following night.(they will hear prince and captive when they chat)
&gt;
&gt;_Library_ üìö - If anyone visits the player with the library then they will gain a passive based off of the room where the library is. 
- if the library is in a room where the player has an occu immune passive then anyone who visits will be occu immune for the next night. 
- if the library is in a room where the player has a death immune passive then they will be death immune the next night
- if the library is in a room where the player has both death and occ immune passive then they will gain both the next night. 
-  If they have two passives then their next limited ability will take no uses.
- (Can only be built day 3 and beyond)

&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability 2:**
_**Destruction**_ - destroy your current building(unlimited uses)

&gt;**Night ability 1:**
_**Secret door**_ - select yourself, anyone who visits you will be redirected to where you built your building if you have one. If you don&#39;t then you may not use this ability(2 uses)
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2:**
**_Loose nails_** - undo the nails collapsing the building on any players who decided to visit the current building, making them all bleed. The current construction will be destroyed. (Unlimited uses)

&gt;**Win condition** - have the starting king and his faction lose to win. 

Lore: The King decided to cut your pay for his own benefits. Now the builder is out for revenge.  

Thanks for the help @Firelitten,  @Htm, @NuclearBurrito and others I didn&#39;t mention</description>

            <p>I want to make a small change but before I do, I would like some feedback. I wanted to change his passive that allows him to survive his first attack and change it</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="NOBLE1" data-post="1" data-topic="58973">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://www.ThroneOfLies.com/images/class-icons/princess-icon-256.jpg" class="avatar"> NOBLE1:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive 2:</p>
<p>Long hours - When you are attacked your first time, you will be immune because you spent extra hours at work. If you are brought to jail then the construction will be stalled for a day.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The new passive will tell any builder if there is another builder in the game.</p>
<p>Like a little icon will be placed to the other builder<br>
Ex. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/hammer_and_pick.png?v=9" title=":hammer_and_pick:" class="emoji" alt=":hammer_and_pick:"> 12. Vow of silence<br>
Like how the crown is next to the king or a tiny contract is next to the mercs target.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>Wouldn‚Äôt that be to easy? Like with the 1 time death immune passive and the redirect any visitors Ability keeping you alive. Plus you just keep building and destroying building every other day. My idea with this class was to have him work together with a faction and provide the right buildings needed. Originally he had to work with the starting king but people didn‚Äôt like that</p>

            <p>K we are getting this ready for the new neut spot. You are making this better no expections.</p>
<p>My suggestions</p>
<p>-Doesn‚Äôt have a slot 17 instead you can choose to build it on any slot except King and yours. IT WONT SAY IN CHAT WHERE IT IS BUILT. If you remove the house it bleeds anyone visting that person and the person itself. Dungeons let you see and talk to the prince THE NEXT NIGHT. and that‚Äôs about it</p>

            <p>The problem still remains why anyone wants to visit the buildings and how the builders abilities assist him in achieving his goal. As of right now, almost no class wants to visit any of the buildings. Church is mostly useless when a physician can easily just heal them directly. Blacksmith has some interesting late game uses. The stables are not something anyone wants to visit. I‚Äôm not even sure the dungeon would work. And the library seems rng based which is never a good choice.</p>
<p>Add in, players waste a full night going too these places. Why would a poisoned sheriff go to the church when a phys can just heal him and he can still search at night?</p>
<p>And again, none of the buildings help the builder survive. Alch has heal to blend in with bd, stoneskin to protect, and poison to kill. He has the tools to survive to the end. The builder just doesn‚Äôt do anything other than exist.</p>
