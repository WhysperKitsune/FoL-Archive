    <title>But seriously. Drunk is just better</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/but-seriously-drunk-is-just-better/39258</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s take a look at the 2 BD offensive classes.

1: Drunk
2: Butler

The Drunk does 2 thing&#39;s. Makes someone target him (while being immune to thier attacks/conversions) And can Occupy someone through immunitys while also making night Immune classes vulnerable that night.

Butler can do 3 things. Stop someone from doing any action (Occupy). Occupy visitors and Poison the king.


First lets look at thier primary Ability&#39;s. Effects on various class types.


Butler:

Invest - they lose a night. Too bad no info for you. This hurts BD

Support - they don&#39;t get to help anyone. Always hurts BD.

Killer - You can save a knight from CSing BD I guess.

Drunk:

Invest - They clear you and depending on what they were doing they can give you even more info. Including that they were Princess if they tried to wisp. They still get info (possablely more) Pro BD.

Support - heals you. The big targets are likely known to be guarded but now you are so someone attacking you will fail. Not quite pro BD but not that bad either.

Killer - You might make a Knight die from CSing you. The only worse outcome.

There is also the fact that if you Deb a non OCC immune killer you will know 100% that you did.

Now let&#39;s look at thier secondary ability:

Butler: His Ability is useful in 1 situation only - When he is attacked by the primary faction or a Reaper. In all other situations it doesn&#39;t help for the reasons listed above.

Drunk: HH is the best offensive Ability in the game by far. You can work with a Knight to kill an NK/MM. You can clutch stop an NK or MM kill/convert. You can stop an assassin or CL kill/convert even if they were occed 3 times earlier and in a cult game it proves you as not converted!


The only thing the butler has on the drunk is poison. And the drunk beats that with royalty being better.</description>

            <p>Happy Hour actually feels like it should be a Butler ability to be honest, but I guess it would be kind of boring to have the same ability.</p>
<p>Making Party go through Occ Immune would make it slightly better since the Butler could at least assure they survive a night.</p>

            <p>Well there might be two butlers too luckily ;). Not alchemists are heal king every night bots either and butler can only poison king from day 4 onwards. If you haven’t figured out who claims alchemist by then, you’re not playing the game and applying social deduction very well.</p>

            <p>I personally believe we have other classes for that type of protection.</p>
<p>The Butler is an “Offensive” class, and it should be more aggressive if anything. Buffing Nightshade Wine would be a good first step.</p>
<p>And if you’re so concerned about NW being healed, just make it incurable. Also stops the “poison me to prove” strat.</p>

            <p>You know what you are? The Butler. What does the Butler do? It occupies. If you really want to get rid of the king that badly, you simply occupy the alchemist. Not all alchemists like siding with evil/neutral kings as it makes them vulnerable to prince and BD backlash. Evil/neutral kings can also take out alchemists as scapegoats “to find NK, neutsout” to prove their credibility.</p>
<p>Main points should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Party goes through occupy immunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nightshade wine kills in one night, but retains the assassin message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all a butler needs.</p>

            <p>Fair enough doesn’t change the fact that possessor could just jump to you. So no the wolf/bear does not matter.Its just an example showing how when butler’s party is supposed to be a savior it does absolutely nothing to stop the kill.</p>

            <p>What people are forgetting about party is 2 things.A-It doesn’t stop Occupy immune classes(MM/Sorcerer/Possessor)and B-Doesn’t actually give you immunity to anything.(Convert/Death)(So if CL is immune form being occupied 3 times in a row then butler does jack shit against it)<br>
With that out of the way Drunk is by far the superior class. It just does the job better.<br>
Not much else to say other then that. If you have a way that butler is better I would love to hear it but right now I’m pretty sure drunk is better. Drunk is better in that it has royal blood and does the offensive role better.Also its HH is better in the same scenario party should be good.Lets say you just got the last assassin.Right now its you,the butler,a hunter,and a possessor.Well fuck you possessor wins as all he has to do is kill you.Now same scenario except your a drunk.You HH him and then you and the hunter vote up the possessor for an easy win.Now the one thing butler has is POISON. What does this amazing ability do?Well at D4 D fucking 4 at the earliest you can poison the king.WOW that’s amazing! Now how long does it take for the king to die from this poison? Well just 3 days. Seriously fucking useless as hell in that having the king die D7 from poison is fucking ridiculous.(I say D7 because poison cant be used first 3 days which includes D3 so D4 + 2 nights of poison=D7 at most.) Right now butler needs some love as he is literally just a worse version of the drunk as burrito proved.</p>

            <p>Actually I’d be super ok with letting Nightshade Wine target anybody. Just give it two uses.</p>

            <p>Agreed, nightshade wine should be able to affect anyone(though you will still kill both yourself and your target if your target was BD).</p>

<p>I think the only change that they should make is make butler’s poison work within one day. It cannot even be used early game. Any decent starting evil king will have gained numbers by day 6 in my experience. This should be THE trump card of the butler. On top of all that the butler suicides, if it was misused. This also promotes evil kings to be more proactive for once. Too many games happen where evil kings sit back, do nothing and win the game. I think the balance besides that is fairly well done between Drunk/Butlers. If another change is in order, have the skill “party” notify you when you are visited while using it. Not who visits you, but just the fact that you have been visited.</p>

<p>Only if the same change is made to assassin’s nightshade.</p>

            <p>Disagree with this heartily. Wining or debbing the enemy CL protects the butler/drunk just as easily as party does, except debbing 50/50 confirms that the target is CL. Happy hour is great in cult games as it confirms you 100% to any one person. Butler is also THE fake claim for invokers, which make up a great portion of cult, since killer classes are still converted to it, effectively weakening the class as a whole. In Unseen games the butler can still prove he is either butler or assassin by whisping someone confirmed BD that he’ll poison and then poisoning king.</p>
<p>For me personally Drunk always has a little edge over Butler against both factions. But I like to lead the court and Drunk can step up with royal blood, so I’m biased a little bit.</p>

            <p>I think, in unseen games, drunk is the best class. he can find mm (occupy immune), reaper and assasin, also the only class besides prince that can stop mm from converting.</p>
<p>For me, the butler poision is kinda useless, now when alch can heal it, and every alch sides with king, evil or good.<br>
the poision should be able to get healed only by physician, this way bd have an option to kill the king without losing a day like unseen/NK have the option.</p>

            <p>It used to be closer when the Drunk died for debauching killers, but now that they don’t it is generally a better ability than Serve.</p>
<p>Drunk can even do what Butler can twice a game… only better.</p>
<p>The only real edge Butler has is he can protect himself from Assassins/eradicates with party.</p>
