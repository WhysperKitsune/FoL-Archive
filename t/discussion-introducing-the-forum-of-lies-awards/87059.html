          <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier this week, we’re planning on shifting to an annual awards system. This thread is going to go through the current draft of the rules, as well as the awards categories. This isn’t set in stone yet – one of the things we’re hoping to do here is get feedback on the rules, as well as on categories you’d like to see added or removed.</p>
<p><s>In particular, one thing we’d like feedback on is whether you’d prefer <em>annual</em> awards or a <em>semiannual</em> (every six months) awards. The rules we have right now assume the former, but it would be fairly easy to rewrite them.</s> Awards will be held annually!</p>
<p>Feel free to use this thread to discuss nominations!</p>
<p><strong>Updated Awards System:</strong></p>
<p>Credit to <a href="https://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/threads/29730-Mafia-Universe-Awards-2021-Nominations">the Mafia Universe mods</a> for creating the system that I’ve modelled these awards off of.</p>
<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who has played at least one game on FoL can nominate another member for an award. Anyone who has played or hosted at least one game on FoL is eligible to receive an award.</li>
<li>All nominations must have a <strong>nomination</strong> and a <strong>second</strong> to be valid. You cannot nominate yourself, nor can you nominate a team that you were part of (for example, if you were scum in FoL 99, you can’t nominate the FoL 99 scumteam for a group award; however, you could nominate a teammate for an individual award).</li>
<li>A minimum of 3 days must pass between a game ending and any nominations for that game.</li>
<li>All games that occurred at least in part in 2021 are eligible for awards. For this year only, there is also a “legacy” category, for games prior to 2021.</li>
<li>The deadline for nominations is one week after the last game that began in 2021 ends.</li>
<li>Once the nominations period is over, all relevant awards will be eligible for voting. Voting will be done via forum poll (the results will not be visible to anyone except forum moderators).</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, one thing we’d like feedback on is whether you’d prefer <em>annual</em> awards or a <em>semiannual</em> (every six months) awards. The rules we have right now assume the former, but it would be fairly easy to rewrite them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>annual<br>
semi-annual is a bit unnecessary since we don’t have that many games in 6 months</p>

<p>annual<br>
semi-annual is a bit unnecessary since we don’t have that many games in 6 months</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Originally when I first read the post I was thinking semi-annual, but this is a good point about the number of games.</p>
<p>Also, can someone win more than one award? Any limit? I couldn’t find that it was specified. I’m assuming there’s no limit, but just wondering for clarification. Sometimes people like to limit awards to spread them out more.</p>
