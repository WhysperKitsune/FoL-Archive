          <h3>Mercenary lore:</h3>
<p><em>Failed contract 1: The Mastermind (Contract died)</em></p>
<p>Failed contract 2: The Blue Dragon*</p>
<p>As he wrote down his former clients, he thought to himself what had happened that day. The king approached him and fired him for one reason: hindrance. His only talent was to prevent people from visiting, and that’s it. And most of the time it helps the unseen more.</p>
<p>The mercenary was no more. She sat down with her baby, Lucy, crying.</p>
<p>“Honey, I can’t take this. I failed 2 contracts already.”</p>
<p>“If you want to make it, do what you do best. People need to see your potential.”</p>
<p>Later after feeding her baby the mercenary decides to take a breather. She’s exiled from the castle now, and nobody can get her back in.</p>
<p>“Nobody? Why such dark thoughts?” A hooded figure appeared just behind her.</p>
<p>“Are you The mastermind? You seem familiar.”</p>
<p>The hooded figure lay down his cape. The face was of a beautiful woman and a powerful witch, rolled into one. She seemed abnormal.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a fool. I’m giving you a chance again.” What could this person possibly want? “I’m giving you a chance to be you. To do what you do best; to hinder.”</p>
<p>“Will this contract expire after a few weeks?”</p>
<p>“We shall see…”</p>
<p>The mercenary gave a slight glimmer of hope Finally she can make enough money to support her family.</p>
<h3>The Inqusitor</h3>
<p>“Age is a powerful thing. It can turn tides of battle, it can be a powerful weapon if you can use it right.” - Rasmodius, Grand Wizard of Adiart</p>
<p>The Inqusitor was getting old. The hunt for the Sorcerer was endless. It was almost time to retire from the church.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’re going on another chase, we need your help.” His bishop complained.</p>
<p>“I can’t chase this sorcerer anymore. The least I can do now is make people believe.”</p>
<p>“So you shall. Your effort to the church is valuable.”</p>
<p>The Inqusitor grinned sinisterly.</p>
<hr>
<p>When he reached the castle, he saw his former nemesis. He appeared to have new spells, in ways which he couldn’t comprehend.</p>
<p>That wasn’t his era anymore. That wasn’t his mission. Let the Blue Dragon kill the sorcerer on their own. He needs to recruit more followers of the church.</p>
