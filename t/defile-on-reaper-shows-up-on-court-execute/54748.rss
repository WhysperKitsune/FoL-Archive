    <title>Defile on reaper shows up on court execute</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/defile-on-reaper-shows-up-on-court-execute/54748</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Assassin attacked Reaper, Herbalist defiled reaper, but reaper did not die because he had enough souls. Next day, we put reaper up for logs and executed him. He showed as Prince. I was the actual prince that game.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Executing the Reaper should have shown Reaper.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. As Unseen, attack the Reaper with Assassin (ensure Reaper has enough souls to survive)
2. Have a Herbalist defile the Reaper as a different class that night
3. Execute the Reaper next day
4. Observe wrong class
