    <title>SFOL 34: FE Echoes I - (Deliverance Wins!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-34-fe-echoes-i-deliverance-wins/72009</link>
    <description># SFOL Echoes 

## Introduction

Welcome to SFOL Echoes! 

The foundation of this SFOL is just like all FOLs, with a King, a similar mechanic to Royal Blood, and Conversion.
I&#39;ve done my absolute best to attempt to take even more confirmation from the game as possible, so that abilities become tools for scumreading, not mechanical confirmation in itself.
The flavor for this game is taken from one-half of the game **Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia**, where one of the protagonists, Alm, goes on a journey from his quiet and small village to help his nation out in the war, but eventually comes to find himself as the hero of the whole continent. 

So, here&#39;s everything below!


### Rules

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515

### Gameplay
Days will be 3 days long, or shorter if someone is lynched
First day out of those 3 days will be for the battle or until majority is reached for battle
Nights will be 1 day long
Actions are done by DMing me
Rigelians will speak in a discord chat during day and night (or DM I&#39;ll see whichever one is easier)
Priest will speak with the dead through a DM at day and night
All classes can be used, the ones from [Echoes Class Cards Thread](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/sfol-echoes-class-cards-finalized/72003)
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it
When everyone has confirmed, or 24 hours has passed, Day 1 will end

### Executions
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
Executions are done by Trial
After the accused posts one message, everyone can begin casting votes
King may also Decide Fate during this time
Executions end the Day
Trials do not extend daytime


### Mechanics and Feedback

:shield: = Unique
:crossed_swords: = Guaranteed
:fire: = Magical 
:crown: = Nobility
[/quote]

[details=&quot;You All Should Read This&quot;]
[quote]

#### Characteristics
- Unique and Guaranteed are the same as the normal kind that&#39;s found on FoL.
- There is no bleeding nor poison.
- Max cap for non-Unique classes is 3.
- Magical is tied to classes that are flavor-wise magic users in Fire Emblem.
- Nobility is taken as a modified version from ToL 1.2. 
- All Nobility gain another secret vote when voting someone else as King, and will only be taken into effect or shown if it actually matters.
- The Scum faction (Deliverance) has a member cap of 7. This makes conversion a constant threat and possibility.
- Alm is always replaceable, like the Cult Leader.

#### Visit Checks
- Arcanist&#39;s first visit check, Feint Wisp, is based on who people message as first if they have the mounted target ability or multiple visits. 
- Kliff and Faye&#39;s tracker and watcher result will give in the order that the player inputted in messages, so the visit to the left will always be the first person the target visited.

#### Neighborhoods
- Nuibaba and Delthea have access to a neighborhood, in the form of a DM, where they can add and remove people. 
- The people in that neighborhood will know who each other are, but Nuibaba/Delthea will talk through the host. 
- NOTE: The neighborhood can only be used at night.

#### Feedback
- Feedback is based on the foundation of the limited version from EFOL 1.
- Meaning: Players will not know if they are attacked and healed, just healed, empowered, mind warped, and missed, dodged, or survived Day Attacks. 
- For non-Investigative classes, players will not know if they were occupied, ran into visit prevention, or redirected. 
- **Basically means that most of the time, there will be a &quot;you slept peacefully&quot; or its easier variant, no feedback at all.**

#### Exceptions
- Investigative classes will be given a &quot;no result&quot; from their ability if occupied or visit prevented, and will only be told that they were redirected, not who they were redirected to.
- Investigative classes will also get normal feedback from their abilities when not occupied or prevented. 
- All players will be told that they were killed, converted, changed classes, put in jail, and connected to the neighborhood. 

NOTE: This game is explicitly non-bastard in all types and forms.

## Specials

### Battles
[quote]
Starting Day 2, at the start of each day, the [color=brown]Rigelian Army[/color] and the [color=green]Deliverance[/color] will meet to engage in battle. The winning side will gain useful prizes each day that sometimes could swing the tide of the game. All day abilities, including day attacks, can still be used during battles. 

This is based off of the classic &quot;Weapon Triangle&quot; from Fire Emblem, where Axes beat Lances, Lances beat Swords, and Swords beat Axes, much like Rock, Paper, Scissors.

[details=&quot;How It Works&quot;]
[quote]
1. Members of The [color=green]Deliverance[/color] will give a fake claim of what they will choose for the battle the night before: either [color=red]Swords[/color], [color=green]Axes[/color], or [color=blue]Lances[/color]. This will be displayed in bold text alongside some descriptive narrative at the start of the day.
2. The [color=green]Deliverance[/color] will also give the real choice. There may be abilities that a class can use which allows them to choose [color=gray]Bows[/color], forcing a tie the following day regardless of the [color=brown]Rigelians’[/color] choice.
3. There will be 1 day in real time for all alive members to come to a vote in the thread by choosing Swords, Axes, or Lances. Some classes may have special abilities that affect this phase.
4. The [color=green]Deliverance[/color] will come to blows against the [color=brown]Rigelian Army[/color] and the choices of both sides will be revealed.
[/quote]

[/details]

If the Rigelians win, all members of the faction will gain Conversion Protection for that night. It&#39;s similar to conversion immunity, but this is only temporary, and even then, can be bypassed by some abilities.
If the Deliverance wins, the faction will be given the choice of removing a single cooldown that night from any ability that their members have. It&#39;s quite powerful.
And if the two sides come to fight and find themselves at equal strength, then nothing will happen as draws are so anti-climactic, and thus don&#39;t deserve any specialties.
[/quote]

### Day Attacks

[quote]

Starting Day 2, during the day, some classes will be able to directly attack their targets by using Day Abilities. Unlike night attacks, this will have a result based on RNG. Each different ability has different hit rates, and some classes have passives and abilities that can increase hit rate or decrease hit rate of various players.

The way notifications for Day Attacks work, is anyone who can use a Day Attack will message me the name of their ability in the DM as well as their target, just like a regular ability. I will RNG it and see the result. The person who used the Day Attack as well as the target will get no feedback afterwards, unless one of them ends up dead. Misses, Protection, One-Shot Immunities, all those will give a no result feedback.

The only target Day Attacks may not go for is the King. Everyone else is fair game.

[/quote]

### Journals
Message me your entire journal, putting it in [quote] 
The last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed

### To Join
To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want

### Questions
You may ask as many questions as you want in your class card PM only.
Questions asked in the thread will not be answered and instead, ignored.

<p>I mean, from my PoV it was unwinnable for town and I was right.</p>
<p>You are right that it’s considered throwing to ask for covnersion. Tho putting scum in situation where converting you is most beneficial is technicly not.</p>
<p>Still shouldn’t have done it.</p>
<p>There was already discussion about it on scum chat, ask to be added if you want to read it.</p>
