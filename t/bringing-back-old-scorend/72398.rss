    <description># Scorned ##
**Neutral Special** 

&gt; Passives:
&gt; Target Acquired - At the beginning of the game you will be assigned 3 targets.
&gt; 
&gt; Resolve - immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to death at night once, but this is lost when you achieve your objective.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day Abilities:**
&gt; TB - Same as normal
&gt;  Configure - If the target player is executed(doesn&#39;t have to be a target) today they will appear as the chosen class, must be used before the player is  on the stand.( 2 or 1)
&gt; 
&gt; ^Since you know your target&#39;s classes this could be used to confuse bd into believing they must be evil similar to the way possessor&#39;s &quot;facelift&quot; is used. This ability was basically useless at night as you didn&#39;t know who would be exed tomorrow as they are most likely jailed and killed by prince, this maybe a bit op so I might make the uses only 1. But if used incorrectly say for instance they claimed princess and then they showed up as sheriff that would look sus and immediately tell bd something is up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Night Abilities**
&gt;  Deceit - Give a target incorrect feedback on their ability. (2 uses)
&gt; (could possibly make it disable the ability all together)
&gt;  ^Could be used to fool bd like for instance they might claim successfully occupying 12 even though 12 is prince or something along those lines, but be careful using this ability too early
&gt;  could raise suspicion that there might be a scorned, basically disabling your chances on getting them executed, but using it too late on a class that might be confirmed maybe even more impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Frame - Make a target appear suspicious to investigative classes, and to all scouts on them.(3 uses)
&gt; 
&gt;  ^Basically looks like unseen visited the target if scout is on the framed player.


**Targets** - Any Class that is neither unique or not bd.
**GOAL** - Kill at least 1 of your targets before the end of the game.</description>

            <p>It should still be renamed though so it isn’t confusing.  Different abilities/passives should not have the same name</p>

            <p>Scorned is almost fine now, the only changes it needs are changing frame so it causes all visitors to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities and changing trickery to a day ability and renaming it to “Shroud”(Fool already has a passive called trickery).  And maybe giving it mind warp as a secondary night ability</p>
