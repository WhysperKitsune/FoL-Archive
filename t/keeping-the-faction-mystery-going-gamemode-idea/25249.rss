    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/keeping-the-faction-mystery-going-gamemode-idea/25249</link>
    <description>Here is a gamemode where it is harder to figure out which faction it is:

1: Cult leader inflicts poison like the assassin

2: If a Cult or Unseen dies they pop up as &quot;Conspirator&quot; Regardless of faction or class - Credit to Norm for this idea

3: Sheriff and Paladin both get reworks listed below. They would both now appear in unseen or cult.

4: Evil king would always show as red

Paladin rework: BD Support
Passive: Zeal - Occupy immune

Day ability: Charge - Smite and Pray will bypass night immunity tomorrow and will kill attackers as well (does not save the target from the kill)(2 uses)

Night ability 1: Smite - The target is convert immune and immune to negative effects other than killing tonight. You will attack anyone trying to convert the target. Does NOT pierce night immunity. (basically a buffed old CW barrier) (Unlimited)
Night ability 2: Pray- Give yourself convert immunity tonight. You will kill anyone trying to convert you (2 uses)

Sheriff rework: BD investigative 

Day ability: Scout - same as now (Unlimited)

Night ability 1: Expert Investigation - Check to see if your target is a Conspirator (Unlimited)
Night ability 2: Inspect - Privately reveal what class killed the target. You will learn the class of the target if it was hidden before. (can only target dead) (Unlimited)

Templar - Unseen Support (Converted Paladin)
Passive: Zeal - Occupy immune

Night ability 1: Preach - Give the unseen immunity to negative effects INCLUDING kills. (3 uses)
Night ability 2: Extort - Remove all passives from the target until after the end of next night. (2 use)</description>

            <p>Basically Paladin is:</p>
<p>More likely to kill a CL than MM BUT:</p>
<p>If charging can kill the assassin OR the MM</p>
<p>This is balanced because losing the MM is devastating.</p>

            <p>The only problem with brotherhood is it’s reliance on the mechanic of a single faction finder, which was changed before</p>

            <p>I know. That is why I put the charge ability in there.</p>
<p>btw I suggest either adding the brotherhood or the cabal as the third faction</p>

            <p>the paladin is significantly less useful in MM games is the problem. Maybe they could larn the MM’s identity if it is after n4?</p>

            <p>It would add some more strategy to cult/unseen:</p>
<p>Cult: Do I kill night one so it looks like unseen game?<br>
Unseen: Do we not kill night one to cast suspicion on those occupied and make people think it is cult game?</p>
<p>because of how different each faction’s killings are, though, it would be best if some hybrid fourth faction came along for this mystery stuff</p>
