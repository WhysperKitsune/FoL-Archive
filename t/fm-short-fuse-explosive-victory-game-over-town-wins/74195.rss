    <description># Short Fuse

## This could either go really well or really shit, but it&#39;s one of my games so that&#39;s a given

### Setup
12 Town
4 Mafia

Mafia requires parity to win rather than the total obliteration of the town faction

Nightless
Mafia have a factional chat but do not have a factional kill
Days are 48 hours long
Lynches happen through either majority or plurality
You cannot vote for a nolynch

### Game Gimmick
Each player has a bomb strapped to them, the bombs can only be disarmed when 1 faction wins.

At the beginning of the game, each player is publicly given a detonator.

At any point, you may type **/detonate** in the game thread to kill the player whose detonator you hold.

When a player dies for any reason (detonation or lynch), the detonator they hold is given to the player who holds their detonator, so if A can kill B and B can kill C, if B dies, A then has the detonator to kill C.

A player may detonate a maximum of one player per day.

Before the game starts, the Mafia must tell me if they want a Town detonator, a Mafia detonator, or for it to be random. A maximum of 3 Mafia detonators can be taken.

Once the player who has your detonator types **/detonate**, you can no longer detonate anyone, this rule is just a safety net if someone is detonated when I am asleep.

## Note: Be sure to read every message I send in big text as these include important game announcements, though really you should read every post but idk how long this game is going to be

### Signups (A --&gt; B symbolises that A holds the detonator for B
