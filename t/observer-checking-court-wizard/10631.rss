    <description>#### What happened?
Was Obs, checked CW in cult game, showed no visit/vistor, but he actually warded 11.  I accused and we lost the game.  Thought it was Apostle, but Cult had no Apostle

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I assume it was supposed to show he visited 11
#### Steps to reproduce:
Observer follow a CW who wards someone?

#### Comments:
Either that or somehow CW doesn&#39;t count as visit, but I&#39;m fairly sure it does cause I&#39;ve nailed them with an empowered eradicate at least once I think.</description>
