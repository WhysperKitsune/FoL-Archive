    <title>The Count (Neutral/Social, but counts as a NK)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-count-neutral-social-but-counts-as-a-nk/25088</link>
    <description>Even though this is a &quot;neutral social&quot; class, &quot;The Count&quot; counts as a neutral killer for the game purposes (so there wont be another neutral killer along with this class), but he appears as social/support to princess checks. 
This is basically a scorned on steroids with a harder win condition, a neutral killer that doesn&#39;t kill anyone directly and instead deceives people into killing themselves on trial.

&gt;**The Count**
&gt;Neutral, Social.
&gt;**Win Condition**
&gt;Defeat the BD, Unseen/Cult and anyone who opposes you.
&gt;**Passive 1: Royal Connections**
&gt;You can step up for king as if you had royal blood. Your votes for execution will count as two. (No one will be notified about it.)
&gt;**Passive 2: Resolve**
&gt;Immune to death and occupation at night. You will appear as BD to investigative roles and your occupation immunity is hidden.
&gt;**Day Ability 1: Triple Trollbox**
&gt;Trollbox a target, can be used up to three times a day. Unlimited uses.
&gt;**Day Ability 2: Decide fate**
&gt;Decide the fate of a player. It will appear as if the King or a mercenary did it. Cannot be used on the king. You can use this ability while you are on trial to force pardon yourself. 1 use. 
&gt;**Night Ability 1: Sow Discord**
&gt;Make a player appear suspicious to investigative results tonight. If that player is executed on trial tomorrow, the first person to accuse them (besides the Count) will die of guilt the next night. Unlimited uses.
&gt;**Night ability 2: Political Backlash**
&gt;Select two players. Anyone trying to accuse the first player will instead accuse the second one. Can target yourself. 2 uses.

**Note:** If the Count steps up for king he will turn into a Psycho King, since he is technically a Neutral Killer.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Changed some stuff again. Count can no longer kill anyone directly unless he steps up and becomes a Psycho King. Also, sow discord now kills people the next night instead of immediately, otherwise it makes it obvious there is a Count in the game.<br>
Also changed political backlash and re-added “Decide Fate” as a second day ability.</p>

            <p>For Neutral classes or the King, where they are necessarily their only ally, I feel that 4 abilities and 2 passives is perfectly fine.</p>

            <p>Changed class’ name to “The count” and gave him royal blood. Also added “Coup” as a second night ability and moved political backlash to a day ability.<br>
The idea here is to make a class that can use court to his advantage, and step up as a Psycho King if he wants more killing power outside of the court.<br>
Coup should also make people suspicious of the King being evil or allow evil king to be more reckless since he can pretend the count is the one that killed his target at night.</p>

<p>Also maybe a name like the Tyrant or the Count, someone going for the crown, would make more sense for this sort of class.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I changed the way some of the Baron abilities work, please give me your thoughts or tell me if you liked the old version of the Baron better.<br>
The changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed “Plot Twist” for “Political Backlash”.</li>
<li>Changed “Sow Discord” so it only frames a single target rather than two.</li>
<li>Changed “Royal Connections” to make his votes count as three, rather than two.</li>
<li>Added “The Baron appears as BD to investigative results” to his “Resolve” Passive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand the Baron’s voting power is really powerful with “Political Backlash” and his triple votes for execute, especially later in the game but I believe it balances out with the fact that he cannot directly kill people unlike any other Neutral Killers.<br>
Also, I’m wondering whether to keep or take away his occupy immunity, please give me your thoughts about it.</p>

<p>It looks really good and really interesting. I like the way the Baron is intended to play the game.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I changed the ability so the Baron can target any player with plot twist. I think that could make it harder to find the baron while still working on himself whenever he wants to avoid being voted. It could also help cause chaos in court when there is a confirmed evil role that they are trying to vote for.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Day Ability 2: Fate decided<br>
Force an execution, it would appear as if the King forced it. 1 use.</p>
<p>The king can say “I dont used it” and you are exposed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think its fine if people know there is a Baron in the game, Baron is already hard to find since he doesn’t kill at night and he appears as social/support. Also, its the same as with other NK, you can know its a poss game as soon as some one claims “I was possessed”, or a reaper game when you see the logs of someone not including the previous night.<br>
Also, an evil king can use this to his advantage, he can force exe a BD claim and say that “it was the baron”, which would make BD more wary of kings claiming it was the baron.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive 1: Royal Connections<br>
Your votes for execution count as two. No one will be notified about it.</p>
<p>3 pardons, 3 exe, and the dude is dead, you get exposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as above, although the game doesn’t notify you of this so even if it reveals there is a baron, you don’t know who he is exactly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 1: Sow Discord<br>
Select two players. Both will appear suspicious to investigative results. If any of them is executed on trial &gt;tomorrow, the first person to accuse them will die. Infinite uses.</p>
<p>How does he die? like the Hunter passive? or at night?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hunter passive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night ability 2: Plot twist<br>
Anyone who tries to accuse you tomorrow will instead vote for themselves. They cannot rescind or change &gt;their votes. 2 uses.</p>
<p>“I just voted myself” Exposed again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one does out you, but it is intended as a late game tool to turn the tables, lets say you need 3 votes to put someone on trial, king uses finger on you, and now he has two votes. You vote him and now he is on trial, and with your “Royal Connections” passive you can easily execute him. This can also help as a self defense when everyone knows who you are and you just want to buy yourself more time, since it basically prevents people from voting you.</p>
