    <description>#Alright listen up all you wannabe class creators, I&#39;m about to give your ass, and various other parts of your anatomy, a crash course in class design
#Warning, some of the terminology I use here may be new to you, these terms are in no way official, but I will be using them, so get used to &#39;em, I&#39;ll be marking special terms in *italics*

#Step 1: [color=red]Im[/color][color=orange]ag[/color][color=yellow]in[/color][color=green]at[/color][color=blue]io[/color][color=purple]n![/color]
The one thing you need before you set out to create a class is an idea, a core theme to base your class around
Every Single Class has a *core theme* expressed in their abilities
Some classes, such as the Possessor, have their *core theme* in one of their night abilities, and the rest of their abilities support that(The Possessor&#39;s *core theme* is the **Possess** Night Ability)
Some classes, such as the Princess, have their *core theme* in more broad strokes, but it is still visible(The Princess&#39; *core theme* is a versatile class that can be, in one way or another, useful in most situations)
Some classes, such as the Reaper, have their *core theme* in special mechanics, and their abilities are generally built around those mechanics(The Reaper&#39;s *core theme* is the Souls mechanic)
A lot of classes also have abilities that do not tie to the *core theme*, but are there to give the class an extra bit of power

**So yeah, the first thing you need is a core theme**

#Step 2: Spooky Scary Skeletons
The next thing you need to do is come up with a *class skeleton*, now don&#39;t get scared, there&#39;s no nightmares here, a *class skeleton* is a rough outline of what the class needs to do, and how it does that, a *class skeleton* should be built around your core theme

**Here&#39;s some tips for your *class skeleton*:**
1. Neutral Killers should generally only win with themselves and surviving neutrals(e.g. Alchemist)
2. Main abilities should try not to copy the main ability of another class too much, it&#39;s okay to do it a bit, but don&#39;t copy too much
3. Keep to your class type, don&#39;t go giving your Investigators a gun
4. If you&#39;re making a neutral class, make sure the abilities help you towards your win condition

#Step 3: Balancing Act
Once you&#39;ve put together your *class skeleton* it&#39;s time to flesh out the class, your class should have most of its power in the night abilities, and generally have between 2 and 4 non-passive abilities, consider running through a few hypothetical scenarios involving your class to see how it might fare in those situations

**If you&#39;re not sure how to balance your class, consider submitting your *class skeleton* and letting other people give you ideas**

#Step 4: Publish
Publish your finished class and watch as people mercilessly tear it to shreds and point out all its flaws, or watch people gush over how good it is, or perhaps something in between
