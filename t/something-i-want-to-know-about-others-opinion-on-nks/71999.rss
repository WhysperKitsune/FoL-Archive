            <p>Agreed. Reaper is very difficult to deal with because of its unique interaction with end-games.</p>
<p>With Sorc now there no such thing as an endgame for sorc wins</p>
<p>Poss is the only NK that still has a bit of trouble in the endgame, however seeing as it just got Mind Control it’s going to have a much easier time.</p>

            <p>If they refuse to buff NK’s winrates then at least they should increase the amount of gold you get from winning as one. At least that would motivate NK players more since they know that even though their chances to win are slim if they manage to do it they will get a big reward.</p>

            <p>But you’d only ever have one Mafia in a game with very few Town</p>
<p>In a setup of a majority vs a minority, the NKs are third party roles and not truly their own faction. Treating them as such for balancing purposes leads to them winning too much, which is both frustrating to play against and takes away from the importance of scumreading against a coordinated faction - the point of the game.</p>

            <p>Well that’s a statement I fundamentally disagree with.</p>
<p>3 mafia members are a faction</p>
<p>If you remove 1 it is still a faction</p>
<p>If you remove another it is STILL a faction</p>
<p>Since 1 Mafia member is identical to an SK in this context that means that an SK is a faction member of a one man faction.</p>
<p>It fits with how winconditions are set up, it fits with most balence philosophies and it fits with how SK’s work in mafiascum FM</p>

            <p>You fail to account for the fact that, on some level, the NK is not its own faction. It is a player who exists to speed up the game first, and winning should be a difficult task. Achievable yes, but not averaging its proportion with it as its own faction - it just isn’t its own faction, and shouldn’t be as likely to win.</p>

            <p>No. But at same time Open Setup Rolemadness is undeniably Town-Sided even if Mafia would have some really powerful members.<br>
If NK isn’t in hand of competent player he’s more like a obstacle rather than threat.</p>

            <p>The mere existence of nightkills in mountainous mafia shows that a single member of a minority faction is supposed to be stronger than a single member of a majority faction. This reasoning extends to an SK</p>

            <p>Yeah yeah I know how that is calculated</p>
<p>But I still think a single player should not be winning that often</p>
<p>10% is probably fine, would personally like lower but anywhere around there is ok imo</p>

            <p>The math was gotten by averaging the probability of randomly picking a faction with the probability of picking any given faction member.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<p>1: A perfectly balanced game of Forum Mafia gives town a winrate of 50% and mafia a winrate of 50%</p>
<p>2: For the same reason adding an additional faction should make all 3 factions have a 33% winrate</p>
<p>3: Losing is less satisfying than winning. Meaning that winrate should be weighed in terms of players</p>
<p>4: The best way to accommodate multiple ideals in this context is to average their results</p>
<p>5: The average of 7 and 33 (the ideal number for each system) is 20. Therefore a balenced SK that takes into account as meny variables as possible should have a winrate of 20%</p>

            <p>Try 5% to 10%</p>
<p>Why should a one-man faction win anywhere close to 3/20 games, much less one out of every 5?</p>
