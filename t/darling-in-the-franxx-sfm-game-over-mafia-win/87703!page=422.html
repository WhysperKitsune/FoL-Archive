<p>Indeed<br>
I don’t give credit to people who jump on a runaway wolf wagon. Especially considering you didn’t express a strong scumread on the guy throughout the day or contribute to it becoming a wagon in the first place<br>
You don’t lose any points, but you don’t gain any either<br>
I just dislike how you’re attempting to gain townpoints in the first place from something I’d consider not town indicative</p>

<p>If I was scum why didn’t I scum read Wiisp for the town cred? Or why didn’t I try to shift their lync? What sense does it make for me to hold other players to a lynch without grabbing town cred as you pointed out a wolf would do?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’ve been attempting to grab towncred recently by saying ‘why would i bus!’<br>
Maybe this is a case of my wording being confusing or something but I don’t really think so?<br>
You did partially scumread wisp, as you acknowledged there was a dome and said you believed Aelin’s CC<br>
Wolves either hop on the wagon there (likely towards the end, and likely werent main contributors to the wagon starting in the first place) or attempt to shift the wagon<br>
You were not a main contributor to Wisp being a wagon in the first place, and by the point you got on his wagon it was quite clear he was going over. That isn’t a pelt.</p>

<p>As to me pushing people you town read not much I can say there. The three I have pushed today are lemon who I felt looked very bad post flip, wisdom who you yourself have not voiced as any form of town read and strongly suspected yesterday (from memory), and Luk who I literally have to fight myself not to focus on in this game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I stated a weak townread on Wisdom earlier - but I’m having a hard time getting any sort of read from her slot<br>
Lukundo is simply a villager and I’ll probably just die on that hill</p>

<p>There are quite a few other players I would be focusing on if I could right now as well but I am still uncomfortable with you. Your reaction on seeing Wiisp train and leaving the thread without a vote or much of a comment (from memory) could be WIFOMed a decent bit and your reasoning and progression on me feels contrived and opertunistic.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I had a headache and I don’t lie about those things. Me leaving the thread shouldn’t be taken as alignment indicative - but my lack of care for the wagon could be, sure<br>
I was more focused on trying to milk spew from the guy as I saw there was a collective dunk-fest on him and I didn’t care much to hop on it. This is indeed all wifom, and I understand how my EoD could be construed as looking bad but I honestly dont really care<br>
My progression on you has been quite transparent in the thread (as well as the sync chat I’ve been speaking in - and that player can confirm this at any point they wish).</p>
<p>I have a very very hard time reading you as you’re a very robotic and binary player. It feels like youre a forum-mafia-playing machine, and I can’t get a grasp as to what you’re thinking because everything reads as monotone and mechanical to me<br>
So I’m working with what I know, which is results, and common wolftells</p>

<p>I guess the question I’m asking myself here is - what is scum!Helz’s overarching agenda this game? Like… scum!Helz I would think would /know/ that pushing town!Luk here is a bad idea, and yet he’s spending so much time doing it anyways.</p>

<p>I’m unsure what w!Helz would be thinking pushing v!Luk to be fair - and its giving me some pause.</p>

<p>My issue right now with you is that I keep looking at your statements to follow your line of thought and I just do not. I do not see you drawing the conclusions you do from the statements you make. I feel like you are grabbing pieces out of context and creating a narrative with them instead of actually reading into what players did in the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I could be posting more, sure<br>
but I feel like i’ve been pretty transparent with my thoughts thusfar</p>
<p>I’m struggling with the fact that I’m still not fully caught up on the thread as I’ve been extremely busy for the past few days - and everything I know is either from my very quick skim, or from what others have told me<br>
As well as the fact that I wasn’t there in realtime for 2 days to feel the things everyone else felt. I have no true emotional connection to anything that happened d1 or d2 and its a matter of me trying to imagine what the thread was like during those times. Trying to feel the hectic energy, or the concern, or the paranoia<br>
And it really doesnt help matters that i dont freakin know what the hell my predecessor was doing and i disagree with like… all of her reads. I’d usually use that as a basis to determine what the flow of the thread was like but I can’t</p>

<p>Thoughts on the PoE</p>
<p><strong>min</strong> - Wind is supremely confident in her read here and I’m very tempted to just sheep it. I think min today has been tonally pure as hell, and I think their d1 opener was comfortable, and reaction to the baseless wagon on them was fair. Progression on Wisdom is ~fine. Kinda doubt the two are w/w based off of how they are somewhat shading eachother for either the target selection or the lack of target selection. w!min doesn’t have reason to go back on their scumread on LHF!Wisdom, and could very well push for her ML. Min can go above the line actually tbh. My only reason min is in the PoE is because I townread people above it more, but I still think theres enough there to pull them out</p>
<p><strong>Zone</strong> - No thoughts, head empty. I’ve honestly been unintentionally avoiding reading Zone because his posts always make my head want to explode. He’s been in what I’d consider his townmeta, and people I townread are townreading him. He’s in my personal nullzone but if I were to sheep others I’d plop him above the line</p>
<p><strong>Lemonfairy</strong> - Tempted to believe their townslip yesterday regarding not knowing Derps was the claimed 3rd mason. Has been tonally comfortable and fine, and reaction to Proph’s case - the OMGUS - felt pure. A little weh by how they’ve been playing the day as it feels a little lacking, and I don’t have very strong reasons to townread them outside of tone. A bit concerned by how easily they throw around townreads - and how they walk back on their reasonings when questioned about it. Scared of this being a ML in the making so trying to keep a close eye on her. Overall pretty see-saw on her alignment and I could see her going either way.</p>
<p><strong>Nika</strong> - God she’s so damn pure - and she’s derped about 500 times. She asked to not be read off of those so I’m respecting it (even though internally its very hard not to!!), and my only major qualm comes with her claim not making much sense to me. I really really want to put her above the line because her attempts at solving the game feel real. I’m a little weh about how she’s been wanting to resolve Blitz for 10 years but I think her progression on the slot, and considering other people’s reads there, including how spew looks for him, is good? Mmhh… she can go above the line</p>
<p><strong>Helz</strong> - I’ve talked in detail recently about how I feel regarding this slot. I’m having the hardest time in the world figuring him out, and I simply am nowhere near comfortable townreading this guy. The point I’d say is in his favor are how yesterday I felt there was a genuine attempt to figure my slot out - and I’m unsure exactly what his overall gameplan is as a wolf. I do wonder why he wouldn’t use his position in the thread, and loud voice, to push for an Aelin elimination before Wisp went over, just for that one extra villager elim - but at a point it was pretty clear Wisp was just dead no matter what</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong> - Wisdom, wisdom, wisdom. How in the goddamn hell do I sort you lol. My gut <em>screams</em> LHF, and I really do want to be careful with her like I am with Lemonfairy, but some things jut truly don’t sit right with me. I happen to be both scumreading her and townreading her for different aspects of the same event which… is ugh. I don’t know what I believe more. I think her piggybacking off of my vote onto Aelin was gross and opportunistic, yet it’s almost the opposite of what I expect a wolf to do there, as it was quite clear Wisp was trying to go UTR and avoid the dome entirely. Shes very clearly disconnected from the thread, which my brain wants to call villagery (ignore that Wisp was disconnected too ayaya thx) but her reasonings for reads feel very flimsy and thin and its hard to get a grasp on what she’s thinking. I want her (and <a class="mention" href="../../u/min.html">@min</a>) to expand upon what was talked about in the sync chat - paraphrased, or course. I just want a better understanding of her thought process and I feel like I can sort her better.</p>
<p><strong>Whysper</strong> - Ugh. I almost feel bad scumreading Whysper because she’s one of the nicest people on this planet, and also because she subbed into a slot that I heavily disliked, and it feels ‘unfair’ to dunk on someone who hasnt had a chance to get into the swing of things. Guillo’s treatment of Wind yesterday was horrible. I really really really disliked it. I also disliked how he was ‘tunneled’ on my slot, and never gave any true attempts to read or sort me. It felt like an excuse to continue pushing me. His claim was BS, and I don’t know what the hell to think about it. I thought he had heacy partner equity with Wisp if not for the claim being retracted, due to the fact that he was pushing hard for us to eliminate in the PRs but never really pushing for Wisp to die - even though there was a very clear dichotomy between the two of them, as their claims contradicted. Wisp was pretty rude to the guy which is &gt;rand to be nonpartned though. Whysper’s vote at EoD really pinged me as an attempt to save Wisp. Not sure how comfortable I am voting for elim here today, because I really do want to give Whysper a chance to do things, and I think I might be able to read her? (I want to add that this is my wolf KP read. I have a weird streak of calling out wolf KP correctly recently and this is where I’m feeling it is).</p>

<p>You’ve been attempting to grab towncred recently by saying ‘why would i bus!’</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do not feel like it’s fair to call it ‘grabbing town cred.’ When someone scum reads you for something and you point out how irrational that behavior would be as scum; it’s simply defending against bad reasoning. I also take note that your basically acknowledging the logic and invalidating it at the same time. I am getting less comfortable with you.</p>
<p>I have thought about it a bit and something that struck me of note is how blitz was very softly the counter wagon to Wiisp. (From my memory) Wiisp and Zone were talking about a Blitz shift which makes me a bit more comfortable with Blitz.</p>

<p>I see my vote as just an extension of my voice. I have gotten into it with other players in the past on this issue but I feel that pressure can be applied just as effectively by voicing a willingness to lynch.</p>

</aside>
<p>“Wanting to lynch someone” and “actually lynching someone by voting them” are two separate things.<br>
I know that not everyone share the same opinion as mine, but I truly believe: If you want someone dead, then vote them FFS.</p>
