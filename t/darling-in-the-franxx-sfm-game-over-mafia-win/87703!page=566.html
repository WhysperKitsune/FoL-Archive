<p>legit if someone could at least give me a tl;dr before i prob die will be nice</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>been thinkin on this for a while<br>
ngl i dont even know how to give a tl;dr of this game but uhhh</p>
<p>d1- shitshow with no organization.<br>
Silviu was wagoned pretty early, and marl ended up claiming to be his mason.<br>
That wagon dissipated, and things were stale for a while, then wagons on PokemonKidRyan (PKR) and Kaif started up later into the day.<br>
At EoD, Aelin/Luk attempt a CFD onto Wisp (wolf), but it doesnt fully take off (Aelin got cold feet, and Blitz moved alongside Aelin onto PKR).</p>
<p>d2 - Marl dies overnight. Very likely killed by Wisp, who had a strongman modifier that night. (This doesn’t particularly matter, but i dont think wolves cared to doc dodge bc of it)<br>
Wisp hardshields Kaif, believing him to be the 3rd mason.<br>
Aelin outs the fact that she was in a neighborhood with Wisp, and posts a wallpost on why wisp is wolfy af. People go all ‘yeah wisp kinda wolfy bro!’ but wisp doesnt die on d2. Someone (your slot, i think?) makes a case on Blitz and Blitz becomes the runaway top wagon. (Also, Wisp claimed town babysitter)<br>
Turns out the thread locked/closed like… an hour earlier than EoD was supposed to be, so Blitz didn’t actually get elim’d. People start moving wagons - to Mercenary, mainly. Tilga ends up voting Wind, and people reeeeally didnt like that, so a wagon on Tilga started up.<br>
Wagons become tied between Mercenary and Tilga, and the tie gets broken by Zone (i think?) - killing Tilga.</p>
<p>d3 - Kaif dies overnight. I’m pretty sure this death is because wolves believed him to be the 3rd mason, and the other outted mason (Silviu) is a relatively new player, who Helz was trying to manipulate.<br>
I don’t really know what happened at the beginning of day 3 ngl. But uhhhh<br>
I subbed in about a quarter of the way through the day, I think. At this point in the day, Wind has turned around on Helz and is calling him out for using her to push agenda. Helz gets pushed and shoved from a few angles. Wagons never really soldify during the day, and people poke around to see what sticks. I think the top wagons were like… 3 or 4 votes on each of me, Blitz, and Guillo.<br>
Turns out Wisp claimed a different Role # than he really was, so Aelin called him out for this. Nothing really happens regarding this for a while, and people mostly just acknowledge it but brush it to the side, but eventually Aelin forces a thunderdome and insists that everyone votes between the two of them. Wisp ends up flipping at EoD.</p>
<p>d4 - Silviu dies overnight. At this point, Derps was outted as the 3rd mason, but he didn’t die overnight. (I personally think it was a semi-doc dodge, as well as the fact that Derps was tunneling on Wind hardcore).<br>
I don’t remember half of d4 tbh. A lot of the day was Me+Luk+Wind stomping on Helz. The wagon on him didn’t fully form until closer to EoD though.</p>
<p>d5 - Derps dies overnight. Last masonboi dead.<br>
This day was preflip central. Nearly everyone (except for Luk) was sold on the fact that Whysper (replaced in for Guillo) was a wolf, and a lot of solving revolved around her flipping red. There was some pressure applied to Lemon and Zone - most notably by Wind and Whysper. Zone was suuper aggressive during this day, and also tried to get a wagon going on <em>himself</em> . Whysper ended up dying and flipping green, and everyone is sadge.</p>
<p>I’m missing a LOT of things in this tldr - and my memory sucks for whatever reason - but here you go.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>d6 - Wind dies overnight. Along with this, theres an announcement that a traitor exists in the game. We all agree to continue looking for packwolves and hopefully the traitor will die in the process (and if not, we switch mindsets down the line)<br>
The thread immediately focuses in on lemonfairy, who was getting flak from both Whysper and Wind the day before. Proph comes into the thread with a vote on smallworldz and requests more people look into the slot. Small spends the day trying to convince everyone that wagons are v/v - but none of us took the bait. We swung from lemon being top wagon, to small being top wagon, to both wagons being tied - at one point zone is wagoned because he literally asks for one - but we eventually consolidate on a lemon elim, and she flips traitor. Feelsgoodman</p>
<p>d7 - Merc dies overnight. Definitely not the expected nightkill, as shes been very disconnected from the thread and mostly just sheeping my votes (love you merc) but i’ve been advocating for her being a villager for 10 years, and she was pretty much just spewed V from Helz’s interactions. So its not like she’d be an easy ML (if a ML at all) - but i definitely expected one of me/proph/aelin to die lol<br>
Anyways, today we’re focused on finding villagers and keeping the last wolf in the b o x. If KP remains consistent then we have 2 MLs, and want a solid PoE of 3, with a towncore that contains zero wolves. Thats the priority</p>

          <p>Mechanics in place</p>
<ul>
<li>Town abilities were based around Masons syncing players. All 3 of our Masons are dead but the pairs they setup are still alive and can use their powers.</li>
<li>The current remaining pairs are Chloe-Aelin who have a detrimental ability in which they are forced to voteback anyone who votes them. Wisdom-Aelin have a protective ability. Blitz-Merc and Zone/Marshal-Wisdom were pairs but our partners died. Proph hasn’t gotten a chance to be paired</li>
<li>Based on info from Lemons flip, there is likely only 1 scum left.</li>
<li>Me and Wisdoms ability previously failed twice which brings about the chance that last scum has a blocking based power.</li>
<li>Sirdeprsalot( a mason) was removed from the mason chat on a previous day while alive and the reason for that is currently uknown.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that’s all there is for mechanics at the moment</p>

<li>The current remaining pairs are Chloe-Aelin who have a detrimental ability in which they are forced to voteback anyone who votes them. Wisdom-min have a protective ability. Blitz-Merc and Zone/Marshal-Wind were pairs but our partners died. Proph hasn’t gotten a chance to be paired</li>
<li>Based on info from Lemons flip, there is likely only 1 scum left.</li>
