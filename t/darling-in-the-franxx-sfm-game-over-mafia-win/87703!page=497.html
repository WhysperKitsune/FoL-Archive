          <p>Just adding onto this, Helz cased Nightingale (Wisdom slot) towards the late end of Day 1 in a way that did not read like w/w distancing. Felt very much like Helz was trying to shade Nightingale’s (slightly unorthodox?) playstyle</p>
<p>Will go into this in more detail when I finish up my post on Helz interactions, but I’d be really surprised if Wisdom is scum here.</p>

<p>Slightly disagree on spewing Lemon clear. He plopped his vote on her as “self-pres” when she was barely a wagon yesterDay, and I read it as antispew. I also think specifically because he didn’t point out anything memorable from Lemonfairy, he legitimately could have been saying he didn’t find his own teammate to be towny.</p>

<p>Fair, yeah I poked around in his ISO a little more and he kinda did the full 180 wrt his read on Lemon so I’ll keep reading more before coming to any solid conclusions.</p>
<p>I wanted to give Lemon a little more time/space to work around Today after I kinda held their feet to the fire a bit Yesterday, hence why I haven’t been really poking or prodding at them much (plus I already have a hefty to-do list when it comes to this game).</p>

          <p>Thanks Chloe for the wallpost on me.</p>
<p>Yeah I didn’t really know anyone in this game other than Wisp, so I just tried to solve and work through things my own way and it… appears to be working out decently. Usually my first times on new sites end up a lot more disastrously lmao.</p>
<p>I want to go through Helz interactions before I come to any sort of conclusion on Blitz. He’s in my head as like “probably town due to being on the Wisp CFD” but his vote on Wisdom certainly raised my eyebrows. (Blitz uses he/him right?)</p>

<p>Hunting for 3p or speculating on 3p existence is entirely a waste of time, and wolves <em>thrive</em> on 3p discussion as they can fit in easily and contribute to the ‘hunt’ while taking pressure off of their buddies - and its also an excuse to put suspicion on widely townread people for ~zero reason</p>
<p>I have no dang clue if 3p/LW exists in this setup, and that should be our final priority. If the game hasn’t ended with 2/3 more wolf flips then we shift mindsets. But until then, we should be looking for a pack and stop speculating on unknowns</p>

<p>This, this, this.</p>
<p>(Funny anecdote wrt this: Was playing in a complex setup with Askthepizzaguy, famous mod/player on MU. He looked super townie for most of the game because all he did was post walls, but around the mid-game he started saying that we needed to hunt the (mod-confirmed existence of) neutral because it was gonna be a huge problem for the town. We all bought it and his wolf team cruised to an easy victory)</p>

<p>Helz interactions.</p>
<p>This forum doesn’t have a table function so I can’t really do a nitty gritty chart but I should still be able to evaluate the interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guillotina play makes me want to say ‘Jester.’ It does not make much sense as either a town or a team scum play to me and he seems to be going out of his way to draw attention and keep his interactions with others negative. The oppositional defiant retorts to being asked questions could be a personality trait though.</p>
<p>I kinda like Min. Pushing anti-LHF on tiger with consistent reasoning felt like a pretty chill towny move.</p>
<p>Zone also seems to be consistent in his mindset and his presented level of confidence appears to match his reasoning. I feel that he may be a slightly stronger player though so that is not to say that would be out of his scope as a player as a wolf.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts : )</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As Chloe has been saying, hate hate hate how he dismisses Guill’s play as jester-like. Perfect storm of distancing/making it so that you don’t have to fake a read on your buddy.</p>
<p>The min read feels like he has TMI that min is town, so it’s a good look for min.</p>
<p>The Zone read is a little weird because he is essentially fence sitting on him/giving himself an escape hatch to scum read Zone in the future, by saying that Zone could have a good wolfgame. So not exactly sure how to evaluate this, here.</p>
<p>He also kind of ties Tilg with Wisp or Zone, but I’m not reading too much into that because Tilg mentioned Zone and Wisp themselves.</p>

<p>Btw. I really think it could be useful for people to talk about what they think the scum setup is.<br>
2 mafia teams?<br>
1+ neutral(s)?<br>
Just 1 Team?<br>
How many scum total?</p>
<p>These sorts of questions will be uncomfortable for scum to answer and getting some consensus can greatly influence how the town handles situations in the mid/late game. They also have very strong implications on how we should scum hunt.</p>

<p>I am half ass set up now and there is a few things worth mentioning:</p>
<p>I am not comfortable with the fact LemonFairy has 50+ posts but when I tried to think of something about that slot but basically drew a blank. With that many posts I should have some kind of anything to think of which makes me feel like they could just be actively blending and farming posts so they do not get called out as lurking. For real… Just skim their Iso and consider how much content they have provided.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This kinda makes me think Lemon/Helz are not aligned?</p>
<p>Like, why would Helz just pick off/shade a buddy like this? I have a feeling that if Helz is scum with Lemon then he is… just kinda content to let her do her thing, and not post something like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So your entire reason for town reading her was that you thought she was a novice?</p>
<p>I am not gona lie, you really pinged me with that read. I very genuinely do not see how you could draw a ‘town’ conclusion in good faith off the top of my head. ‘Not scummy’ sure. But town…</p>
<p>I think you just got caught with your hand in the cookie jar and realized you took an untenable stance. There is the question of why, but I do not think you really had reasoning that ever justified a read of Erika as town.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And yeah, this entire post makes it kind of unlikely that he’s scum with Mercenary. Don’t think Helz ever takes an issue with how one of his scumbuddies is reading a certain player like this; it strongly reads as though he is trying to shade/incriminate Merc here.</p>

<p>That does make sense to me but I still question handing out town cred on that one fact without looking at their overall posts. There is… just not much to go on there. I guess I could see a very soft town lean but that does not feel how you presented your read of them. It was worded like a flat town read (from memory)</p>

<p>I am not sure what you mean with the Anon bit.</p>
<p>I suspect you because you voiced a town read on a slot I did not see possible to be town read and used that to leverage a scum read on me. That felt bad in more ways than one.</p>
<p>I also do not like that you dropped your push on me as soon as I pushed back on you. Even your comment here seems more focused on how I read you than anything about what my alignment is. This also feels bad to me especially when its out of line with your voiced reads earlier suggesting you thought I was town. The evolution of your reads given your reasoning appears to be from some posts at the very start of the game feels bad to me.</p>
<p>So ^ Reasons I suspect you although I do need to take more time to consider and actually dig through things.</p>

<p>This is not accurate. I took issue with the CFD because it was sprung minutes from EOD in a way that purposefully eliminated the potential for discussion. I take issue with that in general but I also see that as scummy as fuck. If you think someone should be lynched the thing to do is talk about it and allow the rest of players time to make an informed decision on the matter. Waiting to blitz a player at the last second is not in line with ‘sorting their alignment.’ Its a naked attempt to kill them. I take very strong issue with this type of behavior and I do feel that its AI for Luk.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here he chainsaws Luk for being a part of the Wisp CFD. Couple this with how he treats Luk D2/D3 and this is the evidence that makes Luk pretty close to confirmed town.</p>

They were pushed all over the place early on and made a lynchbait gambit that makes no sense for scum to pull. I find myself agreeing with both their thoughts and their direction and they seemed to TR Marl D1 and then triangulate off him to some extent. I could ramble about it more but I do town read this slot about as strongly as I could for a D1 read.</p>

One thing that bothers me with this slot is they say they read everything and iso players but there is a big lack of positions taken. Going through their ISO to figure out who they TR and SR gives me very little in spite of having 80 posts D1. <a class="mention" href="../../u/blitz.html">@Blitz</a>- Can you clarify what you think of more players than just Pokemon and Wiisp?<br>
I think everyone that skims his iso will find this same issue and it is a bit alarming.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now yeah, I can see this being sort of a w/w interaction? The thing that’s concerning to me is how much it reads like Helz is throwing a lifeline to a struggling scum buddy to give them chances to re-engage with the thread.</p>
<p>Ehh.</p>
<p>Actually now that I read the post again I’m not so sure about that since Blitz literally said that they were “struggling to jump in”. I do feel like Helz would have shaded this slot a little more if Blitz were v but that’s like the thinnest of reads. So yeah, I thought this post was potentially indicative of Blitz scum but now I’m not so sure.</p>

I feel better about this slot going back through them. They have a higher position to post count density and I can follow their reasoning.

Overall I would slightly town lean this slot and am a bit critical of the consensus view of them.</p>

I would like to see more out of this player. I liked that they do not seem to give any fucks about faking a read to appease anyone.

This may be a good slot for people to push for activity.</p>

<p>Pretty sure Chloe is never w/w with how she interacted with Helz but just wanted to point out the language involved here.</p>
<p>The way Helz worded it like “this may be a good slot for people to push for activity” - he used extremely passive language to pressure Erika here, like he didn’t want to get involved in the actual pressuring of Erika. I don’t think he does this to one of his buddies.</p>

<p>Zone- Town lean<br>
I really like them for a few reasons. They stick to opinions that are not popular such as in 1048 advocating for policy lynches as town against Guill voicing how its used as a scum tool. This is shameless and feels like the ‘I have nothing to hide and do not give a shit’ attitude I get as town. I do dislike the CFD passion but that is a play style thing but something I picked up on is that they are very specifically tracking others reads and call out when a read changes in line with reasoning. I do not know how experienced Zone is as a player but this is a behavior that pings me as townie unless they recognize its faked value and I do not believe that is the case here. I genuinely question why this slot has taken the pressure it has and feel like this is a pretty transparent town from their D1 play.</p>

Their push to draw attention to Erika looked decent and many of their posts are questioning the reasoning on trains or pokeing people for their reads. This is another player I do not understand why there was a push on them and just see some vague guttread justification. I particularly liked 2089 where they were digging into the thought process behind the development of a read which I feel reflects some honest scum hunting and analysis.</p>

<p>Lots of original points and very openly communicating his reads with reasoning behind them. His push to CFD Wiisp EOD1 felt really bad. It seemed like he was literally waiting for the clock to run down to push the case on Wiisp so there would be no time for conversation and he could get the lynch off. If it was D2+ I could see an alignment cop or something doing this but it was D1 and that was scummy as fuck in my book. Maybe some site-meta difference seeing as how interaction based and CFD friendly this site is but this really pinged me and I see as opportunistic and easily a scum motivated move.</p>

<p>I totally understand the purpose of a CFD. Its a great idea to shift when all the active trains are bad.</p>

<p>With Wiisp in particular I view him as a strong player. I really feel that there is potential scum looked at him and said ‘We can’t get this guy lynched by making a case so lets CFD him!’ or something. The same that people push against policy lynches as a tool for scum to push a lynch without thought I feel it can be said about CFD’s in general and very specifically Wiisp’s CFD.</p>

<p>I assume this is some sort of distancing based on Whysper replacing in plus him going all panic mode on Day 3?</p>
<p>Not going to be really looking at Day 4 I think; I’m pretty lazy so I don’t want to go through the last 100 or so posts of his ISO, and I have a suspicion that Helz went into antispew pretty early on into Day 4.</p>
<hr>
<p>For conclusions… honestly they kinda just strengthen my current read on the gamestate rather than change it up drastically. Chloe, Wind, Lukundo, Wisdom basically spewed town. min is weird because… a couple of posts he was talking to them felt like he was trying to convince min to join him on Lukundo, but those interactions are less clear than the others. Merc is also very likely town due to the stuff on Day 1 but he kinda shifted focus off of her after Day 1.</p>
<p>Honestly makes me even more sure of the (Lemon/Blitz/Whysper/Zone/Nika) because he townread all of those slots at various points, so yeah. Was hoping for something a little more definitive but instead it’s just… hopefully confirmation that we’re on the right track?</p>

<p>Tbh ii reallly dont like this list</p>
<p>legit it feels like 1 one luk,zone,proph is scum from that list-mostly cause of how shoehorned it feels</p>
<p>still reading up and its also bedtime here so gn to y’all~<br>
i’d say luk here is scum but i still have to do some ISOing and reading up</p>
<p>Also look at the people they didnt mention in the list or the bottom 3</p>
<p>the poe list feels more natural and based on their reads rather than spew or bus</p>

<p>At this point in the game, Wisp’s death was certain, and everything he was saying around here was a truckload of wifom<br>
I genuinely don’t find myself able to get any solid analysis out of this ‘legacy’ - as it seems to just be the reads he was repping throughout the game. I know some people believe in Rule Of Three but I put more value in <em>why</em> rather than the <em>who</em><br>
This list of players (and players outside of it) doesn’t do anything for me in itself, and I don’t really think it should be used as something conclusive regarding these players’ alignments - and its better to focus on why he put them there in the first place, and how he talked with/about them<br>
If you could give a look at his interactions with those players outside of this one post it’d be appreciated</p>

          <p>Probably not gonna do a full ISO on Zone, but more likely just skim through his posts before sleeping tonight just to get a sense of how he thinks/operates. Want to have a life outside of work and this game lmao (plus I’m getting lazy)</p>

          <p>I’d very much appreciate if people don’t hammer before EoD</p>
<p>I plan on going through all of my townreads one by one and explaining why I believe they’re clear (i’ve already done so for luk/proph/kinda wisdom)<br>
I think theres a chance I die tonight so I want to be as clear as possible regarding those reads. I don’t want wolves to have any wiggle room to drag people out of a towncore i’m rather confident in being pure<br>
but every time i start my brain tells me to procrastinate</p>
