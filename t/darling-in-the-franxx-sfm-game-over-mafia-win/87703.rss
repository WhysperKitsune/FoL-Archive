*A mafia game by:* @Osieorb18
*Cohosted by:* @EliThePsycho
*Reviewed by:* @Geyde&lt;/div&gt;

## [u]Game Info:[/u]

&gt; - This is a Closed Special Setup for 21 Players.
&gt; - I will do my best never to lie to you, and while some roles may lead to false results (such as a Miller or Godfather), as far as myself and my reviewer can tell, this setup does not contain bastard roles. The setup was created with the fun of the players in mind.
&gt; - 48 Hour Hug Deadlines, 24 Hour Night Phases.
&gt; - In addition to the general 15 substantive, on-topic, game-related posts per day phase requirement, you are required to make at least 5 such posts per 24 hours in the thread or in a nightchat. I will not necessarily check this closely but if you cannot post, contact me.
&gt; - Any phase may have a twilight or dawn for the host to have a life. Usually, phases will change around 9 AM PST (give or take an hour or two) or 12 AM PST (give or take an hour or two). Phase lengths may be altered to account for this.
&gt; - Night actions submitted within the last 4 hours of the Night phase might not be counted at host discretion and/or missing it.
&gt; - Flavourgaming and setupgaming are both meaningless, but will give me a chuckle so feel free.
&gt; - Majority and Plurality Execution are in play.
&gt; - If players choose to No-Hug or if no plurality is reached, the day phase ends in no hug.
&gt; - Factional Kills are Optional.
&gt; - At host discretion, if players choose to No-Hug, then No-Kill, then No-Hug once more, a random Town player will be eliminated.
&gt; - Players with chats can chat at any time unless their role states otherwise.
&gt; - Players must ping @Osieorb18 and @EliThePsycho when they vote if they want the hosts to notice their vote.
&gt; - Mechanics may exist which make claiming detrimental.
&gt; - Alts may be allowed at host discretion.
&gt; - You may gain and/or lose abilities over the course of the game.
&gt; - My standard Town win condition is: &quot;You win when no threats to town remain (if there are still living town).&quot;
&gt; - My standard Mafia win condition is: &quot;You win when no threats to Mafia remain or nothing can prevent this from happening.&quot; 

## [u]Rules:[/u]

&gt; - Follow all [Forum Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926).
&gt; - Communicate with a host via DM or PM if you have any questions, concerns, or if you will not be able to meet the minimum expected level of play for any reason. If you do not do so, you may be forcibly replaced or modkilled without further warning. The more you communicate, the more lenient I am likely to be.
&gt; - If you appear to knowingly and intentionally break any rule, you may be able to run but you cannot hide.
&gt; - If you damage the sanctity of the game through any means, you damage the sanctity of your position in this game and future games. You have been warned.
&gt; - Do not replace out or declare V/LA in the thread. Contact a host.
&gt; - Players may not vote for themselves.

            <h1>
<a name="post-game-thoughts-1" class="anchor" href="#post-game-thoughts-1"></a>Post-Game Thoughts</h1>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how well this game worked out! I figured that given its inherent swinginess, the game would be a stomp in one direction or another. Ended up being much closer than I anticipated.</p>
<p>Shoutout to everyone on the scumteam. As Helz mentioned, the team worked remarkably well together. (I suppose DESPITE Prophylaxis’ impulse to bus every scumbuddy he ever has…)</p>
<p>This was not really a scum sweep though. The town played very well too. I was particularly happy that in a 21 player game, out of 6 replacements, only 2 of them were not self-requested.</p>
<p>I think this game reminded me about a lot of the ups and downs of Discourse as a forum style for mafia as far as the software and communication style goes. It had its positives, but I much prefer even plain Xenforo in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>I think if I were to do things differently, I’d explain a bit more to the players. Give town hints as to their benefits, and make the Apes (and probably the Mafia as well) more aware of how the game worked.</p>
<p>I’d also give the benefits to everyone other than the Apes, not just vanillas.</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty solid success though. I’ll probably run a couple mid-sized games or micros here at some point this year. MAYBE another large game.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in addition to the various signups open in <a class="hashtag" href="/c/forum-matches/11">#<span>forum-matches</span></a>…</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone involved in this game as a player, host, or otherwise, and I look forward to seeing you all around!</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks, you played a hell of a game as well. Again, you replacing in Day 3 really made us have to dig in our heels to continue playing, because you had a LOT of wolves in your sight very quickly, and I was worried that you were going to break the silent stranglehold I had on the game since the start.</p>
<p>I think your process was excellent for the most part, and I think that playing the game how you did it nabs the scumteam 8/10 of the time. Just that the town got kind of unlucky with how the mechanics played out, and Aelin and I brought our A games.</p>

<p>You had extremely good reads for the majority of the game, and it’s hard to tinfoil your townreads when we’re right there lunching mafia with you. I was personally trying to set you up as a potential mislunch early but Windward clamped that down real quick on Day 3, and then you were never going to be a mislunch once Wisp and Helz flipped. So props, I think you played a strong game.</p>

<p>I think I said something similar in spec chat, but I think you and min were very close in picking up the pieces at the end there. It was obvious from both of your posts that you both realized /something/ was wrong, but it would have been hard to get there when all the dead townies were calling us town <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Toward the end, I could tell that “why are they alive?” was a thought in people’s minds. But there was also fear - a testament to how well the remaining wolves played. Especially since they had good spew and bus credit from their fallen teammates. There’s always the idea that “if I vote them and I’m wrong, I’m the biggest moron in this game.” And that’s what makes final 5/7/whatevers really difficult to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Props for this - this was an accurate summary of our endgame play. I think one of the strongest tools available to wolves is the ability to create doubt in townie’s minds - the ability for them to reconsider whether you could be scum whenever you make a post. One of the better scum players I know is Achromatic/Sir Chris, and this is something he said a couple of years ago that really helped me level up my scum game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My scum game lives in the spaces of reasonable doubt. The only people who catch me reliably as scum, in my experience, are the people who also happen to mislynch me a lot as town. I am not perfect either, of course, but whereas my goal is certain (survival) their goal (lynching scum) is within the realm of doubt, and doubt is horrific when dressed with a smile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my b, I really didn’t try as hard as I could have when town realistically needed it more than I thought, I sort of just read over the thread consensus, saw how it got that way, and never really bothered to dig deep on the game later on and sort of just accepted my death (not much I think I cld do about that tho lol)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You did a very good job replacing Zone by the way -  I was worried that you would clear yourself and we would have to try and either mislunch you at mylo or keep you alive to endgame. Don’t beat yourself up - it’s hard to know that the town is a bad spot after we literally just lunched a wolf, and you weren’t given any extensions when replacing into a game with 11k posts.</p>

<p>Thanks. You played very well in the latter parts of the game - if I wasn’t scum, then there was a decent chance I would have worked with you more and cleared you.</p>

<p>As always if anyone has feedback on what they feel I could have done better as a player I do love constructive criticism. I think I could have done more work for my post-flip although I was honestly focused on sweeping the town this game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You were a great scumbuddy and I’m glad that I had you to bounce ideas off with in night chat. It’s hard to give specific feedback given that we have pretty different playstyles, but I think you could have done a better job faking interactions/distancing early on? Just that when you flipped a couple of people were hard cleared based on your interactions and you also tied yourself pretty close to Wisp. Also, I think if we were able to pre-plan your claim then we could have probably staved off your lunch for another Day or so.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not gonna write a huge postmortem about how this game went, but would just like to thank my scumbuddies for being great and a lot of the members of the town (specifically Blitz/min/Marshal/Chloe/Windward/Luk) for making this game as enjoyable as it was <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Will try to play another game here maybe later this year, we’ll see.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/aelin">@Aelin</a> I genuinely hope you don’t feel bad about this game. You played incredibly well and although I felt your CC of Wiisp was unnecessary it was an absolutely outstanding play given that we had effectively killed off all TPR and guaranteed the wolf win.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/prophylaxis">@Prophylaxis</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/Wisp">@Wisp</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/nikamara">@Nikamara</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/lemonfairy">@Lemonfairy</a><br>
I was thinking about it last night and our team composition was probably the most effective I have ever seen. Aelin hard bussing Wiisp made it so eithers flip looked outstanding on the other, Proph going hard town for the deep wolf with soft dissociation guaranteed the late game, Lemon being lost broke association tells of any kind mechanically and with Aelin and Proph going deep it freed myself, Wiisp and Nika up to reap chaos that had the town lost for a while. A lot of our team focus was understanding who players scum read so if they started to get on one of us another of us they somewhat trusted could poke their read on that other player to pull them off on a tangent. Its the most effective process I know of as a wolf and would highly encourage other players to embrace it. Even post flip the manipulation is nearly impossible to recognize. I think the strongest example you may see in scum chat was when Wiisp was up for the lynch D3.</p>
<p>The replacements were an issue for us because we had such outstanding control of the town they would shake things up and offer an un-manipulated perspective. <a class="mention" href="/u/chloe">@Chloe</a> was a very specific problem and was very effectively working a PoE to box in some wolves. She did not get everyone but what she was doing is textbook town strategy and I would highly encourage town players to embrace clearing town and forming a PoE as exemplified by Chloe’s play this game.</p>
<p>As always if anyone has feedback on what they feel I could have done better as a player I do love constructive criticism. I think I could have done more work for my post-flip although I was honestly focused on sweeping the town this game.</p>

            <p>will do, Zone! o7</p>
<p>feels kind of dumb that I towncored you <em>correctly</em> and then rescinded it for a mutual mistake we made, but I have to remember we’re all human and make wrong calls sometimes. I don’t think it was wrong of me to suspect you a bit for that, and question why you didn’t suspect me, but I got carried away with it because the whole thread had you in the PoE and I was the only one who didn’t. It was a very easy narrative for wolves to push as a result, and I got caught up in it and definitely contributed to your slot getting pushed. I just assumed there had to be at least one more mafia child and that someone in the sync chats was a wolf, but everyone was townreading their partners (that’s what I get for setup gaming lol).</p>
<p>Also, not your fault for letting me die; I didn’t think I was necessarily going to die that night and expected Aelin to be targeted tbh, so I had no qualms about your choice of action.</p>

            <p>Greetings, I come bearing a message sponsored by <a class="mention" href="/u/zone_q11">@Zone_Q11</a>:</p>

<p>GG Mafia. I did not expect there to be 2 wolves left, and especially not w!Aelin.</p>
<p>From what I heard, it appears that it was an actual bus, and it was something I never expected. <a class="mention" href="/u/aelin">@Aelin</a>, IDK what you or others think; it might have been considered dumb or borderline gamethrowing, but you ended up being towncleared by everyone and I find that very hilarious. You have played well.</p>
<p>I honestly thought that the last wolf was within min/Wisdom. <a class="mention" href="/u/prophylaxis">@Prophylaxis</a>, I said I did not read people by their social behavior, but you <em>were</em> there in my POE until Chloe miscleared you. You have most certainly played well too.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/windwardaway">@WindwardAway</a>, it was lamentable that you died. I could have prevented it, yet I didn’t. I understand that this is very outrageous of me to ask, but please have some faith in me the next time we play together. (Having that said, I can’t guarantee I will be a slacker in the future, so I apologize in advance and ask you to please take care of future!Zone.)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/wisdom">@Wisdom</a>, I don’t even remember what you did to make you apologize. If this is about misreading me, I have no grudges whatsoever. I knew that I would eventually become a scapegoat, and while others seem to disagree with my methods, I still believe that my course of actions were correct.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/marshal">@Marshal</a>, I am sorry for having you sub into your death. It’s… very fulfilling/satisfactory to see someone whose reads are same as mine. You even accepted death like I did. The only difference between us is that I am 100% more annoying than you, you sweetheart.</p>
