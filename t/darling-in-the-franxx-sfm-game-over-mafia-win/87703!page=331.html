<p>Nika brought up a very valid point that has me questioning my read now. The fact he was working against the chaos is not in line with my thoughts of what a scum would do in that situation.</p>
<p>The fact you used meta that I do not have to make your read does not make my read any less reasonable. I honestly take a bit of issue with the fact you seem so willing to talk about me but seem hesitant to talk to me. If you want to sort my alignment I will work with you on that but just talking to other people and saying I am scum does not help in that direction.</p>
<p>To your question of would a wolf CFD off 2 town lynches sure. The player I have played with before is Wiisp and I read them as a strong player. I think wolves are motivated to eliminate strong town over weak town and the fact the other town had trains on them reflected that they were lynchable.</p>

<p>Obviously context is important and Guillo was continuing from his previous post, above Helz’s here. But it just struck me as odd that both of you are talking about the same players, in different contexts, at the same time (except swapping Lukundo for Silviu).</p>
<p>To Guillo:<br>
Yes, I see it, but I’m not convinced because my level of paranoia in this game is way higher than you’ll understand. I got super paranoid of being pocketed and of scum having a big brain play in JoatJoatJoat13 that I evaded one pocket attempt and jumped into another because the scumteam was not paying attention at all and failed two NKs, and I assumed it was a big brain play but it was actually just Occam’s Razor and they weren’t reading the thread lol. So I was thinking this is a similar case, except that I actually do think we have at least two power/deepwolves at this point. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong, but you need to convince me that I’m wrong if you want to defend yourself.</p>
<p>To Helz:<br>
The point Nika brought up about Zone is something I discussed with Kaif, not that it helps you to know that. I think Nika brought it up from an angle that scum is unlikely to take, though, or at least that’s what I thought when I read her post.<br>
The reason I’m hesitant to talk <em>to</em> you is because I’m extremely paranoid that you’ve been steering me in the wrong direction, or at least letting me mislead the town because I’m loud and also was widely townread up until some point on D2. I don’t mind interacting with you if it helps me to solve your alignment, but the feeling I’m getting from both you and Guillo here is that you’re discrediting my reads on you by saying you wouldn’t do certain things as scum, and that does absolutely nothing to convince me you wouldn’t just lie about it. And I value meta somewhat less than the current thread when it comes to reading players I’ve never played with before, so I’m going off what I interpret here and giving my reasons for it.<br>
Lukundo and Wiisp have played together before (as well as with me), and I wouldn’t take Lukundo’s CFD as AI in either direction. He has some meta on Wiisp and also gave reasons in the thread prior to the CFD for scumreading Wiisp; the only difference is that he CFD’d his vote, which is a little questionable but not outside of his townrange either. I really don’t think his CFD was scum motivated because I don’t think scum!Lukundo would draw that much attention to himself when he was already being scumread by half the players or so. I don’t have any meta on his scumgame and I’ve only played once before with him, and he was town (and tunnelled town!me lol), but I just don’t think it’s a logical play to TMI two town wagons by CFDing to a third (because I don’t think a wolf CFDs to a buddy and gets them that close to being the yeet) when they’re already being heavily scumread. At any rate Wiisp and Lukundo aren’t teammates, but I stand by my clear on Lukundo of his assumption that Child was only a town role.</p>

<p>SDaL is acting very scummy in general and I don’t like Erika’s progression on me and how both just kept throwing sticks at me instead of actively discussing with others why I should be lynched. In the other side, Chloe is acting actively not only solvy but also towny, which is not a shift I expect from someone with an agenda. I can see Erika just actually being full of it as I townread Chloe.</p>
<p>Also maybe sync rate has to do with the numbers?</p>

<p>the way they just toss stuff into the thread reminds me somewhat of marl when he just says whatever the hell is on his mind</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>that was my thought as well<br>
plus the way she came in and plopped a scumread on Helz and a 3p/scumread on Guillo<br>
like, it’s a very weird way to enter the thread which attracts a lot of attention, and hunting for 3ps is generally viewed as a scummy thing to do. I guess it depends on how bold Wisdom is as a wolf, but it’s very gutsy if that’s her scumgame, and I don’t think it is.</p>
