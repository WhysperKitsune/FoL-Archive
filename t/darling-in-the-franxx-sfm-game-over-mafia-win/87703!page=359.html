<p>Then theres stances taken with no reasoning.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:4516, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>I’m not.</p>
<p>I read Guill’s ISO and thought “this makes most sense if he’s 3p”.</p>
<p>[/quote]After Min Challenged him for reasoning on Guill being 3p he basically just repeats the stance.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:4665, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Is there any reason not to clear Silviu and Windward based on post count alone?</p>
<p>[/quote]This bothered me. It does not make sense for a scum to make this statement but the thought process behind it does not feel like a genuine attempt to hunt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lukundo said something extremely towny when I joined. Something about “you should know my town meta”. This approach, the mid game “please ****ing solve me” approach is very town-indicative in general in my experience.</p>
<p>Guillotina likes to do fancy stuff when he’s wolfing and focuses more on solving the game (and being omgus) as town. I read through the first 50 posts from him and did not remind me of his town game. First I thought his openwolfing was a 3p sign but thinking about it I’ve seen him do that in another game and I don’t think he was prepared for me to join here to call that out (no one else here played that game).</p>
<p>Did I have other reads? I thought Erika sounded towny and she sussed Wiisp but I have 0 reasoning behind that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>After I poke them for reasoning they give some and I feel like I can understand their thought process to some extent. It does not look really bad but I dislike they did not seem to know what their own reads were. I particularly like that they seemed to have some real thought process for third party hunting. I also liked that they specifically poked me for my reasoning on town reading Guill after that. Later they Town read Kaif without reasoning but when I poke them for it again they seem to have a genuine thought process.</p>
<p>Later I disliked them hunting for the 3rd mason for obvious reasons. They were not shy about it though and advocated for them to reveal. Could WIFOM that either way. Like I hate the intention potential but I like how shameless they were with it?</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:4857, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Nah, sure. Kill me and get it over with if you tunnel that hard. I don’t think you’re wolfing here.</p>
<p>[/quote]This is the first indicator they town read Min which was followed by a reads list:</p>

</aside>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:4934, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Guill, what’s your wolf reads and what’s your read on Helz and why?</p>
<p>[/quote]I didn’t like the no reasoning vote on me which was followed up with this. Felt like a shallow attempt to poke Guill to build a train rather than sorting me.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:5302, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Wind wagon is weird, makes me think they might be towning after all.</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Wind v lean</p>
<p>[/quote]Then a bit after having Wind as potential wolf they get a V lean under this reasoning. Not a great look imo.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:5335, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Oh I’m quite confident Helz is wolfing. I’m just bad at making strangers listen to me.</p>
<p>[/quote]Then some more throwing shade at me without reasoning.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:5375, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Just voting to save Luku tbh</p>
<p>[/quote]I might lean Luk/Wisdom unlikely W/W with this post unless we are in some very strange (multiball which I feel is less likely with 1kpn.) They even double down with a much later post saying it again. The following day they start with a vote on me which is consistent.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:6159, topic:87703”]</p>
<p>Guill keeps screaming wolf to me but I think Helz is the better target right now.</p>
<p>[/quote]I don’t like this post. He scum reads Guill but I am the better “Target.” That wording was very specific.</p>
<p>[quote=“Wisdom, post:7131, topic:87703, full:true”]</p>
<p>Read through Aelin’s ISO. Not w/w with Wiisp/Luku/Min but they are all likely town anyway.</p>
<p>[/quote]Back to this post there was not really any build up on Min’s read and I do not feel like he mentioned Wiisp a single time. Its good they clarified they did not include Aelin in that group given they said they did not even know who that was (although the paranoid part of me wonders if they realized they had slipped when I called them out and backtracked) The Luk read could absolutely be justified but the Wiisp and Min reads are questionable to me and if you include Aelin it’s a lie for sure.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/wisdom.html">@Wisdom</a>- Can you clarify your reads on Wiisp and Min?</p>
<p>Also this post here caught my attention:</p>

          <p>So I am just done messing with this bullshit. Sorry that half the quotes are broken but I have better things to do with my life than figure out why auto generated quotes don’t function and writing up something myself does not seem to function either. I am very tired and getting cranky so sorry for my bad attitude.</p>
<p>TLDR-<br>
Over all I scum lean them but I am also concerned of them being LHF. There is a big play style difference between us and I still disagree with a lot of points they make but the real thing of value I feel in their Iso was that last post calling Luk/Wiisp/Min (and maybe Aelin) ‘All likely town.’ I feel players should look at that situation when sorting their alignment.</p>

<p>Guillotina likes to do fancy stuff when he’s wolfing and focuses more on solving the game (and being omgus) as town. I read through the first 50 posts from him and did not remind me of his town game. First I thought his openwolfing was a 3p sign but thinking about it I’ve seen him do that in another game and I don’t think he was prepared for me to join here to call that out (no one else here played that game).</p>
<p>Did I have other reads? I thought Erika sounded towny and she sussed Wiisp but I have 0 reasoning behind that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>After I poke them for reasoning they give some and I feel like I can understand their thought process to some extent. It does not look really bad but I dislike they did not seem to know what their own reads were. I particularly like that they seemed to have some real thought process for third party hunting. I also liked that they specifically poked me for my reasoning on town reading Guill after that. Later they Town read Kaif without reasoning but when I poke them for it again they seem to have a genuine thought process.</p>
<p>Later I disliked them hunting for the 3rd mason for obvious reasons. They were not shy about it though and advocated for them to reveal. Could WIFOM that either way. Like I hate the intention potential but I like how shameless they were with it?</p>

<p>Back to this post there was not really any build up on Min’s read and I do not feel like he mentioned Wiisp a single time. Its good they clarified they did not include Aelin in that group given they said they did not even know who that was (although the paranoid part of me wonders if they realized they had slipped when I called them out and backtracked) The Luk read could absolutely be justified but the Wiisp and Min reads are questionable to me and if you include Aelin it’s a lie for sure.</p>

<p>I also agree that there is at least one wolf, possibly two, on the Tilg wagon. Out of everyone on that wagon, I would look at re-evaluating or examining Nikamura, Zone, and Aelin.</p>
<p>I’ll need you to explain your Zone and Aelin reads - Zone has been kind of a massive blind spot this game for me because they are on at weird times and not many of their posts have moved the needle for me one way or another. I liked Aelin Yesterday because of their case on Wisp, but they have… somewhat dropped off today, plus it’s compounded by Wisp claiming Babysitter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think Zone would’ve broken the tied wagons yesterDay as a wolf when I accidentally tied them; he should’ve been happy to let them go down, unless they were T/T wagons and he specifically wanted at least one of them to go over. When I talked to Kaif last night, he said he thought Zone and Merc had W/W equity because Zone voted Tilgarial, but I pointed out that Zone had been SRing Tilgarial since D1, so I thought his vote lined up with his reads.</p>
<p>As for Aelin… Well, I felt pretty good about her interaction with me because it felt like she was actually trying to solve my slot, and her case on Wiisp also looked solvey, but that’s about it. I’d be willing to reevaluate her slot at this point. The thing is that i don’t think she’s groupscum, so I think only town or neut are possibilities, but I could be wrong. Chloe is right when she says Aelin doesn’t really have any oomph to her posts, but I attributed that to Aelin’s mood and decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I’m not seeing Aelin do much right now; I know she expressed early on that she was fine with dying and getting out of the game, but I think usually when she says that, she’s more active and pushes her reads, and here I don’t really know any of her reads besides Wiisp and me.</p>

<p>You haven’t really convinced me that i’m scum yet.<br>
You’ve only used some actual reason sprinkled with arbitrary/misunderstood things and called it a case, while only taking in account my D1/first 115 posts, according to your own words</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, that makes sense. I was looking at the vote counts without reading some of the posts in between and it’s entirely my fault that I missed/forgot your reasoning there. I do still agree with others that the Tilga wagon was likely mostly town motivated just because Tilga set off a number of alarm bells at the false EoD, but it’s still worth looking into the slots on their wagon as I don’t doubt there’s at least one wolf there. It’s a large wagon and the same goes for Merc’s wagon (although we don’t know her alignment yet).</p>

<p>Talk to me about how I have been letting you steer the thread/encouraged you to lead the town? I thought I’ve been pretty aggressive about using you as a rock to guide my reads of specific players (min, for example) but I don’t think I’ve ever done either of the things you’ve said.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As I said, it’s mostly a paranoia thing. I think at least someone who’s been actively asking me to give my reads and then working off them is powerwolfing. At the moment I think it’s less likely you than Helz, and out of the PoE of you/Helz/Guillo that i started with today, I still think there’s a wolf there because I don’t think the entire wolf team is UTR, but I know paranoia isn’t a great reason for a PoE full of players who are actually doing things in the thread.</p>

<p>How was it opportunistic? I literally said that I got cold feet on Blitz because of their reactions to my questions at EoD, and I voted Tilg because I thought they mindset slipped + you wanted people to vote for them. You telling me to vote Tilg at EoD yesterday then shading my vote as opportunistic here is kinda skeeving me out, not gonna lie.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m gonna accept your explanation on this for now. As I said, I was looking at the wagons without context and straight-out reading wagon shifts, and it was admittedly a bit dumb. I didn’t want to reread all the posts that went with the wagon shifts because there was a false EoD and I couldn’t just analyze the last 15 min of EoD as I’d done the day before.</p>

<p>This, I can see. I had Helz as one of the townreads I was considering re-evaluating. I previously liked his process with regards to Lukundo, but I think it is fakeable and his posts/stance today I am not particularly favorable of.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve been asking Helz for explanations behind his reads, and while I think they look pretty good, I still haven’t seen any reasoning I’d point out that would never come from a wolf. Maybe I have too high of expectations for his wolf game but I haven’t seen a post from him that screams town. And it would be a much easier game if I could just find him as town and be done with it tbh. Same goes for Guillotina, actually. As for you, every time I read your posts it seems like they make a lot of sense, and that you put thought into them, but I still have some doubts that are mainly due to paranoia at the moment.</p>

<p>I have liked Merc’s posts at SoD3. I also think if Merc is scum, her team doesn’t kill Kaif in the night based on how Merc tied her entire D2 identity into pushing him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is similar to my line of reasoning. I think Merc gets framed by the NK but doesn’t actually perform it. I stated earlier that I thought Merc’s continued push on Kaif looked like a lack of TMI on who the “viable pushes” were, and I still stand by that. She was a lone voter on Kaif when she could just as well have helped to push agenda by voting a wagon that was picking up speed, but she didn’t. And Kaif SR’d her as well, but Merc wasn’t his only SR. He had min and Guillotina as scumreads, and also mentioned he thought Zone and Merc were the same alignment, and I think he was still suspicious of Wiisp as well. Anyway, Merc being kind of inactive and also out of touch with the thread state doesn’t give me any sort of vibes that she wanted to agenda push Kaif because there was no support for it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve wolfed with him once, and in all other games with me he’s been town. He grudge votes, declares war on people, and tunnels accordingly when he feels like it. He often votes erratically as either alignment and picks someone to sheep or picks someone to scumread until they change his mind, but his SoD post looks way out of his scum range to me. Not because it’s a wallpost but because I could actually feel the effort he put into it as I was reading through. I’ve seen Zones reads in this game when he gives them, and they don’t feel contrived.</p>

Instead they list off a bunch of concerning things about Helz and then follow it up with this sort of deliberation about playstyle that I feel like… would not bother to enter scum!Chloe’s head or they would not stopgap themselves like this.

<p>It’s kind of a weak read but I saw similar things in Helz where I thought they were really wolfy/fake in their first couple of posts but I had to remind myself that they come from a completely different mafia site than I am used to. I guess a mini-mind meld is the word I’d use here?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the most part I think Chloe is town so far because her interactions with me feel natural and not weird. I found myself agreeing with a number of her takes, and I didn’t find that backtracking on Helz to be too strange because I’ve also been going back and forth on his slot. I didn’t think he was a wolf for his entrance, actually, but for the way he’s being very thorough in this game and yet still not reaching far enough beyond what I’d think a wolf could do, that makes me think he’s powerwolfing and whiteknighting a handful of townies. I do like that he’s reconsidering his stance on Lukundo after I gave my reasoning on why I think Luk is town, but it almost feels like he lost a potential agenda push. On that note i dont like that Chloe puts Lukundo into the PoE if Helz/Guillo are town because I’m very sure Lukundo belongs in the towncore regardless of Helz’s alignment, but I know she just building possible worlds and not saying theyre a reality.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Guillo carrying the scumread on Erika over to Chloe was a little weird to me. I mean, I carried over a townlean on the slot, and Chloe posted and interacted enough with me that I feel comfortable keeping her there for now. But Guillo’s main push on Chloe seemed to be that she was pocketing me and agenda pushing Guillo and Helz, and that just pinged me. Wisdom was pushing the two of them as well, and so was I at that point. And maybe Lukundo? So by association Guillo would have found the entire wolf team just off having the same reads, which is a really bad wolf play and I know that’s not the case. He pointed fingers at Chloe, Wisdom and me because we were scumreading Helz and him,and kept going on about how towny they both were, which is exactly why I wasn’t letting go of my SR on both of them.</p>

<p>This is something I’m trying to wrap my brain around - does scum WW invite people to vote her at EoD, risking herself being lunched, and then forcing the lunch on someone who voted her? Or is this just an actual genuine Thought that town Windward had?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That was my actual thought, but the reason Tilgarial was paranoid is that they did the same thing, but as a wolf (and also tried to hammer themselves but it didn’t happen because I was the only one voting them lol). Tilgarial sometimes likes reading slots off what <em>they</em> personally would do in their shoes when they don’t have wolf meta on the player in question, so that’s why Tilga asked me if I pick up tips and tricks when watching other people play FM. Because they knew that I would remember it was an effective gambit they pulled off when they wolfed against me.</p>

<p>I’m looking far ahead and what I saw last night was that I was being encouraged by scum to push my towny but bad reads, and they likely planned to tinfoil me close to LyLo for still having wrong reads and also still being alive.

<p>Kiiinda like this post though? This anxiety/worry feels real coming from Windward here.</p>

<p>It’s… a paranoia post lol. As Guillo and Helz said, I could be completely wrong. But I could also be right, and they’re the ones feeding me the narrative that I am wrong but also should lead the town. I’d be more than willing to step back today and let everyone else do their thing, and see if we actually hit a wolf at EoD without my interference, but it isn’t going to help people solve my slot so I’m not sure it’s as great of an idea as I thought it was when I went to sleep lol.</p>

<p>I kind of don’t have a read on them? I had a slight town read on Nightingale for being competent + having similar reads as me, and then they replaced out. I had a pretty negative instinctual reaction to Wisdom because they looked like they were neutral hunting, but I should probably reread them to figure out where they’re coming from. Plus Wind had a read where they were pushing against thread consensus upon replacing in?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, because Guillo was being townread for his RT and TWTBAW reasons, and Helz was being townread for ??? thread presence, encouraging proactivity, and idk what else tbh. The thing is that I realized I had pretty weak reasons to TR them, put them high into my townreads way too quickly and shelved reevaluation for two days, which I was going to do anyway, but what I did not plan on doing was reversing my reads on them. Part of the reason Wisdom scumread me at first was exactly because I stuck those two in my townreads and didn’t think much more on them, so I understand why she’d think there was an association. But I’ve come around to the point where I’m hard analyzing their slots and I’m not townreading them for mundane reasons.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, he moved off of Chloe to vote me instead lol. I really dislike the early D3 thunderdome proposal and I know it’s stupid of me to agree to it, but I can’t see a townie asking for a thunderdome so early in the game. But I’ve also been trying to figure out if scum would risk their position trying to thunderdome so early, too.</p>

</aside>
<p>The one thing that stops me from voting Wiisp so easily is that Guillo was calling for a resolution on the PRs and wanted one of them voted out, which just read to me like “let’s yeet the PRs and eventually one of them will flip wolf”, and honestly I’d rather vote Guillo out than Wiisp for that.</p>

Over all I scum lean them but I am also concerned of them being LHF. There is a big play style difference between us and I still disagree with a lot of points they make but the real thing of value I feel in their Iso was that last post calling Luk/Wiisp/Min (and maybe Aelin) ‘All likely town.’ I feel players should look at that situation when sorting their alignment.</p>

<p>Yeah, I actually do see your points on Wisdom. My thoughts are mostly that it’s due to a playstyle difference but I agree that their flip on reading me and their suggestion on reading Silviu and me off of our post count were both weird.</p>

          <p>Wagons yesterday were Tilgarial (town) and Mercenary (unknown). I thought both could be wolves yesterday which is why I proposed CFDing off Blitz onto one of those two, and Tilgarial primarily for their voting pattern. I really did think Merc could be scum when I proposed the wagon on her, but got cold feet when people jumped on it very quickly after I suggested it as it looked like an LHF wagon more than a wolf wagon.</p>
<p>So yeah, I currently TR both the wagons and I assume there has to be scum on one or both of the wagons by that logic. Kaif is right in that Zone could have tried to save Merc, <em>except</em> that I already would have placed the “saving” vote on Merc because she was tied with Tilga, meaning that if I’d had the last vote, neither of them would’ve been top wagon and we’d have ended up with a no-elim. I don’t think Zone had any need to place a vote to save Merc, and more specifically, he placed his vote on Tilga to break the tie, when he already had expressed a scumread on them since D1. So it was a consistent line of thought and not a wolfy vote imo.</p>
