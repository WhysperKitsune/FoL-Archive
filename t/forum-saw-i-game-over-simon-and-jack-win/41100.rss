    <description># Rise and shine. You&#39;re probably wondering where you are. I&#39;ll tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. 

**Basic Concept**
I get 7/8 people to join and I place you in traps in which you must escape with minimal self-mutilation! 
The traps with either be
a. Physical(you have to wiggle out of something)
b. Moral (You must save others at the expense of yourself)
c. intelligence (searching for a key somewhere)
Also, ALL TRAPS ARE ESCAPABLE, you can die easily if you make the wrong choice. 

You make a sheet with stats with a maximum of 15 points which you DM to me
ex.
Physical 4
Morality 7
Intelligence 4

Sin: I stole a candy bar
(THIS ISN&#39;T FLAVOR, these will decide your options and success rates!)

# So... do you want to play a game?

**RULES**
1. You must try, that&#39;s no fun if people don&#39;t value their lives!
2. If you be mean to Jigsaw(Me) you die 
3. if you guys wanna make a story out of this you can

PLAYERS
1. @SuperJack 
2. @Simon* 
3. @Hippolytus*
4. @Insanity*
5. @NuclearBurrito*
6. @orangeandblack5*
7. @Moleland*
8. @Strangle*

(* means I have gotten their stats &amp; Sin)

# Graveyard
Hippo-Shredded on Trap 3 (8 Doors)
Moleland-Eaten on Trap 3 (8 Doors)
Nuclear Burrito-Eaten on Trap 3 (8 Doors)
~~Simon-Left for Dead on Trap 4 (The Pit)~~ Escaped by climbing
Orange-Left for Dead on Trap 4 ( The Pit)
~~Insanity Left for Dead on Trap 4 ( The Pit)~~ Escaped by climbing
Insanity-Poisioned By Iced Tea on Trap 5(Tea Time!)
