    <title>Why statistics don&#39;t matter for swingy kings</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-statistics-dont-matter-for-swingy-kings/41560</link>
    <description>Since the latest update something I have seen a lot of people saying is that the King odds change heavily favors BD. This is false, the change actually favors King who may or may not be good still.

Lets put it this way. 

If the odds of king were changed the other way to 20/20/60 then no one would EVER trust the king and he would be insta exed. This is clearly a problem for evil kings but what people forget is that this is just as much a problem in the 40% neut or good king situations making all 3 of them less helpful.

Here it is the opposite. People are trusting the king or at least giving him the benefit of the doubt now because the math does not work out to him being an easy lynch. This obviously helps BD work with a good king and would raise thier win rate when there is a good king. However it also make it easier for an evil king to trick them making evil win rates raise in those games too.

The fact that this overall increases BD is irrelevant because in any given game your odds are based on what this list actually is rather than what it could be even if you can&#39;t stratagize like that you can balance like that.</description>

            <p>With the exception of the NK and King coordination aspect the neut king is not interesting to play against. His unpredictability is a bad thing for a class like King that no one can check. Since you need to be able to scum read him that means that the different king alignments need to have to act differently from each other. A neut king however is indistinguishable from the team he is siding with making him frustrating to play with if he ever turns and pointless if he doesn’t.</p>

            <p>I love the Neutral King. It adds more variety and unpredictability to the game, and whoever is playing the Neut King really has to thread the needle to not piss off a faction so much that they get killed. It also allows for interesting, unique coordination between a King and NK.</p>

            <p>I’d still argue that Neut king should’t be a thing and EK probability’s should be what they were pre-patch.</p>

            <p>I agree, but the chances of an evil king are too low.  It should be 50/20/30 instead.</p>

            <p>Yeah, being able to more easily avoid suspicion in the early game is a huge indirect boost to Evil Kings. I’ve really enjoyed the 60/20/20 ratio that’s currently live.</p>
