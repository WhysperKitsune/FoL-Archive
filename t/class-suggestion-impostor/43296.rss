    <description>**Lore**: You have had enough of being snooped by the sheriff and being followed. Your annoyed of the king and his unearned power. Its time to take a step up and to do something but where do i start? Next time they come they will get a deadly surprise... Maybe then i can start from there
**Faction**-Neutral
**Class Type**- Killer
**Night ability 1**- On watch - Kill a visitor and steal there identity

* This has infinite uses

* If a assassin visits he will be bleed and die tomorrow night. For imposer it would be _You attacked someone but they barely escaped_ and for the assassin it would be _You were counter attacked and barely made it out alive_

*  If you hit a BD you will kill them you will get _You killed someone and took there identity!_ While they get _You died while visiting (name)_

*  if you hit nk you will get _You were visited but they escaped without harm!_ and they will get _You were attacked while visiting (name) but escaped_
After you took the identity you will get a new ability-
**Night ability 1**- Learn your identity

* This will allow you to unlock that roles functions but you will not have its passives like occ immunity or armored
After that you will have the function of another role but as a neutral imposer. You will show up as killer in investigates 
**Win condition**: Take someones identity, learn it and survive

Something iv been thinking a lot hope you guys like it :)</description>
