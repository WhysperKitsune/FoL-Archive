    <title>Scripted Tutorial Converted Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/scripted-tutorial-converted-bug/27551</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
So, I was trying out the &quot;Scripted Tutorial&quot; on the game, when it was time for me to get converted to Unseen. When it asked me to click the Class Card to check my abilities, clicking the Class Card button would not open the abilities GUI.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
What was supposed to happen is show me the abilities of my Unseen role (Assassin) and continue the tutorial.

#### Steps to reproduce:
All you have to do is play the Scripted Tutorial until you are converted to Unseen.

#### Comments:
It&#39;s not as a game-breaking bug, but I believe it was worth sharing it. Thanks!</description>
