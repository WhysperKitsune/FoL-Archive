    <title>[RESOLVED] Notice. My account got locked in regards to replies on the fourm</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-notice-my-account-got-locked-in-regards-to-replies-on-the-fourm/7596</link>
    <description>What happened:
I can&#39;t post anymore? It said I reached my limit on post and should wait another 24 hours before posting again. 

What was SUPPOSED to happen:
Did not know this was a thing, I guess it&#39;s to help people spaming the forums which I understand but I was having a good conversation about an idea and usually after 24 hours the conversation is dead and hard to start back up again

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Create an account
2. Interact with others until you get notifications about not being able to post anymore until the next day
3. FeelsBadMan</description>

            <p>You simply have to wait 24 hours, then you can start again. You’re not locked, or banned. Just time-out to prevent any new account from spamming the forum <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
