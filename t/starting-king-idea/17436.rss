    <description>Honestly I don&#39;t really know if the king even needs a second night Ability at all. Just buff guards for the starting king.

Elite Guards: Target player gets night Immunity. Does not consume a use if they are not attacked. Can target self (4 uses)</description>

            <p>i agree. the investigate needs to go. Also the format they have now where every king can see the faction is dumb. No one trusts the king now and it makes him even more useless unless he gets a lucky ping.</p>
<p>I found someone BD. Whispered them “what is your role because i checked you BD and I am BD king” and their exact response was “I still don’t trust you, could be evil.” Asked everyone to whisper leads and they said the same thing publicly. There is no differentiation between the three kings and since its king out d4 with no help, it leads to dumb, boring, not fun king play where I pray I die n1 so I can leave the game and start a new one.</p>
