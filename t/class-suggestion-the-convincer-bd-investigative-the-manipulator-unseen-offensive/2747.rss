<p>this is incredibly weak<br>
for example, there are 26 classes with an “E” in their name, 25 with an “R” and 22 with an “S”, and every letter is used in at least 3 classes, except one, which is Z and only appears once (I didn’t include any aftermath classes)</p>

            <p>I think it could just give two factions, one of which is correct. That way throughout the game it gets more useful, for example, you get Cult and Neutral, but you now know it’s an Unseen game, so they are confirmed neutral.</p>

<p>Wait, so you only get two letters of their alignment, but it could very well be wrong?<br>
For example, you check them and get “u” and “n”. It could be Unseen, or Neutral, but it could also be anything? Seems fairly useless.</p>
