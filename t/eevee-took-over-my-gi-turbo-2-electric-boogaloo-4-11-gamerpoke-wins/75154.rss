* It will start most likely 5 minutes after it fills.
* Days are 15 minutes. Twilight is 2 minutes. Nights are 5 minutes, unless I’m a failure and extend it.
* Early day actions will be processed during the day, late day actions will be processed during Twilight, due to me being a failure once more.

* I’m slow af.
