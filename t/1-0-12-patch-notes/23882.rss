        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve seen some weirdness with two line messages getting chopped to one line after I send them, but can’t come up with a repro case and don’t know if it affects actual chat everyone can see or just mine as sender. It’s definitely not always, and may have to do with punctuation at the wrap point. Something to watch out for.</p>

            <p>I agree. Take away inquisitors power’s. Also for a won scorned they should lose all immunities.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>yeah, I directly hated this idea when it was proposed. and remember pretty much that we need to be taking away inquisitors post victory powers… not giving other roles them. I mean the same logic… the fool also won… if a won scorned can keep using his trollbox, why not a fool (provided he died by execution). These roles are meant to do their damage… then mostly get out of the way, however the threat of them is supposed to at least leave a last resort awful claim (or impliclaim in fools case).</p>
<p>I’d also double down on my reasoning with the fact that trollboxes are RARELY sucesful tools to actually fool people. I don’t know about you but whenever I say anything that would be reasonable to TB someone to say, I follow up with a second “NO TB” message. It is generally a poor tool for fooling people (not saying it never works… just that if you want to succeed with it, you gotta be slow, subtle, and ok with a 25% chance of failure). however it would make a “GREAT TOOL FOR SELF CONFIRMING”. assuming you no longer have a reason to fool the town.</p>

            <p>Shouldn’t the Prince already be using his time on the Scorned, as they are actively trying to get BD killed? Unless the Scorned’s targets were converted, it seems typically worth it to execute or jail/execute a Scorned to help protect BD as a whole.</p>

            <p>It might be a bug, but … why was that changed? Scorned has no need to prove themselves. Rather, the bad provability allows for Assassins and other expendable people to risk claiming scorned, or it makes Scorned suspect and prince wastes time with Scorned!</p>
