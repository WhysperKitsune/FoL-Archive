    <title>Noble needs his maid back</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/noble-needs-his-maid-back/12059</link>
    <description>Right now, evil kings have crazy power. They can just wishper to the unseen/ cult all the information they got.
The unseen use it to kill every physician, knight or the prince and with alchs help (king&#39;s sevents) they get the majority in day 4-5.

Futhermore, the new noble is boring as hell, and doing absolutly nothing besides proving he is noble with his abilities.

I really loved the old noble with crier/maid. Listening to kings and post it on the crier, but even the maid will be good enough to stop this nosense.

There is no reason to buff evil king, as evil king is already an exellent start for unseen/cult.</description>

            <p>Those must have been poor evil kings / new players, because it can be done far more subtle than to instantly get destroyed by a spying noble.</p>
<p>I posted some suggestions for class changes post 1.08 in another suggestion topic. I do think the spying must return: such a fun element. Should have limited uses though. (like 3)</p>

            <p>Only problem with Unseen/Cult kings whispering their info to cult/unseen is that once they are revealed the ones they whispered to are immediately suspicious. Ive seen this in many games and its destroyed the cult/unseen in quite a few of them (About 30-40%).</p>
