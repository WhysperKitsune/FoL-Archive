    <title>Alchemist Limit Uses</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/alchemist-limit-uses/73990</link>
    <description>**Suggestion 1:**

Alchemist has 12 nights worth of abilities. I think the number of uses should be decreased by 1 for each ability or set all the uses to 2. It makes alchemist think of their uses strategically before just yolo tarring someone. It adds a new layer to alchemist instead of basically using 2/4 abilities that you like every time 

**Suggestion 2**

Just make alchemist have to uses each potion by N4 and cannot use a potion twice until every potion has been used once. As I said before, it adds a new layer of strategy to the alchemist class I seats of mindlessly using the potion.</description>

            <p>Agreed with suggestion 2.</p>
<p>Survive win-cons are really bad for this game. Maybe make it “survive to use all 4 potions” and reduce the uses for each by 1 after a win. this would make alchemist a little more fun plus it prevents kingmaker alchs that already won the game to bomb and tar.</p>
