    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Kidnapper - Neutral Offensive</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-kidnapper-neutral-offensive/38276</link>
    <description>**I&#39;m also working on a Neutral Killer version: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-kidnapper-neutral-killer/38358**
![The Kidnapper (Offensive)|690x361](upload://czJc8hJGAUe1zDqA0lyv1NYTJOX.jpg)

Unique.
Cannot be converted.

**Primary Purposes:**
Removes players from the game temporarily, preventing them from partaking in day or night activities. They will be unable to see any messages during the day while captive.
Protects players from being voted onto the stand the following day, or from being targeted by most abilities the following night.
Providing information to hostages with Sweet Nothings.


**Secondary Purpose:**
Discovering players that are Killer-type classes.

Kidnap takes lowest priority, meaning it won&#39;t prevent any night actions such as occupation or killing of and/or by the target on the night it&#39;s used as it only takes effect the following day. However, the majority of abilities except those listed below will not be able to target the hostage during the following night. Will not work on corpses, Killer-type classes, hiding fools, players protected by CW barrier, or imprisoned players.

**Abilities that can target hostages:**
**Psychic**: Link Minds
**Noble/Aristocrat/Apostle**: Maid Spy, Snoop
**Princess**: Will-o-Wisp

The charges on the abilities are mostly for show and don&#39;t have too much thought behind them, though in hindsight I&#39;d probably give Meat Shield 3 or even infinite charges. It&#39;s roughly as reliable as a Bear (without killing the attacker unless they&#39;re a Knight), but can only be used if the Kidnapper has a hostage and prevents him from using Kidnap again until the next night. This also means Meat Shield can&#39;t be used again until the night following the next successful Kidnap (and maybe he&#39;s holding a hostage that he doesn&#39;t want to kill off!) There&#39;s many things to consider and I think it creates very interesting dynamics between classes.</description>

            <p>Edited the original post again after realizing how unreliable Meat Shield is. This class has fairly strong utility but has pretty limited survival ability compared to other Neutral classes when taking into consideration how he has to juggle his 4 abilities.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how “medieval-based” is an argument against kidnapping. I don’t believe it’s a turn of the century activity.<br>
I think you could make similar arguments for the Mercenary, who prevents basically everything except for jailing and becomes immune while doing it to boot. The ability doesn’t even bypass occupy immunity without using Hogtie and fails on Killer type classes (that’s 7 classes). The Kidnapper can be discovered quite easily through the visibility of his actions, especially if he is attacked and the hostage dies instead.<br>
I’m not sure how you figure that the Kidnapper is “unfair” for the other players, as it’d be easy to tell who is kidnapped by the fact that they aren’t at the table and you can’t target them. No actions are prevented on the night of the kidnapping, and the player is only killed if the Kidnapper decides to activate an ability and happens to be attacked. In addition, because the player is already held hostage they can’t be targeted for the next kidnapping (this also adds one more tick to their occupy immunity, which is a benefit).</p>

            <p>As we all know, this game is medieval-based, if you want to “Kidnap” somebody, you have the Prince.</p>
<p>With the Kidnapper, you now have 2 jails on a single game, just with the fact the kidnapper is a little bit more weak.</p>
<p>The game would be super fun for Kidnapper, but pretty unfair for the other 13 player who are not the prince or king.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Cuatrolan. How do you figure a Kidnapper would not fit with the game?</p>

            <p>This is a nice idea, but a Kidnapper does not fit at all with the game. Thats all.</p>

            <p>I took some inspiration for this class from the Butler. I always found it interesting how at face value the Butler only had the purpose of preventing action at night, but had a sort of “hidden” purpose of discovering who was occupy immune.</p>
<p>I think the “Survive” objective is suitable for this class rather than his own unique objective like those of the Mercenary or the Scorned. Because his abilities can be used to the benefit of either BD or Evil there is incentive to keep him alive should he be discovered, similar to the Alchemist.</p>
