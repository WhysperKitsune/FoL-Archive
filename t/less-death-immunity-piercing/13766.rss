        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So you feel death immunity should be reworded to make it more clear that it only effects normal night attacks?</p>
<p>I agree, and think a lot of things should be more clear.  There isn’t even an indication of basic stuff that’s very important, like how Allies is a visit, but Guard isn’t.</p>

            <p>If the percentage of killing abilities that pierce death immunity is at 50%, then death immunity should really be called “Death immunity to some things”</p>

            <p>Well the Knight’s sacrifice kills the Knight, so I think that’s kinda fair.</p>
<p>Even if we could agree on what should and should count to work out the ratio of what immunity does and doesn’t block, you haven’t really made an argument on what the information means.  Why is it bad if the percentage is over 50%? What do you think the percentage should be?  Why do you think that? What evidence are you using to reach that conclusion?</p>

            <p>my point is that it is already at a point where it is not so much death immunity as it is “immunity to half the forms of death at night”</p>

            <p>Of the ones that bypass, 4 of them are delayed kills that can be prevented by an Alch or Phys heal, so they aren’t really <em>stronger</em> than killing at night, so much as they are <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>You’re also including sacrifice which is kind of unfair since it’s not really an attack you use to kill an enemy. And including execs isn’t really fair either, it would make no sense to have an exec immune class.</p>
<p>So that leaves empowered erad, empowered reap, Enforcer frenzy, and Drunk’s ability. All of them except empowered Reap requires comboing 2 players to pull off, and Frenzy and empowered erad are mutually exclusive and cannot both exist in the same game.</p>
<p>Seems fine to me.</p>
<p>If your position is that new death immunity should not be added lightly, I agree, but your title of <em>'Less</em> death immunity’ seems to suggest there is too much already, which I disagree with.</p>

            <p>So?</p>
<p>In any case, it means death immunity is becoming less and less worth anything, like in ToS.</p>
<p>this is mostly a warning to people to stop suggesting classes that can pierce death immunity.</p>
