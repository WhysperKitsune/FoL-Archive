    <title>Snoop sometimes showing blank journals when it shouldn&#39;t</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/snoop-sometimes-showing-blank-journals-when-it-shouldnt/36092</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen this multiple times now, sometimes as Noble myself:  A Noble snoops someone who definitely has stuff in their journal, yet it comes up blank.  It seems extremely common.

When I encountered this bug, I was later turned, and when I snooped again, it worked, filling out the [i]first[/i] of my two recorded notebooks (so the blank one never ended up getting recorded, not even as a blank notebook.)

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t figure out an easy way to reproduce this, but I figured it&#39;s worth at least creating a thread so other people can chime in and we can maybe figure out what&#39;s causing it.</description>

            <p>Just happened in a game I was in.  Noble Snooped the Sheriff and Sheriff had “blank logs” only they weren’t blank, Noble just didn’t get them.</p>
<p>Encountered a similar thing first time I played Noble but I assumed he was using Personal Notes.  Now, I’m kind of convinced it was just a bug.</p>

            <p>Because every time I saw it happen, it was a BD who died shortly afterwards, had a complete log, and insisted they’d always had a complete log even in deadchat / after the game - they had no reason to lie, and a BD has no particular reason to keep their journal in their notes and then copy-paste it in shortly before they die or anything like that.</p>
<p>(The most recent time I saw it, the people involved confirmed it after the game - the Noble saw nothing, and the BD definitely had a log at the time.)</p>

            <p>When you were converted it would have reset the journals because you would regain your uses of snoop so I know that isn’t it.</p>

            <p>How do you know you didn’t snoop someone that didn’t put anything in their logs?</p>
