    <title>[Suggestion] Replay mode</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-replay-mode/39146</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like the ability to bring up past games and replay them, viewing all whispers/chat/actions/etc.  It would be helpful to see exactly how something happened and would probably cut down on reports from people that misunderstand how things happened.</description>

            <p>This would be cool, but it would require quite an overhaul. Maybe like the ability to watch it immediately or saving it (in your only record slot) or losing it forever.</p>
