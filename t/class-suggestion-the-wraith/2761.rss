    <title>[Class suggestion] The Wraith</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-wraith/2761</link>
    <description>&gt;The Wraith (neutral killer)
**Passive: Rage**
At the end of every day you gain 2 rage. You can have a maximum of 7 rage. You start with three rage.
If you have 3 or more rage, you are immune to death. If you have 5 or more, you are immune to being occupied. 
**Night ability: Night&#39;s wrath**
Attack the target. If you have 5 or more rage, you will bypass death immunity. If you have 7 rage, you will kill your target and everyone who visits your target and then lose rage equal to however many people you killed. -infinite uses, cost 1 rage
**Day ability: Phantasmal beating**
The next player put on trial will be immediately executed -cost 4 rage
_&quot;The Wraith has dispatched (name)&quot;_ as a see-through sword stabs them from behind

Lore: As the alchemist stood there on trial, visibly dazed, the blue dragon denounced her as a member of the unseen because they had no other leads. She begged for an opportunity to show them her lab, to show her records of saving the king through her remedies. But they would have none of it.

After her apprentice said his goodbyes and placed a single rose on her grave, the earth around the tomb began to tremble. A single hand reached out and grabbed the rose by it&#39;s thorns. She pulled herself out, angered by the blue dragon&#39;s betrayal.

They would have none of her evidence. She would have none of them left in castle Adiart.</description>

<p>understandable, will change immediately.</p>
<p>It won’t have increase in cost (except for 7) but staying at 1 slows the incline.</p>

            <p>i think that nights wrath should by default take away 1-2 rage, or maybe let you take away differing amounts of rage for stronger attacks<br>
example<br>
/Night’s wrath 1/2-4<br>
attack target<br>
/Nights wrath 5<br>
goes through night immunity<br>
and maybe a separate night ability:<br>
/???(maybe Wraithful Vengeance?) 1-7[x] rage (must have 7 rage to use)<br>
kills target and anyone who visits said target, except for you, with a maximum of x kills</p>
