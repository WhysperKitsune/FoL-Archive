    <title>A play that was bad turned good</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-play-that-was-bad-turned-good/62066</link>
    <description>Okay here&#39;s what happened. I thought of a new strat for inquistor. I claimed hunter. Then I claimed bleeding. Or was it nightshade can&#39;t remember. Thing was that I wanted the sorc to COD me. It lowers the amount of people that could be sorc. Well thing is I was put on stand. So of course instead of claiming inquistor I claimed hunter. I was pardon&#39;d. So the the next night comes. Turned out that the sorc was jailed and he was getting ex&#39;d. Good thing too. Cause I was occupied by a butler trying to prove my occupy immunity. I was placed on stand saying I am hunter don&#39;t do dis. So when I got exed they were like where&#39;s you arrow? I said. I am sorry my arrow turned into a staff. I need a new staff. When I showed up as inquistor some people were like dumb inquistor. While others were laughing.

End of the story I think this would be a great strat as inquistor. Because they won&#39;t attack you if they didn&#39;t bleed you. Cod. Then you just try to yolo the sorc.</description>

            <p>Sure, the hunter is dead, but then you have to deal with the myriad of BD thats gonna be on your butt the next night, worst case scenario prince exes you, best case scenario people think you are fool, but all BD killers will be on you.</p>
<p>I claim bleeding whenever I lose my night immunity as inq and yolo stab.</p>
