    <title>[Class Suggestion] Mithras : The Cult Leader&#39;s &#39;Converted&#39; Form</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-mithras-the-cult-leaders-converted-form/22489</link>
    <description>A new ability would be added ONLY to the original Cult Leader. This is to make the original Cult Leader a much larger threat and give the Cult Leader more options later into the game. 

**Ability** : Metamorphosis
_Only usable with a full cult (4 members) OR as the last member of the cult past day 5_
Turn into Mithras tonight. People will be unable to vote tomorrow.
A message will appear the next day alerting the folk of Mithras&#39;s presence :
&gt; A deafening roar kept you from sleeping last night, you feel uneasy.

_**Mithras**_
_The portrait for Mithras would be the red creature present behind the Cult Leaders portrait. (This is what inspired me in the first place)_ 
_Wins with cult_

**Passive 1: Unstoppable Onslaught** 
Kill all those visiting you at night. Immune to Occupation and Imprisonment. If accused and executed, kill the first player to accuse you. (Similar to the hunter passive)

**Passive 2 : Blood lust**
You are unable to communicate or understand the words of the living (Words will be jumbled and random). Your lust for blood will be sated in 2 Nights and you will die.

**Night ability : Devastation** 
Target a player, kill them and all their visitors. Ignores Night Immunity.
.
Lore: I am the thing under the bed.

Counter-play: Keep Cult numbers limited at all time. If the beast has awoken use the day to figure out who is unable to communicate. Don&#39;t visit anyone when Mithras is alive to avoid being dinner.</description>

            <p>Yes, of course… Hence why it has the hunters passive of killing the first person to put them up for trail.<br>
Someone has to bite the bullet and die to kill Mithras the following day, or let Mithras use Devastation a second time.</p>
<p>The mere presence of Mithras alone will prevent an entire day of voting AND an entire night of action, as players will fear to visit others as it may lead to death.</p>
<p>It does not matter if Mithras is executed the following day, since he would have already killed at least 1 player the night before, made a day and night almost useless AND will kill someone once executed which will put further stress on the BD, deciding who to ‘sacrifice’.</p>
<p>Certian Cult Classes could be changed to increase the survibility of the Cult Leader to make it past day 5, and to even buff Mithras as already been suggested.<br>
But honestly as Mithras stands, I like that it won’t be a common occurrence every cult game and there is SLIGHT counterplay which still causes chaos to the BD.</p>

            <p>Regardless, he still kills the person he visits, and all those visiting him.</p>
<p>This would also be a perfect opportunity for a reaper to chill someone.<br>
Like I suggested before, making the person above and below Mithras also unable to talk that day would be a good way to fix that issue.</p>

            <p>People are unable to vote for that day anyway, so even if they DID know who it was, it would not matter. Any attempts to stop him at night would be futile due to his passive Unstoppable Onslaught. If he is executed the next day someone will still die as well, so overall his almost certain to kill at least 2 people regardless.</p>
<p>Possible fix for such an easy find would be the person above and below Mirthas would hear the roar much loaded then the other members, they would be so scared they will be unable to talk the next day.<br>
Or as Zeryn suggested, A Cult Social trollbox.</p>

            <p>Exactly, I always find myself enjoying Unseen games more than Cult. I also find it difficult to sacrifice people for more eradicate charges in the fear of throwing the game. I feel this late game ability can really upset a game and change how Cult games are played.</p>

            <p>Wow I like this there is just something also you should probably re name it to Mithras since the ‘god’ behind him is Mithras so I guess Mithras takes over his body and goes on a spree for a limited time till his power kills the vessel aka the cult leader I love this overall.</p>

            <p>A new ability would be added ONLY to the original Cult Leader. This is to make the original Cult Leader a much larger threat and give the Cult Leader more options later into the game.</p>
<p><strong>Ability</strong> : Metamorphosis<br>
<em>Only usable with a full cult (4 members) OR as the last member of the cult past day 5</em><br>
Turn into Mithras tonight. People will be unable to vote tomorrow.<br>
A message will appear the next day alerting the folk of Mithras’s presence :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deafening roar kept you from sleeping last night, you feel uneasy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Mithras</strong></em><br>
<em>The portrait for Mithras would be the red creature present behind the Cult Leaders portrait. (This is what inspired me in the first place)</em><br>
<em>Wins with cult</em></p>
<p><strong>Passive 1: Unstoppable Onslaught</strong><br>
Kill all those visiting you at night. Immune to Occupation and Imprisonment. If accused and executed, kill the first player to accuse you. (Similar to the hunter passive)</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2 : Blood lust</strong><br>
You are unable to communicate or understand the words of the living (Words will be jumbled and random). Your lust for blood will be sated in 2 Nights and you will die.</p>
<p><strong>Night ability : Devastation</strong><br>
Target a player, kill them and all their visitors. Ignores Night Immunity.<br>
.<br>
Lore: I am the thing under the bed.</p>
<p>Counter-play: Keep Cult numbers limited at all time. If the beast has awoken use the day to figure out who is unable to communicate. Don’t visit anyone when Mithras is alive to avoid being dinner.</p>
