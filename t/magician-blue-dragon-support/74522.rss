<p>The rule of thumb is that AOE debuffs are support while targeted debuffs are offensive</p>

            <p>both are op but magician particularly</p>
<p>also both aren’t exactly fun to play magician isn’t as he’s kinda like old cw except you can stop attacks except sorc bomb<br>
mage isn’t because he has limited use abilities (although you have a lot rn), and you’re basically converted for your abilities then bussed when they’re used up(and smart bd can tell), and unlike timesnatcher, the abilities are unoriginal and not fun to work with.</p>
<p>but yeah both need a rework</p>

            <p>Early game, when the majority of the court is silent, the sheriff usually doesn’t check the same person twice in a row because it’s usually just a yolo check. Late game however, the sheriff can usually deduce who the unseen is anyway if he’s smart or he’l likely up for logs and have the rest of the court decide (unless he’s new, of course)</p>
<p>I would make the first ability just be “Occupy everyone who visits the Unseen” and probably make it 1 or 2 uses and maybe either increase the uses of the second ability a little bit or give a day ability or something else to compensate for the fact.</p>

            <p>True, however, maybe limit it down to 2 uses? Supposing it doesn’t hide the unseen so the sheriff may just check again or killer may just attack again.</p>

<p>this is ok because it’s on a scum imo, not op and not beneficial all the time, more like a ritualist brotherhood</p>
<p>you can use it to save a scum and it’s not like the sage’s firewall and unlike nado in the way where you can have your assassin attack someone but then swap them so there will less likely be defenses on them.</p>

</aside>
<p>OP… this is like an infinite clear mind but with the added bonus of protection while not occupying healers like a merc would</p>
<p>Summoning portal is op in the way that you can use it to save yourself anf that it’s not a swap so there’s absolutely no counterplay unless you’ve been occupied 3 times already or the scum have servant/invoker/sellsword and can be used to protect high priority bd targets effectively</p>
<p>Overall I do not like this class and think that it is too redundant in it’s abilities</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh wait nvm i see your day ability</p>
<p>you might want to put the day ability first so it’s clearer, but it’s still pretty op, but less so.</p>
<p>you’d have to nerf cw if you want this to be implemented</p>

<p>This is too strong imo blocking both converts and attacks, Magician may as well be a reverse sellsword that<strong>only</strong> blocks attacks and converts as opposed to anything but.</p>
<p>In my opinion, make it either occupy attacks <strong>or</strong> converts to a specific target, changing the day ability to switch between blocking attacks or blocking converts</p>
