    <description>Right now, evil king is 100% wrost for BD and better for unseen/cult.
For me, starting king&#39;s faction shoudn&#39;t have ANY effect on the percentage of the game winner.

Right now, as an evil king, you can be the complete troll, wrost player ever and still be better for unseen then bd.

**Tol Should aspire to:**
Good king win percentage = bd win percentage = evil king win percentage =evil win percentage 



**Those are my suggestion:** 
1. when the starting evil king die by assasin/butler/get executed, the cult/unseen can&#39;t kill/convert anyone the following night.
2. when the starting bd king get executed, the town can&#39;t executed anyone on the court the following  day, bd players lose their ability for 1 night.

**Replacments for rule 1 (1 of the following):**
when the starting evil king die by assasin/butler/get executed
1. give 2 random blue dragon players 1 night immunity
2. resurrect a random DK
3. give 1 random bd player convert immunity</description>

<p>How is that adressing the problem?<br>
We are trying to make<br>
Good king win percentage = bd win percentage<br>
evil win percentage = evil win percentage</p>

<p>Win percentages don’t mean much at the moment with players of all skill levels mixed together<br>
Trying to flatten the percentages without grouping players in lobbies based on skill is going to make the game less competitive</p>

            <p>It works because I don’t actually need everyone to trust me. Just enough people to start coordinating them. And since the classes I need are also the ones that are most likely to claim when asked I am able to consistently get what I need.</p>

<p>Alchs rarely do that if they are already working with a specific player. I have never been betrayed by an Alch while doing this and I would often get at least 2 evils lynched using the whispers alone with no other info even while unconfirmed and unclaimed.</p>

            <p>You’re still telling me a whisper meta, which I already said is the only way we have to get kings faction.</p>
<p>Now as a confirmed BD, you can get people to claim to you, but you’re saying you just randomly ask people for claims even before you’re converted? That’s insane to me. Your whole scenario requires all the perfect blocks to be in place and for everyone to trust you. You’re scenario trashes multiple days to fulfill, but with any competent nk and evils, you’ll have at least 4 deaths by the time you get around to enacting your plan. Your plan there also means you have to have an alch cooperate with you. Maybe we just get different games, but alch almost always wants to turn on BD at the first chance. I can honestly say I’ve never seen any game ever play like that. You live in some perfect world.</p>

            <p>Basically by BD game plan as any class is as follows:</p>
<p>1: Find an alch to buddy with<br>
2: Ask my highest unclaimed scum read for logs<br>
3: If they refuse tell the alch to bomb them<br>
4: If their logs contradict then hang them<br>
5: If someone else should be able to confirm the logs then go to step 2 with them.<br>
6: Next night repeat at step 2 until you win.</p>

            <p>Basically what usually would happen is as king I would have 1 or 2 people claim to me on their own. (usually an alch). And I would go from there and whisper 1 or 2 people for classes to get more information as I go.</p>
<p>And BTW I do that as every other class in the game too just without the initial 1-2 claims.</p>

            <p>Basically you won’t have EVERYONE whispering the king because he isn’t trustworthy enough for a mass claim. However low priority classes like Alch or Sheriff have little to fear from the king so he is likely to get claims from them.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Mostly the same way I do with everyone else. I see how much they are cooperating and judge them accordingly. If when I start trying to direct people they go “fuck you die scum” I know they are evil (You have no idea how meany times an evil king does that). If they start pointing out flaws or agreeing to whatever the plan is then they are usually fine. If they are EKing in the second situation then it’s fine because if they start doing weird stuff to throw off the plan then I know they are evil and if they don’t then we get the evils killed and he looses anyway.</p>
<p>The only problem is when a critical mass of key classes is either dead or converted.</p>
<p>AKA: I don’t care. I just assume he could be evil and plan accordingly making predictions for how an EKing would optimally act compared to a good king. If he matches those actions and not that of the good kings then I hang.</p>
<p>For example if I am confirmed BD who is gathering claims and I whisper King (who would presumably have been doing the same thing for at least a few people) for what he’s been told so that I can send a CW I know about onto a high priority convert. If he is Eking then he has reason to make sure I don’t have that info and will fight me on it. If he is BD king then he has nothing to hide.</p>

            <p>That still forces you to even get 2 phys claims in the first place. So you need to dedicate 2 nights straight when the only information you have to go on is what your jailed target claims. In the mean time, king got a full day of whispers of events last night and can narrow prince down to roughly 5 people since prince isn’t claiming. This is also going under the assumption that no physicians just die anyway, and whoever you claimed to weren’t evil with abilities we’ve already discussed. You know, sorc, reaper, cult/ unseen with target swap. You’re using such a round about method to try and defend Order Execute. The ability is bad and is hurting the game in the long run. It needs to go.</p>
<p>I’d also love to know how you determine the king’s faction with no whisper meta.</p>

            <p>No you don’t just claim to the first one you find. For example I would often just find one and tell them to heal me without context. They often listen.</p>
<p>You would get like 2 or 3 claims and then claim to all 3 at the same time and possibility the king too. And then tell the phys claim and the king claim that the king and phys are both on you. That way any evils will be outed as long as at least one person in the group is good. And since neither of them can know if that is the case none of them can attack you.</p>

            <p>So randomly hope I jail a phys or knight, tell them who I am, and hope they aren’t evil (you know, two of the more common evil claims). You’re literally rolling the dice. What happens if you don’t jail a phys or knight in the first two or three nights? What happens when the phys you jailed n1 was mastermind? You’re still creating a dice roll meta, worse than what we already have.</p>

            <p>This literally sounds even worse. You’ve now convinced me that outing myself as prince is bad. But telling king I’m prince is also bad. And not telling I’m prince is bad since king can figure me out through whispers.</p>
<p>So what’s good here? All of this sounds absolutely awful.</p>
