    <title>Fool Rework/The Usurper [As done by an FM nerd]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fool-rework-the-usurper-as-done-by-an-fm-nerd/53027</link>
    <description>There are two thins I dislike on a conceptual level in this game: The Fool, and whispers. Whispers are likely here to stay, but the whisper King meta has to change. I hate Fools because in my opinion it&#39;s a far more interesting dillemna to see if the sus player is being framed externally and has been framed because they are acting suspicious at day, and who is responsible for this, or whether it&#39;s a gambit to see whether they are bluffing to try and act like that, than to decide whether they are Fool, Scorned Tartget or Unseen.

I&#39;ll explain more when I have more time to write, but we all know the current issue: Whisper King meta. So the natural response is to make a non-BD King whisper reader. Having it on an NK is unineteresting, having it on Unseen/Cult would cause issues based on conversion swing, or OPness if it&#39;s on MM, so the natural response is  a Neutral Social clas.

So, my idea is to rework Fool into a usurper who wants to become King, which fits with his current lore, who reads whispers and can sell the info out to the Unseen/Cult. Here it is:

[details=&quot;The Class&quot;]
&gt; # The Fool
&gt; **Neutral Social**
&gt; **Fascination With The Crown (Passive)** - You hear all whispers to and from the King.
&gt; 
&gt; **Royal Blood (Passive)** - Same as now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trollbox (Day)** Same as current. (Infinite uses)
&gt; 
&gt; **Private Matter (Day)** Your whispers will be hidden from the public today. (Infinite uses)
&gt; 
&gt; **Annoyance** Occupy a player (Infinite uses)
&gt; 
&gt; **Hey, I&#39;m your King! I&#39;m allowed to look in your bedroom! (Night)** - Discover a player&#39;s class type (infinite uses)
&gt; 
&gt; _Your goal is to become King, as that is your birthright!_
Crowns to Foolish King:

&gt; # The Foolish King
&gt; **Neutral Special**
&gt; 
&gt; *Same passives as normal*
&gt; 
&gt; **Manic Frenzy (Passive)** You must use your abilities at any oppurtunity you can, or they will be randomly chosen.
&gt; 
&gt; **I&#39;d like to thank the academy.... (Day)** - Choose a side, BD or Unseen/Cult. You must help them with your abilities. (blocks out Payment to The Hidden or payment tio the dragon)Must be used upon being crowned. (1 use)
&gt; 
&gt; **Payment to the hidden (Night)** - Occupy a player, this will target a random non-unseen/cult player if you attempt to target Unseen/Cult. (4 uses)
&gt; 
&gt; **Payment to the Dragon (Night)** - Protect a player, this will target a random Bd player if you attempt to target  non-BD (4 uses)
&gt; 
&gt; *You&#39;&#39;ve won! Yay!*

*The class can be reworked to be any name you want, but I think it&#39;s a more interesting class than Fool as it has to use trickery and bribes and wit to win. Them not dying after becoming King is intentional, it gives them bargaining chips to play with.*
[/details]

**Please suggest changes to this class! Remember, it can be done as a seperate class called the Usurper if needed.**</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The core of ToL is <strong>Deduction.</strong> Deduction through abilities, votes and how a player is acting. In the classic game of good vs evil, then you have to ask this of your reads on players: Is this realy correct? Am I being messed with by abilities or are my reads SIMPLY WRONG? The punishment for getting your facts wrong is executing BD. You’ve all seen plenty of BD kings acting very suspicious, and executed them for it. That was bad play by BD, and BD should be punished for playing incorrectly.</p>
<p>Now let’s think about a person who could be Fool. You’ve seen someone TB’d, so you know there is a Fool/Scorned, so you have to be wary of accusations. This is normal, being wary of false accusations is part of the classic gameplay. is the accuser an evil person trying to put us on the wrong track because they win if we  do, or at least gain a significant benefit towards their wincon? Or are they genuinely trying to catch the evils.</p>
<p>A Fool acts like they  are Unseen/Cult, it’s just natural. They can show up as evil to investigatives, and they are actively trying to get the good guys to think they are evil. Here’s where the problem lies. As of today, the <strong>Punishment for lynching a fool is far greater than the punishment for lynching BD</strong>. Now, that may not seem that bad! It may seem like that’s what is supposed to happen, town read this persson wrong, so they should be punisheed.</p>
<p>But, by definition, Fool is evil. They are screwing with the town, they are screwing with the investigatives, and are acting like a decoy for the evil characters. A good fool play is indistiinguishable from evil to everyone. If you accept Fool is an evil class that is against the good players due to their wincon, then why should you be punished for getting your reads correct?  But that’s not all.</p>
<p>When you are on trial as a full evil member, someone might point out ‘Hey, he was acting like he was Evil! I bet he was Fool trying to act like evil!’. Now, this might sound fine, evils can escape from being executed. But then you reallise that acting like good is a lot harder than acting like obvious evil to get pardoned due to being Fool. Fool is a crutch to bad play, but in my opinion it works so effectively, and the idea of lynching a Fool terrifies BD so much, that nobody is going to bother acting like BD when they can just act like Fool. Sure, we have Prince, but once all BD killers are dead, suddenly the evils are rewarded for acting suspiciously.</p>
<p>In short, while I understand Fool as a crutch for bad play, it’s currently a crutch that’s better than walking, so how to fix it? The obvious step is to remove the crutch and force evils to act like they aren’t, blending in to the crowd rather than with the madmen. I’d say that a game without Fool would be a lot more interesting in terms of day phases for everyone.</p>
<p>But that’s unlikely to happen, because removing an entire class, which, while admittedly fun to play <strong>as</strong> is actually making BD more and more passive for every patch it stays in the game, even then it won’t be removed, because it’d get such a hhuge backlash. So, either you overhaul the class completely, to keep the art, name and lore, which is what I’ve done, and also to solve the whisper King meta, or…</p>
<p>You nerf the penalty for executing fool. I propose that we try a patch in which the penalty for lynching Fool is gone. We will test to see how the meta is afterwards, and if we like it then Fool stays as a slight niggling doubt in the back of the mind, and the real threat is lynching BD, or if we don’t like it we make BD far too passive out of fear of lynching someone who is acting suspicious as evil.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>The idea is that you are worried about Fool/Usurper selling out your info to evils in exchange for their vote.</p>

<p>Those are mutually exclusive hon, the Fool goes against social deduction. Is X being scummy, then lynch. YOU SHOULD ONLY BE WORRIED ABOUT A MISLYNCH.</p>

<p>It’s not unhealthy, whatever that means.  The game is about social deduction and the Fool encourages it.  “Is this guy acting evil because he’s evil or just wants us to think he’s evil?”</p>

            <p>If that’s the case here’s the rolecard:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>The Fool</h1>
<p><strong>Neutral Social</strong><br>
<strong>Fascination With The Crown (Passive)</strong> - You hear all whispers to and from the King.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Blood (Passive)</strong> - Same as now.</p>
<p><strong>Trollbox (Day)</strong> Same as current. (Infinite uses)</p>
<p><strong>Private Matter (Day)</strong> Your whispers will be hidden from the public today. (3 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Promise? (Night)</strong> - Make a deal with a player. Once you become King, they will be protected from the next negative action to target them. (Infinite uses, can only have 3 deals active, does not reveal Fool to them)</p>
<p><strong>Hey, I’m your King! I’m allowed to look in your bedroom! (Night)</strong> - Discover a player’s faction (infinite uses)</p>
<p><em>Your goal is to become King, as that is your birthright!</em></p>

            <p>I mean I coulld make it about finding the evils and communicating identity, with maybe an infinite shot use of Window Peek. I just had the idea of the whisper thing, and it sounded cool.</p>

            <p>The risk is that the evils kill them. Plus, did you even read the bit where ‘this can be a new classs’</p>

            <p>This is an awful idea.  Fool is perfectly fine as-is, and he should be forced to try to figure out who the evils are to communicate to them his identity.  Not some risk-free ability that does it for him.</p>
