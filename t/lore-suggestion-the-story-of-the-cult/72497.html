          <p><strong>The Cult</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the sweet blood flowing through all of our veins! This is what Mithras gave us to us, so we can obey his orders and show the way to the others. I can still remember that day when I looked into the eye of Corax, and I started this cult so we can worship the almighty gods. Oh the old king, what a fool he was! He made me his royal advisor. I was very pleased with it and I did everything to prove myself worthy. The beautiful women that I have seen back in the day! Oh, how good it was!</p>
<p>I was not religious, I didn’t care about religion, until They came. The candle in my room blew out, the wind was not blowing outside, and I couldn’t hear anything, just a voice. A voice so deep it touched my skin, crawled into my soul: “You are mine.” I tried to run away from it, I opened the door, but I only seen darkness there. The darkness looked into my soul and I’ve seen things I shouldn’t have: a wolrd burning down, blood everywhere, humanity fading away and the end was nigh.</p>
<p>The voice kept saying the same thing, but now whispering it into my head. I thought I was dreaming, but no. I was awake. My nose started bleeding, and it was all on the floor. I heard a laughter saying: “I think you are in, your blood will be the first to fall. You shall be the first to rule over the souls of the slaughtered.” I realised it now, warmth started going through me. “I am chosen! I am chosen!” - I screamt like a rat next to the oven. I asked the voice and the darkness: “Who are you?” The voice answered: “I am Mithras, your god, your ruler, and your master. You are mine. The darkness is Corax, who shall bring the obvlivion to the heathens, who didn’t obey us. And you shall be the one who will rule upon their souls. Now you shall sleep, and when you wake up, you’ll know everything.”</p>
<p>I’ve slept, and I had horrible, yet entertaining visions. I’ve seen mankind slowly growing while the mighty Mithras is watching them. Corax is sleeping, showing their face only to those who are dying. For a Ritualist, the best thing can happen is, that Corax pulls them to his sleep. It means they shall rule too, and they shall not be afraid of death. Soon I started the rites, getting my friends, my family and everyone into the service of Mithras. We became one.</p>
<p>The king knew someothing has changed, so I made him bleed. His blood was our first great sacrifice to Mithras. Corax shall devour the king, his soul can not be saved. The new King looks strange: I can not see into his soul. I don’t know if he is a believer or not, but if he tries to stop us, I shall tattoo myself with his blood.</p>
