    <description>**The Cult**

Ah, the sweet blood flowing through all of our veins! This is what Mithras gave us to us, so we can obey his orders and show the way to the others. I can still remember that day when I looked into the eye of Corax, and I started this cult so we can worship the almighty gods. Oh the old king, what a fool he was! He made me his royal advisor. I was very pleased with it and I did everything to prove myself worthy. The beautiful women that I have seen back in the day! Oh, how good it was! 

I was not religious, I didn&#39;t care about religion, until They came. The candle in my room blew out, the wind was not blowing outside, and I couldn&#39;t hear anything, just a voice. A voice so deep it touched my skin, crawled into my soul: &quot;You are mine.&quot; I tried to run away from it, I opened the door, but I only seen darkness there. The darkness looked into my soul and I&#39;ve seen things I shouldn&#39;t have: a wolrd burning down, blood everywhere, humanity fading away and the end was nigh. 

The voice kept saying the same thing, but now whispering it into my head. I thought I was dreaming, but no. I was awake. My nose started bleeding, and it was all on the floor. I heard a laughter saying: &quot;I think you are in, your blood will be the first to fall. You shall be the first to rule over the souls of the slaughtered.&quot; I realised it now, warmth started going through me. &quot;I am chosen! I am chosen!&quot; - I screamt like a rat next to the oven. I asked the voice and the darkness: &quot;Who are you?&quot; The voice answered: &quot;I am Mithras, your god, your ruler, and your master. You are mine. The darkness is Corax, who shall bring the obvlivion to the heathens, who didn&#39;t obey us. And you shall be the one who will rule upon their souls. Now you shall sleep, and when you wake up, you&#39;ll know everything.&quot;

I&#39;ve slept, and I had horrible, yet entertaining visions. I&#39;ve seen mankind slowly growing while the mighty Mithras is watching them. Corax is sleeping, showing their face only to those who are dying. For a Ritualist, the best thing can happen is, that Corax pulls them to his sleep. It means they shall rule too, and they shall not be afraid of death. Soon I started the rites, getting my friends, my family and everyone into the service of Mithras. We became one.

The king knew someothing has changed, so I made him bleed. His blood was our first great sacrifice to Mithras. Corax shall devour the king, his soul can not be saved. The new King looks strange: I can not see into his soul. I don&#39;t know if he is a believer or not, but if he tries to stop us, I shall tattoo myself with his blood.</description>
