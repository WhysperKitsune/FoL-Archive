Notes : You are basically a Neutral Killer that converts other people. You may decide when it&#39;s time to kill and when it&#39;s time to chill :sunglasses:. You only start with 1 Zombie(Which is why the Starting Zombie is so Special). Additionally , The Zombies are &quot;your minions&quot;(Like the Unseen/Cult Members). Conversion isn&#39;t stopped by a CW. It is stopped by Night Immunity or Healing(This means a Physician can heal himself/herself out of a Transformation).

PS : First class suggestion! Sorry for any mistakes!</description>

            <p>Also I don’t consider a zombie becoming a king since “Rotting” passive will be kept and you will die.</p>

            <p>Well you are right but I didn’t specify when you need to kill the player. You can do it at the start of the day or at the end.</p>

            <p>Something else, remove the restriction regarding Royal Blood and even allow the Prince to turn into a zombie. Right now there is nothing that the Necromancer can do to kill Royals and if many of them spawn then it’ll be difficult for them to do anything.</p>
<p>Also, what are your plans regarding the King? Can the King be turned into a zombie, and what happens if a zombie becomes King?</p>

<p>Love this idea! However, it feels more like a full fledged Faction than a Neutral Killer. Perhaps call it “The Undead” or “The Arisen”? That way, you also conveniently avoid the problem <span class="mention">@Sarun</span> outlines above.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IMO, the idea works better as a Neutral Killer. The level of expandability on the Zombie’s part, the lack of cooldowns for Transformation, and their duration makes the Necromancer less of a converter and more of a killer kind of character than a coverter.</p>
<p>Also for the sake of balance I’d remove the starting zombie and reduce the duration to two days and two nights. A conversion with no cooldown would be hellish to counter.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d just give the ability the power to kill all visitors. Having a reflexive mark for a daykill makes it too damn obvious that you’re a Necromancer.</p>

<p>You also get to design a matching BD class for it as well, maybe something like “the Purifier”?</p>

<p>Would have to only work on BD members and Neutrals. If a member of the Unseen/Cult is turned into a zombie then there’s nothing stopping them from outing the rest of their old faction to the court.</p>
