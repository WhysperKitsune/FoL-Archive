            <p>I like the idea of giving a choice to convert, if the King, however,</p>
<p><strong>For lore -</strong> He’s already made a decision, leading up to this event. People want him dead <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><strong>For balance -</strong> The Black Rose faction would have a huge advantage if they knew he was BR - a big thing that keeps The King from being OP is that no one <em>really</em> knows his faction except himself. You’ll have to deduct based on who he votes for.</p>

            <p>Hmm interesting perspective – I’ll talk it over with the team <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> He definitely can’t be “Cult” (a sub-neutral faction) faction member. This may make sense.</p>
<p>From a roleplaying perspective, our original thought is sort of like the mad king from Game of Thrones - if anything, he was neutral, serving his own purpose and, well, mad <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I personally don’t believe lowering the chances of the King being neutral would be necessary. If you feel that the King being neutral would somehow go against the intention of how his abilities should be used, I would say you may want to consider not allowing the King to be neutral. I can’t assume what your reasoning behind suggesting that a neutral King be rare are, but otherwise it may as well be just as common as the King being a member of any other faction. I would definitely support the latter of my suggestions, since I think that a player with large amounts of power who begins the game with only an alliegence to themselves could lead to some very interesting games full of betrayal, intrigue and mystery (exactly what the game’s about), and I don’t think that such a situation should be rare.</p>
<p>Sorry for such a late reply, but I’ve only just discovered this project and want to share my opinion.</p>
