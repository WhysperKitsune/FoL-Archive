    <title>New Player Training</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-player-training/37249</link>
    <description>As we all know, this game can be a little intimidating at first. Everyone has to start somewhere, but new players can sometimes feel overwhelmed (I totally did!).  I&#39;m here to help! I am going to start playing one or two games a night of newbie friendly games, after which I will make myself available for voice chat to answer questions.  I&#39;ll also start doing some educational streams where I will play the game and have someone watching the twitch chat to alert me to any questions.  Experienced players, you are definitely welcome too, as long as you remain friendly and help the new players as best you can. All I ask is that all the newbies get into the game.

I found a great group of people to help me learn the game, and now it&#39;s time to pass it forward.  You can find me on Discord as @coin operated#1988 and in game as RedneckHipster .</description>

            <p>FYI, we’re getting severe weather alerts (we’re gonna have two whole flakes of snow in Alabama!) so if I don’t show up, it’s because the abominable snow man ate me. I’m going to try to be around Monday - Thursdays at 8pm EST, however.</p>

            <p>I’d like to second this. While I am not a streamer I can use discord to watch someone play and explain what is going on at any given moment in game. I could also go basically the same thing as Redneck with discord instead of twitch.</p>
<p>My discord is: NuclearBurrito#4437</p>
