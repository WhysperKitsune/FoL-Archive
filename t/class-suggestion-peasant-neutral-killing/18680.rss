    <title>[Class Suggestion] Peasant (Neutral Killing)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-peasant-neutral-killing/18680</link>
    <description>**Peasant** - A mixture of the King&#39;s ditched &quot;royal blood&quot; ability and some silly fun. Similar to an evil Inquisitor, who doesn&#39;t need a specific class to exist in order to be in the game.

Passive:
**Cloak of Dung** - You cannot be investigated. (Will return typical block message.)

Day Ability:
**Repressed Dissent** - Cause your own votes for treason to be hidden, and your own vote of execute/pardon to appear reversed. (Unlimited)

_^ Your vote still counts as you&#39;ve actually voted, but everyone will SEE your Execute or Pardon vote come up as the opposite. &quot;Hey, I voted to pardon the Princess, don&#39;t blame me.&quot;_

Night Ability 1:
**I Didn&#39;t Vote For You** - Detect whether a player has royal blood. (Unlimited)

Night Ability 2:
**Poison Potato** - Attack a player. If they have royal blood, you will kill them. (3 uses)

Goal:
Murder or successfully vote to execute 2 players with royal blood.

Lore:
Your name&#39;s Dennis.</description>

            <p>It’s a dumb Simpsons reference. Mr. Burns’ family killed each other with poisoned potatoes. Just an idiotic joke name. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Lore-wise, potatoes seemed like a good thing for peasants to be able to get their hands on.</p>
