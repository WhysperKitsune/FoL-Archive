    <description>Time Traveler - Neutral killer
Passive: Time leap - If you would be killed or occupied then prevent all effects and then put you in the state you were in last night. They will think the ability succeeded*

Day ability 1: Hasten - Remove all cooldowns effecting your target. If they are poisoned or bleeding they will die from it next night. They will be informed at the start of the night if it did anything. Can target self. (3 uses) 
Day ability 2: Delay - Anyone visiting your target wont have the effects of the visit happen until next night. Invest ability&#39;s will be unaffected. Can target self. (2 uses)

Night ability 1: Snipe - Kill the target. If you did not kill last night then this doesn&#39;t count as a visit. 

The Passive works like this. If you would be occupied or killed then you are put in the state you were in last night.

Ex:

N1:none
N2: Poisoned (2)
N3: Poisoned (1)
N4: Killed - You are put in the state you were in N3 so poisoned
N5: Killed - You are put in the state you were in N4 so killed. You are dead.

Ex:

N1: Killed - put in the state you were in N0 so none
N2: Occupied - put in the state you were in N1 so killed. You are dead.

Hasten works on: MM/CL (removes cooldown on convert), Knight/Hunter/Prince (unlocks kill early), Merc (makes them suicide next night if looking for a contract), Technically it works on Sorc CoD too but they cant spawn together. You can use it if the Unseen/Cult are dying too fast and will be whiped out while that is still a bad thing. Does NOT work on the kings loyalty passive.

Delay works on: Kills, Heals, visit preventing night Ability&#39;s, Redirects, Occupys, Frames, Tailors, Possession (both kinds), Guards (both king and Knight), Defile, Mind warp and vote stopping Ability&#39;s.

With the CW/Sage/Ritualist the redirect on both players selected is delayed. With the Assassin 2 for 1 it only delays the target being delayed from dying. With the Possessors puppet strings if the first target is delayed then the Possession and kill both don&#39;t happen till next night. If the second Target is delayed then the Possession message goes through immediately but the kill itself is delayed. If the Possessor uses possess on a delayed target then he will find out their class immediately. If they die before next night then possess will be refunded. All Ability&#39;s have any feedback they get be unaffected.

Delay does NOT work on: The prince, Investigative Ability&#39;s, Self Target Ability&#39;s, Poison/Bleed or conversations.

Delay can be used to trigger snipes effect without missing a kill or to make killers/occupiers attack you all at once rather than over 2 nights.</description>

            <p>Should probably mention that snipe does not interact with haste but it does interact with delay in more ways than one.</p>
<p>If you use it and kill the delayed person then it’s secondary effect triggers. If you use it and kill the delayed target then you will kill them immediately dispite the delay.</p>

            <p>I changed hasten so that it can target self.<br>
If you are wondering why you would want to do that:</p>
<p>N1: none<br>
N2: Poisoned (1) hastened: Poisoned (0) and killed from poison. Time leap to N1 so none. You survive and are not poisoned.</p>
<p>Would like to point out that every NK can deal with poison/bleed (reaper self heal and poss jump). The only one that can’t is sorc who wins with unseen and cult.</p>
