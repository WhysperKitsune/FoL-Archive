    <title>So, this kind of happened</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/so-this-kind-of-happened/72944</link>
    <description> What happened?
Well there was a reaper, and when unseen died on n3, the reaper turned into the mastermind

What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Nothing

Steps to reproduce:
Take a look at this bug (or maybe explain if this was supposed to happen)

Comments:
A neutral class turned into the unseen, how is that possible
Is this a thing now?

Ok let me explain in better detail, this game was an hour ago, I was prince and the mastermind was executed on trial d3 (with a failed convert) when the reaper turned into MM, I exed him in jail the first night he was mm, meaning we won the game d4, because dead assasin and dead NK/MM

In jail he quoted “so, I was reaper, but then I turned into Mastermind” I honest to god thought he was lying, but that photo above was after the game, meaning this was no defile, this was real. The also were only a merc and pretender.

Weird right?</description>

            <p>Did the person who was reaper turned MM let you know he had changed into MM afterwards? If he wasn’t aware, something may have happened eg scorned defile.</p>
<p>That’s really weird if a reaper actually turned into the mastermind though, I’d be very surprised if this actually happened and the guy didn’t report it</p>

            <p>Theory, the mastermind tried to convert you, failed, but then it was a delayed effect? Something like that</p>
