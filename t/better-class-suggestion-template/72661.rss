    <title>&quot;Better&quot; Class Suggestion Template</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/better-class-suggestion-template/72661</link>
    <description>A lot of what @Ashe said in her post still applies, read that first lol

 https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/47799?u=orangeandblack5

That being said, I think cards look cleaner in this format:

&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=darkred]**The Scorned**[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Neutral Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Resolve (Passive) -** Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to death at night. This is lost when you achieve your objective.
&gt;
&gt;**Troll Box (Day) -** Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Frame (Night) -** Make your target appear suspicious to investigative classes. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;**Bait and Switch (Night) -** Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to live to see 3 members of the Blue Dragon publicly executed, or to live to see the Blue Dragon defeated.*

There are a few key differences:
- I use the &quot;big&quot; html tag instead of the header formatting (the # for the class name)
- I space out the different ability types to increase readability
- I format the number of uses such that they are italicized and in parentheses

I think this template looks the best by far, as it dodges the uncomfortable spacing issues of the header tag and groups relevant information in an easy-to-read format.

Here is the basic template, if you wish to fill in your own class&#39;s attributes:

```
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**[color=][/color]**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=][/color]**
&gt;
&gt;** (Passive) -** 
&gt;** (Passive) -** 
&gt;
&gt;** (Day) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;** (Day) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;
&gt;** (Night) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;** (Night) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is * 
```

Here&#39;s the example card I posted above, if you want a filled example to help you put in your own text:

```
&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=darkred]The Scorned[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Neutral Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Resolve (Passive) -** Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to death at night. This is lost when you achieve your objective.
&gt;
&gt;**Troll Box (Day) -** Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Frame (Night) -** Make your target appear suspicious to investigative classes. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;**Bait and Switch (Night) -** Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to live to see 3 members of the Blue Dragon publicly executed, or to live to see the Blue Dragon defeated.*
```

And here&#39;s proof that my method is better:

&gt;&lt;big&gt;**The King**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**Random Special**
&gt;
&gt;**Head of State (Passive)** - Your vote counts as two until you use *Decide Fate*. If the starting King is a **[color=steblue]Good King[/color]** and is executed, those with royal blood will be prevented from stepping up early.
&gt;**Tenacity (Passive)** - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing. If you are the **[color=darkred]Psychopathic King[/color]**, this ability also makes you immune to death at night.
&gt;
&gt;**Decide Fate (Day)** - Decide the fate of a player on trial. This removes the extra vote from your *Head of State* passive permanently. *(1 use)*
&gt;**Royal Finger (Day)** - Resets all votes. Only you or your target may be voted for the rest of the day. *(2 uses)*
&gt;**Replaced by:**
&gt;[color=grey]**Hide (Day)**[/color] - **[color=grey]Neutral King[/color]** exclusive. Nobody will be able to visit you tonight, regardless of immunities to occupation or preventions. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Guards! (Night)** - The King can summon a guard to protect a player. The guard will sacrifice himself for that player if an attempt is made on his life. If you are the starting King, you will have an extra guard, and if you are the starting **[color=steblue]Good King[/color]**, your guards will also protect against conversions. Whether the guard actually saves the player or not, the guard is spent. *(3 uses)*
&gt;**Replaced by:**
&gt;[color=darkred]**Order Execution (Night)**[/color] - **[color=darkred]Psychopathic King[/color]** exclusive. Send a guard to kill a player. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Starting King exclusive powers:**
&gt;[color=steblue]**Swear Fealty (Night)**[/color] - Starting **[color=steblue]Good King[/color]** exclusive. Make a player immune to conversion permanently. *(1 use)*
&gt;[color=purple]**Allies**[/color] [color=red]**(Night)**[/color] - Starting **[color=purple]Evil[/color]/[color=red]Cult King[/color]** exclusive. Discover if a player is a member of your faction. *(4 uses)*

            <p>Scorned not being bolded was an error</p>

            <p><s>Obligatory I like my format better</s><br>
But I do like this although I would consider bolding the name, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><big>The Scorned</big></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>looks better than:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><big>The Scorned</big></p>
</blockquote>
<p>, imo. (I think you even did bold it on the King one anyways though?)</p>
<p>At that point, it basically looks the same as my preferred method, but the spacing is different and clumps up the faction/type line with it, which I’m not a fan of as much.</p>
<p>Although, I can definitely see why you would separate the different ability types, especially on bigger cards like the merged King one, so I may end up ‘adopting’ that. As for the uses, I could pretty much go either way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>That being said, I think cards look cleaner in this format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><big><font color="darkred"><strong>The Scorned</strong></font></big><br>
<strong><font color="grey">Neutral Social</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Resolve (Passive) -</strong> Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to death at night. This is lost when you achieve your objective.</p>
<p><strong>Troll Box (Day) -</strong> Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. <em>(Infinite uses)</em></p>
<p><strong>Frame (Night) -</strong> Make your target appear suspicious to investigative classes. <em>(Infinite uses)</em><br>
<strong>Bait and Switch (Night) -</strong> Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity. <em>(3 uses)</em></p>
<p><em>Your objective is to live to see 3 members of the Blue Dragon publicly executed, or to live to see the Blue Dragon defeated.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use the “big” html tag instead of the header formatting (the # for the class name)</li>
<li>I space out the different ability types to increase readability</li>
<li>I format the number of uses such that they are italicized and in parentheses</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this template looks the best by far, as it dodges the uncomfortable spacing issues of the header tag and groups relevant information in an easy-to-read format.</p>
<p>Here is the basic template, if you wish to fill in your own class’s attributes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&gt; &lt;big&gt;**[color=][/color]**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=][/color]**
&gt;
&gt;** (Passive) -** 
&gt;** (Passive) -** 
&gt;
&gt;** (Day) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;** (Day) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;
&gt;** (Night) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;** (Night) -**  *( uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is * 
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the example card I posted above, if you want a filled example to help you put in your own text:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=darkred]The Scorned[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Neutral Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Resolve (Passive) -** Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to death at night. This is lost when you achieve your objective.
&gt;
&gt;**Troll Box (Day) -** Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. *(Infinite uses)*

&gt;**Frame (Night) -** Make your target appear suspicious to investigative classes. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;**Bait and Switch (Night) -** Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to live to see 3 members of the Blue Dragon publicly executed, or to live to see the Blue Dragon defeated.*
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s proof that my method is better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><big><strong>The King</strong></big><br>
