    <title>Aesthetic and colors of the Death Note</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/aesthetic-and-colors-of-the-death-note/41887</link>
    <description>Heiya liars !

First of all, thank you dev team for listen my suggestion about the access of the deathnote, now i&#39;m not bored anymore when i&#39;m dead !  

So i have 2 new suggestions which concern...The death note again ! :grin:

Its 2 simply thing (i think), First is to change the aesthetic of the death note. the second is to add 2 new colors. 

In this case, screenshot are better than words so here a couple of thing i did for showing you and support my sugg : 

So we have the classic death note here : https://puu.sh/zen39/24d416a1b8.png
Now my new version  : https://puu.sh/zeqn3/26f9a56fb6.png
The 2 version sideby side for a  better comparison : https://puu.sh/zeqVE/29f45ea14a.png

I think a more clear aesthetic death note like the one i did is way better. Its more &quot;realistic&quot;, old fashioned paper like papyrus, its refreshing and its in agreement with the Logs Book and the Private Note. 
I can do other model if you like it.


Now the colours ! 
Purple for the Unseen : https://puu.sh/zen8k/60d1a12326.png 
R:115 V:3 B:115 #730373

Blue for the Blue Dragon : https://puu.sh/zenbc/ec21bea0a3.png 
R:0 V:162 B:255 #00a2ff

And for showing you in situation, here some exemple : 

Blue with the classic death note : https://puu.sh/zentP/27fb394e24.png
Blue with my new version of the death note : https://puu.sh/zenvG/083ca5f4bd.png
Purple with the classic death note : https://puu.sh/zenAP/1c8a0ed3b3.png
Purple with my new version of the death note : https://puu.sh/zenBL/45b55cd6ba.png

The blue and purple should be accessible for every faction (or not, dont like that but why not)
Btw i used the same color reference of the .png logo of the unseen and BD for the colors (found in the wiki) 

So i personally think that the 2 colour i suggest doesn&#39;t match with the classic death note (especially the blue, purple is ok) but its totally match with my version :thinking: 


For the people who might gonna say &quot;its not a drawing game&quot; i consider the Death Note like super fun, even more in this type of game, it&#39;s little details like that who contribute to make the game better ! Buuut i can (hardly) understand you do not like this suggestion. Also Black and Red is a classic color match soo..

Anyway, thanks you for you attention :blush:</description>

            <p>I have difficulties to understand you reply (litteraly) <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
<p>I considere this color idea just for fun, Neut, Cult, BD and Unseen, every faction should be able to wrote a DN with the blue or purple.<br>
So nothing change, if a BD want to prove himselft with the DN he can wrote in red ,blue, black or purple, doesnt matter</p>
<p>Of course if only BD have access to the Blue (or purple just for unseen) it’s dangerous.</p>

            <p>Obviously just make it so that anyone can use any of the colors dispite them being themed after the factions</p>

            <p>Like the parchment idea, but the color idea isn’t great - since BD classes can still use death notes, allowing them to prove that they are BD with no room for doubt is dangerous</p>
