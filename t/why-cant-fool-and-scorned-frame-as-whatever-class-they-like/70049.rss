<blockquote>
<p>Giving him the option to frame as Unseen in a Cult game would also raise the skill floor of Fool, since if he frames the wrong faction it’s obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>actually for the most part if he hits the wrong faction the only thing that I can think of that would be effected is observer peak. Sheriff’s ability is “see if your target is a member of the unseen”. Meaning a fool framed as cult would technically just show as NS.</p>

            <p>I think it’s a lot smarter to get an Investigative claim to check you, Frame yourself as BD, do something vaguely suspicious and THEN Frame yourself as Unseen/Cult/NK, than just doing the obvious thing.</p>
<p>People tend to believe lies more easily when they think they themselves have figured things out and discovered the “truth” independently. Knowing how to lie is based on fabricating the illusion of agency, power and control on people, and Framing yourself as a BD class is a way to do that.</p>

            <p>For clarification, it would work like this.  Say Fool wants to frame himself as Neutral Killer.  He would choose any of the three NKs in order to appear Neutral and Killer/Offensive.  Right now, he can appear Neutral if he doesn’t frame but he would be Support/Social.</p>
<p>Giving him the option to frame as Unseen in a Cult game would also raise the skill floor of Fool, since if he frames the wrong faction it’s obvious.</p>
<p>I think it would be a bad idea to let people be framed as Blue Dragon classes though.</p>
