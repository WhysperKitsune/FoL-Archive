    <description>## :art: Want to make your own ToL class [for fun]? 

Introducing the Class Card Slate - a layered Photoshop PSD file where you can easily template up your own class for fun and to share with others! 

Even the font files are inside. All the faction icons/types are in there, too! Just toggle which icon you want to show. Don&#39;t want so many abilities? Just hide the layer folder, np. All the colors we use are there - use the eyedropper to get the exact color to match.

:bulb: Share your ideas in #lore 

:robot: Type `?slate` anytime in [Discord](https://discord.gg/tol) #bot-spam for a link to http://throneofli.es/slate

            <p>This is super cool!  Why in the world would it not be added in?  Nevermind, they brought back Allies and gave Alch 4 abilities after saying that wouldn’t be done so there is still hope <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>Would also be cool if King were to choose the class the Squire becomes.</p>
