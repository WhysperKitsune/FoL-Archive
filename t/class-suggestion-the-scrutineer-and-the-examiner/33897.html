          <p>Please be gentle while examining this. This is one of those suggestions that the creator is really fond of. With that being said, let’s work together to shape it into the best form it can possibly achieve.<br>
I have taken into consideration all the factors that our favorite forum critics love:</p>
<ol>
<li>She is convertible</li>
<li>She has no ability to prove herself</li>
<li>Not immune to anything</li>
<li>Has a somewhat challenging win condition<br>
Honestly, I’ve been looking at this for hours trying to find a mistake. Started writing it yesterday and took long pauses to think of holes in it and now I think it’s time to let you guys help me with that.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: Please <a class="mention" href="../../u/livicus.html">@Livicus</a>, tell me you like this, lol!</p>

<p>The Scrutineer [Neutral - Investigative]</p>
<p>Passive 1: We The People<br>
If a Neutral player or the Examiner nominate themselves to become the King, all other living Neutrals will be notified.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: On Neutral Grounds<br>
Any whisper that you send to or receive from a <strong><em>Neutral</em></strong> will be hidden from the public. This, however, will not work on whispers to and from a Neutral King.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Net Neutrality (Unlimited)<br>
Investigate a Player. If he is a Neutral, you will be notified. The King may not be targeted.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Neutral Eyes (3 uses)<br>
If the King uses his Allies ability tonight, you will also receive its information. You will not know who he targeted, but you will know if the player is Blue Dragon or Unseen/Cult. If, however, the player found by the King is Neutral, you will receive his number with the information.</p>
<p>Win condition: Make sure that no more than one Neutral loses.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Examiner [Unseen - Investigative]</p>
<p>Passive 2: Stand United<br>
If a Neutral player or the Examiner nominate themselves to become the King, all other living Neutrals will be notified.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: On Neutral Grounds (Unlimited)<br>
Any whisper that you send to or receive from a <strong><em>Neutral</em></strong> will be hidden from the public. This, however, will not work on whispers to and from a Neutral King.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Net Neutrality (Unlimited)<br>
Investigate a Player. If he is a Neutral, you will be notified. The King may not be targeted.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Neutralize Threats (2 uses)<br>
Discover a Player’s action. If that action is meant to harm an Unseen, he will be prevented from using it. This ability doesn’t work on Neutrals.</p>
<p>Win condition: Unseen wins.<br>

<details>
<summary>
Gender Preference</summary>
<p>This doesn’t add anything to the idea of the class but I just wanted everyone reading this to know that I imagine the Scrutineer as being a woman.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Side note on the Neutral Grounds day ability</summary>
<p>There is one interesting scenario here: If there is a mercenary in the game and he gets converted, you will maintain the ability to secretly whisper him. This happens to protect your identity and his. It avoids the “Look, 4 is whispering 9 a lot” and then you tell everyone you are the Scrutineer and it’s a quick bloody death for the converted fellow.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Details of the We The People passive</summary>
<p>Just for clarification, the message shown would be something like “[12] is attempting to become king, he seems trustworthy”. Yes, this could be used to prove yourself, but it wouldn’t really, would it? In a Scrutineer game, any Neutral attempting to become the King would activate this message. This means that even the Neutral Killer can claim Scrutineer and unless the Scrutineer counter-claims, which wouldn’t be wise, he’s “confirmed”. The only proof given by this passive is that there is a Scrutineer in the game.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Details of the Net Neutrality ability</summary>
<p>So, we have Alchemists who normally out themselves; Mercenaries who are somewhat easy to find; Fools who don’t really matter (unless you are an Examiner, then they truly matter); That leaves us with Scorned and Neutral Killers. So is this skill useless? Not in a million years. Let me remind you that Sheriffs are expected to find three players at maximum. If some Neutral players out themselves, that’s great! They did half the job for you, now you just need to help them stay alive. In the meantime, you get some information out of the King’s nights.<br>
Oh, so you found every Neutral Player in the game and now you have no need for your abilities? You’re not alone, miss. Just remember how Sheriffs and Paladins are rendered useless after the evil faction is dealt with and yeah, even though that is not the most frequent occurrence, it’s not rare.<br>
Also, Hunter says hi.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Information on the Neutral Eyes ability</summary>
<p>This ability can be used normally to find Neutrals, like your first night ability, but its main purpose is not that. There are numerous times when an Evil King (or a Neutral one) finds an evil faction member and doesn’t execute him the next day. This ability is here so that you make them stay on their toes and think twice before doing that. You can find that information and choose to ally with him, but you can also out him and get yourself a crown. Also, with Neutral Eyes, you can try to intervene in the formal execution of a Neutral found by the King since you will know beforehand of the Neutral presence. Most Kings, after finding their first Neutral, give them the chance to out and I have seen a lot of Neutrals not outting and getting executed because of that. With the “On Neutral Grounds” passive, you can alert them “Hey, King meant you when he said he found a Neutral, you better claim something to him” and no one else will know.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Details of the Neutralize Threats ability</summary>
<p>If you aim this ability at a Neutral, it will say that you were prevented from visiting the player. Abilities that ignore night immunity also ignore this.</p>
</details>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<p>Changed the winning condition (As suggested by Nuclear Burrito). The previous one was one out of the following three: Either the NK wins, or all Neutrals besides the NK survives or you survive after becoming Neutral King.<br>
Cleaned it up, as asked by Nuclear Burrito.<br>
Turned On Neutral Grounds passive into an unlimited day ability (Also suggested by Nuclear Burrito)</p>

<p>This could basically confirm someone as a Neutral, but the idea is nice, and would allow for some communication.</p>
<p>And I like Net Neutrality but I don’t like the ability Neutral Eyes, as classes shouldn’t benefit from what the King finds. What about a different ability?</p>

<p>This could basically confirm someone as a Neutral, but the idea is nice, and would allow for some communication.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It could, yeah. But those involved would never know unless they outted and asked: “Hey, did you guys see my last whisper to [14]?”. So it’s basically a Passive that requires trust between Neuts. I think it falls into the same category as not claiming to a Psychic because he may get converted.</p>

<p>And I like Net Neutrality but I don’t like the ability Neutral Eyes, as classes shouldn’t benefit from what the King finds. What about a different ability?</p>

</aside>
<p>We could definitely think about a new ability! This ability was made as a weapon against evil kings so that Scrutineers could out them and get the crown, considering it’s one of her winning conditions.</p>
