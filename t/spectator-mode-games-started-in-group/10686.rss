    <title>Spectator Mode (Games started in Group)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/spectator-mode-games-started-in-group/10686</link>
    <description> - What do you want? : I want to allow at least 8 people to spectate a match that started in the group.

- Why do you want it? : This will allow people to watch games especially the host who created the group. This will provide more options to people who are trying to make a tournament.

- Why does Throne of Lies need it? : What I stated before, this will provide more options for the players making a better experience. This will also allow Streamers or Youtubers to provide a game for their audience. Bringing in more of a following. Also, this will allow easier testing the game for the developers.

- Any disadvantages of having it? : This will provide more options for cheaters who are using Skype to talk to more people, who ain&#39;t playing the game. Having an outside view who ain&#39;t in a losing or winning situation, will provide good info to them.

- What/Why did you think of this? : Lunamink a small streamer is trying to make a tournament in Throne of Lies. He did so much math and calculations. But he doesn&#39;t want to part-take into the action, messing the flow of the tournament. With Spectator mode, it will help him a lot. Please make this, to make Lunamink life so much easier.</description>

            <p>We might become too ambitious for a game with a small player base. But if it grows, this should be added.</p>

            <p>I’d love a feature to save a match so it could be viewed later! Even if just from your perspective</p>

            <p>I think this would only be a good feature for private matches, anything regarding public matches would lead to issues with sniping/cheating etc. Players who are spectating could easily be watching the streamer in the players place and leak that info to a player in the game.</p>

            <p>I fully support under one caveat. Spectators get no special information that is not availible to all live players in the game. IE they don’t know who is currently converted, what’s going on in dead chat etc…</p>
<p>That being said I also would fully support a feature that allows saving of replays for games at the end screen, which could be played back and looked through from all perspectives. As well as shared with friends for games that had particularly interesting or funny things happen.</p>
