&gt; **Day:**
&gt; **Asterism (inf use):** Learn if your target is part of a constellation and if yes, which one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Night:**
&gt; **Stargaze (inf use):** Choose 2 players and identify if they are part of a constellation. If they are a pair you will learn their classes. This can target dead players.

[details=&quot;Ability Feedback&quot;]
&gt; Asterism:
&gt; Kape [4] holds a constellation. They are Orion!
&gt; Kape [4] isn&#39;t part of your star map.
&gt; 
&gt; Stargaze:
&gt; You have identified Kape [4] as Assassin and Fake Claiming [14] as Noble. They are Andromeda!
&gt; At least one of your targets is part of a constellation.
&gt; Your targets don&#39;t hold the same constellation sign.
&gt; 
&gt; Galaxy Cross:
&gt; Your target was visited by Orion, Orion and Cassiopeia last night.
&gt; Your target wasn&#39;t visited by any constellations last night.
&gt; 
&gt; Win condition:
&gt; You have identified Andromeda! You still need to find Orion and Cassiopeia.
&gt; You have completed your Star Map, finding all constellations!
[/details]

King cannot be part of a constellation.
Constellation names: Orion, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, etc.</description>

            <p>i’d say it’s not strictly worse than inq due to inq being less appealing to keep around generally, but i see what you mean</p>
<p>and as it stands this class does seem very RNG, yes</p>
