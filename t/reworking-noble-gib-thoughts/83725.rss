    <description>**Noble (BD Social)**

**Passives:**

**Royal Blood:**
Just Royal Blood.

**Day Abilities:**

**Political Pressure (2 uses):**
Force one of your spied targets to vote and prevent voting from them for the rest of the day.

**Decriminalize (1 use) (WIP):**
Force pardon one of your spied targets.

**Night Abilities:**

**Maid Spy (inf uses):**
Spy on a player with a maid, hearing all whispers to and from them, and mark them as spied. You can only have 3 spied targets at a time.

**Listen Conversation (4 uses): (Kinda WIP? idk)**
Listen in on a spied players conversation, knowing what class groupings visited your target.

*Your target was visited by a/some Special or Investigative classes.*
*Your target was visited by a/some Support or Social classes.*
*Your target was visited by a/some Killer or Offensive classes.*

**Aristocrat (Unseen Social)**

**Passives:**

**Royal Blood:**
I‚Äôll add the description later ok üò°

**Day Abilities:**

**Political Pressure (2 uses):**
Force one of your spied targets to vote and prevent voting from them for the rest of the day.

**Object (1 use):**
Force execute or pardon one of your spied targets.

**Night Abilities:**

**Framermaiden (inf uses):**
Spy on a player with a maid, hearing all whispers to and from them, and mark them as spied. You can only have 3 spied targets at a time. They will also be framed until they are investigated.

**Listen Argument (4 uses):**
Listen in on a spied players argument, knowing what class typings visited your target.

This is kinda WIP so give suggestions plz :). I wanted to keep some of Noble‚Äôs old flavors (Gossip = Listen Conversation|Court Spy = Maid Spy.) I kinda have ideas in mind for back-up abilities if you don‚Äôt like the current ones. For example abilities that target multiple ‚Äúspied‚Äù players or maybe more abilities that *harm* the target involved.</description>

            <p>Well<br>
Noble happens to be a better investigative than every single investigative<br>
Political Pressure makes it impossible to fake for most classes<br>
It can confirm tons of people and itself with mechanics, which is what observer can‚Äôt do<br>
That‚Äôs why noble needs a rework</p>
<p><small>can we just make listen conversation into gossip for current noble</small></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have to ask; what‚Äôs the point/reason to rework Noble?</p>
<p>Right now they appear as a means to confirm BD claims, and they have some political power especially in the late game. They are prime targets to make King as a confirmed Gossip is on par with Observer in difficulty to fake and the Noble is easier to live without as they are only supplementary to other invest classes.</p>
<p>This rework would only seem to make them even worse than they are, with a possible exception for Aristocrat.</p>
