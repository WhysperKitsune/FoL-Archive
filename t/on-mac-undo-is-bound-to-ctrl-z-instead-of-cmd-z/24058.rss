    <title>On Mac, Undo is bound to Ctrl-Z instead of Cmd-Z</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/on-mac-undo-is-bound-to-ctrl-z-instead-of-cmd-z/24058</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I tried undoing a change to my logs with Cmd-Z. Nothing happened. Instead, Ctrl-Z is undo.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Cmd-Z should have performed Undo, as Cmd-C/X/V are the Mac ToL clipboard hotkeys and Cmd-Z is system-normal.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Type something on Mac, try to Undo with Cmd-Z. Then try with Ctrl-Z.

#### Comments:

This has screwed me over in trials a whole bunch. :/</description>
