    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Deceiver. Neutral Killer</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-deceiver-neutral-killer/23180</link>
    <description>The Deceiver is a Neutral Killer aimed at causing as much chaos and confusion as possible.
Goal: Eliminate the Blue Dragon, Cult, Unseen and any other types of Neutral Killers. (Same as Reaper) or win through &#39;But Wait! Theres More!&#39;
Conversion Immune.

**Passive 1: It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors**
Your visits will be hidden from others at night. (Same as the Inquisitor)

**Passive 2: Vanishing Act**
Death and Occupy immune.

**Night Ability 1: Flip a coin** _Unlimited Uses_
Choose 2 targets. At random, 1 target will die while the other will be appear responsible for that death (Similar to being framed)
The &#39;framed&#39; target will appear as; (ONLY FOR THAT NIGHT)
&gt;Unseen/Cult to King,Observer,Sheriff and or Paladin
&gt; Killer/Offensives to the Princess (Regardless of what they actually are)
&gt; As if they visited the dead target for Princess and Observer (Regardless of who they actually visited)

_^Don&#39;t you love a bit of chaos? Even the Deceiver will be surprised to see who dies. This ability has potential to throw another player under the bus, thus making them suspicious and potentially target for execution the next day. Not only that, those who get false information from this ability will then ALSO be suspicious_

**Night Ability 2: Dirty Work** _Unlimited Uses_
Choose 1 target, killing them, bypassing night immunity. You will lose your Vanishing Act passive that night.
_^This ability is high risk as you will be able to be killed and occupied that night. You would use this ability in certain circumstances which require you to kill a specific player that night, rather than taking the 50/50 risk from Flip a coin. This also allows you to kill someone if there is only yourself and them alive._ 

**Day Ability: Ventriloquism** _2 Uses_
Functions exactly like troll box. 

_Comments:_ The Deceiver wishes to draw as little attention to himself as possible. Wise uses of Ventriloquism coupled with Flip a coin can result in mass confusion and chaos. Even in death, the Deceiver will continue to cause panic as many will still believe the Neutral Killer is at large.

            <p>Dirty Works initial intention was so he is able to actually KILL the last alive player, since Flip a Coin won’t be able to work. The First Day ability was originally supposed to have a different impact on the game, but was changed to many times. Ill revisit Dirty Work and tamper/remove the first day ability.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input!</p>

            <p>I think his first ability should just be scrapped.  A big part of being NK is surviving to the end, that’s how all NKs work.  So I don’t think it’s a good idea to give a Deceiver who has failed to effectively defend himself an easy out by just taking an easy gamble and pick which side he thinks is gonna win.  Because you realize that’s what’s gonna happen every game, right?  Their trial defense will be:<br>
“Oh, you guys got me, I’m Deceiver.  I’m gonna go with BD so hopefully you guys win.”</p>
<p>Secondly, why would a Deceiver ever drop his immunities for Dirty Work if he can still kill with Flip a Coin?  I think Dirty Work should go through night immunities to make it a truly risk/reward move, but only 1 or 2 uses so you can deal with any night immune classes like MM if you think you’ve found them.</p>
<p>So if you drop the first day ability, then between the troll box, Flip a Coin, and revised Dirty Work, he should be a good NK</p>

            <p>Yeah, I suppose you’re right, My original idea was that the Deceiver would take the place of the class that he faked to be when he dead when a real version of that class actually died within 2 days, but that seems either to complicated or overpowered.</p>

            <p>Not that. First of all you are technically dead. They just think you are a different class. Second of all how do both other factions die when the only people trying to kill one faction are part of the other?</p>
