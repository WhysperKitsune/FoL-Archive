    <title>[Mod-Exclusive Cosmetic] Banhammer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mod-exclusive-cosmetic-banhammer/2609</link>
    <description>We all know the mods put a lot of work volunteering their time into well, moderating the discord- and when the game hits release.. I&#39;d hate to be a downer, but every game had those trolls and throwers. So we&#39;ll need those mods, or GMs as many games abbreviate them as, to manage game-reports. As the devs will likely be busy devving they need not stress over reports, that&#39;s what the mods are for!!! 

Anyways, I have a relatively simple idea. 
A cosmetic weapon which is exclusive to moderators. The weapon would be a hammer that banishes he (or she, it?) whom is being executed through a Portal to the Nether-reaches (underworld?hell?)

I feel it would be a sweet little reward for the awesome mods that moderate this community. Shout out to mommy @Queen_Alfa . 

P. S. The execution effect, I can see it in my mind. A Portal opens behind the guiltied person, as if a tear in reality (magic of course my dear Watson!), and the executioner smacks him info it with the hammer.</description>
