    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-brotherhood-w-classes/1826</link>
    <description># [color=Red]Please read:[/color] 
I know, it&#39;s going to be a whole while before we get a new evil team to play with but, I came up with this little idea a while ago and it&#39;s taken me almost a small while to write something up for it and I wanted to show my current efforts.

-------
# [color=Orange]The Brotherhood[/color]

The Blue Dragon thought they were safe? The Unseen and The Cult were just the beginning. Late one night, the guards left the gate unlocked and enter The Brotherhood. A pacifist crime syndicate with the goal to recruit as many as they can to control the court and defeat the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who would oppose them, rather than mercilessly killing at night. With their brilliant tactics and strategies, they are a tough crew to crack.

            <p>Is this actually true, Plex? The Assassin replaces the Mastermind on the computer game? The last time I played, which admittedly wasn’t too recently, this didn’t occur. And there is no passive on the Mastermind indicating that this happens.</p>

            <p>It was likely a bug.</p>
<p>If Mastermind dies before N3, the Assassin will replace him. I don’t need to ask any Guides about it because I was the first Guide.</p>

            <ol>
<li>Princess flirt reveals infiltrator as special/investigative. Rare is the princess that will out this information in order to get them killed; MM and cult leader also have this result.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for maid, maid can also reveal mastermind, and mastermind cannot be replaced as well. The brotherhood was not designed with the maid in mind.</p>

            <p>I wrote all of that well aware that could’ve been the case.</p>
<p>Since this is the case, Brotherhood is exceptionally weak against the Maid and Princess roles. A lucky N1 Flirt or D1 or D2 Poke Around could seal a BD victory by itself if they find the Infiltrator. They’ll still have the Associate to convert with I guess, but they’d be severely handicapped.</p>
<p>Interesting. In terms of redundancy, the Cult still maintain that special niche of always having their Cult Leader exist. Unseen has this advantage to a small extent. Brotherhood does not, though this is slightly made up by the fact they have a redundant converter role.</p>
<p>With this new info, I predict future FoL Brotherhood games to be extremely feast or famine. Either the head of the snake is cut off immediately and Brotherhood flails until ultimately succumbing, or they +2 and eventually +3 every night because the only way to find the Infiltrator is to have a Knight Cold Steel him, Princess Flirt or Maid match. Serious scum reading will be necessary in order to find the Infiltrator which is a good thing for this game.</p>
<p>I ultimately like the class, and still believe it is a more powerful faction than either Unseen or Cult.</p>
<p>But that is welcome because BD is an extremely powerful faction too.</p>

            <p>Therefore thanks for your wall of text…<br>
But that was based on if the Infiltrator gets replaced and simply they don’t.</p>
<p>Changing everything overall.<br>
However, would be interesting to see what you think now you’ve heard the truth of the converters</p>

            <p>Ummm no.<br>
Infiltrator is the original and Associate can now convert when either Infiltrator fails or he’s dead.<br>
However, Associate has a 1 night cooldown.</p>
<p>Also, once Associate dies too, they’re not replaced. That’s if I remember correctly from the Brotherhood game and what Plex told me <strong>should</strong> have happened</p>

            <p>Because if that is the case, Brotherhood is simply strictly better than Cult.</p>
<p>Cult Leader is hilariously underpowered compared to the Infiltrator, so let’s not even compare it. Comparing Infiltrator to the Mastermind instead – (assuming people are promoted to Infiltrator)</p>
<p><strong>Advantage Infiltrator</strong></p>
<p>No cooldown on conversion<br>
Permanently immune to the power investigative<br>
Useful day ability<br>
Is always replaced no matter how far into the game you are</p>
<p><strong>Advantage Mastermind</strong></p>
<p>Can hide from Princess for the first 3 days (appears as Observer or whatever)</p>
<p><em>Which would you rather choose for your scum leader?</em></p>
<p><strong>Card Counting</strong></p>
<p>When you convert somebody, you are simultaneously removing an enemy and adding an ally, giving you +2 towards majority. Killing an enemy grants you +1 towards majority. We are going to be thinking of this in a blackjack card counting sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>The Unseen</strong> have an incredibly strong start at the beginning of each game. The Mastermind converts somebody (+2) and the Assassin kills somebody (+1) and also poisons somebody the next day (+1). We are assuming the poison will be successful in this case because this analysis is looking at best case scenarios for each faction and determining their potential for blow out games. Unseen’s best case pattern is +3, +1, +3, +2, +3 for each night respectively.</p>
<p><strong>The Cult</strong> have a decent start with conversion (+2) but follows up with (+0) the night after because of the cooldown. Using the Cult Leader’s killing ability also grants (+0) because the death of a fellow Cult cancels out the death of your enemy. At best, Cult’s pattern is +2, +0, +2, +0, etc…</p>
<p><strong>The Brotherhood</strong> have an even better start than the Cult (+2) only because their conversion is less likely to fail. Due to no cooldown on conversion, the Brotherhood can (+2) every single night. Brotherhood’s best pattern is +2, +2, +2, +3 (because of Brother’s kill), +3 (Broken’s kill)</p>
<p>Even if the Infiltrator fails to recruit, the Associate still has a chance even though it puts conversion onto a cooldown.<br>
<strong><em>Even if only the Associate was the one making the conversions, Brotherhood would still be on par with Cult.</em></strong></p>
<p>That really just says how bad Cult is on FoL honestly.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s an argument over which conversion classes are better than others between the 3 factions, but that’s another story. I’m personally in the opinion of;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brotherhood</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unseen</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cult</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>ordering of power.</p>
<p>To summarize, the Brotherhood has a powerhouse Scum Leader that no other special leader compares to, a max member count of 6 including (The Broken) while converting even faster than the Cult (with a max party of 4), and very useful member abilities that can cause a lot of disruption.</p>
<p>To conclude, I believe the Brotherhood is grossly overpowered.</p>

            <p>Does the Infiltrator work the same as the Cult Leader where somebody is promoted to Infiltrator once the original dies?</p>
