    <description>Replace **Bomb Swap** with:
&gt;# Jinx
&gt;Place a bomb on an additional player today, but it will be a dud if you did not select their correct class.

The user interface would be the same as for Defile.  It would have infinite uses and be usable the same day as Walking Bomb.</description>

            <p>And again. Facelift is much MUCH stronger than any given instance of this because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can chose the class being used to fake it</li>
<li>You can chose what they publicly say before the body drops</li>
<li>There is no risk of their logs being contradicted by private information being communicated from them in whispers/jail/mystic link/other private communication</li>
<li>The ability ALSO POSSESSES SOMEONE, which has it’s own completely unrelated benefits</li>
<li>The ability gives you the logs of a player without anyone even thinking they were supposed to receive it for an extended period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these effects are highly beneficial and non-existent in with this change.</p>
<p>There are of course a ton of benefits to being able to edit logs. But it’s not JUST a better facelift anymore than expert investigation is a better window peek.</p>

<p>nonono. There is the additional limitation of the fact that you cannot control what they say before they have been reaped. That means doing this carry’s some risk.</p>
<p>For one, there is the fact that under most circumstances besides maybe very early on most possible candidates for X would have already claimed and thus it wouldn’t make sense for a Princess to hide this information, thus Reaper.</p>
<p>If you have a gray area then you have a physician check to see if it was a reaper and bam you know it’s probably fake. Possible workaround for the reaper is to claim physician yourself and say it’s not reaper, which itself it get you Killed and if successful was also earned.</p>
<p>And most importantly. THIS IS INTENDED. I am specifically saying the reaper should have the ability to attempt this sort of thing with the explicit expectation that they will attempt to both frame innocents and remove information about themselves from someone’s logs.</p>
<p>Heck, it’s one of the key buffs in my own suggested reaper change.</p>

</aside>
<p>Deleting the entire thing is possible but ultimately just makes it obvious that they were reaped.</p>
<p>9/10 times it’s best to leave it in and add an extra night of logs.</p>
<p>This isn’t even comparable to facelift. You have 0 control over what public information gets outed and their class will always flip correctly baring an Herbalist figuring things out ahead of time.</p>
<p>It ultimately would usually just be best to add an extra night with additional use being either niche or high skill, both of which are acceptable for an NK.</p>
<p>So I’d just give him full editing access and accept all of the consequences of doing so. Possibly giving a soul cost to doing so if absolutely required.</p>

            <p>Well the odds of an Observer finding her with that change would go from 1/7 to 1/14 on N1 and increasing each night significantly. This is true regardless of which aspect of follow is being used. While that is a significant change in odds it’s still luck based either way without a deliberate read (which is NOT luck based either way)</p>
