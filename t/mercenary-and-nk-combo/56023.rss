    <title>Mercenary and NK combo</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mercenary-and-nk-combo/56023</link>
    <description>  **Greetings my fellow members of the Kingdom of Lies**

I will be suggesting a feature for the game that I thought of when i was trying to sleep the night before this post got posted. Quite weird huh? 

Anyway, to make things short, I am suggesting a feature about the **Mercenary**. So, you should already know that the **Mercenary** is a guarding class, whose contracted player(s) *cannot* be a Fool, Scorned or the King. That means they *can* be the Neutral Killing or Unseen / Cult.
The addition of the Psycho King really inspired me when thinking of this idea. Basically, if the Mercenary gets to contract with the Neutral Killing (Reaper, Sorcerer but not Possessor because of the jump ability), they get to become the &quot;Crazed Mercenary&quot;. When converted to that type, the Mercenary still needs to protect their target and will be receiving **support abilities**.
Those include:

 - Day Abilites

**&gt; Neutral Support** - _Make your contracted killer look as a member of the Blue Dragon to the Observer&#39;s Peek and as a non-attacking player to the Princess&#39;  Will-O-Wisp and the Observer&#39;s Follow on the following night._ (2 uses max)

- Night Abilities

**&gt; Stand Guard** - _Prevents others from visiting your target and makes you immune if your target is attacked._ (4 uses max)
**&gt; Double Shot** - _Makes your killing buddy kill/reap an extra random target along with their selected one. The target cannot be the Mercenary itself and does not bypass Night Immunity._ (2 uses max every 2 nights)

- Passives

**&gt; Failure** - _If your Neutral Killing buddy dies, you will commit suicide the following night._
**&gt; Enhanced Armor** - _You will be immune to the first 3 attacks you receive. The Armor is not consumable if you get healed / protected by a Knight._ 
**&gt; Nothing Wrong Here** - _Once dead, you will appear as a simple Mercenary to the public._

Yes, the combo seems too overpowered and I agree to that too. Some touching would surely be needed if implemented. I just wanted to share it with you for my own sake. Hope you enjoyed!

**Chocolate suggested this change to the Enhanced Armor ability. What do you think?**

-Select a target. That target will be attacked/reaped along with this one. If you select a target who already would have died, or the ability fails, you get your use back
(2) uses</description>

            <p>It was added as previously NKs became Neutral Kings, and because of that the NK meta shifted to becoming king ASAP as it was far easier to become a Neutral King and survive rather than killing both opposing factions.</p>

            <p>What did Psycho King add to the game? It was simply a new type of role suggestion.<br>
I believe it would be cool for it to be added.</p>

<p>“Hide the Body” not really sure, but also ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Definitely sounds better, I might as well include it to the thread and give you credit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How about this<br>
Cursed Armor: Immune to death. When dead, appear as a Mercenary to the public. [unless of course herbalist/poss you know]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combining them in one passive was thought, but I don’t think that name fits 100% perfectly.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply though!</p>
