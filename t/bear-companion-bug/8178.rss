    <title>Bear companion bug!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bear-companion-bug/8178</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was a hunter. It was a cult game with a reaper. Night 1, nothing happens. Day 2, I talk a lot of smack to get people to attack me. Night 2, I drop the new fancy bear companion. That night, someone attacks me, it says it bypasses my night immunity and I die. I was not reaped. My attacker didn&#39;t die.

I confirmed with the cult leader at the end of the game that he used empower eradicate on me n2. I died, he didn&#39;t die. I also confirmed with the NK (reaper) that he did not reap me. There was no alch.

The only person who attacked me on n2 was the cult leader using empowered eradicate.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should have died due to the empowered eradicate, but the cult leader should have also died.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Empowered eradicate a hunter using bear companion.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m very sure this ability is bugged. I got attacked very late in the game when I had bear companion up. I didn’t die (got the immunity), but my attacker didn’t die (there was 1 assassin, 1 mastermind left), so the assassin had to have attacked me, but then he didn’t die.</p>
<p>The MM did however die, though I’m not sure if that’s coincidental and the prince just executed him or also part of the bug.</p>

            <p>In Jano’s case, he said he didn’t die. In my case, I did (which makes sense because empowered eradicate), but the cult leader randomly lived and there was no alch in the game (though I don’t remember if there was a phys, but even if there was, that’d be a pretty yolo heal on n2).</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I was a hunter. It was a cult game with a reaper. Night 1, nothing happens. Day 2, I talk a lot of smack to get people to attack me. Night 2, I drop the new fancy bear companion. That night, someone attacks me, it says it bypasses my night immunity and I die. I was not reaped. My attacker didn’t die.</p>
<p>I confirmed with the cult leader at the end of the game that he used empower eradicate on me n2. I died, he didn’t die. I also confirmed with the NK (reaper) that he did not reap me. There was no alch.</p>
<p>The only person who attacked me on n2 was the cult leader using empowered eradicate.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I should have died due to the empowered eradicate, but the cult leader should have also died.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Empowered eradicate a hunter using bear companion.</p>
