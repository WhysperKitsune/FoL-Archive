    <title>I can&#39;t open my game, at all?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-cant-open-my-game-at-all/41956</link>
    <description>So I was playing, and I stopped playing for a couple of hours or so. I open steam, and I double click to open, and it won&#39;t open, like at all? Nothing happens, it just says running, syncing, then goes back to &quot; ready to play &quot;. Help please? I have mac. My ToL username is qoaq. Is it possible I&#39;ve been banned or something?</description>

            <p>Ok – seems like it’s a Mac issue with the latest update – I wonder if the new build got corrupted. Seems like 2 hours ago, you were still on the OLD build, somehow, which is the only way this would make sense. I’ll check it out. Until then, I recommend keeping an eye on Discord <span class="hashtag">#news</span> @ <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a></p>
<p>Probably will take me <s>an hour</s> 2 hours ish (I’m in a meeting, so multitasking may take me a bit longer)</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, in Discord, type <code>?rank mac user</code> to get mac specific news pinged to you.</p>

            <p>Yeah, so I was currently in a game and a notification came up saying that theres a new version or whatever, butI stayed in the game, thinking I would have gotten banned because I was alive. After the game, I forgot and continued playing. I don’t think I emailed you guys, though.</p>

<p>Hey, wait – did you recently email us? If not, it may be a bad version upload. Maybe you were on the old version 2 hours ago, THEN updated, and now it doesn’t work?</p>
<p>If you DID email us… then yea, Steam support ftw.</p>
<p>If you DIDN’T email us… then someone else on Mac has this issue and maybe it’s an issue for others? Standby, in that case, but let us know.</p>

<p>D: we don’t even have access to pre-launch – I’m not very good at diagnosing Mac stuff. Get anything new lately? Try updating graphics drivers, update your OS … I’m only guessing, at this point <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>Hi there –</p>
<p>This is a pre-launch issue, so it’s some sort of Steam issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you try turning your computer off and on again?</li>
<li>Right click the game &gt;&gt; properties &gt;&gt; VERIFY INTEGRITY. Try again.</li>
<li>Reinstall, as last resort.</li>
<li>Contact Steam support as last, last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially since it was working a couple hours ago, we haven’t changed anything for ~10 hours. Rebooting and/or verifying integrity will probably fix this issue, if I were to guess.</p>
