    <title>Special Gamemode Idea: Custom Classes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/special-gamemode-idea-custom-classes/459</link>
    <description>Now, I&#39;m not saying code every suggested classes for a gamemode, here&#39;s my idea

You enter a class-creator sort of thing and can enter names and factions and whatever(for neutrals you can pick between the Possessor, Fool and Alchemist wincons)

You can then create class abilities as a sort of &quot;If X then Y&quot; sort of thing, X would be something like &quot;Killed&quot; or &quot;Visits a player&quot; or whatever, and Y would be something like &quot;Kill target&quot; or &quot;Occupy King&quot; or whatever

Players can pick whether to make it convert immune or to create a BR class for it or whatever

Players can save their custom classes and put them in games in this one gamemode if they are the lobby host

Example;
Billy goes to the Class Creator and creates the following
&gt;Name: Billy&#39;s Sample Class
Faction: Blue Dragon
Type: Support
Day Ability 1: Test - If **accused** then **die**
Night Ability 1: Example - Visit player, if **Player Class** is equal to **Reaper** then **Feedback** = &quot;Oh no, a Reaper&quot;
Night Ability 2: Something - If **killed** then **convert** **self** to class **Butler**



Note: I know this almost certainly would never be implemented, but it&#39;s just a thought</description>

            <p>I’m aware that huge steps would need to be taken to make sure that it doesn’t get out of control<br>
It was just a concept for something that could be added in the far future</p>

            <p>This certainly would allow for massive replayability (besides the already immense replayability the game will have), but as you said, it needs to be extremely well thought-out.</p>
<p>So I say if the devs are okay with the base concept, then you (and maybe other users?) can start fleshing it out and branching out the conditions and how everything behaves with all the possible conditions.</p>
<p>Just be aware that all possible conditions etc would have to be thought of, because an idea like this can only succeed if it is well done – if done in a sloppy manner it would just end up clunky and not fun.</p>
