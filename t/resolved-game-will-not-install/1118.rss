    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-game-will-not-install/1118</link>
    <description>####What happened?
I can&#39;t install the game because of the following error:
_Throne of Lies is not available on your platform._

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?
It should install. My system fulfills all requirements.

####Steps to reproduce:
Input key on non-Windows machine. Attempt to download game on Windows machine.
