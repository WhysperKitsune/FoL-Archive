    <title>Got a heavy dose of karma tonight</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/got-a-heavy-dose-of-karma-tonight/10330</link>
    <description>Was binge playing ToL as I do almost every day and today I had an interesting game as prince. Jailed a guy who claimed CW and gave me his logs which showed who all he BARRIERED. I laughed on the inside as I slaughtered him. He ended up being MM. the next day came and I told everybody what happened and we all &quot;loled&quot; at the MM who didn&#39;t do his homework on the patch. The next night I jailed somebody who&#39;s logs said they debbached ME twice succesfully. Well I&#39;m prince so that couldn&#39;t be right, I&#39;m immune to being debbached, those logs didn&#39;t add up. So I executed him. And then I saw, karma had instantly smacked me in the face.</description>
