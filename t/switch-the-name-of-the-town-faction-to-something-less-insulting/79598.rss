    <title>Switch the name of the &#39;town&#39; faction to something less insulting</title>

    <description>Calling the main faction Brain Dead is not only insulting but also very unoriginal, I think the game needs a creative name for that faction, something like Cyan Phoenix or Beige Drake or something.</description>
