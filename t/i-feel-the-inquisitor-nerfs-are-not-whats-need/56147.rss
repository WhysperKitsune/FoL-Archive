    <title>I feel the Inquisitor nerfs are not what&#39;s need</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-feel-the-inquisitor-nerfs-are-not-whats-need/56147</link>
    <description>So when I originally saw the Inquisitor nerfs, I had a feeling they weren&#39;t really right. I&#39;m fairly certain he was nerfed since I believe he undoubtedly had the highest win rate. In the newest patch I am sure his win rate has gone down, but he is completely unfun to play as. 

Right now, inquisitor has two abilities. His main ability to check if someone is magic, or his second ability to instantly kill someone. To counteract this, the sorc was given magic dust which allows her to make everyone look like a magic user, and it was buffed to make her seem not magic. The constant buffs to magic dust have made finding a magic user almost impossible. Your main ability is useless, and you have no way of knowing unless they die. 

Before, you could use ruthless efficiency to have a confirmed check at the risk of killing bd, or if you checked someone as a magic user and they came up not magic, you were fine. But now both of these methods are gone as ruthless efficiency always kills and find magic gives false positives AND false negatives. You can&#39;t rely on your own abilities anymore. 

I would really like to see magic dust nerfed in some way, buff the sorc differently, but change inquisitor&#39;s win condition. Right now it consists of sit back and hope bd find the sorc, since everything he can do is now useless.</description>

            <p>Well I don’t see a huge need to fool your allies, though I suppose that does add a tiny amount of double edged sword to it. My thought was just on practicality of an interface, it’s much easier and faster to use to pick between 3 options than the class list, and the only classes that it would make a difference for, are allies. The only non-BD investigators are, cult/unseen (allies), and inquisitor (the one guy who SHOULD be good at finding the sorc, as that’s litterally his only purpose in life, IE the one who IMO he shouldn’t be able to fool, as being easily fooled pretty much negates his whole purpose).</p>

<p>A lot of that comes down to how hard the King counters Possessor. Both Reaper and Sorc have some way around it (Reaper can Gather Darkness and Sorc can hope for Evil King/have majority with cult/unseen) but Possessor literally has no hope. He needs to somehow remain inconspicuous for 6 days, then hope he can kill the king with only 4 players left so there won’t be a new King. Add in if it’s an unseen game, Possessor actually can’t do anything about Mastermind.</p>
<p>People think Possessor is the easiest to win with due to his tricky nature, and early on, possessor is definitely the most powerful NK. However, when it comes to actually winning, Possessor has an incredibly small chance.</p>

            <p>For sure the Inquisitor needs some kind of rework but i believe one of the issues are holding in Sorcerer’s Day Abilities. Magic Cloak and Magic Dust are <strong>more</strong> countering Inquisitor than BD.That wouldn’t be a problem if most of the time the Inquisitor was killing NK but it is completely inversely. If i was the Dev, i would probably more focus on making Sorcerer as class that can’t be just straight be found by Observer/Princess even Drunk and Butler.Also I would completely replace Magic Dust with something else.</p>
<p>Talking about The Inquisitor, i would make that Ruthless Efficiency can’t be used on players that weren’t checked by him. That would remove a swinginess of his killer ability, i mean do you know how must feel a Sorcerer who was just killed by Yolo Ruthless Efficiency Night 1?</p>
<p>Anyway as <a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@Vandalay</a> said, if there is a role that have a job to hunting down The NK, he should be <strong>only</strong> one who can effectively deal with her unlike “normal” folks.</p>

            <p>The problem is that Sorcerer is a NK and is a main thread to the BD, so Inquisitor can’t be the only way to out them.</p>

            <p>I think we should look at the ways Sorc gets outed.</p>
<p>Right now the sorc is Occ immune, visits targets (unless an ability is used), death immune, comes up neutral, and is immune to bleed/poison. The last one is more helpful for unseen/cult, but that’s about it. Being Occ immune and coming up neutral heavily ruin any claims Sorc could come up with.</p>
<p>I think what might be interesting is giving Sorc the same Passives as Mastermind, Can’t Touch This and In The Shadows, where for the first three nights, Sorc appears as occupied/knows who they are redirected to/appears BD. I think you can just tack these effects onto Mage Armor. Three nights will be plenty, as Sorc offers the same play style Unseen do which is attacking a lot of people, meaning the first three nights gives some priority time for Inquis to find Sorc, but if Inquis is killed early, Sorc doesn’t become impossible to locate.</p>

            <p>Wait I got an idea! Buff Sorc in a way that makes Inq 99% of the time to find Sorc and make BD almost literally can’t find Sorc and make Inq immune to Sorc attacks possibly? Making it if BD kill Inq to be a very harsh punishment</p>

            <p>IMO inq as he is is just pointless. More or less every form and update to him has been some extent of the same broken. He’s underpowered in the sense that he’s just plain worthless at his job. He’s OP because bd is pretty good at his job and do it for him most of the time.</p>
<p>They kept nerfing the inq and buffing the sorc… because the sorc wasn’t strong enough to survive both the BD and inq hunting him… but IMO they should have dealt with that via explicitly adding cover to the sorc from the BD… making the inq the only way to reliably catch him. Instead they made the inq explicitly useless for finding him beyond blind stabs.</p>
<p>So yeah I agree… IMO magic cloak should allow the sorc to chose his/her princess result as well as appear BD to peek. Sorc should have no abilities to mess with detect magic. The inq has one bloody job… if his existance is to be justified, he should be the best at it.</p>
<p>(that or his existance isn’t justified and he can just be removed, and some nerfs placed on sorc).</p>
