          <p>I LOVE making classes. Mostly all of these (except Tapstress &amp; Waitress) were made in a span of around ~2 hours. They will have huge balancing mistakes and probably just normal mistakes in general. That’s why I appreciate feedback and suggestions on changing certain class abilities, passives ect.</p>
<p>I apologize for any similarities between classes. Inform me and I’ll try to change it if it’s possible.</p>
<p>The most difficult classes I made were the BD and Unseen Support &amp; Killers. I found trouble finding a support action that’s unique that isn’t too similar to what a social would have but unfortunately it’s more social leaned than support. I feel as though the Killer could be abused a bit however I think it’s relatively balanced. Definitely on the stronger conversion side.</p>

          <p>Europe (home to the setting and lore which composes ToL) did NOT have coffee in medieval times.<br>
“From China tea spread to other parts of Asia, especially Japan and Korea.  But it did not first reach Europe until the sixteenth century, when Portuguese explorers brought some back.  In the seventeenth century the Dutch East India Company started importing tea, which became popular as a luxury drink in Europe.  Not until the nineteenth century, when the British began having India (then part of its Empire) start growing tea in order to break the Chinese monopoly, did tea become the all-purpose British drink it still is today.  (Tea has also become very popular in India in the last 200 years.)”<br>

          <p>I first intended for it to be an alcoholic drink to fit the theme of medieval times however I also could not find a suitable word for a female who serves drinks. A male name would be too similar to butler. I dislike the word ‘Barista’ but Tapstress is pretty neat.<br>
As you can tell I’m very into the theme of things. I quite enjoy unused words such as Cordwainer.</p>
