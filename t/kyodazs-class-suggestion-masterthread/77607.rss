    <title>KyoDaz&#39;s Class Suggestion Masterthread</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/kyodazs-class-suggestion-masterthread/77607</link>
    <description>I LOVE making classes. Mostly all of these (except Tapstress &amp; Waitress) were made in a span of around ~2 hours. They will have huge balancing mistakes and probably just normal mistakes in general. That&#39;s why I appreciate feedback and suggestions on changing certain class abilities, passives ect.

I apologize for any similarities between classes. Inform me and I&#39;ll try to change it if it&#39;s possible.

The most difficult classes I made were the BD and Unseen Support &amp; Killers. I found trouble finding a support action that&#39;s unique that isn&#39;t too similar to what a social would have but unfortunately it&#39;s more social leaned than support. I feel as though the Killer could be abused a bit however I think it&#39;s relatively balanced. Definitely on the stronger conversion side.

            <p>hey I know this is really old, but Barmaid could be used<br>
Edit: also shroud would kinda suck because it could easily out NK as NK, make it more like a merc guard, so then oyu cant be like 'only invest were occ’d on X, therefore X is NK in an orphan game!<br>

            <p>I mean, it should have a cult convert if it can be converted.</p>
<p>Invoker seems fine.</p>
<p>But a lot of conversion is removing towncore BD to cult, so that no one can be fully tristed. A neut&gt;evil a)Means someone who is not BD to begin with can be converted, and executed off of their OG class<br>
b)unbalances the game with neut numbers</p>

            <p>Perhaps removing the passive share is a good idea. That’d allow more BD counterplay and no conversions.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s already a horrible claim that shouldn’t really be considered. Also easily caught by Pretender, Observer ect. and you are having to BS logs every odd night. Harms your claim considerably. I don’t think it’s good to claim with or without Offer Dessert. Though I do agree that it may still catch out MM a bit more than I would like (not just Princess) therefore I’ll drop the count of Offer Dessert &amp; Offer Leftovers by one. Don’t want it to be an ability that is spammed.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ah my mistake.  The Tapstress is like Princess but not like Maid.  But here are some specific problems I have with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Immune to occupation and redirection but doesn’t appear to be.   This would be the only class to cause such confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offer Dessert (Night)</strong>  - Offer desert to a player, discovering if they are using their second night action.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This seems like a terribly strong counter to mastermind princess claims, since wisp is never used but foresight is used half the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually don’t dislike it that much.  It’s more I dislike the Princess class already.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do believe he needs more of a handicap than that though. Do you have anything in mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t to be honest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d imagine he would have a high skill-cap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I like classes that do <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auditor is the Unseen convert; I assume you are referring to the Clerk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see him as helpful in numerous situations. Especially if he’s converted. He can communicate with the King easily allowing him to anonymously instruct the King on Unseen’s strategies if they suspect he is aligned with him.<br>
Do you believe he’s good balanced based? I believe the fact he’s unique and prevents Mystic from spawning makes his class a suitable addition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay well I suppose since he prevents Mystic from spawning that he’s fine.  But I do wish current Illusionist had Link Minds, the only caveat being it told the linked person they were converted.  And to allow it to communicate with the King (just Illusionist though).</p>

<p>I think the issue you see in most of the classes is being similar to other ones. However I don’t think it’d be best to introduce a lot of new mechanics or they will most likely be confirmable (such as night bleeds that the previous butcher had.)</p>

            <p>You should. If the class isn’t original then why bother implementing it? Whatever things it can add could be added more efficiently by altering the class it’s similar to.</p>
<p>In fact designing that way leads to more versatile and well defined classes.</p>

            <p>Ah I see.<br>
I personally think Gossip should be completely reworked. Until this even has potential to be implemented in the game I won’t worry about originality for a bit. It’s just a concept that can be changed.</p>

            <p>In other words. If it was a stronger gossip I would have the same exact complaint. The issue isn’t that it’s stronger or weaker, the issue is that it’s using a niche that’s already accounted for.</p>

            <p>The point isn’t a balance one. Rather an originality one. If gossip is broken then the solution is to fix gossip. If this is a less broken gossip then why not put it on the Noble instead of this random class idea?</p>
