    <title>KyoDaz&#39;s Class Suggestion Masterthread</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/kyodazs-class-suggestion-masterthread/77607</link>
    <description>I LOVE making classes. Mostly all of these (except Tapstress &amp; Waitress) were made in a span of around ~2 hours. They will have huge balancing mistakes and probably just normal mistakes in general. That&#39;s why I appreciate feedback and suggestions on changing certain class abilities, passives ect.

I apologize for any similarities between classes. Inform me and I&#39;ll try to change it if it&#39;s possible.

The most difficult classes I made were the BD and Unseen Support &amp; Killers. I found trouble finding a support action that&#39;s unique that isn&#39;t too similar to what a social would have but unfortunately it&#39;s more social leaned than support. I feel as though the Killer could be abused a bit however I think it&#39;s relatively balanced. Definitely on the stronger conversion side.

            <p>hey I know this is really old, but Barmaid could be used<br>
Edit: also shroud would kinda suck because it could easily out NK as NK, make it more like a merc guard, so then oyu cant be like 'only invest were occโd on X, therefore X is NK in an orphan game!<br>

            <p>I mean, it should have a cult convert if it can be converted.</p>
<p>Invoker seems fine.</p>
<p>But a lot of conversion is removing towncore BD to cult, so that no one can be fully tristed. A neut&gt;evil a)Means someone who is not BD to begin with can be converted, and executed off of their OG class<br>
b)unbalances the game with neut numbers</p>

            <p>Perhaps removing the passive share is a good idea. Thatโd allow more BD counterplay and no conversions.</p>

</aside>
<p>Itโs already a horrible claim that shouldnโt really be considered. Also easily caught by Pretender, Observer ect. and you are having to BS logs every odd night. Harms your claim considerably. I donโt think itโs good to claim with or without Offer Dessert. Though I do agree that it may still catch out MM a bit more than I would like (not just Princess) therefore Iโll drop the count of Offer Dessert &amp; Offer Leftovers by one. Donโt want it to be an ability that is spammed.</p>

<p>I agree; the most fun thing about Princess is the thought of possibly being able to fake claim as Pretender and somehow win BD the game in a 1v1.</p>

            <p>Ah my mistake.  The Tapstress is like Princess but not like Maid.  But here are some specific problems I have with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Immune to occupation and redirection but doesnโt appear to be.   This would be the only class to cause such confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offer Dessert (Night)</strong>  - Offer desert to a player, discovering if they are using their second night action.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This seems like a terribly strong counter to mastermind princess claims, since wisp is never used but foresight is used half the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually donโt dislike it that much.  Itโs more I dislike the Princess class already.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do believe he needs more of a handicap than that though. Do you have anything in mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I donโt to be honest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iโd imagine he would have a high skill-cap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I like classes that do <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auditor is the Unseen convert; I assume you are referring to the Clerk.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see him as helpful in numerous situations. Especially if heโs converted. He can communicate with the King easily allowing him to anonymously instruct the King on Unseenโs strategies if they suspect he is aligned with him.<br>
Do you believe heโs good balanced based? I believe the fact heโs unique and prevents Mystic from spawning makes his class a suitable addition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay well I suppose since he prevents Mystic from spawning that heโs fine.  But I do wish current Illusionist had Link Minds, the only caveat being it told the linked person they were converted.  And to allow it to communicate with the King (just Illusionist though).</p>

<p>What abilities and situations would make it too powerful? I donโt think itโs anything like maid and just adopts a more powerful class-type deduction without the accuracy of flirt. I quite like the ability.</p>

<p>I think the issue you see in most of the classes is being similar to other ones. However I donโt think itโd be best to introduce a lot of new mechanics or they will most likely be confirmable (such as night bleeds that the previous butcher had.)</p>

            <p>You should. If the class isnโt original then why bother implementing it? Whatever things it can add could be added more efficiently by altering the class itโs similar to.</p>
<p>In fact designing that way leads to more versatile and well defined classes.</p>

            <p>Ah I see.<br>
I personally think Gossip should be completely reworked. Until this even has potential to be implemented in the game I wonโt worry about originality for a bit. Itโs just a concept that can be changed.</p>

            <p>In other words. If it was a stronger gossip I would have the same exact complaint. The issue isnโt that itโs stronger or weaker, the issue is that itโs using a niche thatโs already accounted for.</p>

            <p>The point isnโt a balance one. Rather an originality one. If gossip is broken then the solution is to fix gossip. If this is a less broken gossip then why not put it on the Noble instead of this random class idea?</p>
