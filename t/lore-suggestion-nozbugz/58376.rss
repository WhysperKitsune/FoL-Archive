    <description>Prologue
---
---
Once across the seven seas lay awake a beast known only as the Noz. This beast had differentiating patterns in their day. Some of which were doing nothing, while others were doing many things. This beast asked time and time again for the lord Brakuren to create their damn lore, Brakuren was hesitant at first but after a long time of him being inactive in the lore community, Brakuren decided to come back in with a request that was long in storage.

The Beast
--

---
The Noz beast is something that can only be described as cute and adorable, at least to the human eye. No one truly knows what the Noz beast looks like, researchers like me can only hypothesize of it&#39;s great and beautiful nature. But researchers date back to the existence of the Noz creature to May 12th, 2017. The first thing that the Noz creature has said the island of The Throne of Lies Discord was &quot;Hai&quot;. The passport that the creature was carrying on them was from the region known as &quot;Dyno&quot;. Original they called themselves &quot;Noz the Pure&quot; which was a facade for their terrible schemes that they were planning on creating. Our researcher, Brakuren, first met the Noz Creature when he was doing things back in May on the 26th he saw the Noz creature post &quot;!rank Alexander Hamilton&quot;. So Brakuren hypothesized that the Noz creature was in love with the Hip Broadway Show &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;. If only he knew the truth.

The Awaking 
---

------
The Noz creature after many points in time became evil. They became purely evil because (idk) they felt like it. They then went and terrorized the villagers of the discord and after bending the gods to his will became a demigod (Guide) this demigod was calm for the most part, until the one day that terror struck. We don&#39;t know much about the day that terror struck, but it happened and it was scary. The Noz creature did something and left the realm, and as a punishment for leaving the realm, the Noz creature was revoked of his demigod status.
After a while, the beast eventually returned and was no longer feared by the people.


The End
---

------

Thank you for reading this lore page, it didn&#39;t take a long time but let me say this.

The Noz create is a nice person, but sometimes scary and quiet. But our researchers have made a discovery of what happened to the Noz creature after they returned. He is a clip of paper that we found off of our missing research team. 


&gt; What we know now is the Demigod is no longer a demigod and is instead a cul-

I thank you for reading this, and I hope that one day I will become a loremaster. 

This is Lore Researcher Brakuren, signing off
