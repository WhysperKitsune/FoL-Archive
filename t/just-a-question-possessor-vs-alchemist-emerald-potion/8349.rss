    <title>Just a question, Possessor vs Alchemist Emerald Potion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/just-a-question-possessor-vs-alchemist-emerald-potion/8349</link>
    <description>I was playing as a possessor, and was killed at night. I wasn&#39;t told that it bypassed my Black Shield immunity. Later, an alchemist claimed responsibility. Is this something that can actually happen? And if so, is it intended? I wasn&#39;t occupied that night, so I wasn&#39;t Happy Houred the same night.

Chat log:
`You will control Nicolas Vernye [11] and kill Gilbert Atlee [2] tonight.`
`Something prevented you from visiting Nicolas Vernye [11]. This could be due to a Court Wizard, Prince, Mercenary, Poacher, Sage, or Sellsword.`
`You were attacked last night.`

If this is intended, the wording of emerald potion should be updated.</description>
