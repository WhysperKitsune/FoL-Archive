    <description>&gt;## [color=green]The Wanderer[/color]
&gt;**[color=lightgrey]Neutral Offensive[/color]**
**Resolve (Passive)** - You are immune to occupation and target changing.
**Royal Blood (Passive)** - You may step up as king. 
**Never Surrender (Day)** - Tonight, you will be immune to death and your **Brawl** ability will bypass occupy immunity. - 2 uses
**Royal Connections (Day)** - Type a message. At the start of the night, the current king and any royal blood will receive it.
**Brawl (Night)** - Occupy a player. Anyone who visits this player at night will also be occupied. - Infinite Uses 
**Spot Weakness (Night)** - Remove a player&#39;s death immunity for tonight and the following night. Anyone who tries to guard or heal the target will be occupied. - 1 Use
_Your objective is to survive to see yourself become king._
 
&gt;**Convert Immune**

&gt;## [color=gold] The Victorious King[/color]
&gt;**[color=lightgrey]Neutral Special[/color]**
**Pass the Torch (Passive)** - If you die, a new king may arise.
**The Royal Finger (Day)** - Your vote for today counts as 2 votes
**Decide Fate (Day)** - You may change the result of a trial - 1 Use
**Guard! (Night)** - Choose a player, they will not die tonight (Includes you) - 3 Uses
**King&#39;s Favor (Night)** -  Targeted player becomes your champion. Tomorrow, your champion cannot be accused of treason. - 2 Uses. 
*You have won! You may do as you please.* 

&gt;**Crowned From**
&gt;* The Wanderer

This is mainly a suggestion for FoL but I could see it working for ToL too (Just replace Victorious King with a Neutral King who has already won.) 

I wasn&#39;t too sure about what to do for **King&#39;s Favor**, I wanted it to be something impactful and fun to use. 

I&#39;d like to hear all of your thoughts and suggestions. Too Strong? Too Weak? Unfun? Unfair?</description>

            <p>I may be dumb, but what could a Wanderer potentially write in Royal Connections for the Royals to see, if his goal is to actually outplay them all, more or less?</p>
