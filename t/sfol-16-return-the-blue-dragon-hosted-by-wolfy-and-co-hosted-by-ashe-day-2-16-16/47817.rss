    <description>The Unseen had won, taking over Castle Adiart. But now, the small remainder of the Blue Dragon is fighting to take it over again! 


[color=deeppink] Welcome one and all to a game where this time, the informed minority is the Blue Dragon, trying to get their Kingdom back from the clutches of the Unseen. Credits to @Ashe for creating the idea for a potential gamemode for ToL if it was to be developed.[/color]

        <title>SFoL 16 - Return the Blue Dragon (Hosted by Wolfy and Co-Hosted by Ashe) - Day 2 16/16</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ashe]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The FoL Team has decided to end SFoL16 early due to what we believe to be cheating between PKR and Wolfy. As you may have noticed, PKR’s ability to discover scum yesterday was strangely accurate. Unfortunately, the FoL Team has determined that this is most likely due to cheating.</p>
<p>For those who are not aware, PKR and Wolfy have a history of cheating in forum matches (mainly on other sites). This isn’t the first time a forum game has been ended early due to collaborative cheating between the two. This is one of the main reasons that the FoL Team was initially sceptical. Combining that with the fact that Wolfy is the host of this game, and that PKR was able to with perfect accuracy know the entire Blue Dragon’s members (and their exact classes) and which player was the Neutral Killer, all on Day 2, we believe it is extremely likely that cheating has occured in this game.</p>
<p>While it is possible to either be in a situation where a player would have in-game knowledge to make these assumptions with the confidence that PKR did, or one where someone’s scum reads are lucky enough to be as incredibly accurate as PKR’s were, the FoL team believes that neither of these situations has occured. In PKR’s case, no justification or reasoning was provided for how or why PKR achieved these reads when he did, only later giving some justification that the FoL Team believes is not sufficient explanation on how he went about achieving these scum reads. Additionally, PKR was the Kidnapper in this game, and initially was going to imprison Marluxion (The Negotiator) on Night 1, before he changed to imprison a different player. Strangely, he provided his imprisonment choice with a screenshot of a random number generator, saying he only chose Marl because he had Marl as 4, and it landed on 4. I would not have been suspicious about a lucky imprisonment on it’s own, but the fact that he attempted to justify his imprisonment choice with a random number generator led me to believe that he had already gained knowledge of who the Negotiator was at the time, and wanted to “throw me off the trail” that he had the knowledge, when in fact this worked in reverse and led me to be suspicious of the choice.</p>
<p>While there is no definitive proof that PKR and Wolfy cheated in this game, the fact that all of the above happened in the same game that Wolfy hosted, as well as the fact that it isn’t the first time that a situation very similar to this has happened due to them means that this game is being ended early.</p>
<p>Edit: If you wish to discuss this, please do it on the FoL Discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/YU7aVWd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here’s the link if you aren’t a member of it already</a>).</p>

            <p>The King looked upon his loyal subjects. They were furious that people had infiltrated their beloved Kingdom. He heard the shouts of executes, and guilties. He eventually stood up, and the court fell silent. “I have decided to find the accussed… GUILTY!”</p>
<p>The crowd cheered as Orange was tied to the stake, and was burnt. Once the execution finished, everyone went back to their rooms, hoping nothing would happen to anyone else.</p>
