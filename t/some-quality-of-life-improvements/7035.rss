    <title>Some quality of life improvements</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/some-quality-of-life-improvements/7035</link>
    <description>Hello, relatively new player here. I&#39;ve found a few things that could be improved upon:

1. In-game (fake) name and/or number on the end screen chat. Having to constantly check names on the board just to see who is saying gg is really annoying.
2. **[Addressed in patch 1.0.6]** A slightly longer day 1. I&#39;ve seen way too many princes (myself included) miss jailing someone during night 1.
3. A warning at 10 seconds remaining if you still have daytime/nighttime abilities to use. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I like to wait until late to use abilities... which usually leads to me forgetting when something big happens just before the end of the period.
4. A marker on the player list for who you&#39;re targeting during that period, or perhaps just highlighted names. Useful to check if you did correct targets. I know it says in the chat log, but extra info never hurts.
5. **[Addressed in patch 1.0.6]** The ability to change daytime ability targets up until the end of the day for anything that doesn&#39;t affect the target immediately. Only really affects sheriff&#39;s scout ability; I&#39;ve wanted so badly to change targets later in the day but been unable to. 

That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Mainly just stuff that&#39;ll help new players, but helpful for all nonetheless.

EDIT: Hooray! New patch! 2 and 5 addressed! Loving this game :grinning:</description>

            <p>I’ve thought the same things. Except for 3. Good suggestion but could get annoying. Maybe it could be optional. Youre right though I’ve forgotten to use an ability plenty of times. I’ll even log what I wanted to do and then forget. So what I do now is use an ability right away, knowing that I can always change it or cancel it before the night ends. Better than waiting and forgetting.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this all seems reasonable. As long as you can turn the warning for 3 off, that is.</p>
