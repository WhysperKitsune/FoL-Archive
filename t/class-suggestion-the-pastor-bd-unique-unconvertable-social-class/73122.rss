    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-pastor-bd-unique-unconvertable-social-class/73122</link>
    <description>Pastor (Social BD Class, Unique &amp; Conversion Immune):

Passives:

God&#39;s Messenger - Cannot be Converted during the night.

Day Action:

Force Confession (3 uses) - Is able to talk to a chosen person during the upcoming night. The chosen person cannot be linked that night. If you choose the same target as the Prince chooses to jail, this action won&#39;t work and you&#39;ll still have one less use. The chosen person also cannot perform an action. The Pastor will appear as &quot;Pastor&quot; when talking (to the Pastor). The Pastor will get to know if the targeted player is a Neutral Class (except Neutral Killing, Fool, Scorned and Inquisitor).

Night Action:

Declare Holy Person (1 use) - Make a person Conversion &amp; Death Immune, lasting for two nights. If the person gets converted or attacked within these two nights, the immunity is lost right away. The MasterMind/Cult Leader will know they hit a holy person, attackers won&#39;t and will receive the &quot;death immune&quot; message. Only useable on the person you &#39;Force Confessed&#39; that night.

Quote of the Book (4 uses) - Randomly make a chosen person: 1. Death Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is an Offensive class); 2. Conversion Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is a Social class); 3. Occupy and Redirection Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is a Support class). The chosen player gets to know what they got, but the Pastor doesn&#39;t. Not useable when you used &#39;Force Confession&#39; the day before.

Win Condition:
Win with BD.</description>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback! I’ll work on the Pastor and change it a bit. I’ll change all the abilities a little/a bit.</p>
<p>And with the win condition I meant:<br>
Same win condition as BD.</p>
<p>But I was to lazy to add that whole sentence into this post, since I was so tired and I thought it would’ve been logic. (No Offense)</p>

            <p>I have to echo some of the thoughts here.</p>
<p>I’m very much a person who hates the ability to easily confirm oneself while having immunity to conversion, this ultimately makes it so that you can always trust the target and that’s a huge strength in hidden ally games.</p>
<p>Having a second mini-Prince is probably too much for Blue Dragon who have a high win rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Declare Holy Person (1 use) - Make a person Conversion &amp; Death Immune, lasting for two nights. If the person gets converted or attacked within these two nights, the immunity is lost right away. The MasterMind/Cult Leader will know they hit a holy person, attackers won’t and will receive the “death immune” message. Only useable on the person you ‘Force Confessed’ that night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems alright. It is pretty strong as it allows for multiple types of protection so you never feel useless. I do like the fact you have to use it on someone you Forced Confessed, makes for some interesting decisions and forces you to set up and really think about your plays in advance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quote of the Book (4 uses) - Randomly make a chosen person: 1. Death Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is an Offensive class); 2. Conversion Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is a Social class); 3. Occupy and Redirection Immune (doubled chance if chosen person is a Support class). The chosen player gets to know what they got, but the Pastor doesn’t. Not useable when you used ‘Force Confession’ the day before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Random abilities aren’t inherently bad, though this one I don’t really like. The aspect I do like is the extra chances of having an effect that matches up with your class type. I feel using class types isn’t really used enough yet and this is a decent ability for that, though it does step on the toes of the Court Wizard’s Empower somewhat.</p>
<p>If I were to adjust it, I would allow the Pastor to choose one of four options (like the Alchemist’s Brew Potion) and then the target receives it. In addition they get one based on their class type, regardless of what you selected. This means you have some control over it, but still need to understand what their possible role is, so that you can maximize your selection.</p>
<p>Overall I do somewhat like the ideas here, they just need to be refined a little.</p>

            <p>I’ll have a detailed reply to this posted eventually.</p>
<p>First impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unconvertable isn’t good</li>
<li>And it is second Prince, oof.</li>
<li>Way too strong</li>

            <p>well I’d say off the bat, unconvertable is a bit of a no-go right now. Bottom line if cult/unseen fail too many conversions, it winds up with a really short really dull game. Adding an extra class that is both inherantly conversion immune, and can grant conversion immunity etc… is probably pretty broken inherantly, there’s a reason why historically every single increase to conversion immunity has had to be rolled back</p>
<p>(sheriff was conversion immune at a time, rolled back because it was broken, same with priest for a while, he had to be removed, CW recieved a buff where he could make 2 people conversion immune each night, also had to be rolled back, good king had swear fealty to make one person conversion immune… bottom line is what we currently have is already more or less the maximum tollerable conversion immunity).</p>
