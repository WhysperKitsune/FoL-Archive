    <title>Patch Notes in game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/patch-notes-in-game/10456</link>
    <description>Is there a way we can get patch notes into the game itself . 
Like when you first log onto the game after a patch the latest Patch Notes opens up on the screen and after like a minute you can click off them .

The amount of times post patch I come up against someone who has no clue what&#39;s changed etc. is astonishing .
Some people I guess wont read anyway , but it would help with those whoa re not necessarily knowing where to get the patch notes</description>

            <p>Yeah, this is a necessary feature. Jusr keep a running patch notes file where you can see what each update did. Have a small box on the login screen that shows the most recent patch, and for anything with more than bug fixes open a popup upon login. In game (once logged in), alongside the rules, allow the player to read through the patch notes.</p>
