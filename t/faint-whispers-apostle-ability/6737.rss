    <title>Faint Whispers Apostle Ability</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faint-whispers-apostle-ability/6737</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I used faint whispers and started whispering other cult members.  BD team accuses me of treason because they saw the whispers.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The ability is supposed to hide whisper notifications - I was an apostle, and the other cult player was a cult leader.  All other players saw the whisper notifications, even though I clicked Faint Whispers and both I and the cult leader saw the chat notification that I had used the Faint Whispers ability.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Just click Faint Whispers during the day and have culties chat with each other.  Other BD&#39;s should not see the notifications that the cultists are whispering to each other, but they do.

            <p>It should hide the whisper from the Noble, if it doesn’t it would be a bug. I’ve looked into Faint Whispers, but couldn’t reproduce the bug. I’ll try looking into it some more.</p>

            <p>There may have been a noble alive during the game - I didn’t take a screenshot of the summary screen at the end so I can’t recall the player manifest.  Even if there was a noble using a maid, I agree with DeathReaperRH that the faint whispers ability should still hide the whispers from nobles.</p>

            <p>This honestly confuses me too.But i do think noble shouldn’t  be able to read the whispers even with a maid spy.It just makes faint whispers kind of useless.Although tbh if you have an apostle its either a psychic or noble which means the apostle was either a psychic or the apostle was a noble and there are 2 nobles and he places a maid spy on you.But noble still shouldn’t be able to see the whispers no matter what imo.<br>
Also this is probably a bug and it shouldnt work like this.</p>
