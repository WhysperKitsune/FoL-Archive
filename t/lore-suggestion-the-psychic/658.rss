Lore Subject: Mental transience exemplified!

Lore:

However you look at the Blue dragon you can never deny the resourcefulness of their allies. With no help from the divine they look to the gifts of the best of humanity. Case in point the Psychic maintains the gift of mental manipulation. Trained from birth to control their gifts their mental capacity allows them to bypass the spys and stealth of the Blue dragons enemys to create an beneficent and noteworthy communication network. Of course while detailed and extravagant scripts from their targets may be out of the question they understand the very heart of their motivations and can manipulate them to a degree. While the true extent of their powers is more malevolent in nature they are trained not to provoke the court so as to be accepted. A mind reader is a terrible thing to fear.
