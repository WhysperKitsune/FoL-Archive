<h1>Character Sheet</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>  Alecia Dunbrack<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Female<br>

She has a large scar on her lower right abdomen that’s carefully hidden behind various intricate tattoos that snakes up her neck and down her left arm.<br>
<strong>Crime:</strong> Car and Aircraft hijacking<br>
<strong>Personality:</strong> Alecia has a good grasp of her abilities and won’t back down from a good opportunity if she sees one but she’ll flee from danger the instant she believes that it becomes too much. She’s a bit materialistic and has a difficult time trusting anyone she doesn’t consider to be apart of her “crew” without some sort of collateral or proof.<br>
<strong>Personal Skills:</strong> Mechanical skills, Ingenuity<br>
<strong><font color="orange">D-Class</font></strong> - 447</p>
