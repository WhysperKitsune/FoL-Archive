            <p>Cheeky throwback to first ever FoL game which happened this time last year, when unseen were still called black rose, a ton of people were thought to be afk due to reaper, and half of the players have disappeared for ever. I was just a babby hippo. Also the first person we executed was the sheriff <span class="hashtag">#proplays</span>.</p>
<p>Nice to see how far FoL and it’s playerbase has evolved, mainly thanks to the fantastic FoL team.</p>

<p>If he didn’t pull that Alfa inno stunt, I would have jailed Xerxes instead.</p>
<p>orange help me a lot. I considered jailing Polik when he whispered me that Polik is Alchemist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way I see it, three possibilities exist.</p>
<p>Priest!Dooku, Fool!Dooku, and Soulcatcher!Dooku.</p>
<p>Priest Dooku is either VI or playing at being a Fool.<br>
Fool Dooku is a Fool.<br>
Soulcatcher Dooku, in roleplaying his actual part, is trying to convince us he’s a Fool.</p>
<p>Either way, he should be executed ASAP, but at night. If you’re reading this, I will obviously be dead, but I would hope that Dooku will have already been killed by Dama.</p>
<p>Either way, moonbird, Xerxes, yau, Jord (likely dead), and Anthony are the only slots I cannot pin down, comprising of the Reaper, Assassin, Physician, Random Neutral if not Fool!Dooku (BD otherwise), and the final BD member (if Soulcatcher!Dooku) or BR member (if Priest!Dooku or Fool!Dooku). Hippo and Dead could both be BR if not Soulcatcher!Dooku, but I’d be more likely to peg one of our non-claimers for the title.</p>
<p>Since Jord is likely dead, and I can’t get a read on cbman’s slot (moon pulled a bit of a 180 tbh), I’d say the most likely scum candidate is Anthony, who should likely be our next lynch. Xerxes and yau would both also make good lynches, but bad information lynches due to relative lack of contribution to discussion.</p>
<p>So basically Anthony is pretty freaking evil, plz execute.</p>
<p>Dama is confirmed BD, trust him. Deadfrien is also good as long as he wasn’t converted, but I will not give out his role just yet. Let’s just say my silent whispers were quite effective, as were my bird metaphors. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Hippo is pretty safe due to actually claiming, and if I die I suppose y’all can know that Polik is totally the Alchemist. I told him to heal Dama, but if he doesn’t make sure he dies.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t say how I died, remember that that means that the Physician was killed by a Reaper or converted last night.</p>
<p>As for the king, I was about to poison him, due to there being a 67% chance of him not being BD, but since he was quite helpful in lynching Alfa I’m sparing him for now. Although he could still be any alignment (99% sure BR King doesn’t know other BR members), it’s worth keeping him around to guard Dama or some such.</p>
<p>I RB’d Anthony tonight, so if only I die and am reaped he’s both not the Reaper and likely the Assassin.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

<p>Might’ve thought Jord was dead and Anthony would be a good lynch, but whatever. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>That was actually awful to watch</p>
<p>I knew I was gonna get Reaped, but I had almost figured out the entire game. The only thing I didn’t know was who of Xerxes, yau, and Anthony were each remaining role.</p>
<p>Good game for the most part. Am going to point out that Dooku was basically gamethrowing, and I would not be against banning him from here on out.</p>
<p>Anyways, here’s my full will, just because:</p>
