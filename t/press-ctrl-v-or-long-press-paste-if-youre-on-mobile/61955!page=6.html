          <p>VIZZINI: So, it is down to you. And it is down to me.</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK nods and comes nearer.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward.</p>
<p>VIZZINI pushes his long knife harder against BUTTERCUP’s unprotected throat.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Let me explain…</p>
<p>VIZZINI: There’s nothing to explain. You’re trying to kidnap what I’ve rightfully stolen.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: There will be no arrangement [pauses, deliberately] and you’re killing her!</p>
<p>VIZZINI jabs with his long knife. BUTTERCUP gasps against the pain. The MAN IN BLACK stops quickly.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: I’m afraid so – I can’t compete with you physically. And you’re no match for my brains.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: You’re that smart?</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Yes.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Morons.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: For the Princess?</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK nods.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: To the death?</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK nods.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: I accept.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Good. Then pour the wine.</p>
<p>VIZZINI fills the goblets with wine. The MAN IN BLACK pulls a small packet from his clothing and hands it to VIZZINI.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Inhale this, but do not touch.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: I smell nothing.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: [Takes the packet back] What you do not smell is called Iocaine powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Hmm.</p>
<p>VIZZINI watches as the MAN IN BLACK takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces VIZZINI, drops the Iocaine packet. It is now empty. The MAN IN BLACK rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of VIZZINI and the other in front of himself.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: But it’s so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy’s? [pauses to study the MAN IN BLACK] Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I’m not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: You’ve made your decision then?</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Not remotely. Because iocaine comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Wait till I get going! Where was I?</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: Australia.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Yes – Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder’s origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: [beginning nervousness] You’re just stalling now.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: You’d like to think that, wouldn’t you? You’ve beaten my giant, which means you’re exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you’ve also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: [nervously] You’re trying to trick me into giving away something – it won’t work –</p>
<p>VIZZINI: [triumphant] It has worked – you’ve given everything away – I know where the poison is.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: [fool’s courage] Then make your choice.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: I will. And I choose [stops suddenly and points at something behind the Man in Black] what in the world can that be?</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: [Turns, looks] What? Where? I don’t see anything.</p>
<p>VIZZINI quickly switches the goblets while the MAN IN BLACK has his head turned.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK turns to face him again. VIZZINI starts to laugh.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: What’s so funny?</p>
<p>VIZZINI: I’ll tell you in a minute. First, let’s drink – me from my glass, and you from yours.</p>
<p>And he picks up his goblet. The MAN IN BLACK picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, VIZZINI hesitates a moment. Allowing the MAN IN BLACK to drink first, he swallows his wine.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: You guessed wrong.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: [roaring with laughter] You only think I guessed wrong… [louder now] …that’s what’s so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. Ha-ha, you fool.</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK sits silently.</p>
<p>VIZZINI: You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia.” But only slightly less well known is this: "Never go in against a Sicilian when  <em>death</em>  is on the line!Ahahahaha, ahahahaha, ahahaha–</p>
<ul>
<li>thud *</li>
</ul>
<p>VIZZINI laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. The MAN IN BLACK steps past his corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off BUTTERCUP, who notices VIZZINI lying dead. The MAN IN BLACK pulls her to her feet.</p>
<p>BUTTERCUP: Who are you?</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.</p>
<p>The MAN IN BLACK leads her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain.</p>
<p>BUTTERCUP: [Glances back toward the fallen VIZZINI] To think – all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.</p>
<p>MAN IN BLACK: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to Iocaine powder.</p>

          <p><i>My friend, you have met a terrible, terrible demise. But, uh, y’know, I-I don’t feel too bad about it. After all, if…if it weren’t from me, it would’ve just been from someone else, y’know? I guess what I’m trying to say is, life…life goes on. W-well, from—for everyone else, life goes on. Not…not for you. You’re…you’re dead. But that’s neither here nor there. It reminds me of one summer day in the park. I was having just a delightful picnic with my good friend Orville. And I said to him, I said, ‘Orville, I…I have a story.’ And he said to me, ‘What’s the significance of the story?’ And…I said to him, ‘Orville, not every story has to have significance, y’know? Sometimes, a…y’know, sometimes, a story’s just a story. You try to read into every little thing, and find meaning in everything anyone says, you’ll just drive yourself crazy. Had a friend do it once. Wasn’t pretty. We talked about it for years. And then not only that, but…you’ll likely end up believing something you shouldn’t believe, thinking something you shouldn’t think, o-o-or assuming something you shouldn’t assume. Y’know? Sometimes,’ I said, ‘a story is-is just a story, so just be quiet for one second of your life and eat your sandwich, okay?’ Of course, it was only then I’d realized I’d made sandwiches, and…poor Orville was having such difficulty eating it! Elephants have those clumsy hands, y’know? Actually, I-I suppose that’s the problem. They don’t have hands at all, do they? They’re f—they’re all feet! And I-I couldn’t imagine anyone asking me to eat a sandwich with my feet. Now, if I recall correctly, there was a bakery nearby. I said to him, ‘Orville, let me go get you some rye bread.’ Now, I’m unsure if elephants enjoy rye bread, but I assure you that Orville does. Now, this was on a Tuesday, which was good, because rye bread was always fresh on Tuesday. They made sourdough bread on Monday, and threw it out Wednesday… Or rather, they sold it at a discount for people wanting to feed it to the ducks, and then, prob’ly at the end of the day, finally, they threw it all out. I-I don’t recall. I do remember a man who would bring his son to the bakery every Wednesday, and…then go feed the ducks. He would buy all of the sourdough bread. Of course, y’know, you’re not supposed to feed the ducks sourdough bread at all. It swells up in their stomach, and then they all die. At, uh, at least…at least, that’s what I’ve heard. Y’know, I-I never saw any ducks die myself, but I did notice a substantial decrease in the duck population over the course of a few years. I just never thought to stop the man and tell him that he was killing the ducks by feeding them sourdough bread! And if you want my opinion on the matter—heh, and I told Orville this as well—if you wanna feed ducks, or birds of any kind, for that matter, it’s best to buy seed. I mean, when you think about it, breads of any sort don’t occur in nature. They don’t grow on trees o-or spring up from the bushes. I don’t think birds know what to do with bread. What was I saying? Oh oh, yes yes. So I bought Orville some rye bread. What a fine day it was.</i></p>

          <p>Why, oh, why wasn’t she more forceful? If Dad was here, among the endless rows of food, there bound to be something that he liked. She was concerned about how skinny he is, with only coffee and toast as his only source of nourishment. At least he would use jam or add egg to his toast, but going by without ever eating fruit or drinking water… It couldn’t be helped that she worried.</p>
<p>While lamenting her inability to coerce her father to come, Aretta joined a short queue toward a smoothie(?) stand.</p>
<p>“Red velvet drink, please,” she ordered to the girl behind table. The girl worked quickly, mixing syrups, milk, and ice cream in a blender while preparing the glass container for the drink. Aretta left the stand holding a cheerful red straw and a bottle filled with pale yellow drink, streaked with red syrup.</p>
<p>It was the kind of fancy drink you expect at a festival; delicious, small, and a bit pricy. She didn’t particularly mind. She bought it to drink it later at the conference, and the sweetness of those kind of drink shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>“Ah right,” she suddenly stopped at her track and moved aside. Aretta opened the bottle and dipped her pinky into the cold drink. Her pinky let off a white glow for a moment, and the drink followed. Satisfied, she popped the bottle cap back on and stored the bottle and straw in her shoulder bag.</p>
<p>There. The drink should stay cold for at least two weeks now.</p>

          <h2>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?</h2>
<p>I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
