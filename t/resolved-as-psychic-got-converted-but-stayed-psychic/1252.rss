    <title>[Resolved] As Psychic, got converted, but stayed Psychic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-as-psychic-got-converted-but-stayed-psychic/1252</link>
    <description>####What happened?

I was converted to Black Rose, but stayed Psychic. Afterwards I was unable to use my abilities or chat with Black Rose at night.

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I was supposed to be converted to the Illusionist.

####Steps to reproduce:

I am assuming have a Mastermind convert another Psychic in a 8 Player game. 

####Comments:
