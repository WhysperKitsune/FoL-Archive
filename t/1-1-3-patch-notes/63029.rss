        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I meant everyone knows Possessor knows he must either jump to SS or GK, otherwise he dies and loses.  If Poss jumps to GK, MM successfully converts SS and the game ends with a win for Unseen.  If Poss jumps to SS, game doesn’t end and everyone knows Poss jumped to SS.</p>
<p>But actually all of this is moot.  Because everyone knows that everyone knows that Poss knows his only potentially-winning move is to jump to SS and hope for the King to give him the win.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not that. If the game doesn’t end that means the Possessor jumped. MM is night immune so it wasn’t him. King has Finger and would use it if it was him. So if the King doesn’t finger he’s Possessor (King trying to trick Everyone into thinking he is poss is irrelevant as that’s equivalent to letting poss win kingmaker)</p>

            <p>I thought about it and you’re right.  Because if the game didn’t end then it can only mean the Sellsword got possessed.</p>

            <p>What reason would I have for coming up with that?  I defined my situation carefully in order to ensure that converting the SS was a good idea.  Not sure how your situation suits my purpose.  But I will try to issue an opinion … one minute lol</p>
