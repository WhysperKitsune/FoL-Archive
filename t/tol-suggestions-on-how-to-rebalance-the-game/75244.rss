    <title>ToL suggestions on how to rebalance the game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/tol-suggestions-on-how-to-rebalance-the-game/75244</link>
    <description>Hello I&#39;ve decided to take some time and write some of my suggestions on how to rebalance the game and keep it interesting yet simple.

ToL is a great game but there are some issues right now that I would like to address.

1)Hyperconfirmable abilities such as Noble twin , Mystic&#39;s Private matters.

2)Buggy interactions for some reason the Sellsword is stronger than the merc for example if you get hunter&#39;s marked visiting someone the merc gets occupied yet the sellsword gets an occ attempt message yet stonewall goes through. This is a technical issue thus can be fixed easily.

3)Some classes are rather uninteresting , I&#39;ll propose some ideas on how they can be made more fun.



I&#39;ll start listing my class ideas below.

[1] Mystic

Private matters should be taken away as it makes the king obsolete as it is a hyperconfirmable class that no one can deny is Blue Dragon. An alternative would be target a player and whispers between you are hidden.

Illusionist should keep private matters but it only works between Unseen.


[2] Noble/Aristocrat

Noble twin needs to be removed from the game as it is a one click confirmation and is extra powerful in cult games as Apostle&#39;s can&#39;t twin.

[3] Pretender

Some games go too fast and the Pretender never gets a chance to kill the king so this is my suggestion on how to reduce the variance of the games.

Remake No allegiance : True Heir , after you find 3 Royals with Blood Test Kinslayer bypasses the king&#39;s death immunity in addition you are death immune while not being king.

This way the pretender will get to deduce who are the royals rather than just waiting for evils to kill the king.

[4] Seeker

Seeker is by far the weakest cult class the way to fix that is giving Seeker an additional use of expose.

An additional passive would also help making the Seeker more relevant

New Passive Ability: Eyes of Mithras , every night you will know who visited the Cult Leader.

[5] Alchemist

Revert the alchemist to the old fun alch with the 4 potions , it made the class so fun and exciting rather than a neut physician with 2 bombs.

[6] Mercenary

Allow the Mercenary to target the King with Stand Guard.

[7] Sorcerer

I feel like the Sorc is by far the hardest NK to win as there&#39;s no lategame vote removal and there&#39;s too much RNG on bombs so I will be proposing a few fixes.

Combine Mage armor+Perception.Remove Bomb swap.

New Passive Ability: Wild Magic, For every 2 bomb targets that die that you did not detonate plant a random bomb on a new random target.

New Day Ability: Magical Reflection 2 uses , Choose one player , it removes their vote from you and does not allow them to accuse you for the rest of the day.

[8] Chronomancer

Allow the Chrono to redirect his own death on to others , this gives the Chrono more power and makes the player think when they should PD as it could be game winning. Also adds more to social deduction cause you need to pay attention and deduce if the evils are attacking you tonight.

[9] Princess

Will-o-Wisp is a very weak ability and needs to be more impactful.

Target a player with the wisp , if their class changes you will be notified. Lasts 2 nights , 2 uses.

[10] Herbalist

Herbalist is currently the weakest Unseen class as it is easy to deduce whether there&#39;s a herbalist or not as Defile is obvious and Drug doesn&#39;t really help bleeds and other healers find your target as DNR.

Remake Drug: 4 uses , Occupy a player if they are targeting one of the unseen they will not be notified of the occupation and the check results will show up as NS.

This ability will justify why the Herbalist is an offensive convert as well.



This is the first part of my suggestions , if there&#39;s positive feedback I&#39;ll post a second part as well.</description>

            <p>The wisp you propose is overpowered because it’s basically Sheriff’s Scout, but MUCH stronger</p>

            <p>Wisp is not overpowered , it’s a situational night ability that can win you the game if you know when you should use it</p>

<p>Wow I just found this out and posted it in Bug Reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hyperconfirmable abilities such as Noble twin , Mystic’s Private matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private matters should be taken away</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Illusionist should keep private matters but it only works between Unseen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really no reason to nerf Private Matters on Illusionist</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative would be target a player and whispers between you are hidden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems cool also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble twin needs to be removed from the game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it just needs to be invisible unless it affects the outcome of a trial</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like the Sorc is by far the hardest NK to win as there’s no lategame vote removal and there’s too much RNG on bombs so I will be proposing a few fixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, I just think a solution is let Sorc place 2 bombs on death immunes to kill them, including King.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow the Chrono to redirect his own death on to others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overpowered IMO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will-o-Wisp is a very weak ability and needs to be more impactful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wisp is useful for testing players who claim K/O classes that don’t attack</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Target a player with the wisp , if their class changes you will be notified. Lasts 2 nights , 2 uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an overpowered Scout that also counters possessor</p>
