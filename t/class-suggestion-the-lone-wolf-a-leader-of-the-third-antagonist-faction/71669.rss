    <description>&gt; # [color=darkgreen]The Lone Wolf[/color]
&gt; **[color=darkgreen]Anarchy Special[/color]**
&gt;
&gt; **Passive (Trained)** - Immune to Death at night.
&gt; **Passive (Brutal Force)** - If someone attempts to **Occupy/Redirect** you , they will die.
&gt; **Passive (Patient)** - **[color=darkgreen]The Anarchy[/color]**&#39;s limit increases to 3 members. After 2 nights , the last **Recruit**&#39;s target will commit suicide. Your **Recruit**&#39;s cooldown will be gone.(Replacing **Brutal Force** when **Influencer** is used. This affect wears off after 2 nights. Member limit without this passive : 2 members)
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Last Stand)** - Your attacks will bypass **Immunity/Healing** tonight.(1 Use - You will only be able to use **Headshot!** tonight)
&gt; **Day Ability (Influencer)** - You will become **Occupy/Redirection Immune** tonight. Your **Brutal Force** passive will be replaced with a new passive.(2 Uses) 
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (Headshot!)** - Kill a player.(Infinite Uses)
&gt; **Night Ability (Recruit)** - Recruit a player to join **[color=darkgreen]The Anarchy[/color]**. You will not know if the ability succeeded. Your identity to your target will not be revealed if it succeeded.(Infinite Uses | [1 Day Cooldown] |You will still be able to use this ability even if you succeeded but it will have no effect.)
&gt; **Goal:** *Defeat **[color=steblue]The Blue Dragon[/color]** and any **[color=gray]Neutrals[/color]** that seek you harm.*

Any ideas for potential converts?
Sorry if this is unbalanced in any shape or form.</description>

            <p>hmm then i should prehaps pick a random between the converted butler drunk or knight and i dont know how it is with passing on the lone wolf status because unlike the unseen there dependent on the lonewolf to do the killing mostly so prehaps make a backup class to wich all other classes fall back to if the lone wolf is dead but i still find it a good idee<br>
ps i love this full class and really like the idee keep it up i will look around and see if i can help just give me a pm <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>something like this prehaps?<br>
<strong>The Right Hand</strong><br>
<em>Anarchy Special</em></p>
<p><strong>Passive (Backup Squad)</strong> If <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> dies before day 4 you will become <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> instead (If hes just like MM but if hes just like cl then replace this with something else or remove it)<br>
<strong>Passive (Learned From The Best)</strong> You are Occupy immune and are the only member of the Anarchy who knows who <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> is (you can also change that into is death immune once)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability (Covert Ops)</strong> Your abilites and the abilities of <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> will not count as visiting tonight (1 Use)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Scout Ahead)</strong> go scout <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> target tonight preventing <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> visit to that target if the target is Death immune, getting guarded by a bear or knight, jailed or being healed by a pshycian or alchemist. not usuable if <strong>The Lone Wolf</strong> used <strong>Last Stand</strong> during the day -2 uses<br>
<strong>Night Ability (Intimidate)</strong> Occupy a player tonight preventing them for taking any action. -infinite uses<br>
prehaps not tottaly fitting but its just a shot</p>

            <p>Problem is there’s only 2 passive per class.<br>
So if you can combine 2, feel free</p>
