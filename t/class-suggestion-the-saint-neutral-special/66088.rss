    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Saint (Neutral Special)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-saint-neutral-special/66088</link>
    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;gray&quot;] The Saint [/color] :crescent_moon: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Special [/color]** 
**Vow of Moonlight (Passive)** - Immune to being occupied at night, conversion and target changing. Additionally, you cannot accuse others or vote to execute.
**Argent Ward (Day)** - You choose one target to bear an invisible ward tonight. If your target dies at night, they will be instantly resurrected but will not remember dying. - 3 uses 
**Gaze of Silver (Day)** - At the end of the day, you will know if your target can kill at night. - 4 uses
**Heart Sight (Night)** - You will visit a target to peer into their heart, learning if they are able to kill at night. If they intend to kill someone that night, you will occupy them, saving their target. Bypasses occupation immunity, but cannot be used on the same target twice in a row. - 5 uses 
**Sacred Lunar Seal (Night)** - Protect yourself with ancient holy magic, making you immune to death at night. - 2 uses 
*Goal: Save three people other than you from death at night. You lose your abilities upon winning.*

***NOTES*** 

1) Targets will not be informed they were saved by the Argent Ward or that they were attacked/killed. Those who attacked/killed will get a successful attack/kill notification, and the Reaper will get a soul (but the target will not be reaped). The Possessor will be reimbursed a use of their Possession ability if they attempt to possess a warded target.
2) Argent Ward does not protect against the King&#39;s Order Execution, but it protects against the Prince&#39;s Execute ability (the use of Execute is consumed, but if the target was Blue Dragon, the Prince does not lose his remaining Execute uses).
3) Heart Sight on the Prince will prevent them from Executing their captive (same rules as Argent Ward).
4) Heart Sight vs. Puppet Strings only works vs. the ability&#39;s first target (the one doing the attack).
5) The King cannot be targeted by Heart Sight or Argent Ward.
6) Sacred Lunar Seal does not protect from the Reaper&#39;s Empowered Reap or the King&#39;s Order Execution.
7) Sacred Lunar Seal will protect from death by Poison/Bleeding, but only if activated during the night where it would kill the Saint.
8) People saved by both Argent Ward and Heart Sight will count towards the Saint&#39;s goal. If two Saints have an Argent Ward on the same target when they die, or they both Heart Sight the same killer, they both get a +1 towards their goal.
9) The Saint naturally detects as a magic user.

I do believe that&#39;s all. Will add more based on feedback!</description>

            <p>Well, the normal reap already bypasses healing, so I thought the Empowered Reap was more than just a way to bypass death immunity, but with the new Sellsword and the Apostle’s warped feedback, it’s difficult to tell exactly whether someone was being protected or not the night they were reaped.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s changed. Sacred Lunar Seal is basically now a Hide with 1 less use.</p>

            <p>There is. Butlers can occupy him and Knights are the only way to counter Empowered Reap. Observers can also soft-counter Reaper as regardless if its empowered or not Reap still counts as a visit, unlike the Possessor or Sorcerer if the cloak is used. Plus, this is a NK with a 12%ish win ratio, Reapers aren’t broken in the slightest.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s no reason why a Reaper would want to use Empowered Reap on a Saint claim. Saints are a neutral class that can’t vote players up so it’d be in his interest to keep the Saint alive in order to make it hard for the court to put them on trial. The question of whether Saints should be immune to Empowered Reap is irrelevant to balance here as there is no reason for a Reaper who’s not a complete imbecile to waste souls and a night to kill a Neutral.</p>

            <p>Interesting, I was under the impression the Empowered Reap would get through Occupation, since it bypasses visit prevention. If that’s not the case, then I agree, Heart Sight is indeed enough.</p>

            <p>I’m on the fence about it, I’ll wait and see what others think about it. If there’s a consensus on getting rid of that, I will. I just think having some form of counterplay to Empowered Reap is good.</p>

            <p>Every NK has a means of countering Poison and Bleeding. The Sorcerer is outright immune to it, the Reaper can use a soul on the day they would be killed to heal themselves and the Possessor can jump to another player and leave the Poisoned or Bleeding body alone.</p>
<p>Also there’s no real reason why a Saint should be immune from an empowered reap. Reapers don’t yolo empower and a neutral would be a low-priority target for them.</p>

<p>It’s entirely possible for the game to already spawn a <strong>total</strong> of 3 Alchemists(Healers with night immunity), Sellswords(Occupation and prevention on most visits) and Mercenaries(One-shot immunity for a player and prevention on visits).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Full quote. As in it can be a combination of either 2 Alchemists+Mercenary, 2 Mercenaries+Alchemist, 1 of each, or any variations of thereafter. My point there was that OP was grossly overestimating how much his class would bog the game down as there are already plenty of neutrals that do that.</p>

            <p>Interesting, the only time poison/bleeding came into play with a Neutral Killing role for me has been with Sorcerer and Reaper, so I assumed Death Immunity covered both, but that’s in fact not the case.</p>
<p>Still, that doesn’t mean the mechanics are contradictory, the Sorcerer is immune to both Death at night and Poison/Bleeding, so having an upgraded Hide that grants those immunities (plus an exception for Empowered Reap) seems doable.</p>
<p>Didn’t know Circle of Death counted as an attack, since the target themselves is not attacked. Interesting.</p>

            <p>False. Death immunity is a spacific mechanic. Poison and bleed spacificaly bypass it and so does Empower Reaper. Furthermore Empower Reap only bypasses Death immunity and Healing (regular reap bypasses healing too)</p>

            <p>Those statements are not contradictory at all. Death Immunity covers more than attacks (since it covers bleed/poison and bear/circle of death, none of which are attacks) and the Empowered Reap bypasses not just Death Immunity, but also Occupation and Visit Prevention. The mechanics are not really related at all, so there’s no contradiction.</p>
<p>Sacred Lunar Seal is a Hide that works against Empowered Reap, that’s it.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed people underestimating the difficulty of actually finding the correct targets. You find a Hunter thinking he’s assassin/NK, go Heart Sight him, you die to his bear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heart Sight shouldn’t be classified as an attack, so a bear shouldn’t kill the Saint. Plus, with proper scumreading a Saint can basically find an evil early on, especially with the ability to check 2 people per night, and repeatedly block them three nights in a row. This would make it far too much of a pain for evils in general to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you could find the NK/assassin/CL early and stay on them to try and win, but the killer can choose to not attack. If you know a Saint found you, you can make them question whether to stay on you and waste their limited uses of Heart Sight or move on to another target, because Heart Sight does not occupy unless you choose to attack. As the CL, you can convert instead of Eradicate. As Possessor, you can Puppet Strings instead of Possess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically if an attacker got the prevented/occupied message they wouldn’t automatically assume that they’re being occupied by a Saint, so there’s no reason why they would waste a night just in the case for that scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other evils that kill have to either do nothing or they can try to keep attacking to gain occupation immunity. It’s not perfect, I agree, but it’s not any worse than being found by a Butler/Drunk and occupied 3 nights in a row.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butlers don’t have any way to detect if a person actually can attack or not so they’re not like the Saint. Drunks typically out their attackers the beginning of the day as they have no reason to keep them alive and it’s less frustrating for Unseen/Cult and better for BD that way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, since no Neutrals can be converted (and it seems to be norm from now on) can we really have that as a criteria for a good neutral role?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. A hypothetical neutral that can be converted would balance its confirmability out as that’d give reason for BD to want to execute them. A neutral with all 3 checks could just claim d1, confirm themselves in the next day or two, and then basically just AFK and nobody will bother them anymore ala the Alchemist’s early iteration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did take into consideration C, and I tried to balance giving them a defensive tool so as not to die too early vs. not making them too easy to confirm. I wouldn’t mind weakening Sacred Lunar Seal to simply granting Death Immunity for that night, since it fits better with a NK/MM claiming it, but not preventing visits means Investigative classes can check them, which can also help confirm them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except that this would specifically require both a Sheriff/Paladin and a Princess to check on them to make sure they are both NS and Special/Investigative. The current iteration basically just needs for anyone to visit the Saint the night they use SLS to confirm themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making the Saint not unique feels like it would bog down the game too much, with way too much death prevention and occupation. Even if you weaken the Saint, their whole shtick is preventing death. Having 2 of them plus whatever healers, knights, drunks, butlers and mercs you might have can end up with a blockade where nobody dies for 3-4 nights and we’re back to having to execute during the day to make any progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s entirely possible for the game to already spawn a total of 3 Alchemists(Healers with night immunity), Sellswords(Occupation and prevention on most visits) and Mercenaries(One-shot immunity for a player and prevention on visits). Up to 2 Saints replacing that would not bog the game down for too long, especially as a game with 2 of the same kind of neutral isn’t common at all.</p>
<p>The entire point in removing the Saint’s uniqueness is to make them a better fake claim for evils, as the class right now has pretty good conditional retroactive confirmation in HS and SLS while also being too BD sided for them to want to execute you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>1:</p>
<p>I’ve noticed people underestimating the difficulty of actually finding the correct targets. You find a Hunter thinking he’s assassin/NK, go Heart Sight him, you die to his bear. You find Inquisitor/Paladin/Prince/Knight, you waste a use of your abilities because they don’t kill every night.</p>
<p>Yes, you could find the NK/assassin/CL early and stay on them to try and win, but the killer can choose to not attack. If you know a Saint found you, you can make them question whether to stay on you and waste their limited uses of Heart Sight or move on to another target, because Heart Sight does not occupy unless you choose to attack. As the CL, you can convert instead of Eradicate. As Possessor, you can Puppet Strings instead of Possess.</p>
<p>The other evils that kill have to either do nothing or they can try to keep attacking to gain occupation immunity. It’s not perfect, I agree, but it’s not any worse than being found by a Butler/Drunk and occupied 3 nights in a row.</p>
<p>2:</p>

            <p>The concept is pretty good, but I still have two issues with this class.</p>
<ol>
<li>This class is too strong and BD-sided as it can basically win by finding and blocking the Assassin/CL or NK for three nights straight. Heart Sight should only work once per target or have other limitations as otherwise this would be extremely frustrating for Evils to play around.</li>
<li>The Saint fails the test for a good neutral role. A good neutral must only have 2 out of the following 3 attributes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A) Be useful for BD. <em>-Entire shtick is preventing night kills, which help BD far more than Unseen/Cult/NK.</em><br>
B) Unable to be converted. <em>-Since you didn’t create an Unseen version, I’m taking this as a yes.</em><br>
C) Easily confirmable. <em>-Is unique and Sacred Lunar Seal can be used as a means to confirm themselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d personally remove its unique attributes and also the prevention on Sacred Lunar Seal. 2 weaker Saints add more claim-space for evils without making them too overbearing and that’d be better than the current single strong one of your iteration.</p>
