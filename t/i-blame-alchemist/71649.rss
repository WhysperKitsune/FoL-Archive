    <title>I Blame Alchemist</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-blame-alchemist/71649</link>
    <description>Pretender will be very hard to win with, which is causing a lot of complaints.

I blame Alchemist.

Well, not *just* Alchemist, but them along with Inquisitor, Fool, and I guess pretty much *all* of this game&#39;s current Neutrals.

I see no problems with instating a difficult Neutral class. If it needs to be buffed later, that&#39;s *really* easy. Give it self-guards, let it kill more Royals, and if it&#39;s really bad give it a couple kills as King to speed up the game. It&#39;s much, much easier to buff a class than it is to nerf it. So why the outrage?

I blame Alchemist.

See, here&#39;s what happened. We all got so used to Neutral classes that are *too* good at accomplishing their wincon.

- Alchemist needs to survive. Okay. But what do we give it to do that? Four nights of death immunity activated during the day, two free kills on other players (notice the Pretender also has two kills but has to investigate them first and may only kill other Royals), *and* infinite healing, which makes it very beneficial to the Blue Dragon if kept alive. That&#39;s a *lot* of powers.
- Inquisitor needs to have the Sorcerer die. Okay. But what did we give it to do that? One-shot night immunity, visits hidden from Observers, a neat investigative ability, and a three-use immunity-piercing attack on the Sorcerer (or any other magic users). Plus, you win even if somebody else kills the Sorcerer, meaning you can do literally nothing and still win. That&#39;s a *lot* of powers.
- Fool needs to get lynched. Okay. But what did we give it to do that? Two self-frames, two nights of death immunity, permanent occupation immunity, and the ability to make it appear as if others said things they did not. That&#39;s a *lot* of powers.

I could go on, but I&#39;d hope my point is made. The overall power level of Neutrals in this game is *really* high. Hell, even the Neutral King apparently has a 75% winrate. It&#39;s for this reason that introducing a difficult Neutral class is getting so much backlash so quickly. It&#39;s not that the concept is bad, or that the class is underpowered to a broken degree. It&#39;s that we&#39;ve come to expect such a high level of power to accomplish our goals as a Neutral that anything less than that seems like it will be too hard.

I for one welcome this change. Rolling Neutral should not be handing you a relatively safe and easy win. Having to work hard for my victories as a Pretender will make them even sweeter, and I think we all need to take a step back here and look at this objectively. It&#39;s okay for a class to be difficult; hell, it&#39;s infinitely better than it being so strong it&#39;s boring. It&#39;s okay for a class to be buffed post-release; that&#39;s way simpler than trying to nerf it will ever be. But when it comes down to it, I can see where all of these complaints are coming from, even though I don&#39;t agree.

I blame Alchemist.</description>

<p>Judging by most of the post he’s mostly using old rules, hence inquisitor is listed as “killing magic users”, and “having a neat investigative ability”. When the current inq gets 3 blind/scumread stabs (which will kill any non immune class, plus sorc), and has a supposed investigative ability so that they can claim they are doing something other than blind stabbing when questioned (only an idiot would actually believe the results of those checks, when sorc has 2 uses of a full court frame, and 2 uses of an ability that makes him appear not magic user,). The inq’s actual investigative ability is the 3 uses of ruthless efficiency, as sorc can’t fake a class flip in the death announcements.</p>
<p>But yeah I do fully agree with the whole, alc is pretty obnoxious for what he is, it’s a fun class… but his ability to help bd outweighs any risk of him betreying BD (making him very unlikely to be executed). The probability of a stoneskin etc… makes him not worth attempting to remove from the board for the unseen, thus making his survival a bit too easy.</p>

            <p>Only NK should be hard to win with since it robs everyone else of their win. All other neutrals do not have this issue and their  winrate is ideally 50%. Those Neutral King stats are also highly biased as we only have neutral kings that have stepped up now and yes then it is insanely easy to win with.</p>
