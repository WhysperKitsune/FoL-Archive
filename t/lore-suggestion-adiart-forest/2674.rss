    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-adiart-forest/2674</link>
    <description>This forest is a memorable one one that in frequently inhabited by a specific member of the Blue Dragon. Roamed by many animals none tend to enter without knowing the wildlife. This forest is treated like a home to the hunter, seeing as though he has spent all of his life here. Along with the bears that he have tamed, he has tamed bird and others. He is the king of this forest, although he needs to kill for food. He sets spike traps here in order to replenish his hunger. But saying that, he honors the animals he kills.</description>
