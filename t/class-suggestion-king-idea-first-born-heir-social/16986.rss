            <p>Both versions can become a much stronger than normal king. The first born can also trick the unseen/cult as I mentioned and also tank conversations even if they aren’t fooled. The hier can act as an extra vote due to not counting towards the Unseen and cults faction limit.</p>

            <p>Good. Im going for the heir to be someone who doesn’t know who the unseen is. Also what I have been trying to say is that regardless of if he used his night Ability or not he comes up as unseen/cult on the sidebar for the other members. This would have the same effect on cult because he only ever converts to heir as per what I said next to him.</p>

            <p>To tell the heir who he needs to vote with. Basically you want to prevent him from accidentally voting up unseen or innoing sus BD. Plus once he becomes king it is even more important for them to communicate.</p>
