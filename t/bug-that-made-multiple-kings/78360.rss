I wasnt able to use my Prince abilities, but I could point (wasnt able to slam).
Later on king 1 and king 6 died for some reason, and I was only one who was able to step as new king, while beeing a king, and I didnt do that, so MM was kinged by court (rest of it, some died by night due to dc) next day. Game was hilarious, but Im not sure what really happend</description>
