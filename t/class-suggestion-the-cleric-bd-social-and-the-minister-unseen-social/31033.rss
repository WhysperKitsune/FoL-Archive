            <p>First quick impression, the Clerics Passive is too powerful. One of the things the unseen/cult have going for them is the mystery of “is there is more out there”. If there is a class that can track every convert then there is no mystery anymore.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what sending a random message to all of x class would do aside from A: Reveal yourself and B: Tell them to do x to prove or be voted up…and most of the time they won’t be listened too.</p>
<p>Second power, no one would risk sending a random, could be converted, person a message. They’d have no idea if it was a Cleric or a Minister they were talking too, anonymous or not.</p>
<p>This is basically Psychic in my opinion, just without the undead talking. The Day Abilities of both are nice but the passive is to powerful and the Night Abilities too risky. The passive being changed to a day power with x uses might work, means the usual “N1 Convert Night, Night 2 Attack/Investigate” is a risk and might change that up a bit.</p>
