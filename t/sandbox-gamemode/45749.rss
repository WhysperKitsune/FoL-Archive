    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about something which would make the job easier for guides, mods and even regular people! A gamemode, which follows the exact same rules as a regular game, but it&#39;s only run by 1 player. That way, we can determine what is a bug and what is not a bug! 

We can also help new people with it. They always have interesting questions that even we don&#39;t have answers to. This gamemode would help a bunch with problem solving in my opinion!</description>

            <p>This sounds like something that could properly help debug the game, and it also works as a safety net for all future updates. I think it’s a good idea.</p>

            <p>Honestly, this could be extremely useful for testing interactions or bugs with abilities. It might be a great deal of work to program however, that’d be my only concern. I quite like this idea though. I can see many situations it would be very helpful in.</p>

            <p>This would be extremely useful both for testing and for people just learning the game.  Make it so all coundowns last until “next” is pushed, and have a little button next to each name that you can use to become that person.</p>

            <p>Yeah, i would assume there would be a manual end-night button, and you can swap between the various numbers perspectives (and name them), and i assume you could choose the classes before hand, providing it doesnt break any explicit rules (like the cap on the number of unseen being 3) or maybe implicit rules (3rd unseen wont spawn)</p>
