    <title>Improper game end?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/improper-game-end/9308</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
There were 5 players remaining in the game.

2 was sheriff and was reaped.
9 was king and BD.
12 was reaper.
14 was butler.
16 was Assassin.

16 was hanged and the game instantly ended as a BD win, but from my perspective the reaper has a 50/50 chance or so to win from that position based on attacking the non-guarded target that night.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The game shouldn&#39;t have ended, the reaper should have had a 50/50 chance to win the game that night.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Have a reaper, a reaped target who is BD, and 2 other BD.

            <p>Had one earlier where it got down to Reaper and King, Reaper had 2 souls.  King won, even though they’d just executed the last cult, so the Reaper should have been able to Reap the King right then and there and win (with souls to bypass immunity even).</p>
<p>Felt bad, the Reaper played it perfectly and still lost even though he would’ve won if allowed to play it out.</p>
<p>Basically it was:  CL, Reaper, BD King.  Reaper convinced King to kill CL.  After execution.  BD wins.  Even though Reaper had 2 souls and was going into night vs a lone king.  If he reaped king, king couldn’t vote and he’d have won. Instead the king won because… no idea why.</p>

            <p>Yeah…</p>
<p>Yesterday or the day before, I played a game where we had an Evil King and it was Reaper and Evil King left (and I think a member of the BD or Alche). I believe the reaper reaped the Neut/BD but the result was an Unseen victory.</p>

            <p>In all probability, the BD would win that game. But yes, it could have gone either way.</p>
<p>The only question is if the King was Reaperable or not.</p>

            <p>Imperium42 should really let these games play out. It’s robbing scum teams of their wins when the game assumes everybody knows the alignment of everybody still alive.</p>

            <p>But they didn’t know for sure that 2 was reaped nor were they sure he wasn’t converted. There was a lot of potential for misplay that ends in a reaper win.</p>
