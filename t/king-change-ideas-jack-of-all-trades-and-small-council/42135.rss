    <title>King change ideas: jack of all trades and small council</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-change-ideas-jack-of-all-trades-and-small-council/42135</link>
    <description>A vocal subset of people seem to be dissatisfied with our new murderous king. I&#39;ll agree that the current king&#39;s mechanical flavor feels like more of a temperamental dictator than a noble leader of the court.

It&#39;s one thing to have a knight who gets bored and yolo coldsteels someone, killing himself, than a novice king who gets bored and yolo executes people, removing THEM from the game.

As it stands I have two suggestions: a &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; variety and a &quot;Small Council&quot; variety.

JACK OF ALL TRADES
Day abilities remain unchanged
Night abilities are set to:
Guard (4 uses) - Same as current
Allies (1 use) - Returns only &quot;unseen&quot;, &quot;cult&quot;, or &quot;not suspicious&quot;
Order Execution (1 use) - Same as current
Private Conversation (2 uses) - Like psychic link

This king has lots of tools, but a very finite number of each. As king, your job is to follow up on the information you&#39;re given, not to be a primary investigator.

I don&#39;t think this needs much explanation. It&#39;s a minor sampling of existing mechanics.

SMALL COUNCIL
Same day abilities, plus a new one:
Select Councilors (infinite) - Choose three players to form your small council tonight. Those three will be placed in a private chatroom with you similar to that of the unseen/cult tonight.
Night abilities:
Guard (6 uses).

Now, this is a bit more high concept and mechanically demanding. The number of councilors is certainly up for debate, but my goal in selecting three is twofold: keep the number low enough to remain productive in the short night period, and keep the number high enough such that not everyone would be willing to out themselves on early nights.</description>
