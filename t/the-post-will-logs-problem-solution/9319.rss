    <title>The &quot;Post Will/Logs&quot; Problem &amp; Solution</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-post-will-logs-problem-solution/9319</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve all had that time where you&#39;re put up for execution, and you&#39;re asked to post your logs. First thing everyone does is highlight the page in their will, ctrl+c and ctrl+v it into the chat box. However, this is where the issues come into play.

The chatbox has a character limit, so at most you post the first 4 or 5 nights worth of logs, and thats when players start voting. At this point players think you&#39;re evil because you didnt post the later nights in the chat. Obviously for the one being executed their panicking trying to find out where the chatbox character limit stopped and copying/pasting from that point on and putting it in the chatbox.

After that however, it&#39;s almost already too late, most players have voted and you have no real time to type to them and explain your logs, and how they actually make sense, and you end up dying.

It&#39;s a major issue, and a lot of players end up dying without even getting the chance to fight the claim.

The obvious and simple solution would be to increase the chatbox character limit, however this would allow for paragraphs worth of text from players, and would cause issues regarding spam in the game.

My suggested solution is a button or command that allows the player to input their will into the chatbox, ignoring the character limit.

**Example:** you are jailed and you have 8 nights worth of logs, so instead of trying to copy/paste your will frantically, you could just type /will (page #) and it&#39;d output all the text on that input page into the chatbox and send it (ignoring the character limit of course).

**This solution would both solve this issue, and still keep that character limit in the chatbox which prevents users from spamming/posting paragraphs of text.**

Let me know what you guys think of this idea, and any other methods you think we could help the dev&#39;s with regarding this issue &lt;3</description>

            <p>I think a better idea would be a button a player could press that means other players can look at their log.</p>

            <p>Don’t take it personally. It’s just unclear how to distribute credit/MMR to players who then lose to their own decision making after conversion.</p>

            <p>I have no faith in your ability to make a good MMR system (as I have no faith in any man’s ability to fly of his own accord), but I wish you well in the endeavor nonetheless.</p>

            <p>I’m also doing some brainstorming regarding a capable MMR system for the game, even with the conversions (which is the main issue the developers are running into). I have quite a few ideas, but i’m writing some test algorithms to really see if they’d really work as intended (with as little issues as possible). I’ll make a post in the future regarding MMR/Ranked once I complete them all and get the results.</p>
