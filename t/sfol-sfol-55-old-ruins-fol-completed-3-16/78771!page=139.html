<p>I honestly really don’t like Priestess’ behavior around Soul. As town she doesn’t really push people that hard, but here she’s like ‘lynch Soul, he has barely contributed and I don’t like him.’ She’s pushing him, and pushing him over Marshal who had a scummier day 1 in my opinion. I’m starting to wonder if she’s groupscum with Marshal (I know, lolpreflips).</p>
<p>It just strikes me as weird how aggressively Priestess jumps on that push.</p>
<p>And there is more. There were several of Priestess’s posts which pinged me before.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I personally don’t mind how priestess interacted with myself I feel like priestess is that kind of reaction testy player and generally pushes, but I can agree to a certain extent that her joining my bandwagon was weird, (I even pointed this out on my reads list and feel like it was one of the genuine things I could only put aganist priestess even if it was based upon myself.  again I feel like priestess <em>Could</em> of been trying to push me towards trying harder by joining the wagon I don’t think it’s a set case one way or the other, also it’s possible priestess could use this as a accuse but for what it’s worth It did generally push me to at least try harder and try to help town. So this action seems really null for me. (Not trying to whiteknight priestess but I’ll acknowledge that defending someone can be seen in that way).</p>

<p>Which was a question I asked because I found it really stupid. Priestess’s response feels… a bit awkward. ‘Tele hasn’t been on my good side this game.’ But she put her in towncore before… why put someone who isn’t on your good side in towncore? It feels like I caught her on a read she didn’t care about and she had to backtrack.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I felt like this was  a very “prietess” thing she generally reaction tests ect. While to a extent this is only from memory and I should be honestly looking at some of her town games soon I don’t know it feels like a priestess move from me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice that she did not re-evaluate on Soul whatsoever despite his posts being significantly better as of late (in my opinion) and his lengthy interaction with Solic. She sees an opportunity D2 and hard pushes him <em>again.</em> There was no <em>attempt</em> to see something towny, she just tunnel votes him <em>despite still having other scumreads.</em></p>
<p>Note that the counterwagon as of right now is Marshal and most of us agreed that he was scummy D1, but Princess townread him. The fact she is hard pushing Soul feels like an attempt to get the wagon off of Marshal. This point is moot if Marshal is town, but it makes perfect sense I’d Marshal/Priestess are both scum.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>(Thanks, it’s been a hard time getting better at fol at least I’m better then 2018 Fol Soul O_o that was a hot mess)<br>
I felt like my main point was that defense was content even if it’s not the best sort of content it was early game I had hardly anything to point out apart from derps Isos which where hypocritical to say the least I don’t know if I’ve changed on derp but at some point today (in fol terms of a day) I want to look at derp again. I disliked the whole push on myself maybe I got really emtional but I was planning on making reads and I felt like everyone didn’t even give me a chance I also just woke up from a nap and first thing I got bombarded with people calling me scum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She finally posts a readlist and it mostly follows consensus aside from a few key spots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Townread on Marshal.</li>
<li>Townread on Tele <em>again.</em>
</li>
<li>Scumread on Solic.</li>
<li>Null/Townlean on Luxy.</li>
<li>Null/Townlean on Arete (I know he claimed Cowardly but bear with me) - at the time that wasn’t consensus from my POV, but I suppose this one isn’t AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels like she is scumreading Solic because she doesn’t have enough scumreads, honestly. She calls Jake scum and doesn’t explain it, and the Solic read is… what? She says his progression is good but she is scumreading him anyway? …Okay?<br>
So she only has two scumreads. She turns to Tele town again, and nulls/townleans Luxy despite several people suspecting him. Maybe she didn’t want him lynched, I don’t know since she didn’t explain that either.<br>
The townread on Marshal feels like it comes completely out of left field. She has not been defending him too strongly before if I remember correctly, point me to these posts if she has. This reeks of an attempt to change the thread direction, but it didn’t really work… which is important.</p>
<p>I know this post has been really chaotic (I’m trying to squeeze a good post into a 30 minute break) but Priestess D1 in hindsight was… really bad in my opinion.</p>
<p>And then we move into D2.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree with “following a Consensus” bd don’t get far if everyone just blindly agrees with each other it creates discussion and better pushes to play devils advocate sometimes or disagree with someone and not hide it I don’t think priestess not following a general consensus is needed.</p>
<p>I don’t really know priestess vs solic that well I generally felt like she was pushing solic in a way that because he was a veteran and she needs to create more of a reaction filled read based on how he interacts with others.</p>
<p>I think the same really goes for Jake and others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This entire push by Priestess reeks of being orchestrated in bad faith and her D1 has been mostly her drifting through the thread without notable contributions, sadly. All of that combined and I don’t really see her being town here.</p>
<p><strong>/vote Priestess</strong></p>
<p>If Priestess is evil, Soul is probably spewed town or at least not groupscum. Luxy/Shurian’s position is worse because Priestess put a null read on him, kinda ‘leaving him for later’ as a result.<br>
Marshal looks terrible by association if Priestess flips scum, too.</p>
<p>TL; DR I think Princess scum and this post is so disorganized I’m sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>TL: DR I think this is likely TvT, I just still need to look into priestess on other games but I don’t think this is priestess acting strange at least.</p>
<p>I might of skipped over things because I was interrupted while doing this -_-.</p>

<p>I honestly really don’t like Priestess’ behavior around Soul. As town she doesn’t really push people that hard, but here she’s like ‘lynch Soul, he has barely contributed and I don’t like him.’ She’s pushing him, and pushing him over Marshal who had a scummier day 1 in my opinion. I’m starting to wonder if she’s groupscum with Marshal (I know, lolpreflips).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Tbh the interactions between me and Soul feel very natural. It was tl;dr “Hey i’m gonna be unproductive” “hecking soul, stop being unproductive, can you help me with some reads” “ok I did that and you still scumread me??? I give up” “coward, go replace out, or fight” “ok”</p>

<p>It is a D1, my friend. I do a lot of shading and trying to play with the thoughts that someone is scum… pushing them… and seeing that my suspicions are unsustainable. I simply try to “not deathtunnel a potential BD”, cause that’s… welll… deadly.</p>

<p>I didn’t clear Marshal from being mastermind, I just said none of the mechanical info we have is a hardproof for having Soul and him in a thunderdome. The most dangerous stuff which can happen to BD is a TvT fake thunderdome imho.<br>
I want some explanations from Shurian to how it came to this fake thunderdome tbh.</p>

<p>I personally don’t mind how priestess interacted with myself I feel like priestess is that kind of reaction testy player and generally pushes, but I can agree to a certain extent that her joining my bandwagon was weird, (I even pointed this out on my reads list and feel like it was one of the genuine things I could only put aganist priestess even if it was based upon myself. again I feel like priestess <em>Could</em> of been trying to push me towards trying harder by joining the wagon I don’t think it’s a set case one way or the other, also it’s possible priestess could use this as a accuse but for what it’s worth It did generally push me to at least try harder and try to help town. So this action seems really null for me. (Not trying to whiteknight priestess but I’ll acknowledge that defending someone can be seen in that way).</p>

          <p>I think I’m an extreme case in this tho… I don’t see many people doing so much questionable stuff as BD as I <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png!v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>
<p>Okay.<br>
I’m not 100% sure why I didn’t feel very comfortable with the thread, but now I feel like the last stuff was only posted by townies, pretty confident on this.<br>
I don’t have a lot of scumreads in this game, I don’t think we have an obvious powerwolfer in this game. I’ll go and create an PoE, that’s kinda the way to solve this game I guess.</p>

          <p>I’m likely going to make a full reads lists on Arete next might take me even longer then priestess reads and may even need a small break over it but a king with a good chance of being evil is worth to look at</p>
<p>I honestly Don’t want to be a meanie to a Neutral King (Infact I love neutral kings). But that big chance of ek really doesn’t look nice.</p>
<p>Eitherway I think Arete should be left alone for now as I’ve seen some of there posts as general contribution and trying to help bd, this may change Idk.</p>

<p>Pretty sure based on what Marshal said he <em>wasn’t</em> occupied because he was referring to yesterday when he didn’t want to be occupied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay I just saw that Soul claimed Observer and according to Kyo Marshal visited Vul. One of them is confirmed evil (Marshal/Soul) so why are y’all trying to vote outside of that thunderdome? It’s like Blizer and Italy all over again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here I actually definitely believe Soul’s claim over Marshal’s. I do believe Marshal is the type of person to claim Maid as MM.</p>
