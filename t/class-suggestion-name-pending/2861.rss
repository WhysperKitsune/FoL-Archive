    <description>The (new name required)
Passive:night immune once
Passive #2-resistance of wine
Day ability-disguise(infinite or 5 uses)
Description-makes you look/act (choose one of those words or choose a better one) like the disguised player, causing different investigative results to appear for the night.
Night abilities
1) makeup-makes you perform the main action of the disguised player.(requires use of disguise)(shows a box of numbers of players.)(this wont change the target of the mercrenary-you only ...waste a use?)

(Since it will be too op, the ability will fail when you disguise as all specials.)

2) props (4 uses)-try to make items of a player&#39;s house by learning what they have.
Notification examples-
1 Your target has keys to a jail.
2 Your target has a case of wine glasses.
3 Your target owns a wolf.
4 Your target wears a cloak.

3) Resemble-gives you the role of the disguised player.

Win condition: Depends on what role you choose.

Neutral Support(since you do the ability using makeup, you are indirectly doing the player&#39;s actions.)

            <p>A bit confusing but I get the idea.</p>
<p>I would remove the 2nd night ability (it doesn’t fit and it causes most of the confusion.) And I would make the class convertible (have the converted version lose the second ability)</p>

            <p>this is very confusing, could you update it to match the established formula for classes? <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/72">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/72</a></p>
