    <title>Should Prince claim Day 1? (Probably)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/should-prince-claim-day-1-probably/9297</link>
    <description>Can Prince safely claim Day 1? With 16 players alive, it is guaranteed that there is either a Knight, Physician, Court Wizard, friendly Alchemist in the game who can protect him.

**Advantages:** 

1) Protective classes don&#39;t waste their time trying to find the Prince. They also don&#39;t accidentally save evil classes.

2) Investigative classes don&#39;t waste time using a night to accidentally find the Prince. They can have a smaller list of suspicious players to investigate.

3) Prince won&#39;t be accidentally voted up to trial and executed by an Evil King.

4) Prince can safely receive whisper claims from suspicious people (or everybody, why the hell not)

5) **The Prince won&#39;t die randomly the first night.**

**Disadvantages:**

1) You have to trust that protective classes believe you or otherwise don&#39;t screw up somehow.

2) The Prince is subject to dangerous day abilities like Chilling Touch or Nightshade.

3) Prince can die at night if there is an Unseen Enforcer or Sage.

4) Possessors can Puppet Strings a BD player into you, potentially causing two BD deaths in one night (However, he may also target evil classes as well -- this might be a good strategy to get the MM killed Night 1 every now and then.)

**Dangers at night?:** There are not a whole lot of threats during the beginning of the game. Even Empowered Reaper attacks or Possessor jumps still die to the Knight. Once a Knight dies, I&#39;d expect NKs to try a shot at the Prince as they won&#39;t immediately lose if they&#39;re wrong when a Knight is guarding. However, there can be two Knights in a game, so even this fact might scare off NKs. Even if 2 Knights are dead, there is still the Ice Ward from the CW or Physicians and friendly Alchemists wanting to prove themselves. There are a lot of barriers to go through before an evil class can get to the Prince. This isn&#39;t even accounting for the King&#39;s guards which can also help prove his allegiance. 

I&#39;m not sure where I lean on the Day 1 claim. I&#39;m inclined to think it is _advantageous_ right now because it causes protective classes to be immediately useful Night 1 instead of playing whack-a-mole for a few days before finding a confirmed BD. Even if the Prince is poisoned, there are still a lot of class slots open for Physicians and Alchemists. Every now and then evils will try to kill the Prince claim anyway and fail, too. The real dangers are the Marshall, Sage and Enforcer.</description>

<p>I feel like anybody who claims Prince day 1 will be investigated anyway, even though it’s obvious that if he was faking the real Prince could just nab him, because people are silly geese.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thats 100% true. If ranked existed and it was a game with good players, then he obv would not get suspected much, but with the current players i play with, they would all call him a fool and every investigative roles would be on him.</p>

<p>3 souls</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s 4 souls. 2 to revive, 2 to bypass.</p>
<p>The attack is still redirected to the Knight. So the Reaper will have spent 4 souls to kill a Knight.</p>

            <p>Well if you have 3 souls, you can bypass immunity and survive the Knight’s attack <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>

<p>Reaper will bypass immunity</p>

</aside>
<p>If a Knight is guarding then the Reaper loses the game tho</p>
<p>You could try bypassing immunity after seeing a dead Knight, maybe</p>

            <p>Disadvantage: Prince will die anyway. Reaper will bypass immunity and generally everyone will do their best to kill him.</p>
<p>Not really a fan of the strategy.</p>
