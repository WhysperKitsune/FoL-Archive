    <title>[Lore suggestion] The Duchess</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-duchess/2272</link>
    <description>She had been in her room, feeling contempt for her life. She had realized that all though she had royal blood, she would likely never become the monarch; her father was to young to die any time soon, and the court favored her brother for king anyways.

She would likely be married off to a neighboring kingdom&#39;s prince as an act of diplomacy.

She resented this situation.
She resented her father.
She resented her brother.
She resented the blue dragon.

She finally decided that she would escape, run away into the night. Maybe she would be an adventurer, or join up with the army. All she knew is she would be as far away from here as possible.

After she gathered her things, she took a deep breath and opened her door.

There she saw a hooded figure with odd, gray skin; he stood there; she could not hear his breathing.

The princess took a second to decide whether she would call for help, but then she realized that he was not here to hurt her; he was here to help her regain vengeance on her father, her brother, and the blue dragon.</description>

            <p>I like it all apart from the bit where it goes “He was the master mind”. This should be obvious from reading it and her reaction so it’s needless, it breaks the tension and dumbs it down.</p>
<p>Other than its pretty good.</p>
