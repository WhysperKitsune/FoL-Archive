    <description>**The Convict (Neutral Offensive)**

**Passive 1: Wanted**
You will appear to be a member of the Cult/Unseen to all investigative abilities. If the _Prince_ jails you on Night 3 or later, they will be forced to Execute you, unless they have no charges left.

**Passive 2: Hard Times**
Immune to death at night once. Immune to bleeding/poison once.

**Day Ability 1: Evasion (1 use)**
You cannot be jailed tonight. You will appear to be jailed to the _Prince_, and you will still be able to talk to them in jail, but they will not be able to Execute you.

**Night Ability 1: Reduce Heat (3 uses)**
You will appear to be not suspicious to investigators tonight.

**Night Ability 2: Deflect Heat (2 uses)**
Choose a target. Anyone targeting you will be forced to target them instead, and your target will show up as a member of the Cult/Unseen. Cannot use until Night 3.

**Win Condition: Survive.**</description>

            <p>Eh… I’m the same, its really manageable to filter someones posts here though and we’ve all been through the newbie phase.</p>
<p>Someone has recently joined who is a vet at Forum Mafia but completely new to Throne of Lies and it’s forum counterpart: Forum of Lies. The vast majority of the setups here are role madness meaning everyone gets to do something, however the feedback has been reduced so have the time you have no idea whether your actions did anything or not -_-</p>

            <p>Maybe make it disrupt BD (like Sellsword), as you said to throw off BD Invests. I would’ve suggested that it would kill any support class that visits them (1 at a time, priority takes effect if multiple?) but it sounds dumb and it’d be like an NK.</p>
<p>Also Marcus I’m afraid I’d fail at Forum Mafia, everyone scum reads/town reads a lot and I’m not the best at those.</p>
<p>Edit: It would kill off possible protective for BD, and make them concerned about Convict.<br>
Edit 2: It could also kill Alchemists/Mercenary that visit them for whatever reason, making them more careful in using a potion.</p>

            <p>mhm I like that passive on a neutral as well, its actually a long standing feature of old-school social deduction games to include someone who comes up as evil but is actually town</p>

            <p>Day 1:</p>
<p>“Hey guys I’m a convict, Sheriffs/Pallys check me and I will redirect you onto someone else.”</p>
<p>Day 2 you’re confirmed and all you have left to mess around with BD is a single use of tornado.</p>
<p>I would suggest making it slightly less BD-friendly than its current state for example: all Unseen/Cult/NKs that are usually not occupy immune will be, and any BD class that tries to change them will be notified that it succeeded similar to the Masterminds occ immune ability, in addition, all BD classes that are usually occ/redirect immune will actually lose it secretly. This Neutral could be confirmed to evils but not to BD</p>
