    <title>Keep Mind Warp the way it is</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/keep-mind-warp-the-way-it-is/73803</link>
    <description>* Illusionist needs a powerful ability since it is converted from a very confirmable BD.  Mind warp fits that.  

* Mind Warp is great because of how it can affect any class.  No feedback should be infallible.  Anything that improves the deduction aspect of this game is a good thing.

&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not a nerf&quot;

* Yes it is.  Mind Warp acts as both a frame and tailor, and can affect any class.  Making it just a frame will remove the tailor and make it only affect investigatives, which is definitely a nerf.


&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s confusing for new players&quot;

* So?  All feedback-altering abilities can be confusing.  We shouldn&#39;t balance for new players.  I&#39;m fine with rewording abilities/modifying feedback, but you shouldn&#39;t change the core idea of an ability just because some people find it confusing.  And mind warp is relatively easy to understand, it just causes you to receive false feedback.  

&gt; &quot;But it can cause bugs&quot;

* What bugs?  Receiving DNR on a bleeding player when you were Mind Warped is not a bug, it&#39;s how Mind Warp is intended to work.  
# Other Solutions

* Include examples of how mind warp interacts with abilities in the glossary.

* Add the phrase &quot;Or you were Mind Warped&quot; to feedback.

* Clarify that Mind Warp can affect any class in the description</description>
