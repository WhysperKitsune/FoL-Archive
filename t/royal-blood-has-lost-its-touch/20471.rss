    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/royal-blood-has-lost-its-touch/20471</link>
    <description>royal blood doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore. Not one person with royal blood should step up because they are better as the class they are instead of being king. King actually nerfs the BD if royal steps up. Noble was the only one who could step up and not lose anything from it.</description>

<p>Wouldn’t you die just as easily as a regular BD class?</p>
<p>What kind of hypothetical situation are we talking about here?</p>

            <p>Late game Kings are incredibly powerful though. Stepping up also helps confirm that BD player in the first place.</p>

            <p>IMO it’s actually in a pretty good place overall. You have your cost/benefit of a royal blooded king. Being royal means a 0% chance of being any of the starting cult/unseen/neutrals. But for that security you also lose out on a valuable BD member.</p>

            <p>Poor dev’s can’t win.</p>
<p>Class sucks because he’s not good for anything but becoming king</p>
<p>Class removed</p>
<p>Royal blood sucks because there’s no royal classes bad enough to not be a downgrade</p>

            <p>Both correct from you and bbiaglla and sometimes the passive ruin BD’s chances by not letting Reaper or Possessor becoming next Neutral king if the previous one died, but it’s mostly player’s fault and their arrogance to become king rather than them will be their undoing.</p>
<p>That would be another matter discussing about them rather become Evil King or the unoffical The Psychopathic King [Which the latter makes more sense as Reaper and Possessor]</p>

            <p>I can’t say you’re wrong. But, What if. You expended all of your night/day abillities? as the BD you played as with royal blood. say, Drunk (used all happy hours) ? (just an example)</p>
