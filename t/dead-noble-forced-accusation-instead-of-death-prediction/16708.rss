    <title>Dead Noble forced accusation instead of death prediction</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/dead-noble-forced-accusation-instead-of-death-prediction/16708</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was dead as a Noble, tried to predict who would die at night, it forced them to accuse themselves

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to predict their death
#### Steps to reproduce:
Be a dead Noble and try to predict someone&#39;s death, happened first day after I died (I bled out)
