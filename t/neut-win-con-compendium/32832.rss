    <description>For anyone trying to make a neutral class you need a win condition. Here is a list of possible win conditions you could use.

## Existing Goals:

* Survive to the end
* Out live X Player/Class
* Get X Player Executed
* Keep X Player alive
* Get yourself executed
* Make sure the BD lose
* Kill the other factions

## Possible Short term goals (You win before the game ends):

* Target X people with an ability (Possibly X SPECIFIC people)
* Kill/Save X people
* Become King (possible)
* Execute X number of people
* Survive for X days
* Outlive X number of players
* Die
* Die to poison/Bleed

## Possible Long term goals (Cannot be completed until the end):
* Outlive literally everyone
* Have more Executions than deaths
* Have more Deaths than Executions
* Win as king
* Become a new class and complete its objectives
* Never be targeted by a night/day/any ability
* Be in X state (It would be something class specific)</description>
