    <title>Inquisitor kills King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/inquisitor-kills-king/17561</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Inquisitor killed Illusionist who became King.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
After Illusionist becomes King he becomes non magic user and can&#39;t be killed by Inquisitor. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
Let magic user become King and let Inquisitor kill him.

#### Comments:
Last game I played Mastermind. In the end of the day there were Mastermind, Evil King (ex converted Psychic) and Assasin VS Inquisitor and Court Wizard, so 3 Unseen including MM and King VS 1 convertable BD and 1 Neutral. Should be easy win for Unseen, right? I think it definitely should be an easy win in terms of balance. BUT: Inquisitor kills Evil King through guards, Court Wizard swaps positions. Unseen has zero chances to win. GG, nice balance. Btw our Sorcerer became Evil King earlier in the game too and Inquisitor simply killed her too.</description>

            <p>this happens when a magic user becomes assassin as well, all roles retain there magic role it seems like, no matter what they switch to later in the game. (i dont know if a non-magic bd that became cult then becomes king follows that rule as well, as they get there magic tag after the start of the game… i dont have 16 people that can help me test this kinda stuff <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
