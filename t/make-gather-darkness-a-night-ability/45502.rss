    <title>Make Gather Darkness a Night Ability</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/make-gather-darkness-a-night-ability/45502</link>
    <description>Reaper sometimes wastes 2 souls by getting jailed after using Gather Darkness so it seems like it should be a night ability.  Or is there some programming issue that prevents one from using both night abilities in the same night?</description>

            <p>This would be quite a buff to reaper, because reaper can now also both gather darkness and chill during the day. I like the extra decision making involved in using gather darkness to be honest.</p>

            <p>We could just make it a night Ability that does exactly what a gather darkness + reap would do.</p>
