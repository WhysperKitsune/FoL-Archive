    <title>Minor suggestion for Possessor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/minor-suggestion-for-possessor/77658</link>
    <description>Just got in a game where I was poss with MM being last person. Ended in a draw. I suggest in order to stop this that Mind control allow (only when 1 person left) you to make person vote for themselves?

Anyway, if its a stupid idea, sorry lol.</description>

            <p>This seems like a pretty clear case to me. Mastermind literally can’t win, Possessor is the only one who can, so it should (in my opinion) auto-resolve as a Possessor win.</p>

</aside>
<p>No it isn’t. The Mastermind has a 0% winrate whether he does it or not. Thus letting the Possessor win in this situation isn’t any more gamethrowing than voting with BD as a Pretender in the final 3.</p>

<p>If NK winrate is too high, then nerf it in other areas except resolving end game scenarios in ways that don’t make sense in my opinion.</p>
<p>This is probably harder to realize code wise, but if we’re talking idealistically.</p>

            <p>The NK winrate is decent, no need to buff it. Especially poss, which is the strongest NK imo.</p>

            <p>Auto wins are bad, give them a mechanic to win.<br>
Rn there is a mechanic for Possessor which helps him to win in 2v1 situations. But you have to lynch the Mastermind/GK/EK. If you fail in that, you kinda deserve the loss. And you can pretty good calculate how many deaths there are, so you don’t end up in a 1v1 with the Mastermind/GK/EK.</p>

            <p>Neither of them would ever succeed but MM has a method of breaking the cycle while poss does not.</p>
<p>If Possessor had something that he could do that would also make it so conversion would kill them then I wouldn’t be saying the same thing.</p>

            <p>poss attacking every night, and mm trying to convert poss every night, for eternity … should be auto resolved as a draw.</p>

<p>How? The game won’t end so it can never reach a draw.</p>
<p>Also, a smart MM and a dumb MM shouldn’t act any differently because the MM can’t win in this situation.</p>
<p>All options even with a draw auto resolution lead to a loss for the MM. So there is no reason to pick one option over the other besides picking dirty works so they can get to the next game.</p>

<p>because … no win for poss if he didn’t defeat the unseen</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But he will defeat the Unseen. It could take an insanely long time but the only possible way for the game to end is with a poss win with a dead assassin. Since that state is obviously a winning state that means poss wins.</p>
<p>The only reason why we even want an auto resolution in the first place is because it’s unfair to make the possessor wait that long if the MM decides to be a dick and stall.</p>

            <p>very interesting.  well, in the specific case of mm v poss, if the mm is smart enough to know better than doing dirty work then it should end in a draw, in my opinion, because … no win for poss if he didn’t defeat the unseen. which he clearly didn’t seeing as mm is alive and well</p>

            <p>It’s not.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different situation:</p>
<p>CL no bleeds + Any 2nd cult vs Prince no exe’s + Butler</p>
<p>For one reason or another everyone here has perfect information about the situation, or at least close enough that the Butler/Prince know to coordinate locking down the CL.</p>
<p>Butler occupies the CL 3 times<br>
Prince jails the CL once<br>
The game draws.</p>
<p>Without auto resolution this would be a Cult victory after 7 nights.</p>
