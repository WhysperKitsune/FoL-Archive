&gt; What the hell? Why was NightX shot before he even began to present the awards? Oh god dammit- it&#39;s the Mafia. And now marl&#39;s going to say something about hypoclaiming Prince in a closed setup and we&#39;re all going to be doomed.... Well. I guess we have no choice. Time to play FM. Again.
&gt; 
&gt; You have no abilities except for your voice and your vote.
&gt; 
&gt; You win when all threats to the [color=green]**Town**[/color] have been eliminated.

&gt; Right.... gun. Check.  Anti-mislynch cream.... Check. List of targets.... oh, there are none.  All the power roles have been scratched off the list. What a pity. Oh well... This should be pretty easy then.
&gt; 
&gt; You may communicate with your partner, [color=red]**[player]**[/color] at all times.
&gt; Each night, one of you may shoot a player, killing them.
&gt; 
&gt; You win when the [color=red]**Mafia**[/color] control 50% of the votes in the game or nothing can prevent this from happening.

<p>PKR’s only real mistake was his opening but that was enough to crack the entire game right open for Town.</p>

</aside>
<p>I kind of have to agree here. I don’t read too much into his LAMISTy opening posts as that’s NAI from him, but him voting Hippo up for BS reasons while hard white-knighting FK confirmed him as scum and we created a pretty good PoE from that.</p>

            <p>This wouldn’t necessarily work. As I said before PKR, and Solic by extension, already knew he was about to die so performing associative reads on him then would be a waste as he could have WIFOM’d his interactions. This is why I put Eevee as a null read for me.</p>

            <p>I don’t know about that. A SvS between me and PKR would be challenging, since our playstyles are very different. I’m not as nice. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I contemplated hard defending him as some players have said in other games that that lead to me being shown as town, but I didn’t think I could have made that organic either here.</p>

<p>PKR and Solic put up an honourable fight. The town, however, were very clearly at peak performance this game.<br>
PKR’s only real mistake was his opening but that was enough to crack the entire game right open for Town.</p>

            <p>Also as I said before, I didn’t need to interact with PKR as he was more likely than not scum and already heading for the gallows. The optimal step here would be to evaluate his associations to townhunt and scumhunt, which essentially let me find Solic. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
