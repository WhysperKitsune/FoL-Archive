            <p>Okay, less stupid names coming:</p>
<p>Impressive Nomenclature Below</p>
<p>Built to Last -------&gt; Engineer</p>
<p>Trap Door -------&gt; Vigilant</p>
<p>Alarm System ---------&gt; Sentry</p>
<p>Unavailability Indicator -----&gt;  (I have no idea what this ability does based on your description so I’ll hold off until later)</p>
<p>Locksmithy ------&gt; Pettibone (A forklift used by carpenters to move heavy stuff around, occupy immunity should be immovable without this)</p>
<p>False Alarm --------&gt; Faux Brace (A brace is used to stabilize builds and stuff)</p>
<p>Sabotage -------&gt;  Destabilize</p>

            <p>my fear there is too many things to give conversion immunity (unless this is replacing CW). I really am nervious of returning to the days where making it to night 4 without a single succesful conversion being commonplace. Having up to 4 conversion preventers in play at a time… may be pretty bad for that.</p>
