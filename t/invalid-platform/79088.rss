    <title>Invalid Platform?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/invalid-platform/79088</link>
    <description>Hey there! I couldn&#39;t play the game randomly, for whatever reason. I don&#39;t have hours to troll this forum for what seems to be an errant error.

Not sure if this is a unique problem, or, since this game gets a multitude of updates, just an update error.
But I deleted this game to reload it, because it wouldn&#39;t load, and now it says that I have an &#39;invalid platform&#39; and I can&#39;t even re-download the game.

I play on a mac, I have many many hours playing this game. I used to play back when death knights were a thing. And... now I have an invalid platform and can&#39;t even re-download the game.

What&#39;s up? This problem affected me about a week ago... I figured it was an update and would self-resolve.

It hasn&#39;t.</description>

            <p>I’m not sure.</p>
<p>there are ways to get around this that can be seen on the discord in the mac-linux channel. You might want to try some of those.</p>

            <p>So we paid for a game and are just screwed? Was there any refund offered?</p>

            <p>Mac doesn’t work anymore. Something with the recent software update from apple and unity.</p>
<p>there are some work arounds, i think you can check the discord for those.</p>
<p>(i am a fellow mac-user myself)</p>
