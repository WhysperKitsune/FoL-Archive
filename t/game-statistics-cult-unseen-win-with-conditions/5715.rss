    <description>Hey,
Is there any game statistics?

for example:
1) unseen\ cult victory percentage
2) what the percentage when there is a reaper/possesor/both
3) what the percantage when king is evil/natural/good

For me it seems like the cult is way too strong because they can be 4 and always have a cult leader so how can u kill them fast enough?</description>

            <p>The Assassin also received quite a significant boost recently.<br>
2-For-1 and 1 extra use of Nightshade means that the Assassin has +2 free possible kills compared to metagame you are referring to.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to imply that this is what makes all the difference, but it is a significant difference. I don’t think it can be overstressed how much the high mortality rate in Unseen games helps the evils’ cause.</p>

            <p>It does seem like evil is doing pretty well at the moment, but I also see BD making obvious blunders or not playing well in most games.  In the games where you get a couple smart BD or a smart Good King, Evil tends to get destroyed.  I think things will change as more people learn the mechanics as well as the general strategy for these types of games. It’s kind of odd but right now aggressive BD who try to vote people up for info or ask for roles are considered suspcious, and the general BD meta is do nothing and hope investigatives find info, and when they don’t sit around and get picked off one by one at night.</p>

            <p>You are right but almost every game got 1 or 2 neutral killers,<br>
Anyway, i think both unseen and cult are kinda strong.</p>
<p>For somone, noone give us the statistics,<br>
so i guess that im right and bad guys win about  76-80%</p>

            <p>My experience is that Unseen is much stronger than Cult, because they have just so much killing power that they don’t give time to the Blue Dragon to gain enough info, especially if there is also a NK in the game.<br>
I’m not sure about the winning changes of Blue Dragon in games with Unseen and both NKs, but I bet they are extremely low.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a Cult game with no NKs is most of the time a BD win, since BD can just take their time to find out who’s evil. There is no rush.</p>
<p>This is why I feel Blue Dragon should feel no pressure to lynch on the first days, until they have some actual leads. The more you’re lynch-happy, the more quickly your game will end. In an Unseen game, that is almost an auto-win for the evils. And that’s true even if you are lynching some actual evils, as you’re probably just freeing up space for new converts.</p>

            <p>I wonder if some people get results from games with friend groups compared to games with pugs .</p>
<p>With better players across the board I think cult and unseen have a lot harder time .</p>
<p>noob players get easily convinced of very dubious claims .</p>
<p>one time an entire blue dragon killed me because I was the only 1 to pardon a few turns earlier on a kill …  they had killed an obvious fool that had turned out to be a fool  . someone pointed out I had voted differently . so they killed me .  then next two turns they killed the only two people to defend me . even though I was a noble and even after the first one was a blue dragon</p>

            <p>Paladin that can’t be converted is a great idea,<br>
Make the cult want to kill the paladin and its much harder then convert him.</p>
<p>?Also, what is the cooldown of Brainwash (convert) when there is a new cult leader.</p>
<p>I think it should be 2 days, or 1 day+the last cultleader cooldown</p>
<p>It doesnt make sense that you kill the cult leader and don’t slow up the conversions</p>

            <p>I don’t know if they are OP, but I have to agree that Cult games are really a mess. We just killed 2 CLs in the first 2 days and yet still managed to lose while having no clue what’s going on until the game was finished.</p>

            <p>It certainly doesn’t feel like it. From my experience it looks like cult wins like 8 games out of 10. That’s why I ask developers to give us statistics.</p>

            <p>I think cult is harshly overpowered at the moment. Every game i play is complete chaos, and even if one cult member is found early, then cult wins anyway, but takes 15 days so they again have 4 members and they kill everyone in trials. I would like to see statistics, how many games cult wins i bet it is like 70-80%.</p>
<p>I think one solution would be that Paladin is not be convertable. This is so stupid that Paladin finds one target and then is just converted to cult - it happened in almost every single game I played. Please take a look about this cult games, because I really don’t enjoy them at all.</p>

            <p>Occupying the cult leader can set them back, as can cultists dying at night (happens a lot), as can them failing to convert someone because that target is immune or CW magic barriered or jailed, etc.</p>

            <p>i think the probelem is that nobody wants to vote without information.<br>
As BD you should just accuse random ppl and get them on their knees, and then pardon if they seems good</p>
<p>But im still don’t get how do you supposed to beat the cult, there is always a cult leader,<br>
It seems like you need to remove 1 cult member every single day,<br>
Maybe it can just happen when the reaper kills them…</p>

            <p>I see bad beat good in a big majority of games I am on and almost exclusively it’s because bd are as dumb as rocks .</p>
<p>nobody seems suspicious of turn 1 speakers and are happy to trade a living bd for a scorned .</p>
<p>even when you shout fool 5 times in chat when a blatant fool is fooling people they still get hung.</p>
<p>then every game at least 2 blue dragon get bing for no journal .</p>
<p>oh and about 1 player in 8 reads dead folks journals</p>
