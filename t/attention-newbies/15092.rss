    <description>WHISPERING DOES NOT EQUAL UNSEEN/CULT

unseen and cult get a night chat that no one else can read, so rarely need to whisper. On the other hand, the only way besides prince for BD to communicate privately is whispers, so they whisper.

This post brought to you by someone randomly executed by a prince because I whispered.</description>

            <p>I always wispier a lot as king and use my non-scum checks as a bargaining chip. I do this regardless of my alignment. I will probably keep doing this after the next patch because it is still a good bargaining chip.</p>

            <p>There’s also a good chance they are talking to their lead generators. BD is always way too willing to vote whisperers up for class, and too ready to execute early on if someone doesn’t want to claim… Leading to them getting their own investigatives killed or converted, especially if they manage to confirm their claim.  I’ve won so many games for unseen because of BD forcing me to out myself as sheriff, getting me converted, and then believing every word I say afterwards because they confirmed me.</p>

            <p>Doesn’t necessarily mean that. They could actually be a good king that has been convinced that the scum they are whispering to are something good. Something that helps the scum out a lot  when the king is  out of ally checks</p>
