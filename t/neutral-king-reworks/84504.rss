    <title>Neutral King Reworks</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-king-reworks/84504</link>
    <description>This is long overdue. FoL already made this change. PK exists in ToL. So why not let neuts retain a similar wincon when they are crowned? Anyway, here it is!:
&gt; # The Foolish King
&gt; **Neutral Special**
&gt; Passive: Tenacity: Immune to occupation, redirection, and death (unless you are using Disperse Guards or redirect a death with Absolute Foolishness). Can speak at any point during trials.
Passive: Poor Fellow: If you are executed at day, there will be no executions the next day and king elections will be delayed for an extra day. You count as BD for Butler’s Poisoned Wine, your killer will lose a use of all limited use abilities, the Reaper will not get a soul for reaping you, and the Sorcerer will only be able to detonate once after your death. Your killer will not be punished if you redirected them.
Day ability: Trollbox: Same as normal. Unlimited uses.
Day Ability: Decide Fate: Same as normal. 1 use.
Night ability: Disperse Guards: You will not be death immune tonight. 2 uses.
Night ability: Absolute Foolishness: Redirect target player to you if they are attacking and are not the Knight. You can redirect the possessor but you cannot redirect the stringed person. You will not be immune to attacks you redirect. 4 uses.

Day ability: Royal Finger: Same as normal. Unlimited uses.
Day ability: Decide Fate: Same as normal. Costs 1 brilder.
Night ability: Guards!: Night ability 1: Guards!: Have a guard protect you, granting death immunity for the night. Costs 1 brilder.
Night ability: Stand Guard: Same as normal. Unlimited uses.
