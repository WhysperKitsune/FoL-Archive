    <title>Xblade&#39;s Ol&#39; Dev Plans: Following Up!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/xblades-ol-dev-plans-following-up/71970</link>
    <description>I posted a ton of my personal plans for the game months ago here:

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/xblades-dev-plans/35778

Looking back [at that annoying pinned global banner that I&#39;m going to unpin shortly after this post], I realized that.... we accomplished nearly everything I wanted to do, already! WHOA! Not bad, considering these were solo dev plans as Boslof works on in-game stuff like balance, changes, and new classes.

For those that don&#39;t know, I&#39;m mostly the dev that deals with the things OUTSIDE the main game - mostly meta features like lobby (friends/matchmaking/etc), data, friends list, 3rd-party API&#39;s like Discord - and even this forum.

So many times have I played games where the devs blog about their dream additions to the game to never see those actually implemented, so I am pretty stoked I can be a dev that follows up on those dreams.

We still have more features and goodies to come! As we grow, dreams grow bigger, too. This game is going to be around for a long time and it&#39;s only going to get better. We hope you&#39;ll stick around! And for those that have been here since the beginning (or even &quot;before&quot; the beginning): Can you feel our progress? Does the game feel more polished now than it used to be? Is it less buggy and more intuitive now? Easier to learn? These are things we want to keep making better and hope you like our strategies as our players grow with us!

            <p>why? lol</p>
<p>It’s obviously just a design choice that all Cult members gouge out their right eye</p>
<p>It’s what binds their art together into a cohesive unit</p>
<p>Also hi Rogue long time no see</p>

<p>I’m advised that I should NOT be revealing my plans because everyone has different opinions and some people get angry at my direction, so this is a “Test post” to see how people react to it, which also determines future transparency for my dev plans~</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll say now having played SO many games where dev interaction w/ their consumers/fans is key, and transparency/detailed changelogs/etc are so important to keeping the fans happy, it’s good that you’re saying stuff like this (even months ago). World of Warcraft is a perfect example of what NOT to do if you want happy fans. Keep open transparency with stuff that isn’t extremely sensitive (unless it’s a huge gameplay change that we should be aware of). Keep communication flowing. Take both sides of feedback to heart instead of just “following your vision” and saying “we know what’s best for the game, not you (the fans) guys”.</p>
<p>Just keep communication and transparency flowing. When you guys go mute or stop being clear with us, that’s usually when bad things happen (again, look at WoW and how Blizzard has been handling it lately. Perfect example of what not to do).</p>
