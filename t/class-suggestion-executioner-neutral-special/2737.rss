    <title>[Class Suggestion] Executioner (Neutral Special)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-executioner-neutral-special/2737</link>
    <description>Executioner (Neutral) 

Day Ability 1: Judge, Jury, Executioner (2 uses)
Day immediately turns into a forced trial day. The votes become anonymous and so are the names. Executioner shows up as Executioner in bold with red text. Everyone else shows up as witnesses (Or jury or something). Executioner&#39;s vote counts as two votes during the trial. Whoever is voted up is instantly executed without a defense. [This ability cannot be used on the first two days and has a 1 day cooldown]. (Comment: the way this game does it&#39;s trials I figured maybe the way they die from this is like the Hunter&#39;s retribution passive. They just die where they&#39;re standing with 5 seconds as last words Where the Executioner can also talk as well. Also having a different soundtrack during the mock trail... something energetic yet dark... or something like that lol)

Day Passive: Royal Hatred
When the king dies and there&#39;s a vote for a new king, you cannot vote NOR can you step up as the next king.

Night Passive 1: Bombastic Voice
During the night phase, you&#39;re able to speak to the entire court. Your name will show up as Crier during this time. (This doesn&#39;t work when jailed.) (Comment: figured his name would show up as crier because maybe it could be implemented that the noble get&#39;s something like this too to add extra chaos to the game)

Night Passive 2: Iron Clad
You are immune to death for one attack.

Lore:
WIP, but his story would have something along the lines of hating the Blue Dragon and maybe something they did to him.

Goal: Survive long enough to see the Blue Dragon Lose the game.

Comments:
Yea, This role is inspired off the Judge Role from the Starcraft II Mafia Mod. Figured I&#39;d call it Executioner since my second idea for the name was either aristocrat (which is already taken) Or Politician, but unsure if that name makes sense in the lore of the game. Love to see suggestions and feedback since I&#39;d love a role like this being added to the game it adds flavor (and also not to mention my favorite Neut role ever, least the judge was). This role also adds much needed mechanics such as careful thought before saying you&#39;re a sheriff out loud if you think there&#39;s an exe. Maybe you&#39;re a fool and you want to manipulate it so you can get a win from the mock trial? Has great potential to intertwine with a lot of roles and strategies... making it very flexible and fun. Also btw as a special class there can only be one of him so he&#39;s immune to conversion.
Thank you!</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>“Everyone who doesn’t vote for someone must be an executioner”</p>
<p>Also there is a max of 2 passive and there is no destinction between a day passive and a night passive.</p>
<p>Just make booming voice a night ability and remove the part about not voting for royal hatred.</p>

            <p>Yep, it has a wiki so you can read about it there. If you want to see the role that I inspired this class off of you can type in google “Starcraft 2 mafia Judge” And it’s the first result.</p>

            <p>Mafia games in general Implement role idea’s throughout all the games out there (Epic mafia, SCII Mafia, ToS, etc.)<br>
The Judge Variant Is one of the more unique Roles i’ve seen In all the mafia games/forums i’ve seen. I also tried to make this as original as Possible from the SCII Variant of the role, which is kind of hard because the two things that make the role (The talk at night/Forced anonymous trial during the day) Are basically the role’s bread and butter.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/simon">@Simon</a> Yea that’s actually a good point too. It’s another way to find the Executioner if the town’s THAT desperate or if there’s only like 4 players left during this time.</p>

            <p>I think its pretty interesting. Like, it would be a bad idea to kill/get rid of the king after a forced trial, because it would be fairly easy to oust you during an election</p>

            <p>Yea, as Icibalus said it’s a Neutral Evil wincon. Neutrals have various goals so what’s wrong with a Neutral having a goal to see the town (Or BD) Fail?</p>
