    <title>I cannot change my ingame name to what i want it to be</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-cannot-change-my-ingame-name-to-what-i-want-it-to-be/30738</link>
    <description>What happened:

I tried changing my ingame name to &quot;iyfBrainBug&quot; which is the nickname i always use. It says &quot;Choose a different name&quot;

What was SUPPOSED to happen:

It was supposed to change my nickname to &quot;iyfBrainBug&quot;

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. My Account
2. Change name
3. Type &quot;iyfBrainBug&quot;

If the name interferes with some sort of curse-filter i would really love it if you could change it manually &lt;3</description>
