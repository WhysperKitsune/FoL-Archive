    <title>Change CW to third initial-spawn character for Unseen</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-cw-to-third-initial-spawn-character-for-unseen/25282</link>
    <description>This would be a huge improvement for BD as it would ensure only half of the time a CW will spawn plus they&#39;ll read as Unseen and can be murdered.

Tornado is hands down the worst ability in the game, and the character needs to be switched or removed. I don&#39;t say this from a place of salt, just analytical truth. When you&#39;re switching people, you&#39;re rolling dice that the people you&#39;re targeting are going to somehow swap to a more beneficial outcome. You have no investigative powers, so you don&#39;t even know for certain if you&#39;re being useful in your redirection. Giving the power the benefit of the doubt, let&#39;s say you know a character is Prince and a character NK. You know beyond a shadow of a doubt that both characters are these classes.

What do you do to use that ability to the fullest? Redirect the Prince with someone else? Redirect the Prince and the NK? There are so many ways to potentially screw over BD, like stopping a drunk from occupying the NK that night, or forcing a CS on the prince. This is assuming you KNOW a good guy and a bad guy, you still can&#39;t assure the power is put to good use.

How much more when you have no idea who&#39;s who. Night 1, swap 16 and 4? SURE, WHY THE HELL NOT LET&#39;S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

The current iteration of CW is so bad, even compared to the last version, and that&#39;s saying something. He definitely needed changed, but this is much worse.</description>

            <p>So troll then. Got it.</p>
<p>Speaking of balance, I’m genuinely curious as to what the win rate for CW currently is. It’s also kind of a quality of life adjustment, though, in the same way that changing the occupy rules was sort of both.</p>

            <p>CW also has restrictions, based on what you consider restrictions. The most obvious is when you said “hunter can’t attack king.” Well, CW can’t switch king.</p>
<p>Further restrictions on CW that hunter does not have:</p>
<p>-Can be occupied<br>
-cannot directly kill<br>
-cannot prove itself to court (ritualist, sage)</p>

            <p>We should not be balencing around trolls. There are plenty of ways to troll without even using role spacific abilitys.</p>
<p>Tornado does not increase the chances of a BAD dying for 2 reasons.</p>
<p>A: The Unseen/cult/NK is actively trying to attack important BD like Prince and Psychic.</p>
<p>B: The Unseen/Cult/NK will never attack themselves</p>
<p>If you swap 2 people at random then the chance of an Unseen/Cult being attacked by self goes up from 0% to &gt;0%. That increase needs to take away from somewhere and the only thing to take away from is the BD and Neuts. Add that to the fact that Unseen/Cult are less likely to attack Neuts anyway and they also have the best chance of finding them that means that swapping makes BD disproportionately less likely to be attacked.</p>
<p>Ex: Someone accuses someone of being unseen but the accused person is pardoned. The accuser is either A: Telling the truth and might be attacked/converted or B: Lying and definitely won’t be attacked by Unseen/Cilt because they know that. Either way swapping them means a Neutral is likely to be attacked rather than a BD.</p>
<p>Given than converted invests can make situations like this happen even while you don’t know about it you should always swap someone.</p>

            <p>Here. You’re still not reading my post correctly, so let me bold-face something important:</p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, nothing about occupying a BD inherently increases their risk of getting killed</strong></p>
<p>Do you see how this is not the same thing? I’m not talking about occupying someone to prevent someone else from being healed. I am talking about the fact that the person you target is not at any greater of a risk of getting killed. If they were about to be targeted, they’re still dead. If they weren’t, they’re still not dead. In fact, referring specifically to occupy, you used to be able to occupy someone as much as you wanted. That was changed, and while I’m not a dev, I can almost guarantee it was - in whole or in part - changed to combat using the ability to grief. On the contrary, using Tornado to swap someone who was not making a random decision almost always increases the risk of something bad happening: an Investigative class hits someone they already hit, a Knight now hits a BD target with Cold Steel and dies, a healer can’t heal a person who needs it, and so on.</p>
<p>Every single example you’ve given has some combination of: restrictions on when it can be used, a limited number of uses, requires luck, requires knowledge gleaned from other players, requires a second day, or requires manipulation of other players. Court Wizard requires <strong>absolutely no restrictions or requirements whatsoever</strong> to grief. These are not even remotely the same thing, and there is no way you can argue that this is coincidental.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that I would like the class - or even just Tornado - to be changed in such a way to where you can’t just decide to be a jerk from Day 1 and completely ruin a game. Play enough team-based multiplayer games and you will see that either very particular measures have been taken to counteract griefing, or else they need to because griefing is a problem.</p>

<p>Hunter also can’t attack until Night 3. Hunter cannot attack the King. Hunter’s attack does not kill instantly - giving the victim a chance to get healed - and it also does not affect all classes. Furthermore, the Hunter can’t stop anybody from healing the victim. Some Hunters are loose cannons, and they can still do a lot of damage to BD, but there are restrictions.

            <p>Also, statistically speaking, swapping at random will become progressively worse for BD as time goes on, as it makes it more likely that a Knight accidentally hits a BD or that otherwise intelligent uses of abilities become misfires or wastes.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the one who doesn’t seem to get it is you. The point is that the Court Wizard’s powers are extremely easy to abuse, and considerably easier to abuse than any other Blue Dragon class. This wouldn’t matter if not for the fact that they are, again, a Blue Dragon class.</p>

Then, you have to positively identify the Prince, which is impossible to do without help from others. Then, you have to convince the rest of the court to vote him up. At that point, yes, you can execute him. If you successfully pulled all of that off, congratulations. You’re still a jerk. You probably have never seen this happen unless you did it yourself.</p>

            <p>It is clearly a player problem. The problem is that the CW abilities are extremely easy to abuse. Accepting the fact that online multiplayer tends to bring out jerks in numbers, I personally would like to see the CW ability changed in some way to something with less grief potential.</p>

            <p>At the risk of you actually being serious, let’s tackle the arguments one by one.</p>
<p>Yes, Butler can annoy people. But there’s a 3-occupy limit, after which the target becomes immune. Furthermore, nothing about occupying a BD inherently increases their risk of getting killed, although it might encourage the court to execute someone. You’ll probably die next, though. In any case though, this rarely happens.</p>
<p>Prince can’t execute anybody until Night 3. If he hits a BD, he can no longer execute. Jailing people also counts toward the occupy limit, and unless they’re already poisoned or bleeding, there is a 0% chance a BD will die as a result of being jailed. This is rare.</p>
<p>Your Good King argument is probably the most laughable of all. First, you have a 1/16 chance of even being the King in the first place. Then, you have to pass another 1/3 of even being Good. Then, you have to positively identify the Prince, which is impossible to do without help from others. Then, you have to convince the rest of the court to vote him up. At that point, yes, you can execute him. If you successfully pulled all of that off, congratulations. You’re still a jerk. You probably have never seen this happen unless you did it yourself.</p>
<p>Hunter also can’t attack until Night 3. Hunter cannot attack the King. Hunter’s attack does not kill instantly - giving the victim a chance to get healed - and it also does not affect all classes. Furthermore, the Hunter can’t stop anybody from healing the victim. Some Hunters are loose cannons, and they can still do a lot of damage to BD, but there are restrictions. Everyone has probably experienced this at least once, but it’s still far from common.</p>
<p>Here is a complete guide to griefing as a Court Wizard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide you want to grief.</li>
<li>Swap one or two people repeatedly until you get bored or one of you dies.</li>
<li>If you did not die, go back to Step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing this can easily increase the odds of getting a BD killed, and if they’re poisoned or bleeding, you can pretty much guarantee it. You can also pretty much guarantee no one can investigate that person. Unless you are occupied, there is zero counterplay to this.</p>
<p>In about 150 hours of playtime, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I’ve seen any of your scenarios occur. I had four separate games where Court Wizards decided to grief yesterday alone.</p>
<p>These are not even remotely the same thing.</p>
