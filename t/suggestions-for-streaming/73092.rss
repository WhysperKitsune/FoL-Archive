            <p>I stream aswell<br>
My tips:<br>
Try to keep the game running 20fps or higher if you can’t that’s fine, but if you can I’d push for the highest settings without breaking you computer.<br>
Interact with viewers it’s very nice to talk to them about things not only doesn’t it help them know you more but you get to know the people behind your streams looking up to you.<br>
Be talkative, don’t Force it but try your best and talk about things related but sometimes off topic.<br>
Not much but be yourself if you act fake people can tell.</p>
<p>Hope it helps I’m a noon at streaming</p>

            <p>I watch poker streams regularly, they just chuck a 5 minute delay on their stream,  you can post links to hosted TOL in chat and you’re good to go! I suppose it comes down to what you’re willing to give up to avoid stream sniping but I think people are pretty good.</p>

            <p>Ehh it’s tough steaming. I wouldn’t recommend it imo I would go the videos route, but yes if you have to stream then never play with your fans because they will stream snipe you. But for quality purposes you have to leave your stream uncovered or else the streams are low quality.</p>
