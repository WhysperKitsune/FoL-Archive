    <description># The Aspirant (Neutral)

**Passive:**
Conversion immune. Votes to execute the king will count as double, and will relay the message as though a Noble, Apostle, or Aristocrat had enhanced the vote.

**Night Ability 1: Fabrication** 
If there is an election for the king the next day, you will be able to step up as though you have the royal blood passive.
*Optional notes*Two uses.

**Night Ability 2: Climb to the Throne** 
Attack a player. If they have royal blood, you will kill them.
*Optional notes*Two uses.

**Day Ability 1: Hear the Murmurs** 
You will see the next whisper, regardless of who it came from or who it was sent to.
*Optional notes*Three uses.

**Goal**: The Aspirant wins if they is elected to Kinghood.

# The Accomplice (Neutral)

**Passive:**
Conversion and occupy immune. The Accomplice is given a random person who is their partner that they assist. 

**Night Ability 1: Control the Info** 
Disguise yourself or your partner as a chosen class for the night. 
*Optional notes*Three uses.

**Night Ability 2: Pave the Way** 
Occupy all people who visit you or your partner. 
*Optional notes*Two uses.

Whispers between you and your partner will be hidden for the day.
*Optional notes*Three uses.

            <p>I think if they have to become King AND survive, they’d have to have the Royal Blood passive permanently. I like your suggestion of limiting the force accuse to the king instead of the double vote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fabrication would always be used.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, if the King is executed the day before, yes it would be used.  But if not, you would have to anticipate on which night the king dies since you only have two charges.  Obviously if the king is reaped or poisoned, that would be easy.  But there are many times when a king dies unexpectedly in the night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: The Aspirant wins if they is elected to Kinghood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My concern with this is it has the chaos of a scorned/inquis who already won but with king powers/importance.  I don’t think that is healthy for the BDvsEvil battle.  I think the goal should be to become king AND survive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Votes to execute the king will count as double, and will relay the message as though a Noble, Apostle, or Aristocrat had enhanced the vote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is kind of weak.  My experience is that once the king is on the stand, the execution/pardon vote is not that close.  I think a better ability would be the noble’s ability to force a player to accuse someone, but limited to the king.</p>

            <p>I tried to use the Inquisitor wording for the Aspirant’s kill ability, making it conditional. It’s meant to only kill those of royal blood.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A bit redundant.</p>
<p>Alright goal, seem weak since whispers don’t help you much. Fabrication would always be used. Why not just give Royal Blood (or a reskinned version). Climb to Throne is good, since it eliminates competition. Would it just become a neutral King when it ascended?</p>
<p>Accomplice is similar to Mercenary. Too easy, since if you target BD you most likely win, since they win a lot of games. Basically, you are whatever faction your partner is.</p>
