    <description># General Game Suggestions!
If you are suggestion to nerf/buff something and don&#39;t want it to be lost in the shitshow that is #feedback in Discord, you should post it here.

It should be,
At least a good 3 sentences, 2 if it is a small suggestion like (X shouldn&#39;t be able to do Y with Z ability as it&#39;s AA)
In the right category, see that thing by the title of the thread? You can pick the category there! It isn&#39;t that hard..

# Good General Game Suggestion Examples! 
(DISCLAIMER: I do not agree with all of these, I just think they were well written)

[Please do NOT add a ranked mode (By Tiny Deer)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/please-do-not-add-a-ranked-mode/33151)

[The King&#39;s Allies- They gotta go (By Livicus)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/the-kings-allies-they-gotta-go/34445/1)

# Bad General Game Suggestions!
(DISCLAIMER: I have nothing against these people, just the way they post feedback suggestions)


[Please Remove Decide Fate From King (by Eran_Shmuel)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/please-remove-decide-fate-from-king/35080/1)


So with these things in mind, please be like the first two suggestions. Not the last one.

(NOTE: I am making this post out of frusteration, I&#39;ve seen way too many bad suggestion formats around the forums)</description>
