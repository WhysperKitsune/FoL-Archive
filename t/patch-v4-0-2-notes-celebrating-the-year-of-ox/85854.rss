    <description>Greetings! 

&gt; A new patch is live to improve the gaming environment in the King&#39;s Courtroom! To celebrate the Year of Ox, all active citizens in the past 30 days shall receive 4000 Gold, and all new citizens of the King&#39;s Courtroom will now start their new life with 5000 Gold! Hooray!

## ***System and Game Improvements***

* Fixed players&#39; logs format on copy and paste function.
* Improved Lobby UI by removing the number of players to avoid confusion.
* Improved BUY GOLD interface and functions.
* Improved moderation security and interface.
