# Gameplay
• Days last 96 hours, or until majority is reached for execution. Nights last 48 hours.
• All actions, including whispers (Only Butler, Invoker(if they choose so), and Servant can whisper via loud whisper), must be sent to the mod.
• Unseen/Cult/Nobles will talk through special Discord servers
• Priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server.
• All classes will be used, and will be used as they are found in the Class Cards Thread.
# Executions
• To accuse someone say “/accuse [player]” or “/vote [player]”
• Votes saying Guilty or Not Guilty before the target is on the stand will not be counted.
• Should the votes reach the majority, that player will go on trial. They can say a defense, and the rest of the players must vote Guilty or Not Guilty on the thread.
• Players can discuss while the target is on trial.
• No one is able to use day powers when a trial is in session. The Only exception is the king’s Decide Fate.
• After the voting, the King has 24 hours to choose to allow or veto the vote. Should the king not respond, the majority vote will be accepted.
• The day timer does not stop when the target is on trial.
• If the day timer runs out before a total majority is hit, the option with the most votes is what happens to the target.
# Picking a New King
• When the king dies 24 hours is given for any player with royal blood to step up and take the throne.
• After that 24 hours anyone is free to step up.
• If only 1 person steps up when the day ends that person becomes the king
• If 2 people step forward everyone votes on who should be the next king. Whoever has the most • votes during the end of the day becomes the king. If the votes are tied whoever stepped up 1st becomes the king

            <p>I don’t think this game is indicative of the Brotherhood’s power. With 2 NKs and another faction (which can kill), Brotherhood couldn’t really utilize their biggest strength - numbers. They never made it to having a Disciple. Yeah, BH won, but they never had time to reach their potential. Probably need to run more SFoLs with them as the antagonists, especially after the rework.</p>

            <p>We really need a prod system in place. People are better than they used to be (ie, actually making night actions) but we need some sort of measurement of it. Unable to be in regularly is no excuse, as people can tag you to important posts.</p>

            <p>Wolfy, I have to ask: After you jailed me N2, when Day 3 started, why did you ask me here if I was jailed? You said in Prince comms that you’re keeping quiet that you jailed me because I’m Observer, which I understood as “don’t tell everyone you were jailed in case I die and my journal said I jailed the Observer”. Then you posted “Hey Meth, you were jailed last night, right?”<br>
Were you trying to crumb to me that you were the Prince?</p>

            <p>Just allows the prince more leeway, and maybe focus a few minds in future.</p>
