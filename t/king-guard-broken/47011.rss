    <title>King Guard Broken</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/king-guard-broken/47011</link>
    <description>I think King&#39;s guard should be more like Merc guard where it prevents all visitors to that target. Guarding your last confirmed BD just to vote the final evil player to find out that your confirmed BD was converted through your guard seems really broken. Second king feels really weak with no way to truly protect their people. 

Maybe there&#39;s a reason I havent considered why they should be able to be converted through the guard. If not please consider the change. Thank you.</description>

</aside>
<p>What’s broken about it?  I honestly do not see any problem with it at all.  It makes it harder to trust someone 100%, which is important for gameplay, and prevents BD from having “easy” strategies where they can perfectly protect everyone important.</p>
<p>I’m just not seeing any real benefit to this suggestion.  King doesn’t need a buff.  BD doesn’t need a buff.  Conversions don’t need a nerf.  And I don’t see how this would improve gameplay.</p>
<p>It seems like you’re expressing a vague feeling of “I don’t like how this feels”, but I have to say that my reading is just that you’re annoyed that it happened to you in-game - this suggestion feels like a “plz nerf scissors.  signed, paper” sort of thing.  Conversion being the weakness in death-based protection seems to me to be a valuable design choice that forces people to plan for more potential scenarios.</p>

            <p>Agreed.I think they need to look at when CW was the strongest.<a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/what-did-the-court-wizard-use-to-be/46071/11" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/what-did-the-court-wizard-use-to-be/46071/11</a><br>
That should help for when people remember what CW used to be.</p>

            <p>I think that CW needs to change focus, as it’s pretty useless as it is. Since there are usually 2 kills per night on average, that gives Physician two chances per night to save someone (unless there’s a reaper, but it’s still one). This doesn’t even include poison or bleeding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, magic barrier has 1 chance every 2 nights in order to stop a conversion.</p>
<p>I’d focus CW more on tornado, and then maybe this could work.</p>

            <p>I do agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/nightx">@NightX</a> though it wouldn’t exactly out them as unless the Evil King says he is going to guard them and then they become converted but you can always say that they were converted at a later time or that you were trying to mind game the evils. The only scenario where it really fails is when you say in chat “im guarding X(Lets say 7)” and the 7 is converted who was also scouted and the sheriff goes “7 was converted last night even though king said he guarded them”</p>

            <p>What they are saying is with CW’s one niche being outclasses by the King would make being a CW useless.All classes should be able to do something unique.Physician saves people from attacks.CW from conversions.Princess finds out your class type.Prince jails.Noble manipulates votes and can read logs and whispers.Observer can confirm or deny logs.Knight guards and kills.Physician guards and can revive a DK which are extremely powerful.Drunk can find killers and can occupy people.Butler can occupy people and kill the king.Psychic floats information.Paladin and Sheriff find out their faction.This in part is why butler is weak.It doesn’t offer utility and often drunk can just get the job done better.</p>

            <p>How exactly would they be caught? Only they know they were converted, and they’re converted now.</p>
<p>And we can make it different for Good Kings, as Loyal Subjects already is.</p>
<p>It is the CW’s job, but then again protecting people is the Physician’s job.</p>

<p>I do think it would be good if the Good King could prevent conversions. It would be negative utility for an Evil King.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We can’t give it to only one and not the other, since that would potentially out an evil king if someone they protected ends up converted and gets caught.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I just don’t think this is a good idea.  The king doesn’t need to be more powerful, the Unseen / Cult don’t need the nerf, the CW needs preventing conversion as a purpose, and missing a conversion hurts Cult / Unseen <span class="bbcode-i">far</span> more than missing a kill.  I’m not seeing the argument for this change.</p>

            <p>That sounds more reasonable. Maybe they think that would be OP too? From a lore perspective why would they let a stalker in but not a diplomat?</p>

<p>It definitely shouldn’t prevent visitors, since that is generally also negative utility, as it stops Investigators and such.</p>
<p>Orange has a good rework <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/king-rework-orangeandblack5-edition/40698/28">here</a> if you think the King should do that. But it should not stop visits.</p>
