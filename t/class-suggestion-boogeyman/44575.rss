    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-boogeyman/44575</link>
    <description>

This class is designed to mess with people so enjoy

&gt;***_Name - boogeyman_**. still trying to find name that fits in the game. 
**_Faction - neutral_**
**_Type - support_** 

&gt;**Passive 1**: **_just a myth_** - if anyone visits you then you will know who it was 
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2**: **the legend lives**_ - if the boogeyman dies then the person who killed him, dies the next day.[this is to punish the evil doers for attacking him, meaning that people should try to kill him during the day]

&gt;**Day ability 1**: _**Going insane**_ - make someone crazy having them hear people talk but they wont know who is talking, everyone will appear as anonymous, this includes whispers. (4 uses)
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 2**: _**in your head**_ - select two players. The first player will send the message and the second player will revive it. After selecting two players then a box will show up where you can type a whisper and it will appear as the first player is whispering to the second. (Unlimited uses)

&gt;**Night ability 1**: _**crawling my way inside**_ - select a player and then select one of the false info you want to place in their mind (unlimited uses)
- you were attacked and healed
- you were occupied 
- a hunter has attacked you
- a mercanary has stood guard at your door
- anyother messages during the night that I did not mention 

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2**: _**I&#39;m not real**_ - select a player, any night action that will be performed on you will be switched to selected player. The player will also be framed that night making them appear as unseen/cult or killer/offense depending on who investages them(4 uses)

&gt;**Win condition** - survive To see the BD fall


&gt;Changes:
&gt;
&gt;- **Night ability 1** - Crawling my way inside - get in someone’s head, allowing you to use the day ability 1 on them (unlimited uses)
^ this allowed you to pretty much do an unlimited troll box on someone which would be too overpowered
&gt;
&gt;- **Night ability 2** - kidnapped - steal a person and bring them to the woods. They will not be able to hear,vote, or talk the following day(4 uses)
^ I do agree that this would be boring for the player 
&gt;
&gt;- Win condition was also changed to more suitable gameplay 
&gt;

            <p>With a goal to survive, none of the abilities help it. They are all about messing with people.</p>
<p>With a goal to have BD lose, it might be too powerful. Day ability 1 is an insanely buffed trollbox to the point of probably being broken. Going insane completely confuses one person. It might work with 1 use.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2 is not fun to be used on. You can do nothing the entire day, and are forced to sit there. They can’t even get information.</p>

            <p>This is a cool idea, and I like the idea of not being able to see who sent what(the second day ability) but I don’t like the infinite tb. It seems too powerful and the night ability that pairs with it is pretty pointless tbh. Unless you want the chance of being prevented from visiting or something. Also the kidnapping ability seems really op and boring for the person who was kidnapped. Imagine doing nothing for 90 sec facing a blank screen(or more if there was a trial near the end of the day, or even two). I would suggest at least letting them talk to the kidnapper at least, so it’s not extremely boring for them. Or maybe just remove the ability and replace it with something else.</p>

<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong> - Crawling my way inside - get in someone’s head, allowing you to use the day ability 1 on them (unlimited uses)<br>
^ this allowed you to pretty much do an unlimited troll box on someone which would be too overpowered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - kidnapped - steal a person and bring them to the woods. They will not be able to hear,vote, or talk the following day(4 uses)<br>
^ I do agree that this would be boring for the player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win condition was also changed to more suitable gameplay</p>
</li>
</ul>
