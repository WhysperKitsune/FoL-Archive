    <title>Prince should be a consideration focus role</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/prince-should-be-a-consideration-focus-role/8814</link>
    <description>as far as I know, the prince now is not really needing to think that much before exe. because if he got a neu killed its just 1 wasted exe use, and if he got a bd killed its just disabling his all exe uses. if he want to exe randomly he won&#39;t take so much risk to do so. I want it be like knight&#39;s cold steel which will commit suicide or disable jail ability if killed a bd. also if other bds knew prince can handle the whole bd&#39;s faith then they won&#39;t get encoraged to join the conversation to find more evil members</description>

<p>yup but the bigger thing to note is both sides of the coin as well (not doubting you know it, more the OP), so many times the prince also executes the BD member that think imitating fool as a minor BD role is next level strategy etc… I’d say it’s better for the game to stay at least margionally competitive to have a handicapped prince and a dead gamethrower, than a now confirmed BD gamethrower and a dead prince.</p>

            <p>The thing is sometimes prince does random but i hope people play prince logically.Say you have some confirmed classes.Well then if there are 3 unconfirmed then they are probably the unseen i won as prince by doing that once.I wont exe someone just for their claim unless its sus.<br>
But i dont think this change is necessary.The prince occupies and can bypass night immunity whoever is in jail. It is very strong but i dont think prince should commit suicide if he exes a BD.Though sometimes princes are dumb ill admit.<br>
Like one time i was psychic was jailed N2 and N3 and was exed bc prince “didnt trust me” lost the game for BD bc of that.</p>

            <p>People frequently misplay as the Prince. He’s not a brain-dead killing machine.</p>
<p>An execute should be a strategic and thoughtful decision.</p>
<p>Jailing can even be a strong defensive skill.</p>
<p>Won a game last night by jailing somebody I knew was good to protect them from conversion/death.</p>
<p>“When I die tonight, you’re cleared because I’m jailing you. Let’s win.”</p>
<p>We did.</p>
