<p>This is extremely strong even despite limited uses.<br>
2-shot parity cop that targets two players is incredible in efficiency. Since maid can be rolled more than once that makes the class even stronger.</p>
<p>At best I would reduce it to having only one use, but even then it’s power is incredible.</p>

<p>Overall, I don’t think there is a real need to have more BD invest classes as we already have an extremely high amount (4 versus next highest which is 3 in support).</p>
