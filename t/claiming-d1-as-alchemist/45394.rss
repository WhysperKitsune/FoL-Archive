    <title>Claiming D1 as Alchemist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/claiming-d1-as-alchemist/45394</link>
    <description>Now this is a General statement but I feel like an alchemist claiming D1 has no downside at all.You allow A-Butlers and Drunks to determine if your occupy immune or not.B-The drunk to make sure you don&#39;t attack them.C-Observers to follow you,princesses to check on you etc etc
This is a good strat as alch because evils know your alch so they usually leave you alone and BD get to fully vet you to confirm that you are alch.Its a pretty simple strategy that I&#39;m pretty sure would work most of the time.You claim alch D1.You remind people that your alch every day kind of subtly.You heal all the poisoned/bleeding people.And you win almost every single time.
Now what if BD is all #Neutsout well then you die D2 and can move on to the next game after approximately 3-4 minutes.Now the reason I bring this strat up is because you have to think what the NKs and Unseen/Cult are going through.They don&#39;t know that your alch so you might just die to RNG.The other reason is because I don&#39;t see the value in whispering king when you can just as easily tell the court.The king has absolutely no value in claiming towards unless he is yolo&#39;ing which is a bad tactic.Just if your ever alch think about this strat.



P.S-I never really have to use stoneskin potions in this strat unless idiot princes want knights to CS you and tell you to stoneskin</description>

            <p>If you think the issue that makes this strategy so viable is how friendly alchemists are to BD, and then how easily he can change teams late-game, then there’s a simple fix:<br>
Give him equal helping and kill potential to make him more dangerous.  This can be done by giving him limited healing potions, specifically 3, and upping the bombs to 3 also.  That way he poses equal aid and threat to both sides, as he can only help BD so much with only 3 heals, but also can easily knock out unseen/cult with 3 bombs.  Also should consider dropping the stoneskin potions down to 2 or 3, so that he can’t just sleep on those for the whole game, and actually has to placate himself to both sides to avoid getting killed on nights he doesn’t have stoneskin.</p>

            <p>It’s a valid strategy, but I often see this fail. Princes sometimes suspect Alch claims and kill them without risk. Knights will occasionally do the same thing as well. If there’s a whiff of suspicion against you, you’re probably screwed since Evils will probably try to pile on the bandwagon of putting you up.</p>
<p>As long as you don’t yolo until late game, though, it’s a decent option.</p>

            <p>Fake Alch claims fail D1 for a couple of reasons. Firstly is as assassin,drunk and butlers will DB or occupy you and may stop or find out out you’re assassin. You could claim yolo bomb N1 but who likes a yolo bombing alch? Also you’re right in that poison won’t make them face any tests and you could just not attack someone they say to heal.Fake alch claims D1 as MM would work slightly better unless king or prince just exe you. Also if hunter wolfs you you’re screwed as you’re supposed to be immune. The other way this fails if there are 2 alchemist claims/deaths or 3 neutral claims/deaths(besides NK)I’m not saying this strat is OP or that alch should be convertible I’m saying that this is the most reliable strategy as alchemist to win.</p>

            <p>I’ve failed to see your point.<br>
If you think alch claim d1 is OP, just claim alch d1 as a MM or assasin.</p>
<p>You can just not use poision so you won’t face any tests.</p>
<p>Making alch convertable will make bd exe alch Every single time, and remove alch claims from evil as well.</p>
<p>If you wan’t to “convert” an alch, just wishper him “bomb 9 and game over”</p>

            <p>I think that there’s actually a point where repeatedly attacking an Alchemist out of spite (to the point where you’re pretty much ignoring your actual goals) would qualify as gamethrowing.  I know that if I was trapped in an Unseen with an Assassin who insisted on attacking the Alchemist over and over and ignoring other targets, purely because they hate Alchemists who claim D1, I’d probably report them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the only real change that needs to be made here is to make Alchemists convertable, which would make revealing more dangerous (even if you don’t mind being converted, BD will suspect that you could be converted and are more likely to lynch you as a result.)</p>

            <p>While I get this is a lazy strategy it is fun for me for 2 reasons.Once you become confirmed you can always backstab BD and that is amazing.Like I don’t like being jailed or occupied.Also while you are right in that you do have to heal you no one says it has to be immediately.The thing is you should be playing this game because you enjoy the game.That means that all classes should be fun regardless of what you do. Also if you’re alchemist you’re not really cunning you’re a fucking survivor.You have no investigative abilities no way to really prove yourself and overall is just a boring class by design.Now if you want to say that it is a lazy play and feel it shouldn’t be rewarded then you do have a point.But killing them does a couple of things.As BD you get rid of a potential healer.As Evils you waste a night killing.And as NK you kill your one potential ally instead of the multitude of other people you could kill.This also allows the alchemist to leave N1 with hopes for another more fun class to them.</p>
<p>Also here’s my rebuttal  there are tons of lazy plays.N1-Random Jail,Guard,Heal,DB,Occupy,Bear,Kill,anything really is a lazy play<br>
So what makes this play so much worse then those plays?<br>
Are you going to get mad at the assassin for random killing N1?<br>
What about random healing?<br>
These are all lazy plays as you’re not healing or killing them for any particular reason you’re doing it because that is you’re lazy and you have nothing else to do really.<br>
And sometimes you get rewarded for those plays do you think those plays should be punished?</p>

            <p>I don’t think it’s risk free.  Evils still want you dead because you’re a potential source of heals.  Your stoneskin potions make it unlikely that they’ll risk an attack on you, but not impossible - getting rid of all healers helps Cult / Unseen a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> (basically doubling their kill rate.)</p>
<p>Additionally, you do have to heal.  BD isn’t going to let you live as an Alchemist claim if you don’t heal poison / bleeding.</p>

            <p>Ironically it used to be a risky thing when King had Allies, but now it somehow is less risky.</p>
<p>Probably because Kings don’t need to “prove” themselves to the court by doing it all themselves and throwing an easy Neut to the hounds to keep them off their back.</p>

            <p>While you’re not wrong here, I think that takes a lot of fun out of the game. You’re not being cunning or anything. You’re just claiming alch and hoping the game rolls past you.</p>
<p>I guess if all you want to do is win, sure, but dang that sounds like the most boring game of throne of lies ever.</p>

            <p>Now this is a General statement but I feel like an alchemist claiming D1 has no downside at all.You allow A-Butlers and Drunks to determine if your occupy immune or not.B-The drunk to make sure you don’t attack them.C-Observers to follow you,princesses to check on you etc etc<br>
This is a good strat as alch because evils know your alch so they usually leave you alone and BD get to fully vet you to confirm that you are alch.Its a pretty simple strategy that I’m pretty sure would work most of the time.You claim alch D1.You remind people that your alch every day kind of subtly.You heal all the poisoned/bleeding people.And you win almost every single time.<br>
Now what if BD is all <span class="hashtag">#Neutsout</span> well then you die D2 and can move on to the next game after approximately 3-4 minutes.Now the reason I bring this strat up is because you have to think what the NKs and Unseen/Cult are going through.They don’t know that your alch so you might just die to RNG.The other reason is because I don’t see the value in whispering king when you can just as easily tell the court.The king has absolutely no value in claiming towards unless he is yolo’ing which is a bad tactic.Just if your ever alch think about this strat.</p>
<p>P.S-I never really have to use stoneskin potions in this strat unless idiot princes want knights to CS you and tell you to stoneskin</p>
