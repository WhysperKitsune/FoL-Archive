    <title>Infinite Ress Priest + Phys/Alch</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/infinite-ress-priest-phys-alch/7970</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was healing a confirmed priest. A princess was brought back to life and he was healed because of it.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I guess it was correct, but he was supposed to die, doesn&#39;t he? I mean, if not i think it&#39;s pretty broken
#### Steps to reproduce:
Priest revives someone, and gets healed that very night. It happened to me as Alchemist. Didn&#39;t try with Phys

            <p>Title was kinda misleading though.</p>
<p>Maybe you could say:</p>
<p>Healing cause Priest not to die when ressing.</p>
