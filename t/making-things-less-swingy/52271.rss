    <description># Prince

While I think Prince is a bad class, I know it isn&#39;t going away. The main problem here is if it randomly gets killed early on, taking away a huge power class for the BD.

So I suggest  the following passive:

&gt; Passive: Legacy: If you are killed in the first 3 days, any Blue Dragon Royal may choose to replace you.

This would be done via a &quot;step up&quot; function, although no one would know who stepped up, or who was chosen. The first person would become Prince, and other BD royals would be told &quot;A new Prince has been chosen.&quot; At least one non Prince BD would be guaranteed.

# Smite

Smite is a balanced ability. It rarely takes effect, but it is extremely powerful when it does. I&#39;ve seen Paladins yolo smite and crush the Cult. So I&#39;d suggest the following change:

&gt; Night Ability: Smite: You and your target will become unconvertible for the night. 3 uses.

# Scout

Scout is also perfectly balanced, but has the same swing problem. It would have less effect if there was some wiggle room out of it, for example this:

&gt; Day Ability: Scout: Send a scout to watch your target. You will know if they are visited by the Unseen.

This allows you to claim some other Unseen targeted you, and you weren&#39;t converted, while also allowing the Sheriff to sometimes discover if an Unseen killed their target.</description>

<p>Prince<br>
While I think Prince is a bad class, I know it isn’t going away. The main problem here is if it randomly gets killed early on, taking away a huge power class for the BD.</p>
<p>So I suggest  the following passive:</p>
<p>Passive: Legacy: If you are killed in the first 3 days, any Blue Dragon Royal may choose to replace you.</p>
<p>This would be done via a “step up” function, although no one would know who stepped up, or who was chosen. The first person would become Prince, and other BD royals would be told “A new Prince has been chosen.” At least one non Prince BD would be guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>BD doesn’t insta-lose with a Prince death. The game is supposed to be unpredictable, and you’re supposed to have to change up your strategy as the game progresses. Giving BD a lock on a strong role is an artificial, strong buff that the BD doesn’t need.</p>
<p>King is strong as well, and there’s a high chance that it’s a BD or Neutral starting king. The chances of Evil King + Prince dead n1 are very small. We shouldn’t make balance changes for <em>rare</em> occurrences.</p>
<p>I understand the frustration with Prince dying n1/2 from a BD perspective, and I understand the frustration of Unseen/Cult being kept from killing if jailed more than once, but that’s representative of healthy, unpredictable, dynamic play. I just played a game as Assassin where I was jailed n1, n3, and n4, and the chaos and confusion I caused gave the other evils the chance to take advantage and win. I <em>like</em> that I had to think on my feet. And the same goes for when I play BD - I <em>like</em> having to adjust and play more aggressively when Prince dies early.</p>

            <p>I see the scout one as at least partly meaningless though. The unseen has 3 members, one kills, one converts, one does other stuff. If you were visited n1, and you aren’t dead… you are either the convert, or you are immune to conversion or death.</p>
<p>N2-until an unseen dies - OK almost certainly not a conversion.</p>
<p>after an unseen dies… we’re back to n1 scenerio</p>

            <h1>Prince</h1>
<p>While I think Prince is a bad class, I know it isn’t going away. The main problem here is if it randomly gets killed early on, taking away a huge power class for the BD.</p>
<p>So I suggest  the following passive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive: Legacy: If you are killed in the first 3 days, any Blue Dragon Royal may choose to replace you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be done via a “step up” function, although no one would know who stepped up, or who was chosen. The first person would become Prince, and other BD royals would be told “A new Prince has been chosen.” At least one non Prince BD would be guaranteed.</p>
<h1>Smite</h1>
<p>Smite is a balanced ability. It rarely takes effect, but it is extremely powerful when it does. I’ve seen Paladins yolo smite and crush the Cult. So I’d suggest the following change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability: Smite: You and your target will become unconvertible for the night. 3 uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Scout</h1>
<p>Scout is also perfectly balanced, but has the same swing problem. It would have less effect if there was some wiggle room out of it, for example this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability: Scout: Send a scout to watch your target. You will know if they are visited by the Unseen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allows you to claim some other Unseen targeted you, and you weren’t converted, while also allowing the Sheriff to sometimes discover if an Unseen killed their target.</p>
