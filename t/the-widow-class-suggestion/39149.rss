    <description>&gt;# [color=Grey] The Widow [/color]
&gt; **Nuetral Killer**
&gt;Passive: Immune to death and occupation (no duh this is an NK, it needs staying power)
&gt; *Day Ability 1- (I have clue what to name this ability. Taking suggestions):The person you attack with any ability tonight will see your name, however  their logs and class aren&#39;t shown to anybody and they die as if you were using Lethal Bite -1/2 uses
Note: This is incredibly powerful as it basically gets rid of one class and their logs which can be very useful, but if there is a psychic around they can easily broadcast who the Widow is.
&gt; *Night Ability 1- Posionious Bite*: You attack a target, they die in 1 night and start seeing some words as gibberish and anything mentioning the widow increases the amount of gibbersh they see and that sentence mentioning the widow is now  gibbersh
NOTE: Broadcasts what the NK is, but then again you can figure out the NK by around D3
&gt; *Night Ability 2- Lethal Bite*: You attack someone tonight, they die tonight-3 Uses 
NOTE: Meant if someone is too smart for their own good (*Cough* PKR *cough*)

LORE: Once a respected member of the King&#39;s court, this lady has fallen into madness after her husband&#39;s death and blames the court for his death. She now seeks revenge by eliminating the court



Comments
I went for a sorta of a delayed killer that can kill quickly if necessary.  
Also for some reason I can&#39;t change the category, it&#39;s either not updating on my thread creator or god is smiting my forum account :P
