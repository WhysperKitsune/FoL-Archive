    <title>Class suggestion: The little brother</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-little-brother/11029</link>
    <description>The Little brother is a Unique investigative class that belongs to the Blue Dragon faction
Unlike the prince this character is converable. However, once the prince dies he become the new prince, and unconvertable

**Night abilities**

find-prince: check 2 people, will tell you if one of them is the prince
Follow prince(3 charges)- will tell you who visited the prince last night, and who was jailed by the prince

Passive: Royal blood
Passive: Become prince if the original prince is dead





**What the idea:**
Many games is decided if the prince died early or not, this way the games will be less random.
The cult/unseen can convert  or kill the little brother before killing the prince, so it wont be like the priest meta when 2 princes were almost guranteed.

Alternative: the little brother will become the prince only if the prince died before night 4-5

Of course, you can add this class while removing 1 physician for balance issues</description>

            <p>The point is, its not like 2 princes, because if the little brother dies or get converted then you wont get the second one. It’s not like the priest that were impossible to kill. it just guranteed that the prince won’t die early.</p>
<p>I did make an alternative that this will only work until day X</p>

            <p>Prince is one of the most powerful class. With this class, you essentially get 2 Princes which is too strong for BD in my opinion.</p>
<p>BD losing Prince in the early game is rough but I’ve been in many games where BD was able to win even when Prince died on night 1.</p>
