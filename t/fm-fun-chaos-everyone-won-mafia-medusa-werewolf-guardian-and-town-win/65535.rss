    <description>[color=lightgreen]Welcome[/color]
=
Hello folks and welcome to ~~Chaos~~ Fun game

Basically it&#39;s really a normal game but with a twist... it has a tiny pinch of **bastard**, I promise you tho that this &quot;bastard&quot; has nothing to do with the classes or the day/night, it&#39;s just there to add some ~~chaos~~ fun!

Also most of this game is a complete FHLUCAEOSIN. Woah that glitched bad.

[color=lightgreen] Rules[/color]
=

1. Follow the Global Forum Rules
2. If you haven’t posted content in 36 hours, you’ll be prodded for inactivity. If you don’t respond to that prod in 16 hours, you will be force replaced.
3. No private messaging others in the game about the game.
4. Do not screenshot private host messages
5. Don’t throw the game. This includes any form of intent to make you or your faction lose
6. Do not use me big boi letters me colorz 
7. Editing is allowed if you are correcting grammar mistakes other than that you need me permission. Also no deleting posts.
8. You can edit quotes for the lulz but other than that no.

[color=lightgreen]Gameplay[/color]
=
1. Days will be 72 hours long, or shorter if someone dies
2. Nights will be 24 hour long, or shorter if everyone sent their actions in
3. Actions are done by messaging me
4. Mafia have a night chat and day chat
5. All classes will be used, and will be used as they are found in your PM
6. All classes are hidden.

8. Mafia have a factional kill

[color=lightgreen]Lynches[/color]

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
The player at the end of the day with the most votes will get lynched.
No lynches and d1 lynches are in play btw

[color=lightgreen]Journals/Deathnotes[/color]
=
Message me your entire journal/DN, the last draft I receive before you die/kill shall be the one displayed

            <p>I actually don’t like bastard games that much. Also I hate to say it but nobody on this site has ever used bastard games for anything but “GET IT I LIED ECKS-DEE”</p>
