    <title>Buff to Reaper Chill: Chilled prevents log edit</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/buff-to-reaper-chill-chilled-prevents-log-edit/71428</link>
    <description>Change it so that chilling someone prevents on-the-spot additions to their logbook during the day when they&#39;re chilled. 
Right now chilling is only useful late game when you chill someone whose vote decides whether or not you get lynched. If Chill prevented log edits during that day from showing, then it&#39;s possible to chill someone and accuse them and they wouldn&#39;t be able to out you as the reaper who chilled them if they get exe&#39;d.</description>
