    <title>The Diseased[Neutral Killer](A silly-ish class)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-diseased-neutral-killer-a-silly-ish-class/2129</link>
    <description>#Note: Just because I said this class is &quot;silly&quot; doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think it could work in Throne of Lies, the mechanics just seem a little silly, and perhaps it would have to be restricted to a more chaotic or silly gamemode

#The Diseased
**At Death&#39;s Door(Passive)** - You will die the night after receiving this class
**Horrid Stench(Passive)** - You are immune to occupation
**Sneeze(Day)** - Sneeze on a player, they will not perform their day ability - Infinite uses
**Infect(Night)** - Convert another player into **The Diseased**, your class will cease to be **The Diseased** once you have done this, unless your original class was **The Diseased**

Objective: See the disease continue to the last 2 players

Notes: You can only win if your disease reaches the final 2, the other Diseased player will also win
If you die and you did not infect anyone, the disease has lost and so have you
The &quot;Hot Potato&quot; aspect of this class may make it less fun for the original Diseased, so something could need adding there</description>

            <p>Perhaps the original diseased could have abilities from beyond the grave. Another suggestion is for the original to control how the disease moves even while dead, while another class, the undertaker, tries to stop<br>
you.</p>

If the person is not important, then they will be imprisoned and lose.</p>
<p>Also, Infect does not pierce Conversion Immunity, so it is a bit underpowered, as there need to be only 2 unconvertables for the goal to be unreachable, and one blunder(especially early) and you are dead.</p>
