            <p>GENERALLY it doesn’t mean she will sided with BD to the very end. Just saying there may betray BD like other neutrals when she find out last guy with royal blood is evil. Someone suggested to expand more her win condition: “Queen also need to survive until end of the game”, which can prevent fearless outing herself to court as Queen, also you’are not guaranteed to be protected by healers or knight considering you’re neutral who can backstab them in the most sudden situation,</p>

            <p>Yes, but it is better to refine it first. There is no reason to give it vote manipulation, so it shouldn’t have it. Tbh I see no reason why not reveal immediately. The BD knows you aren’t evil and that you generally side with them. I feel we don’t want give out anonymous communication like candy. It would be better to find some other ability to spice up the protection.</p>

            <p>About Private Conversation I would like let keep her ability(Making more special than just “blank” guarding and destroying purpose of revealing and  2nd ability)<br>
As you said there is no reason keeping double-voting fro Queen BUT it doesn’t mean there is reason to remove this.I think you may underestimate a this vote thing.<br>
I probably would not agree with me but hey, the best way to find out is testing in real life don’t you agree? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>There is no reason for Queen to have 2 votes, so I’d remove it. Just make Private Conversation just guard target instead if that’s what it is for. Revealing is a powerful ability, and your targets are mostly good (since Royal Blood). The sheer number of targets makes it easier than mercenary.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So you want FAR more difficult win condition?<br>
1.Then Queen with her passive should she royaltes classes without outing herself.<br>
2.Killing butlers or drunks? I’m not sure is there a point of impede even more.<br>
Overall, she would need probably even more abilities considering she would have hard win condition but yeah it may be worked out. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The queen and her abilities are very interesting, but i don’t love her win condition.<br>
How about this as a win condition:</p>
<p>At the end of the game, you only win if:</p>
<ol>
<li>the prince or one of the princesses are still alive(and not as an assasin, only dutchess/princess/prince).</li>
<li>all the butler/servents are dead (can be replaced with drunks)</li>
</ol>
<p>That will make her a true natural, as she’ll try to kill the butlers, but save the prince, princess. It will also help a MM who claim princess.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Let me tell ya my point:<br>
1.Queen need way to survive like other neutrals and Private Conversation is more defensive tool then investigative and also in case of Prince jailing Queen’s target and 1-Day Cooldown It’s making pretty high chance it will fails.<br>
2.Revealing in early game is waste in most cases. Watchful Spy can determine of classes AND serving as protection considering if her target dies she will know who killed them.<br>
3.I don’t think second vote will be confusing.She’s a Queen so give her at least double vote(Giving her Decide Fate may destroy whole uniqueness of the King)<br>
Queen is powerful and swingy role to play,and I would say what’s the point of making a class who is weaker than alchemist/mercenary overall?</p>

            <p>I think it has an interesting goal. I’d remove second vote, I think it is a confusing ability. I;d also remove Private Conversation, we don’t be more anonymous chatters. Prince fills it fine. Also why not immediately reveal? You know who you need to protect that way. This will make royal blood members even more valuable for evil as  it lets Queen side with them. Overall, I think it is a sound idea.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t bypass Prevention. The ability does not say it does. He probably either died in a previous patch where jail wasn’t prevention or die to a status such as poison.</p>

            <p>It does. Frenzy is giving assassin guarantee to kill anyone(Bypassing prevention,occupation,night immunity,healing). I remember a game when I was the Prince who jailed someone and next night my target was killed at the same night (no I didn’t press execution) so IT does bypass prevention. I know you don’t probably believe me but trust me on word buddy.</p>

            <p>Correction,reaper won’t kill the Queen’s target but  with assassin + enforcer combo target AND the assassin will gonna because Frenzy give him ability to kill ANYONE no matter what. Also if there is lot’s of royalties in game BD have even harder to protect all of them because probably there would be a situations like: 2 Knights guarding same target or 1 healer + knight. Also if there will be situation like Starting King died in early game and ONLY 1 person will alive with Royal Blood and turns out being then Queen automatically switch sides even if she earlier was sided with BD. I would like to mention a fact smart evils could figured out who could be the Prince(for instance 4 whispering royalties who is not a Prince) then it will left like at least 9 people(minus King,Royaltes,Queen,Teammates) so there is greater chance to kill the Prince in early game not mentioning like tornadoes from Sages &amp; Ritualists. I wanted to be Queen powerful role and swingy enough to not trust completely “confirmed” Queen. Actually Private Conversation is occupying a player and the fact it would have 1-Day cool down with a possibility blocking an important role in bad time would make this pretty balanced.</p>

            <p>Also remember. Not only can she self guard. But the guard is a PREVENTION with a counter attack. That means that Reaper and Enforcer can’t bypass it.</p>

            <p>I don’t think outing yourself as a royal (that isn’t prince) is risky at all.</p>
<p>Attacking someone who is very likely to be a princess is extremely dangerous, and if there are few royal claims, the queen can easily (too easily) protect using private conversation.</p>
<p>You are correct that a queen probably won’t out a royal who’s been converted, but simply knowing that the person in question began the game as BD is helpful enough (since they will be good targets for barrier, smite, and scout)</p>
<p>Having the queen lose if she does makes her win con a little more reasonable, but there’s little incesntive to kill her, she can guard herself with private conversation every other night, and guard herself 4 times after revealing, so even trying to kill her seems like a bad idea. Prince/King obviously won’t want to kill her since she will help the Prince/King, and there’s really no reason for BD to vote her out.</p>
<p>A neutral who appears royal could help thwart the strategy, but more than likely that neutral just won’t claim when the queen asks for nobles to claim, and the queen won’t out them. The BD royals still claim and get all of the advantages of having the queen direct their actions.</p>
<p>Making the prince unable to jail the queen is pointless. No good prince would jail a queen claim in the first place unless she was asked to make an entrance and refused (in which case she’s probably not actually a queen)</p>

            <p><strong>Yep i see your point, thanks for your comment.But i would like to make a respond:</strong><br>
1.If there is less more 3 royaltes then this play you mentioned would be risky,because even after revealing yourself to Queen it would be less and less probability you would be protected, especialy it hurts in reaper game.<br>
2.If royalty was converted and Queen check him, she would’t probably outed him as ‘Scum",considering killing him=less chance to win.<br>
3.Talking about win conditon i think the best way to ‘‘balance’’ it is just add "You need also survive during the game’’ it means if she died then its immediatly <em>game over</em> for her.<br>
4.I have an idea of a Neutral with Royal Blood who appeared in suggestion a few times,Neutral who is more like enemy for main factions.<br>
5.I think we could make that The Prince can’t jail the Queen(His ability will fail) to prevent jailing night 1 the queen and then the Prince will tell his number.<br>
Summarizing,Queen need to think twice before she deside to out herself.</p>

            <p>Probably too helpful to BD, and too easy to win (easier win con and more power than a mercenary)</p>
<p>I could see this being a common play:<br>
1.) Queen claims day 1, asks all royals except prince to claim without giving class.<br>
2.) Queen confirms true claims (known BD) and refutes false claims<br>
3.) Queen tells each royal who to target, and tells prince (without outing) who to target.</p>
<p>In this way, the prince, drunks, and princesses aren’t wasting their abilities on confirmed royals and aren’t targeting the same people = very high probability of an evil being debbed or jailed.</p>
<p>The drunks or princess could be converted later, but knowing a handful of ppl that started as BD is immensely helpful.</p>
<p>The fact that the queen can confirm herself very easily means an evil playing at Queen is not going to get much out of it, so the BD has no reason not to go along with it.</p>
<p>(Worst case scenario is that an evil claiming queen outs a bunch of royals, but as that will not include the prince, it isn’t that bad)</p>

            <p><strong>The Queen</strong><br>
<strong>Faction:</strong> Neutral(Cannot be converted)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Special</p>
<p><strong>Passive Abillity 1</strong>: The First Maiden<br>
You cannot step up to become the next King.Immune to Occupation.After using ‘‘Grand Entrance’’ your vote will count as 2.<br>
<strong>Passive Abillity 2:</strong> Royal Sense<br>
All players with Royal Blood will have a sign next to their name(Blood drop).You don’t see their class and faction even if they got converted.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1:</strong> Private Conversation<br>
Choose a player and talk to him next night.Targered player will see you as “Queen” in night chat and unable to use Night Abilities.Anyone who try visit Queen or her Target will be prevented.(1-Day-Cooldown)<br>
Note:<br>
She cannot target The King.<br>
If she pick The Prince or his target, ability will fail(She will got a message at night phase)<br>
<strong>Day Ability 2:</strong> Grand Entrance<br>
Reveal yourself to the court as “Quenn”(Crown next to name).You cannot whisper and receive whispers to you.Remove ‘‘Private Conversation’’ and change ‘‘Watchful Spy’’ into ‘‘Personal Guardsman’’.Upgrade passive abillity ‘‘The First Maiden’’</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1:</strong> Watchful Spy<br>
Discover a class of a player with Royal Blood.See who they visit and who visited them at this night.(3-Uses)<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2:</strong> Personal Guardsman<br>
Protect a player with Royal Blood from first attack,killing a player who attempt to kill her target.Can target herself.(4-Uses)<br>
Note:<br>

<p>Objective:At least one of the players with Royal Blood or Starter King need survive until the end of the game,in order to win.(Next Kings won’t count unless they had Royal Blood)</p>
<p>Personal Thoughts:I browsed any suggestions about ‘‘Queen’’ Class before i came up with this idea.I wondered why there isn’t this character (King’s Wife)  in a game.What do you guys thing this?Any comments and good criticism is appreciated. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
