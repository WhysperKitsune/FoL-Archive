            <p>I think I understand what happened here after speaking with other people.</p>
<ol>
<li>King died, and someone we’ll called Joe died.</li>
<li>Prompt appears for new king to be chosen.</li>
<li>Noone of royal blood takes the throne, so chance opens for anyone to take the throne.</li>
<li>JOE selects to be elected FROM THE GRAVE</li>
<li>The people vote Joe to be the new King.  He’s resurrected as the new king, but the UI doesn’t adjust to this.  He still shows as dead in the player list.  He still talks in Live chat to the table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expected Results: No prompt to step up to the throne would appear to Joe</p>
<p>Actual Results: The game didn’t register Joe as dead immediately for King election prompts, UNTIL the table loaded to begin the start of the next day.  As such, when the prompt came up, Joe was able to claim the throne FROM THE GRAVE!</p>
<p>I’ll try to get a private game of the pre-alpha testers to see if we can test this on our own and reproduce the issue.  That will be later tonight that I attempt this.</p>
