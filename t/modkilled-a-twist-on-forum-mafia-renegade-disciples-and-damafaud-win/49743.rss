### *Two Mods enter, one mod leaves.*
#### Hosted by Marluxion and Damafaud

*The concept is simple. One mod is good and one is evil. The game ends when one of the mods is &#39;sacrificed&#39;. Sacrifice the [color=#ee1717]E[/color][color=#c8191e]v[/color][color=#a21b25]i[/color][color=#7b1c2b]l[/color] [color=#713e2c]M[/color][color=#8e5d27]o[/color][color=#aa7d21]d[/color] and peace returns to the forums. Sacrifice the [color=#447294]G[/color][color=#5785a6]o[/color][color=#6a97b8]o[/color][color=#7caac9]d[/color] [color=#b1c5d1]M[/color][color=#d2cdc6]o[/color][color=#f4d6bc]d[/color] and the realm will be flooded with fake rolelists and unfair modkills..* 

# **Rules**

[details=&quot;Standard  FM Rules/Voting Rules&quot;]
Standard Forum Rules. No being an arse, cheating, spamming etc. 
**Days will last 72 Hours. Nights will last 36 hours. Extensions will not be granted for forgetting to send an action.**
Voting is compulsive and plurality based! Majority is in effect! To vote someone up, you simply type **/vote playername** (bolding it is nice too.) When the majority of the group has voted for someone, they will be immediately sacrificed! 
Roles ARE revealed upon death!
[/details]

[details=&quot;Special Modkill Rules&quot;]
The game has two mods! Each will be assigned a special rolecard randomly. 
**_The mods cannot directly speak to the players. (Other than Vote Checks and Lynch Flips.) During each night phase, the mods will be able to send one message to all players in the thread._** 
Mods CANNOT publicly reveal their alignment in any way, NOR can they directly reveal the class/alignment of any specific player. The nightly messages will be as cryptic as possible.
**_The game begins with 10 Disciples of the Good Mod and 5 Cultists of the Evil Mod. One random player will be the Renegade. Not believing in either mod, The Renegade&#39;s only goal is to survive until the end._** 
The Cultists know who the Evil Mod is and who their teammates are. However, the disciples have no such luck. They only know their own alignment. 
**_The Cultists will have a day and night chat. ONLY The Evil mod will be able to see the chat, but cannot directly speak in it._** 
Each day, the church of the mod (you, the players) will vote to sacrifice one player to the mods. (A standard lynch.) Voting for No Lynch is an option. 
**_When 5 or less players remain, the [color=darkgrey]Ultimate Sacrifice[/color] will begin. The 5 remaining players will vote to sacrifice one of the two mods. **If the mod sacrificed is the Evil mod, the Disciples win! If the mod sacrificed is the Good Mod, the cultists win! (Regardless of who is alive.)_**

<p>Also how were we supposed to tell whether each mod was good or evil? It heavily biases the end to Cult, since if they’re all dead it’s random, while if they live they get an insta win.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah normally(which is a problem, but I already said that). Here Marl was the proven Evil Mod because they somehow thought that they should lie to the Modeion with just 2 Cult alive. A terrible idea, especially because their information was obvious BS.</p>

            <p>Feedback:</p>
<p>The fact that one mod can only use one power per night and they are all publicly announced allows confirmation (like how a modkill happened and PKR was shielded so that confirmed him)</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better if Modshield and Who needs to be fair/Equality could be used in the same night.</p>
<p>Another thing is that I think Modshield shouldn’t be usable every night, as the mods can completely negate all kills (like when I attacked Wolfy and Simon reeeeeeeeeeeeeee)</p>
<p>Also how were we supposed to tell whether each mod was good or evil? It heavily biases the end to Cult, since if they’re all dead it’s random, while if they live they get an insta win.</p>
<p>Also championing doesn’t work well when the second use of it always confirms someone, making it unusable by the mods.</p>
<p>And the fact that each Champion power is different means you can tell which mod did it. So I’d make each championing identical.</p>
