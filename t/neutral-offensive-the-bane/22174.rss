    <title>[Neutral offensive] The Bane</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-offensive-the-bane/22174</link>
    <description>Lore: the 3 pillars of civilization: the royal family, the army, and the church. In Adiart, however, there is a fourth pillar - the bane

&gt;**The bane**
Neutral offensive
**Passive: Without a trace**
Whenever someone investigates you, you will learn who, their class, and will gain a use of suppress
**Night ability one: Priorities**
_(infinite uses)_ Determine if your target is a royal. If they are, kill anyone who attempts to visit them. Does not bypass death immunity. The king counts as a royal for this ability.
**Night ability two: State sponsored death**
_(infinite uses)_ Kill someone who voted &#39;execute&#39; on a royal or the king the previous day (even if the royal or king is now dead)
**Day ability: Suppress**
(3 uses) for the next 20 seconds, your target will not see any messages sent by anyone else, and no one else will see your target&#39;s messages. They will not be informed of this.
**Day ability: Smother dissent**
_(1 uses)_ Fire a crossbow bolt at the next person to accuse the king of treason, killing them. The court will be informed that you are the bane once you do.

**Goal:** _Make sure a non-royal never becomes king_

---------------

This would help prevent the NK killing king meta, as the bane fights to prevent the possibility of a non-royal becoming king.

Note: I wasn&#39;t sure if the bane should win if the king line is eliminated due to the king dying with 4 people left</description>
