    <title>[RESOLVED] Can&#39;t purchase gp in game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-cant-purchase-gp-in-game/7501</link>
    <description>**What happened:**

I tried to buy 8,000 gp.  When I click the 8,000 denomination and press Purchase, it comes up with some red text to the right of the Purchase button that says &#39;Unknown Error&#39;.

**What was SUPPOSED to happen:**

It should have processed the transaction so that I could buy a sweet pumpkin head with gp.

**Steps to reproduce this issue:**

1. Click Customize Item Shop
2. Click Buy Now (gp) on an item for which you haven&#39;t enough gp.  A window will pop up with 4 denominations of gp to purchase.
3. Select a gp denomination and click Purchase.</description>
