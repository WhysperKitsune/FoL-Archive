    <title>[BUG] Killed as Possessor while jumping</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-killed-as-possessor-while-jumping/75679</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was the Possessor, and I was trying to possess a player.
The jump worked (got the message saying I took control of their body, and that they were a Knight), but I died to my own attack as Possessor after that. I basically possessed myself as Possessor. There was a lag spike as the night ended, and I got feedback multiple times... that probably had something to do with it.
Additionally, I had used Facelift to disguise myself as a Hunter when I jumped, but after my death I showed up as Possessor anyway.
The Knight stayed alive on the player tab, but they were in the dead chat with me (similar to if they had been reaped). 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should have been able to jump to them without issue.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Possess someone during a lag spike.

#### Comments:

            <p>I mean if the knight was hh’ed (or by any means redirected to themselves) then you would have died.</p>
<p>If not, then the order of operations of what happened is wrong. But I would believe the first is what occurred.</p>
