    <title>Court Wizard is still unique?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-is-still-unique/38447</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Since playing way too much since the patch that changed Court Wizard, I have not seen a single double CW game - it appears to still be unique but the in-game information doesn&#39;t show it as such


#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Court wizard should not be unique.


#### Steps to reproduce:

Play the game way too much and notice there is never a double CW game? :stuck_out_tongue:

<p>It was unique yes. It would help if you read the patch notes some times to stay up to date of the game (which I admit, I’m guilty of for not reading at least four of them)</p>
<p>As well as that, use tab to bring up the cards and choose the class you want to read up on. If it has a shield, it’s unique.</p>

<p>He’s posting it as a bug report. He isn’t unaware that the rules changed with CW being made unique and then having uniqueness removed. He was saying in the games he’s played since it was un-uniqued he hasn’t seen 2 in the same game (thus he suspected that while the labels in the cards and patch-notes said it was no longer unique, behind the scenes it could still have the unique tag). I think it was just coincidence that he never happened to be in a game where 2 rolled up, as I’m 99% sure I’ve seen it happen once or twice. But I can see from his perspective the only way players would determine if a mistake like that had occoured (or the dev’s be made aware via something other than happening to look over that particular area of code). Would be if multiple people spoke together to see if any of them have had a 2 CW game since it was supposed to be made possible. Which is more or less what just happened.</p>

            <p>Court Wizard is NOT unique, you have to remember there can be double of one class or another. From my time in streaming the game I know i have seen double CW games plenty of times.</p>
