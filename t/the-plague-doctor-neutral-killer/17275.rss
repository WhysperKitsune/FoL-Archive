<p>There should also be something to kill Phys or Alch because I’m guessing Phys is immune to the plague.</p>
<p>Like a 1/2 time use ability that instantly kills the target or something like that but it only works on Physicians or non night immune Alchs (maybe herbalists too)?</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with this. Maybe give the Plague Doctor some kind of shank that only works on bleed/poison immune classes.</p>
<p>Also, a class like this would really benefit Alchemists in general so they don’t just get executed as often, and allows them to prove themselves easier.</p>
<p>Have you thought about some kind of Day Ability? Maybe an ability that prevents someone who is plagued from being visited, and tells you if a healer tried visiting? Obviously limited to 1/2 uses.</p>

<p>Ewwwww. no, if people know your real identity. It will end in a free execute.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also could add some kind of night immunity, like if you get attacked, you retract a plague from the most recent plagued player to heal yourself, with some kind of plague tracker to see how many people are plagued (similar to Reaper’s soul tracker.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Add this in. All neutrals should have a survival mechanism, whether it’s infinite night immunity or something else like Fool’s hide, Merc’s guard or Alch’s stoneskin.</p>
<p>There should also be something to kill Phys or Alch because I’m guessing Phys is immune to the plague.<br>
Like a 1/2 time use ability that instantly kills the target or something like that but it only works on Physicians or non night immune Alchs (maybe herbalists too)?<br>
The charge isn’t wasted on use.</p>
<p>The passives also seem a little useless. Intimidate should just be occupy immunity and Insane is technically a nerf.</p>

            <p>I don’t see it being OP. It would be a cool mechanic that if they visited a plagued player before they die, they get infected. Especially since its curable. Obviously Phys/Alch is the counter to this killer. Seems like a nice idea.</p>

            <p>Sorta feels like a nerfed reaper. Maybe the plague could bounce on to one visitor. Alch will become much easier to play now if this is in play.</p>
