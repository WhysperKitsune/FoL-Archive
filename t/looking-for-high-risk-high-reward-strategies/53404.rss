    <title>Looking for High-Risk, High-Reward strategies</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/looking-for-high-risk-high-reward-strategies/53404</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been experimenting with some dangerous plays, most if not all of which I learned from others.  I&#39;m looking for some more.  So far I&#39;ve tried:

* Claim Prince to King before real Prince does, get protection and also get real Prince outed.
* Claim Inq. 
* Claim Noble, have a teammate accuse somebody and claim you forced them to vote.
* Claim Psychic, whisper King that this is &quot;hidden&quot; whisper and this guy is sus.
* Claim Hunter, leave a bear deathnote and say they were puppetstringed into your bear (I love this one).
* Claim Paladin as Assassin, say you were bled by Cult leader and this guy is Cult (to out Sheriffs lol).

What I haven&#39;t tried yet is faking a wisp and saying I was attacked and healed (trying to think of a way to make this work).

Does anybody have more crazy ideas to try out?</description>

            <p>Claiming prince, when you’re princess day 1 to confirm all healers/knights instantly and avoid conversion. Only works if prince plays along unfortunately. Everyone will also claim to you day 2 if you aggressively ask for it. Be honest to king and your healers/protectives.</p>

<p>You call it a peek on the unseen. And, you just bs your logs, but once you get the successful peek most people won’t pressure you for them. That said, this topic was “high risk, high reward plays”</p>

            <p>Another very risky play is to claim something like Butler as the MM. It’s so gutsy and stupid some kings won’t doubt it. (Yes, one of my friends has fallen for this before).</p>

</aside>
<p>but… how would a legitimate observer find the MM (I suppose claim peak found unseen but obviously not specifically calling it MM)? and how to explain the first 3 nights of which if anyone actually asks for logs, one of the people you claim to have watched should have a visit, and should have been visited by someone else.</p>
<p>then of course, the side risk of the immune being alc. or guarded by king. or scorned etc…</p>

            <p>What I’ve theorized as a Mastermind is an aggressive bussing strategy: basically once you get a convert off, you wait one night and then you bus either the assassin or the new kid the next day. That gives you a new convert the next night, which essentially works as an extra kill (since you have 1 less BD), all the while giving you a proper Sheriff (or Observer, if that’s what you want) credential.</p>
