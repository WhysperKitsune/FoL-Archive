            <p>This is a very weak role in my opinion, because is basically a werewolf with some buffs and nerfs. The coins are just plain confusing, cause you have to literally implement a new button fot every single class, so I suggest removing that aspect of the Dragon. If you use Unchain you’re basically done for if the Prince decides to execute you. To summarize: Dragon Riches is a little too much to add for 1 class that may never spawn, and Unchain should clean the Prince’s journal, which will probably give you some time.</p>
