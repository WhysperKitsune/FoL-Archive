    <title>Mystic Minor Class Change Suggestion!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mystic-minor-class-change-suggestion/71305</link>
    <description>**Passive: Aided by Spirits**) You are unable to be occupied or prevented when linking\conduiting someone. You will not keep this passive when converted


Chance on the class sheet) Make it appear as occupy immune.


Now, implementing this doesn&#39;t change anything _however_, due to their abilities not counting as visits. The reason I think this should be implemented is because the abilities don&#39;t count as visits. If your a target-changing\occupying class, mystic shows up as immune, even though it doesn&#39;t say its occupy immune, even though it is. This will help more newbies not make a total fool of themselves trying to get mystic killed because &quot;its not occupy immune.&quot; I sometimes even get confused, and I think having this will just generally improve that situation, causing less confusion. 

Edit: Someone brought up that butler doesn&#39;t receive feedback as it being occupy immune, but I think it should as _occupying it doesn&#39;t do anything, I think that should be changed as well._

The reason I don&#39;t have it for keeping the passive is that most of the time when converted, you swap your claim to something else. Not keeping it doesn&#39;t really impact anything as you still have to have someone that can prevent, but you still cant be confirmed in the same amount of time by linking someone. 

Anyways, that&#39;s all I have to say! (I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not the best at wording the class description etc.)</description>

            <p>The confusion is that while a Butler will infact get “success” on a mystic a Drunk will get “immune”</p>
<p>However this is also true for a Noble/Apostle/Aristocrat using spy or a physician using self care or anyone who did nothing or was occupied.</p>

            <p>I would like to point out that this actually does have a meaningful mechanical impact.</p>
<p>Right now the mystic shows as redirection immune but does not show as occupy immune. Changing this makes it harder to maintain the claim if occupied as an Illusionist or Apostle.</p>
<p>Furthermore making the mystic officially occupy immune means that the passive would transfer to an Illusionist or Apostle.</p>
<p>TLDR: you didn’t seem to have quite thought this through</p>
