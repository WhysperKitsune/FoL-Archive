    <title>2 new King night abilities</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/2-new-king-night-abilities/74835</link>
    <description>I brainstormed a couple new King abilities, what do you think?  They both utilize the voting feature but are night-time.

&gt;**Outlaw (Night) -** Instantly announce to everyone by a system message that a particular player has been made an outlaw for the night.  The first person to click their name (in the same way one would accuse them of treason) will attack them, instead of using a night ability.
&gt;
&gt;The King&#39;s deathnote will appear on the outlaw if he is killed in this way.

&gt;**Grand Jury (Night) -** Instantly announce to everyone by a system message that the court&#39;s opinion on a particular player is being surveyed. Simply click on their name (in the same way as one would accuse them of treason) in order to **anonymously** vote against them, or abstain otherwise.
&gt;
&gt;The results of the survey are published the next morning.

&gt;**Allies (Night)** - Publicly announce you are seeking an ally. Every player is given the option to vote another.  King will learn the classes of the three players with the most votes but not know which is which.</description>

<p>Atm race is a speed test. Velocity one. It isn’t the focus of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then just let anyone and everyone attack the outlaw, not a big deal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but people don’t work this way. If they want to lynch, they will simply vote and put up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still think it would be fun, not sure what “people don’t work this way” even means.</p>

            <p>My abilities only make sense if King doesn’t have guards, but instead a 1-time death immunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outlaw is an atm race. Just… why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes King feel important during the night, a replacement for the cancerous allies which if I understand correctly, is only there because people felt King was boring at night.</p>
<p>What does “atm race” mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grand Jury seems kinda useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it would be fun at the very least.  Maybe even useful for King to know whether it makes sense to put someone up for execution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allies don’t look very useful as any scum can simple hide they cast a vote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I will try to make it better.</p>

            <p>I had 1-time death immunity in mind. I’m updating the OP with another ability.</p>

            <p>Outlaw</p>
<p>Order Execution but better but worse but I think better?</p>
<p>Grand Jury would be okay but is also quite literally just giving people buttons to press</p>
<p>If we add it it should be explicitly for that reason</p>
