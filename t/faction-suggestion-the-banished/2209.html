          <p>You have no idea how much fun I had coming up with all these Classes.</p>
<p>Fun Fact:<br>
“The Tinkerer” - Neutral Wildcard (Win with evils)<br>
“The Widow” - BD Support<br>
“The Shaman” - Neutral Wildcard (Win with Neutrals only)<br>
“The Begger” - Neutral Wildcard (Become King)<br>
“The Begger King” - Neutral Special (Survive as King)</p>
<p>These were actually going to be Classes I was going to suggest for Neutrals in ToL rather than being in a faction.<br>
I took a load of them and implemented them into this faction. Worked out pretty well I’d say.</p>
