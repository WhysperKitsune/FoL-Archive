    <title>1.0.9 Player models when executing are weird</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/1-0-9-player-models-when-executing-are-weird/16334</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
When executing the player models look like they have two stones for feet and no balance with their hands.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
When executing the player models should look much better, like in previous versions for comparison.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Get in a game, execute someone, compare the execution animation to the old ones
