    <title>CL sacrificing mechanic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cl-sacrificing-mechanic/17443</link>
    <description>Played a pretty embarrassing game as CL. Pally got exes and called my only other cult guy sus as he died. So I figured I&#39;d sacrifice him that night since he&#39;d be exed the next day and I&#39;m out of erads. Well then I was jailed because I claimed pally to prince N2 and that was the 2nd pally who died. So there I am in jail, with my cult buddy about to be sacrificed. But I was hoping since I was in jail my sacrifice wouldn&#39;t go through. But it did. And we lost that night. But what I don&#39;t get is how I was able to sacrifice somebody from jail. I know I clicked on it during the day but i feel like jail should cancel that since, well I don&#39;t know what all goes into sacrificing somebody in reality. But I feel like CL couldn&#39;t do that from jail.</description>

            <p>What I know for sure is that the sacrifice does not happen if you become Cult Leader yourself after you are being declared as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>I was in a game as the only other Cult Member left and the Cult Leader was caught and about to be put on trial. As last action he decided to sacrifice me (bit of a throw, indeed!). He was executed and I became Cult Leader. The sacrifice did not happen in this case.</p>

            <p>The sacrifice happens even if one of the involved people are jailed.</p>

            <p>Hmmm. Well he still died that night. So maybe he died some other way? Yolo alch or something. And it was just a coincidence.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure if the cl is imprisoned, the sacrifice should have not gone through. Same rule should apply if you sacrifice your member that has been imprisoned</p>
