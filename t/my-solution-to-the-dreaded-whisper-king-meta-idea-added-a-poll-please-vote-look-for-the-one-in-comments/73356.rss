    <description>Ok so, the whisper king meta. Nobody really likes it but it&#39;s always kind of been there. How do we solve it.
First:
**Turn off whispering to king**.
Well now, that&#39;s a solution all in itself. But we still need a way to give info to king. How? (Keep in mind, the King can still whisper you.)

Add this fella:
&gt;# [color=blue]The Messenger[/color]
&gt;*[color=blue]Blue Dragon Social (Unique)[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Manipulative)** - This class has a 10% chance to be evil. Meaning, it will still be in the BD class form, but it will need to see the Blue Dragon lose. It will **only** be able to see it&#39;s fellow evils if it is converted. If the evils try to convert the 10% evil messenger, it will work and it will now just be the converted class. Otherwise, it will not know who their evils are. Also, this class will always be in a game that has more than 11 players. &lt;11, and this class will be random if it spawns or not. If the class is evil, it will take up a neutral slot.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Connections)** - You may whisper the King. All whispers to the King will be hidden.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Private Matters)** - Hide all whispers to and from you for the rest of the day. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Open the gates)** - The court will be sent a notification, and they will be able to send whispers to the king for the rest of the day. _1 use, not usable until d4_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (King&#39;s Connection)** - Select a player. The king, once day time is started, will be given the message &quot;The messenger&#39;s selection is a member of the ____.&quot; The messenger will not know the faction of who they selected, and the king will not know the number of the person the faction belongs to. _3 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Private Eyes)** - Select a player. You will know if they have been visited by a royal in the past 3 nights, including the night this is used. King counts, if they were jailed, that will count too. _Infinite Uses_.
&gt;
&gt;***Goal: Same goal as BD (unless the messenger is the 10% evil)***


&gt;# [color=purple]The Mediator[/color]
&gt;*[color=purple]Unseen Social[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Evil Connections)** - You may whisper the King, and all whispers from you to the king will be hidden.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Watch the People)** - The court will be sent a notification, and they will be able to send whispers to the king for the rest of the day. All unseen will be able to see these whispers. _1 use, only usable if &quot;Open the Gates&quot; was not used as a messenger._
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (King&#39;s Connection)** - Select a player and a faction. The king, once day time is started, will be given the message &quot;The messenger’s selection is a member of the ____.&quot; The king will not know the number of the person the faction belongs to, and he will be shown the fake faction you selected. You will know the real faction of who you selected. *2 uses* .
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Unseen&#39;s Connection)** - Select a player. The mastermind, on day startup, will know their exact converted class. _3 uses_.

All comments by me in the coments are changes to the post

**I had an idea because some people didnt like &quot;manipulative&quot; passive. So I made a poll:**
[poll type=regular public=true]
* Keep it as it is
* Remove manipulative, add this passive: Your votes in the elections will count twice. This class is guarenteed in games with more than 11 players. Less then or equal to 11, and it&#39;ll be random if it is in or not. If you vote for a royal, royal blood and this passive will in total make it count for 3 votes. You will not keep this ability if your class changes.

            <p>To be honest I think we just get a whisper messenger meta.  The main reason people whisper to king is because he is in a perceived position of power and if he is evil he won’t know who else is evil and if he is good he can’t be converted.  If we have a class that is guaranteed 90% bd (as opposed to 60%) I think they just out and since they can easily prove (due to hidden whispers) we still get a claim game just to a different leader.</p>

            <p>But if it’s aligned to a faction then it could possibly not trust the king.  IMO the win con should just be the same as the current king’s.  That way you won’t have the problem of the Messenger not trusting you.</p>
