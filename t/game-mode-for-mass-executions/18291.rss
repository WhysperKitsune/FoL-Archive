    <title>Game mode for mass executions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/game-mode-for-mass-executions/18291</link>
    <description>In this game mode, as soon as a majority is reached on a player, the king is given a small window to issue a pardon. He has three of these, and they make the player not get executed and prince further executions for the day. If no pardon is given, the player immediately dies an voting phase resumes. Any number of people can die. This goes on until the timer ends.

Sometimes, sheriff finds 2 unseen at once. In a real court, you just execute all three of them! But alas, without the prince, this is inconceivable.

This works especially best if player&#39;s classes are not revealed upon death</description>
