    <title>Reaped Player Execution</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaped-player-execution/3755</link>
    <description>I think it would be an interesting addition, that if a reaped player gets executed during the day it would not reveal his role. 
Instead the role would show something like &quot;Empty Hull&quot; or &quot;Lifeless Corpse&quot;. This would add much to the paranoia since the surviving players would not know what role is missing, except from the journal. Maybe only physician should be able to identify the corpse role with 100% accuracy. Priest can also talk with the dead to find out the role, but the dead can lie to the priest. 

This would possibly cause the unseen or cult not to know if prince or any other important class is still alive. And the BD would not know if the MM is dead or they killed an important ally.</description>

            <p>I like this idea to be incorporated some way but reaper is very strong as is, he just doesn’t win often because his win condition is brutal but that makes the times they do win all the more epic.</p>

            <p>How good is this ability though? All it adds is the ability for all evils (even non reapers) to stay silent during trials and survive more often.</p>

            <p>It would be cool flavor wise, but the Reaper is fairly balanced at the moment.</p>

            <p>The reaper’s strength is stealth and those who are not paying attention will learn too late of Reaper’s whereabouts.</p>

            <p>I think that the Reaper is a bit weak. He isn’t that bad or anything I just think a little buff is good enough.</p>
<p>For example if gather darkness could peirce healing too.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of an Neutral Killer with this ability but Reaper is already strong enough in my opinion.</p>
