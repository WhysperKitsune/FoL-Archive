    <title>0.9.2 Patch Notes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/0-9-2-patch-notes/2516</link>
    <description>## Illusionist:
* Link Minds &amp; Mental Blur are now the Illusionist&#39;s night abilities.
* Now had Psychic&#39;s Misdirect as a second day ability.
* Changed type to Social.
* Link Minds now has a two second delay at the start where the linked player will be unable to send messages.

## Nightwatch:
* Now has the new Follow. (See Observer)
* Watch Carefully now reveals a player&#39;s class. Has 2 uses.

## Butler &amp; Servant:
* Removed Black Wine.
* Added Concentrated Wine. The Butler/Servant throws a party at night. No one will be able to whisper the next day. Has 2 uses.

## Observer:
* Follow and the old Window Peak have been combined into a new Follow ability.
* Window Peak now discovers a player&#39;s faction. Has 2 uses.

## Soulcatcher:
* Unleash Souls now shows players&#39; classes.

## Bug Fixes:
* Aftermath fixed.
* Acolyte now properly becomes Cult Leader when they are the only Cult member left.
* Chat can now display more than two lines if neccessary.
* Fixed the possible bug killing off MM and CL randomly.
* People will no longer be able to vote for themselves after the king voting is finished.
* Maid Spy is now actually infinite uses.
* Targeting panels for abilities with 2 targets have been fixed.
* Rejoin message spam has been fixed.
* Acolyte kills were appearing as Assaassin kills.
* Some others.

## Notes:
* Most day abilites are going to get reworked at some point. Going to do them all in one go, instead of doing them as I&#39;m trying to balance individual classes.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Giving Illusionist Telepathy was badly needed as otherwise if Psychic was converted he was immediately caught. As was removing Visions, as they did not belong in a social class anyway - Psychic often found more scum than Observer.</p>
<p>Before last Patch Psychic was OP, but I think he was very well balanced after it. With this most recent patch playing Psychic will just be infuriating - literally no one will give any info to you in an Unseen game, and Scum have a great excuse not to try and fake claim to you.</p>
<p>I think they should make linked minds a limited use ability on the Illusionist and replace mental blur with a main night ability. As it is Illusionist has gone from by far the best BD role to one of the worst.</p>

<p>This seems pretty powerful for Unseen and not so much for BD. BD tends to whisper a lot more since Unseen meets at night.</p>

<p>I’m all for nerfing Psychic but that utterly destroys him. Why would I ever tell my role or any info to the Psychic who linked minds to me if there is a chance he is Unseen. I think you had it right last patch getting rid of visions and adding Telepathy to Illusionist, bringing Psychic in line with other BD roles.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like the changes but Psychic needs a new night ability. If unconverted, Psychic seems rather weak right now.</p>
