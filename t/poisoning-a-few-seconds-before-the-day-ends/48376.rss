    <title>Poisoning a few seconds before the day ends</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/poisoning-a-few-seconds-before-the-day-ends/48376</link>
    <description>It&#39;s really annoying that you can get poisoned just as the day ends. I feel like the poison/bleed abilities should be disabled earlier so people have more time to say they were poisoned/bled. I was in a game where I was randomly poisoned by butler on d2 as good king right before night. Like if somebody is a slow typer or just spaced out for two seconds or whatever, they&#39;re just going to die. That&#39;s not fun.</description>

            <p>Wait, I thought you do have to poison a few seconds before the night ends.  All activated abilities disable several seconds before talking does.</p>

            <p>There is a thing called being patient. you give the healers one less night to heal which is good for you. BD doesn’t need an indirect buff</p>

            <p>That is almost necessary. Without it Unseen/Cult get four extra kills, and that would unbalance the game.</p>
<p>Besides, I find it is a great way to distract the healers, securing safer kills.</p>

            <p>I disagree. Part of the problem with poison is its so easily removed - Its <em>almost</em> a worthless skill (IMHO). This tactic of delayed poisoning evolved out of the simplicity of healing the poisoning.</p>
<p>But again, its just an opinion <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I think you should have to poison 10 - 15 seconds before the day ends. It would solve this.</p>

            <p>While that is unfortunate, I will point out that that one’s on the Butler.</p>
<p>Assassin/Cult poisons take two days to kill, which makes it a bit better.</p>
