    <title>End game scorecard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/end-game-scorecard/10290</link>
    <description>I would love it if there was a way to see the actions the players took postgame. Like I just played a game of Court Wizard, and it would be nice to see if I did some good with my Ice Wards. And in general it would be cool to see what happend that game that you did not see / catch.

Maybe just have a log button next to the add friend / report player on the post game screen. Where it says

N1: Warded 1 Successfull
N2 Warded 2 Failed

or something like that, you get the idea :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>This could also help cut down the number of false reports since the transparency of night actions could clear up things for angry or confused players.</p>
