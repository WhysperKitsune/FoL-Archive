    <title>[FM] Throne of Riots - Council of Idiots Win! (Barely)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fm-throne-of-riots-council-of-idiots-win-barely/64958</link>
    <description>[details=Lore Introduction]
All is well in the Council of Idiots Discord Server. Its members discuss the latest dank memes and show images that should not be seen to the common eye. From a cat that controls the element of fire to a magical dog who sets his heart on a Victorian-styled gambler, this group is not like any other. They like to lighten up each others lives through controversial methods.

A voice of great power echoes throughout the chat. “It is time, fellow idiots! Time to show that we are the ones in charge! Who’s with me?”

Everyone cheered as a new topic on https://forum.imperium42.com/ titled “This is Totally Not a Riot” appeared in the Off-Topic section. Seconds after the thread was posted, hundreds of posts containing meaningless content formed. Pings fly from the United States to Russia and links to overly disliked Youtube videos played at maximum volume. Half of the forum can’t fall asleep because of all the notifications that keep on popping up since midnight.

As chaos unfolds in the thread, two well-established figures in blue suits glare with disgust. One of them has a mature face and structure with brown sticks of hair on the top of his hair. The other is more similar to a young anime school girl.

“Why must we suffer like this?!” cried the taller figure. “Every time we close one of their threads down, another one pops up in the span of minutes!”

The shorter individual faced the other. “What if we destroy them from the inside? They had gotten along so quickly, but we can tear them apart just as easily. We can even have some of them join our quest for justice.”

The girl’s accomplice developed a surprised look on his face. “That’s an excellent idea, but how can we get inside the thread without anyone noticing us?”

The leader grabs a plastic bag and pulls out two stylish mustaches. She hands one of them to her companion. “With these clever disguises, of course. Those dumbasses aren’t smart enough to see past them.”

The two figures walk towards the thread confident that their mission will be complete. If not… they might as well be dead.

## [color=Purple] Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Throne of Riots! You may think this is a SFoL, you&#39;re wrong. According to the Mama herself, the &quot;townie classes&quot; are too different, so it&#39;s a FM! I needed a co-host because I never hosted a game like this before, so @Pug  will assist me. He helped create a class inspired by himself and offered suggestions throughout the creating process such as the Toxic Classes. This is heavily inspired by a battle of thread postings and their closings. If you didn&#39;t experience that, then I hope this game is similar to it (This concept of a COI based FoL was originally from Firekitten but I accidentally stole it... sorry dude) [/color]

## Rules

1. No Gamethrowing.
1. If you have not posted anything related to the game within 36 hours, you will be prodded for inactivity. If you don&#39;t respond to the prod within 16 hours, your spot will be replaced.
1. Do not spam or post several times in a row, give everyone else a chance to speak.
1. Do not use big letters or use our mod colors. Mine is [color=Purple] this [/color] and Pug&#39;s is [color=#29E45B]this[/color].
1. Do not post a screenshot from your class card or Moderator/Toxic/Uncle Doggo Night chat.
1. Do not interact with posts with the living if you are dead. That includes commenting, liking a post, etc.
1. Actions such as accusing or voting should involve the indicated action along with bold text.

## Gameplay

* Days will last for 72 hours or less if an execution takes place and nights will last for 24 hours

## Executions
* To accuse someone, type /accuse [player] or /vote [player] 
* The use of /execute or /pardon before a trial begins is ignored
* If the number of votes reaches majority, the player being accused will go on trial and be able to make a defense within 12 hours
* If the accused makes a defense within 12 hours or does not respond after 12 hours, the rest of the players will vote to /execute or /pardon
* Nobody can use day abilities during a trial except for the Thread Host&#39;s Account Declaration
* If the day ends and the trial is still occurring, then the action with the most votes happens, if it&#39;s a tie, the accused lives

## Picking a New Thread Host

* After a Thread Host&#39;s execution, the day will not end and an election will occur
* Players with the Meme Lord Status have 12 hours to nominate themselves for the election
* If no players with the Meme Lord Status step up after 12 hours, then anyone can nominate themselves to be the next Thread Host
* If only one person nominated themselves, they will become the next Thread Host
* If two or more people nominated themselves to be the next Thread Host, then an election will be held
* Whoever has the most votes gets to be the next Thread Host (If it&#39;s a tie, the player that nominated themselves first gets to be the Thread Host)
