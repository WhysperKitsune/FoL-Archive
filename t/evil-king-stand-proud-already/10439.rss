    <title>Evil King . Stand Proud Already</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/evil-king-stand-proud-already/10439</link>
    <description>I see this a few times and it bugs me .

The game is down to about 5-6 players and not many  unseen or cult have died . Your likely looking at at least 3 unseen .

And the evil king is still playing out like he is a good guy .

As the unseen you obv aren&#39;t sure  because the king has been cagey  and you cant risk revealing to king encase he isn&#39;t your guy .

then a few turns later the prince has axed a few guys etc. and the game has swung back to Blue dragon . 

Just feel sometimes that an Evil King needs to step up once in a while when the odds are likely that you are ahead .</description>

            <p>IF you are fairly certain there are three unseen, then it is time to out at 7 total players (including yourself), so long as you can either execute the prince that day or the prince is dead.</p>

            <p>I’m not really sure how or when to do that. I mean, if its obvious and I’m MM/Assassin I’ll go out on a limb and whisper king. On a semi-related note, my 2 Reaper wins have been because I whispered Neut king that I was his only ally and he voted with me both times.</p>
