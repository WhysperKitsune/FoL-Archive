    <title>Stepping up as new king not visible to some</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/stepping-up-as-new-king-not-visible-to-some/16340</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
The King was killed and a new King had to be elected.
I step up to be King together with 2 other guys and the usual question for roles comes.

I claim to be the Drunk and while the voting is going on they say I was lying because I didn&#39;t step up.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to show up for everyone as someone who stepped up. Did not happen.
Got executed instead.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Be the Drunk, step up as king when he dies.

#### Comments:
Screenshot attached.

I did post this screenshot while the game was in progress when they were about to execute me, I know it is cheating and it&#39;s banable. I am sorry for doing this. I was just frustrated with this bug and that I was about I died for no reason.

It had no info that they wouldn&#39;t know either way though cause my dead confirms I&#39;m the Drunk. 
So if I get banned it&#39;s understandable but I hope you guys have mercy on me.

Hope you guys can fix this :slight_smile:</description>
