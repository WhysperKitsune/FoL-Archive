    <description>Just had a game as Mastermind where my first **-&gt; 5 &lt;-** conversion attempts failed with one Court Wizard &amp; two Neutrals already dead.. That&#39;s beyond ridiculous. Of course some of those attempts were probably on a Priest or Prince but still... I believe anti-conversion mechanics are too strong right now.</description>

            <p>I don’t think CW is too strong. I think the number of convert immune targets in a game is too strong. Maybe instead of guaranteed priest, like 20% higher chance of priest spawn or something. It’s just too good to have a priest which is night immune and convert immune, a prince which is convert immune, and a res target which can’t be voted up or converted along with a plethora of alchs that can’t be converted.</p>

<p>And as A MM you should not try to convert those people before you can see 1 dead CW</p>

<p>But then you’re basically leaving out the most important to stop target, when there may not even be a CW in the game to start with.</p>

            <p>So maybe you just tried to convert the investigative wishpering class?</p>
<p>When i play CW i just barrier whoever wishpering the king.<br>
I think every good player with no other information should do the same,<br>
And as A MM you should not try to convert those people before you can see 1 dead CW</p>

            <p>Court Wizard is really hard to disprove without Observer or Sheriff actions. Just unlucky. Another day, you kill one Court Wizard and convert the other.</p>

            <p>I partly agree with you, but then also looking at the fake claimable roles list, and well CW is one of the better claims, once it becomes unique that option goes much worse.</p>

            <p>So you mean to tell me it’s balanced that two Court Wizard’s can make 25% of the players N1 immune to conversion, on top of Priest, Prince and most of the Neutrals being unconvertible? I’d say nah to you, on that.</p>
