    <description># Only post Character Sheet here
Discussion of characters can go at https://discord.gg/8TzBntw or https://forum.imperium42.com/t/nexus-interest-check/46724/28

&gt;# Character Rule 
&gt;**Velonia:**
&gt;1. Your character, should they be a magic user, should have a method of controlling magic, what this is is up to you, it could be a wand or potions or harnessing mana through leylines
&gt;2. Depending on how your magic works, it might not work on other planes, or it may be limited. 
&gt;
&gt;**Callinety Falls:**
&gt;1. Your character, should they have metahuman powers, may only have 1 power or 1 type/style of power
&gt;2. Callinety Falls is basically present day earth but with crazy powers, so keep it modern and save the crazy technology for the sci fi world
&gt;3. Remember, your character may be a metahuman, but they&#39;re still human, so don&#39;t make them an immortal supergod when their actual power is making fireballs  
&gt;
&gt;**Grand Peninsula:**
&gt;1. Steam power has its limit, even though on this plane those limits may be seen as unrealistic, they still exist
&gt;2. Steam power is not infinite, it needs water and fuel, sometimes you may not be able to get these things, in this case your machines won&#39;t work, deal with it
&gt;3. You&#39;re only human, any extraordinary abilities your character may possess are due to machines and invention, not any sort of special power.
&gt;
&gt;**Eleos-12:**
&gt;1. Your character, should they be from an alien race, must have purely defined abilities and shortcomings, you don&#39;t have to state what they are, but remain consistent
&gt;2. You may have all sorts of crazy technology, but the whole nexus thing is pretty new, so you can&#39;t communicate or teleport between dimensions using your technology.

            <p>(<em>cracks fingers</em>)<br>
Name: Chris T Kal<br>
Age: 23<br>
Gender: male<br>
Plane of <em>origin</em>: Callenity Falls<br>
Plane of residence: 52nd/velonia<br>
Appearence: quite tall (6’ 1.5"), with a mop of curly, reddish-brown hair, and bright green eyes. He usually looks calm/cold and focused, but when talking about his interests he has this crazy smile and his hair somehow gets puffier/curler<br>
Backstory:</p>
<p>Power/s: Crystaline Construction - conjure a crystal of semi-random color/characteristics (depending on location/soil) through the ground, and depending on color/characteristics one can power through them. He is better at using them, both in powers and physical manipulation (ie aiming them when throwing)<br>
Specifics:<br>
Generally, more precisely cut crystals or ones with brighter/clearer colors are stronher<br>
In Eleos, conjures crystals have fluorescent colors. In Velonia, they grow.</p>
<p>Color/power table<br>
Known by Chris:<br>
Purple - storage<br>
Red - destruction<br>
Green/dark green - communication<br>
Light green/lime - strength<br>
Clear/prismic - crystal manipulation (changing color/focus). Power based on clarity instead of brightness<br>
White - passivly strengthens nearby crystals slightly. Also much easier to manipulate with prisms than others<br>
Black: cannot be conjured<br>
Ooc thought of:<br>
Yellow: creation<br>
Grey: crystal merging. Very specific in terms of brightness/cut, effect/product can significantly change with 1 degree brighter or more precisely cut.<br>
Black: cannot be conjured, must be made with a perfectly-clear prism on a pure white crystal. Uses up the prism in the process. Crystal fracturing.<br>
White - when merged with another crystal through grey, focuses said crystals power around crystals, or strengthens their power significantly, depending on the grey</p>

Age: 17<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Plane of Origin: Callinety Falls<br>
Appearance: Average height teenager with a permanent smile. Longish brown-blonde hair. Wears a red and blue jumper all the time.<br>
Backstory: He used to be bullied severely at school and tried to kill himself. His father was a famous scientist, so Spaz tried to use a concoction of chemicals from his father’s lab to kill himself (the concoction was named Spazium Epilepsate). He was very allergic to some of the chemicals and before he could drink it he inhaled the fumes and had an allergic reaction. This was an epileptic fit and he felt so good afterwards that he decided to drink the mixture. It not only made him have a fit, but it also made it controllable! (realistic rite?). 3 years later his father was massacred at a funeral and Spaz started to travel through the realms to find his inner meaning.<br>
Special Ability: He spazzes super fast and can occasionally spread the spaz to another person.<br>
Skill: He holds knives while he spazzes so he can chop up anyone who comes near.</p>

            <p><strong>CHARACTER INFORMATION</strong><br>
<strong>Name/Alias:</strong> Dinara Senade<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 25<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Female<br>
<strong>Plane of Origin:</strong> Velonia<br>
<strong>Species:</strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
Night Elf</summary>
<p>The origin of Night Elves was said to be an elf clan who wished to achieve immortality in order to fully taste the full bearing of life. They performed a ritual described in an ancient manuscript told to be older than the world itself, hoping it would fulfill their wish. Many versions appeared on how the grand ritual failed. A sabotage by their own member, a false instruction in the manuscript. Nevertheless, the ritual failed and left the elves as shadows, stripped from their enchanting appearance that charmed mortals far and wide.</p>
<p>In vain, the first of Night Elves tried to reverse the damage, but it was too late.They covered their shadowy form with a magic augmentation that will change their appearance into figures as imagined by others. It was not enough, but it was all they have. The Night Elves hid from other elf clans in shame and blend with humans, only dare to tread the world under the cover of the moon and ink black sky. Yet they continued to live, having learnt their lesson. Life is a good thing, and one won’t cherish a good thing unless it has an end.</p>
<p>If a Night Elf is seen without his glamour, he will be seen as a shadow figure, similar to those of a silhouette. He would be as tall as the person who sees him with a pair of glowing yellow eyes on their face. The shadow themselves are dense and trying to run a hand through one will be a useless struggle.</p>
<p>With his glamour on, a Night Elf can take the appearance of what a person imagine. The glamour that covers a Night Elf tricks all senses, changing the Night Elf skin tones, muscles build, intonation and melody of voice, fragrance, and other physical attributes to fit the onlookers thought.</p>
<p>A Night Elf is always shrouded by illussion, but able to suppress it, avoiding unneeded attention on daily life activities. A Night Elf’s shadow form normally can only be seen by elves and witches. Other species will only see them as humans. However, there were cases when an injured Night Elf turns into his shadow form as his magical energy focused itself on keeping the Night Elf alive.</p>
<p>They lost most of their elven heritage, including their affinity with nature magic. They do keep their enchanting charm and their meddles with spells left them with a unique bit of magic of their own. They call it trust magic, although they are unsure of the reason they earned it.</p>

            <p>Name: Orbi<br>
Age: ???<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Plane of Origin: Eleos-12<br>
Species: Pervolvian – Generally large, insectoid creatures who can retreat into their shell (which is spherical) and roll around. They are generally pitied by other species due to their fairly disgusting look and how their eyes cannot see very well.<br>
Special Abilities: Dr. Orbi is intelligent. He is miniscule compared to normal Pervolvians, at roughly the size of golf ball (this is due to his egg being damaged by a human as he was growing). He can bounce around in ball form unlike normal Pervolvians.<br>
Appearance:  Slimy, spiked body with small limbs. Has two pincers as mouths and two eyes which are normally covered by his goggles which let him see in different ways (which he invented). In ball form he is a sphere with occasional spikes; his arms wrap around his body in ball form.<br>
Backstory:  Orbi was abandoned by his parents when they saw his miniscule stature and he was homeless for many years. He built inventions out of thrown away items from bins and got better rapidly. He built a jetpack at very young and was noticed by a doctor who recruited him as a doctor of engineering. A few human years later he won his first award for building a deployable mech suit for himself. He then moved on to building commissions from people and occasionally is commissioned by important people or leading scientists</p>
<p>Equipment: Cosmic spanner which is an energy spanner designed by Orbi which as well as working as a normal spanner, it can charge up machines and warp gravity to make hitting things have more force; Goggles which lets Orbi see better</p>

He became renowned as an undead slayer, wielding a mighty two handed greatsword that shone with a holy light.</p>
<p>However, things didn’t go as planned. Serkos grew arrogant, and missed his opportunity to kill the Lich Lord.  Instead, he was burned alive by the fiend’s green flame.
