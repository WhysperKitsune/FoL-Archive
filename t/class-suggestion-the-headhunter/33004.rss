    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Headhunter</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-headhunter/33004</link>
    <description>Neutral Killer

Goal: Must kill all royal bloods to win 

Passives:

Jungle adaptation: Immune to being Occupied and killed at night (Prince execution still surpasses). Also Immune to bleeding and poison. 

Day Ability 1: Toxic Dart (3 uses): Poison a targeted player, they will die in 3 nights.
D1: They will be able to talk and vote as usual.
D2: Still alive, but behave similarly to a reaped body.
D3: They will be incurable at this point and die the next night.

I decided 3 nights for sake of balance with my ideas, though I understand it can be a bit too long and if there is an active healer, it is essentially pointless.

Day Ability 2: Subtle Intimidation (2 uses): If being voted, target a player to rescind their vote for the day, they will be able to vote others, but will not be able to vote you up again. (This will give you away, but 

Night Ability 1: On the hunt (infinite uses): Behead a player, killing them. (will not bypass healing, imprisonment or night immunities) If target was a royal blood, gain another charge of toxic dart.

Night Ability 2: Deadfall trap (2 uses): Lay down a lethal trap outside someone&#39;s house, if they leave tonight, kill them.

Lore: Once a loyal hunter for the king, he was sent on a mission to a far away land in hopes of finding hidden tracks of the Unseen Mastermind. What he was not told was that he was going on a suicide mission, for the Royal blood found his skills far too dangerous if he was ever to be converted. For weeks he spent in the jungle, he found nothing, but vast green canopies in the sky and the vivacious lifestyles of the native wildlife. Eventually, the hunter gave up, trying to track his marked path to home, he quickly discovered that his tracks were no longer to be found. He was being followed, but not by any beast. 

&quot;Little far away from home are we?&quot;, bellowed a voice, in a sympathetic, but almost mocking tone.

The hunter turned around to see what he was looking for; the mastermind, a man of many faces, but no faces at the same time. The hunter fell to his knees, knowing that no matter how great his strengths, his soul was now unwillingly surrendered to the great mastermind. The mastermind was aware of the hunter&#39;s mission, fulfilling the rage within the hunter and slowly convincing him to the path of the unseen. The mastermind then slowly reached out to the hunter, closing his eyes, the hunter could sense the power from that one finger, eager to claim its prize, but the anticipation felt like an eternity. Suddenly, the horrific feeling vanished and a loud scream was heard. The hunter opened his eyes and noticed his bear companion&#39;s fresh carcass on-top of the mastermind&#39;s struggling body.

 Knowing this was his opportunity, the hunter fled, with fear enveloping his body, but with a vengeance to strike down the royal blood. He returned to the village outside Castle Adiart, changing his identity entirely, he renounced himself as a hunter, instead proud-fully entitling himself as a vengeful Headhunter.

Comments: Hard core nerded out here, I was super bored and even though I&#39;m aware there&#39;s a lot of NK ideas right now, I felt like there is none that actually have any specific goals than to kill all major factions.</description>

</aside>
<p>if by hardcounter you are reffering to the inq… that’s silly, inq is completely incapable of  finding the sorcerer. I wouldn’t call a class with at least 33% chance of a false positive on any check, a hard counter. But even with the inq worthless, I do have to say, while I don’t know the statitstics… I haven’t seen a sorc win yet. I’ve seen many reaper and a few possesor wins since sorc was added, but not actually witnessed the sorc win.</p>

            <p>I like the idea in general. There isn’t much in the game around royal blood right now (Other than succession).</p>
<p>But I like talking balance where I can, so here goes. ^^</p>
<p>overall, I think indirectly benefits evil a lot.</p>
<p>Poisoned darts combined with evil poison/bleed will increase the value of healers substantially and BD will be more hesitant to lynch alchs before confirming NK class whether it’s head hunter or not. And in cases where healers are dead early(Happens too often for me) it could increases the death rate to 4 a day! (Reaped is technically dead at this point). one healer scenario will also be unfavorable as healer will not be able not keep up with the amount of poison/bleed occurring daily (D1: 2 poisoned, D2: 3 in need of healing, etc). I like that it increases alch’s survival chances early game but there’s a high chance it will overwhelm BD with less healers at the start of the match.</p>
<p>From evil perspective, head hunter is a valuable ally since prince is one of his targets and initial evil are by default not of royal blood. This beats the point of an unbiased neutral killer (a sorc with no inq).</p>
<p>Deadfall trap: A nod to poacher. But can you tell me a scenario where headhunter uses this ability over “On the hunt”? I can’t think of any.</p>

            <p>You’re completely right, I edited it to make more sense, could also make another form of trap instead of dead-fall trap where the trap just poisons them (or makes them bleed)</p>
<p>The initial idea of it just killing visitors could also work, allowing investigative classes to be severely punished, though I can understand it can be a waste with the night immunity.</p>

            <p>could work, I was thinking of other day abilities, but it’s hard to think of stuff that just doesn’t blatantly say “OH THIS GUY IS THE HEADUNTER”. I’m still a bit hesitant on Toxic dart as the headhunter already has two pretty powerful night abilities. Could maybe shift the dart into a night ability, but it then removes the ability for the headhunter to have a solid way of defending himself if need be. (where other nks usually have a very powerful way of diverting investigative classes). At least toxic dart itself adds more confusion to the game (early game people could believe it’s unseen game instead of cult or people in unseen games would think assassin is being super active on his day abilities).</p>

            <p>Sorry , but this is horribly weak.</p>
<p>His only day ability , his only form of killing , can be solved  by claiming poisoned , and having a healer sort it out.</p>

            <p>Neutral Killer</p>
<p>Goal: Must kill all royal bloods to win</p>
<p>Passives:</p>
<p>Jungle adaptation: Immune to being Occupied and killed at night (Prince execution still surpasses). Also Immune to bleeding and poison.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: Toxic Dart (3 uses): Poison a targeted player, they will die in 3 nights.<br>
D1: They will be able to talk and vote as usual.<br>
D2: Still alive, but behave similarly to a reaped body.<br>
D3: They will be incurable at this point and die the next night.</p>
<p>I decided 3 nights for sake of balance with my ideas, though I understand it can be a bit too long and if there is an active healer, it is essentially pointless.</p>
<p>Day Ability 2: Subtle Intimidation (2 uses): If being voted, target a player to rescind their vote for the day, they will be able to vote others, but will not be able to vote you up again. (This will give you away, but</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: On the hunt (infinite uses): Behead a player, killing them. (will not bypass healing, imprisonment or night immunities) If target was a royal blood, gain another charge of toxic dart.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Deadfall trap (2 uses): Lay down a lethal trap outside someone’s house, if they leave tonight, kill them.</p>
<p>Lore: Once a loyal hunter for the king, he was sent on a mission to a far away land in hopes of finding hidden tracks of the Unseen Mastermind. What he was not told was that he was going on a suicide mission, for the Royal blood found his skills far too dangerous if he was ever to be converted. For weeks he spent in the jungle, he found nothing, but vast green canopies in the sky and the vivacious lifestyles of the native wildlife. Eventually, the hunter gave up, trying to track his marked path to home, he quickly discovered that his tracks were no longer to be found. He was being followed, but not by any beast.</p>
<p>“Little far away from home are we?”, bellowed a voice, in a sympathetic, but almost mocking tone.</p>
<p>The hunter turned around to see what he was looking for; the mastermind, a man of many faces, but no faces at the same time. The hunter fell to his knees, knowing that no matter how great his strengths, his soul was now unwillingly surrendered to the great mastermind. The mastermind was aware of the hunter’s mission, fulfilling the rage within the hunter and slowly convincing him to the path of the unseen. The mastermind then slowly reached out to the hunter, closing his eyes, the hunter could sense the power from that one finger, eager to claim its prize, but the anticipation felt like an eternity. Suddenly, the horrific feeling vanished and a loud scream was heard. The hunter opened his eyes and noticed his bear companion’s fresh carcass on-top of the mastermind’s struggling body.</p>
<p>Knowing this was his opportunity, the hunter fled, with fear enveloping his body, but with a vengeance to strike down the royal blood. He returned to the village outside Castle Adiart, changing his identity entirely, he renounced himself as a hunter, instead proud-fully entitling himself as a vengeful Headhunter.</p>
<p>Comments: Hard core nerded out here, I was super bored and even though I’m aware there’s a lot of NK ideas right now, I felt like there is none that actually have any specific goals than to kill all major factions.</p>
