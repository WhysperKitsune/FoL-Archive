            <p>I’m personally not convinced that Butler is weak. You can already stop a kill even if you aren’t sure you did, not to mention blocking other members of the Cult/Unseen/Reaper.</p>
<p>And the power to kill the King is huge. It might be worth more if always worked, though.</p>

<p>Well, you’d still be aware of prevention. And if you aren’t sure, you can occupy them again.</p>

<p>Killer. Not plural. Without the check you only can find the Assassin/CL except in reaper games. And in reaper games you might just die anyway if he empowers.</p>

            <p>Prince doesn’t really fit into any category tbh. The only thing Imprison doesn’t function as is Investigation.</p>
<p>With Drunk you’re still gonna try and find killers.</p>
<p>As Butler, you can still look for patterns in the attacks and who you occupy, for one. And in addition you have Party to protect yourself.</p>

            <p>Just like how prince isn’t meant to protect. The secondary uses of an ability is still valid. Since it encourages interesting play (AKA: Not sitting there doing nothing) it is good that it is there.</p>

<p>Hunter is great as is imo. I always save bears if I’m not trying to bait. Hunter is a gambling role in certain ways - it’s great to have bears later on.</p>

            <p>It’s okay now.</p>
<p>But the claim space should be a priority, even if we have to tweak Hunter to do so.</p>
<p>I feel like it could work with 2 bears.</p>

            <p>Okay true, but on the topic of Hunters, I just feel that they wield too much power when more than one, but is a perfectly balanced class as it is right now, which is why I felt that Hunters should remain as the current class.</p>

            <p>Hunter to King:</p>
<p>Defense: Bear and Guards.</p>
<p>Offense: Wolf and Order Execution</p>
<p>Their abilities serve the same purpose.</p>

            <p>Well there’s different leaders. King is a constantly open leader.</p>
<p>Hunters are offensive leaders, taking on the role of leader during the day,</p>
<p>while Princes, MM, CL, etc. are secretive leaders, having the actual influence and power of their faction.</p>

            <p>Just saying, usual King or Prince is leader, not Hunter, since he can be converted.</p>
<p>I don’t think Hunter even should be a leader, even if bears suggest it is their purpose.</p>
<p>I suppose it could stay unique, but it would really help the claim space if it wasn’t.</p>

            <p>The issue isn’t with the hunter but with the assassin’s fear of a hunter being the leader.</p>
