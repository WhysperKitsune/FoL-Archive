    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Ritualist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-ritualist/2920</link>
    <description>&gt; I can feel their blood coursing through my veins... I feel their warmth on every part of my skin... Mithras... Corax.. My saviors...

Once a normal man, the Ritualist used to spend his time caring for his family. He was a loving husband and father, and he kept them safe and well-cared for. 

One day, the man got into a fight with one of the members of the court, and ended up killing them. Stunned, the man ran from home, secluding himself so he wouldn&#39;t be persecuted. There, the Cult Leader found him, and promised him a life of luxury and safety from being executed, if he offered himself up to both Corax and Mithras. Seeing no other option, the man accepted.

Now, the Ritualist is dedicated to showing everyone the light of Corax and Mithras. He&#39;s lost everyone he knows, his family is gone, but they will soon see. **They** will prevail. Soon.. **_everyone_** will see...

**_The Ritualist lays down on the altar as the Cult Leader raises his knife. Smiling, the Ritualist is content with the life he&#39;s lived, and happy to have served Corax and Mithras. He just can&#39;t wait to see them._**

**_And the knife is plunged into his chest._**</description>

            <p>Not very long. Like I said, basic little drafts of my ideas. The 2h gap between Apostle and Invoker was me roleplaying on discord.</p>

<p>I am a dedicated man to the lore life. I wrote history of the cult (God Help Me) This is not a body paragraph for lore. It set up a exposition then in 3 sentences jumps to the climax.</p>
