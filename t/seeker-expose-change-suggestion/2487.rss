    <title>Seeker Expose Change Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/seeker-expose-change-suggestion/2487</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t be alone when I say the first time I used the Expose ability on the seeker, I saw &quot;The Prince isn&#39;t planning to jail anyone tonight&quot; because I hadn&#39;t used it later in the day. I suggest that the ability be changed to show who the Prince **ends up** jailing, instead of who he plans to jail at that exact moment. So, when you use expose, it will say something like &quot;You will spy on the Jail, checking to see who is jailed tonight&quot; or something to that degree, and at the end of the day, tell you who is jailed. It does take away from the fact that you could alert the other cult members through whispers on who is being jailed, but it makes it a more user-friendly ability, in my opinion. What do you think?</description>

            <p>… not to mention that this can be countered by simply waiting until the last seconds as Prince</p>
