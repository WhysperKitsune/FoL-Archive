            <p>Somebody suggested this already, but I forgot who and where.  Anyway, the suggestion was to change possessed people to the Possessor’s team, to keep them quiet in dead chat.  I liked this suggestion alot and would love to see it implemented.</p>

            <p>Yeah, King is the most difficult challenge for Possessors, but it’s really a combination of many problems.</p>
<p>I suggested giving the Possessor the ability to ‘mimic’ some of the abilities of the class he’s possessing a while back.  It would be interesting if he could mimic Butler poison when possessing a Butler, among other things.</p>

            <p>The point is, unlike the prince, psychc, u can always get a new king, so if u dont kill him when there are 4 players left you are screwed, and its not even up to you if you can do it or not.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I agree that a weak endgame is a much bigger problem for the psychic.  But the psychic is part of it.  Realistically, for a Possessor to win, you must have <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> of the following die before the last few nights:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The King.  He executes you 1v1, and you can’t get through his guards if he has any left.  This is the biggest problem because the Possessor no innate way to kill a king who guards or who gets protected, and with starting kings starting with 6 guards and new ones having 4, with little else to spend their actions on, it is very common for there to be a guarding king every single night for the entire game.  Possessors pretty much have to hope the king randomly dies when the population is too low to elect a new one, hope the king happens to have no guards at that point, or hope for a hail-mary and get elected themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Prince.  You can kill him, unlike the King, but it’s still near-guaranteed loss if you reach the endgame with him still alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Psychic.  You can’t jump while he’s still alive without getting rapidly lynched, and not jumping before the endgame will get you killed by any competent court because you won’t be able to facelift to convince people the NK is dead and won’t have a credible claim that can pass a court looking for the NK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The majority of the Cult / Unseen.  You can survive having one alive, but if two or more live to the endgame you are almost certainly screwed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of things that have to line up perfectly for a Possessor to have a shot at victory.  And this doesn’t even guarantee their win, it’s just the bare minimum they need to have any realistic hope at all.  Even if all these people die, the remaining court can very easily get lucky and catch them - Butlers, Drunks, Princesses, Observers, and more all have ways of catching a Possessor, while Knights and Hunters can get you when you try to jump.  Those are more “reasonable” dangers that any evil faces, but they’re on top of all the must-deal-with problems listed above.</p>
<p>For comparison, the Reaper pretty much bypasses all endgame problems through the combination of reaping + chill, plus they can empower-reap to get the king if necessary (and they can do it a turn earlier than everyone else because even if everyone realizes he’s reaped, there’s still a one-day delay before they get to replace him.)</p>
<p>While the Sorcerer, of course, doesn’t have to kill the other evils and can rely on their numbers to win the endgame.</p>
<p>So while the king is the major problem, the Psychic is still a contributing factor in that they add another layer to the <span class="bbcode-i">long</span> list of stuff that has to shake out perfectly for a Possessor victory.</p>

            <p>This is not the posessor problem, just kill the psychic before you posess.</p>
<p>The posessor problem is that even when he kill the whole court, he can’t kill the king in any way and he lose to the king on 1vs1</p>

            <p>Another possibility would be to make it so Possess silences the person you possess while they’re in the dead chat, possibly just until the end of the next night.  Granted, that might make them more likely to just leave, which is bad mechanically (such a vital thing shouldn’t depend on whether they sit through the tedium of a silent night.)</p>
<p>Of course, if they’re silenced permanently and we suppress leaving messages for dead people, it doesn’t matter.  That would work.</p>

            <p>It comes after but it heals the target if they are dead when being possessed. This means that order exe will kill him before he can jump but if the king exe’s his target he will jump into them and the king will fail to exe them.</p>

            <p>Also, does Possess come before or after other kills?</p>
<p>If it doesn’t, it would be a nice minor buff.</p>

<p>Readding the priest and moving call the dead back to her would help. That would make it not an instant loss but rather just another factor to keep in mind.</p>

            <p>Don’t use possess willy nilly. Possess is a last resort tactic to buy you extra time. Be careful using it.</p>
<p>To be honest, as long as Call of the Dead exists, there is no solution to this “problem.”</p>
<p>At the very least, wait until Psychic is dead.</p>
