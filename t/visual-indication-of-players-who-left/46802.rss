    <title>Visual Indication of Players who Left</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/visual-indication-of-players-who-left/46802</link>
    <description>If a player leaves the game it would be nice to have some sort of visual status indication on the player list.

An icon, color, font style change, something.

I know it says it in the chat box but it&#39;s hard to keep track with people coming and going.

It would also be consistent with the visual language of the rest of the game.</description>

<p>Correct, I think that clarifies it for Shrimpy</p>

            <p>If someone dies and it says they left the game right away it would indicate they are not a poss jump.  Actually it’s like that now.  That encourages metagaming, or am I misunderstanding completely what you’re saying?</p>

            <p>What? I’m talking about when people disconnect.</p>
<p>It will say in the chat</p>
<p>[3] Somebody has left the game.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was a visual indication of this on the list of players.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about showing people who are dead/reaped/etc.</p>

            <p>No no, this is a terrible idea.  We don’t want to know if players left the game until and unless they died because of leaving the game.  Otherwise we would be able to know that the person on trial is the last evil when all the dead evils leave game, or that the dead guy was not a poss jump because he left the game.</p>
