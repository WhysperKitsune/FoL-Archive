    <title>Chilled target can see its own trollbox</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/chilled-target-can-see-its-own-trollbox/38066</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was chilled by reaper as king and a fool trollboxed me, but I saw the trollboxed message myself.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Trollbox target is not supposed to see the trollboxed message

#### Steps to reproduce:
Chill a target as reaper (I don&#39;t know if being Evil King matters or not here), then use the throllbox ability on the chilled target (don&#39;t know if it&#39;s different for Fool and Scorned). And the chilled target will see the trollboxed message in chat.
