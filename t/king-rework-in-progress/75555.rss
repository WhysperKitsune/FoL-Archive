            <p>Give me a reason why it should give a immunity message.<br>
because I clearly canâ€™t think of one</p>
<p>This just solves metas where assassin and evil king works together or confirms a gk itâ€™s a lot more easier this way without it getting messy or broken.</p>

            <p>Too confirmable my ass. Chronomancer is considered a good fake claim even with the ability to reliably get a unique notification with bleed.</p>

            <p>Too confirmable so no.</p>
<p>Otherwise you want the old meta when GK saves prince it confirms it.</p>
<p>Obviously guards should be silent limited protection so it gives a excuse for not protecting prince all the time.</p>
