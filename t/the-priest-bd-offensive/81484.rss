            <p>To address everything although yes you can have 4 unseen, the <strong>The Soulcatcher</strong> is mainly useless, so giving another unseen member there abilities back isn’t that overpowered considering you still have the voting power of 3 unseen.</p>
<p>Yes  you can only talk to the wisp this is to prevent metagaming, the reason you can talk to them is basically just to tell them who to target.</p>
<p>An Occupation changes the game so yes you will be told if it  succeeds though if prevented you will gain no info.</p>
