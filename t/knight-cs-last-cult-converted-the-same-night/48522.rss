    <title>Knight cs last cult+converted the same night</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/knight-cs-last-cult-converted-the-same-night/48522</link>
    <description>I just lose a game when I was a knight and basicly csed the whole cult, just to be converted to the cult the same night I csed the last cult leader.

I think that when a knight cs the cult leader he should not be able to get converted. 
I don&#39;t mind that others wiill get converted on that night.

Basicly, it doesn&#39;t even make sense: 
1.If the knight kill the cult leader first, the cult leader can&#39;t convert him.
2.if the cult leader convert first, the knight won&#39;t kill his &quot;brother&quot;</description>

            <p>One suggestion I made a while back, which I still think is good, is to award people a bit more at the end of the game if they were converted from the winning side to the losing side immediately before the game ended.  For instance:</p>
<p>If you’re converted from the winning side to the losing side and the game ends the very next day, you get 65 coins.  If it ends the next night, you get 55 coins.  Otherwise you get the usual losing 45.</p>
<p>(You would still get more coins for winning in all cases, so you’re still incentivized to help your new team and not gamethrow.  But this somewhat reduces the sting of being converted to the losing side when it’s too late to do anything.  And I think it’s intuitively “fair”, since if you were only converted right before the game ended, you probably played well and did stuff to help the winning team.)</p>

            <p>Let’s not add arbitrary really detailed rules, because you got converted into a loss once. As you said it happens really rarely regardless and how would this function against MM? And Hunter should have the same protection for wolfing CL?</p>

            <p>It’s not a situation that happen every night. its happen once in 100 games.<br>
Im not talking about when the knight cs the invoker or somthing, but when he cs the cult leader, he shoudn’t be converted.</p>

            <p>The problem here is that the game is based around conversion. To make it not based on conversion, we’d have to redo the whole game. Besides, it is what makes this game different, along with the King.</p>
<p>The basis on conversion is probably a downside, but it is key to the game, and we’d have to make infinite arbitrary restrictions to avoid this, and it would make the game worse.</p>

            <p>I agree with your thoughts, but at the core of Throne of Lies conversion is a big part if it. So I feel when you are converted as knight it is part of the game, you may not like it, but it is part of the game. So I disagree with your suggestion.</p>

            <p>Well in the princess case, i think the Wisp shoudn’t show anything.</p>
<p>In the knight case, i think he should be convert immune when he cs the cult leader, because otherwise he will become a convert target and knight claims are bad enough…</p>
<p>This is not about balancing the game, because this situation happens once in 100 games, its more about rewarding the knight for killing the right targets, and not reward him with being converted to a loss.</p>

            <p>I think that having conversion prevent you from taking actions that would be catastrophic to your new side is fair enough (and avoids putting players in slightly awkward situations where they’re going to feel intense pressure to gamethrow.)</p>
<p>A comparable case is that a Princess who gets converted on a night where she uses a Willo will, currently, omit the Mastermind’s visit from the willo report that their target receives - otherwise Princesses would feel massive pressure not to willo when they fear they’re about to be converted.</p>
