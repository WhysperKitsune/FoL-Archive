    <title>Bug with inq loading late to game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-with-inq-loading-late-to-game/74182</link>
    <description>#### What happened? I loaded late to game D2 and it told me heathen classes were assassin, alchoholic and chrono

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? Should have told me heathen starting classes, so drunk instead of alchoholic

#### Steps to reproduce: Have heathen converted N1 and inq load into game D2

#### Comments: to be exact I loaded into the game on the last second of N1, I did see my night skills by flash. Here is pricture of chat

            <p>The game does an auto detect what classes your targets are when you load in, so since you loaded in D2 and a person was converted, when it was checking classes, it gave you those results</p>

            <p>It wasn’t a bug with the converted classes, it was a old bug with loading in</p>
<p>I had one game where we loaded in D2  and it counted it as D1</p>
<p>And D1 counted as D0</p>
<p>Still is weird though</p>
