    <title>Suggestion: More Engaging King Mechanics</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-more-engaging-king-mechanics/40239</link>
    <description>Having seen the latest patch notes, it looks like starting kings are in a pretty weird spot without Allies.

My suggestion is to give each player a day ability allowing them to request an audience with the king at night. The king is shown a list of requests during the day and is given until the end of the day to accept requests. While in the King&#39;s court, players can freely speak to everyone else in attendance, like the evil faction&#39;s night phase.

The idea behind this suggestion is to add more gameplay around the king -- the king can use these secret meetings to attempt to identify allies at the risk of revealing his own faction.

A couple of additional thoughts:
* A night ability for the King that gives some form of investigative feedback (e.g. 1 charge of observer&#39;s follow on all guests) would greatly enhance the depth of strategy around attending these meetings.
* Manipulating how guests can visit the king may also prove interesting (guests can&#39;t attack the king? the king can&#39;t guard himself from guests?).
* Players in attendance and their names should probably be clearly visible to limit the power of identifying a killer allied with your faction and inviting them to every meeting.

Even if these changes don&#39;t seem like a good fit for the King, I feel the ideas here could prove a solid foundation for an entirely new class as well.</description>

            <p>I think this basic idea of the King having an audience with people is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!</p>

            <p>First off. The core idea sounds great. I do however feel like it might not work like what you suggested but that’s besides the point.</p>

<p>Straight up no. We do not want a repeat of Ally’s. The closest thing I would accept is Snoop and that’s social.</p>

<p>That’s actually really interesting. I prefer the idea that Kings guards don’t protect from guest’s rather than the other way around. That would add lots of depth to everyone involved.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this one too but I don’t think it will accomplish your goal. He would just do it anyway and make sure there are protectives (the king could just do it himself) on them.</p>
<p>The reason I feel it would have to work differently than you suggested is that the interface is designed to have up to 2 day Ability’s and they shouldn’t put in that much work for just one class even if it is the King.</p>
<p>My suggestion is making it an unlimited use night Ability (instead of Order) that lets you select as meny people as you want. All of them will be notified that the king wants to invite them to the audience and they can select yes or no. No one who selects yes can Investigate or protect anyone else in the audience. The king will not find out who said yes until the night where he can talk to them.</p>

            <p>I was more playing off the idea that with no Allies, kings will be auto exe’d every day. This gives a chance for an obs or sheriff, let’s say, to feed info to the king and have them act on it. If they don’t act on it it might make them suspicious. make it too powerful though and it tips the scale though.</p>
<p>Still a good idea worth exploring.</p>

            <p>It needs to be more powerful than this – this suggestion would make the ability a weaker version of Private Matter that the target has to agree to at the cost of their night abilities.</p>

            <p>I like the idea going in this direction. It is thematic. I would say that only one could be in attendance, and they forfeit their night abilities. Kind of like being jailed by the prince. Just less hostile. So if someone really has some info they want to share, but do not want to out themselves during the day. This might help that person confirm or almost confirm the king’s alliance.</p>
