    <title>The Jouster / The Duelist</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-jouster-the-duelist/75390</link>
    <description>This might be a dumb idea for reasons I&#39;m not yet aware of but hope you enjoy reading anyway.

&gt;# [color = &quot;steblue&quot;]The Jouster[/color]
&gt;**[color = &quot;steblue&quot;]Blue Dragon Killer[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Joust (Day Ability) -** Use the next trial to play a game of rock–paper–scissors (**execute–pardon–abstain**) with a player of your choice.  They receive an automated whisper from you like this, [color = &quot;pink&quot;]&quot;**I CHALLENGE YOU!**&quot;[/color]
&gt;- **Draw:** Be immune to their attack tonight.
&gt;- **Victory:** Attack them, bypassing immunity.
&gt;- **Defeat:** They are forced to attack you. *This is in addition to their normal night ability, and they are not notified.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Strike (Night Ability) -** If your target attacks you, attack them back. **(2 uses)**
&gt;
&gt;**Parry (Night Ability) -** Be immune to your target&#39;s attack. **(2 uses)**
&gt;
&gt;*You will lose all charges of Joust if you kill a Blue Dragon player.*

How does this work?  Say you use your **Joust** ability on someone during the day.  As soon as the next trial begins, they will receive a whisper from you warning them that they are being challenged to a joust.  
 - If you both vote the same way, it&#39;s a draw.
- Whoever votes **exe** (rock) beats the one who votes **abs** (scissors).
- Whoever votes **pard** (paper) beats the one who votes **exe** (rock).
- Whoever votes **abs** (scissors) beats the one who votes **pard** (paper).

&gt;# [color = &quot;E633FF&quot;]The Duelist[/color]
&gt;**[color = &quot;E633FF&quot;]Unseen Killer[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Duel (Night Ability) -** Attack a player, but force them to attack you also unless they are occupied. *This is in addition to their normal night ability, and they are not notified.* **(Infinite uses)**
&gt;
&gt;**Rebound (Night Ability) -** Attack a player who has helped vote an Unseen player up to the stand, but didn&#39;t vote execute. **(2 uses)**

Obviously to win a duel you have to play dirty by convincing someone to heal you.  Rebound is supposed to punish sheep who mindlessly hop on random bandwagons.  Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be good at accomplishing that, I&#39;m not sure.</description>

            <p>The problem with Pirate is it’s pure rock-paper-scissors.  All luck and no skill.</p>
<p>How is exe-pard-abs unintuitive?  It’s the same game but renamed.</p>
<p>BTW I was just looking at ToS classes and I came up with this class after reading about the Pirate.</p>

            <p>This seems super unintuitive, and I think that’s the largest problem</p>
