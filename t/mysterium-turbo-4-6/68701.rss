    <title>Mysterium Turbo (4/6)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mysterium-turbo-4-6/68701</link>
    <description>## Welcome to Mysterium: A co-op game where you must figure out the mystery of a poor soul’s death! One lucky player will die and become a ghost while the rest are Mystics who can communicate with said ghost through a séance! You have seven hours until the ghost loses communication with the Mystics and be locked out of heaven forever!
### Note: there will be some differences between my and poisoned&#39;s game in how it is ran, but for the most part it should remain the same, gameplay wise. Because of this, I will direct you to [Poisoned&#39;s Game&#39;s Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/mysterium-fm-edition-7-7-hour-1/68658), and I will just list the differences here
[details=Or alternatively they&#39;re copy/pasted here]
Welcome to Mysterium: A co-op game where you must figure out the mystery of a poor soul’s death! One lucky player will die and become a ghost while the rest are Mystics who can communicate with said ghost through a séance! You have seven hours until the ghost loses communication with the Mystics and be locked out of heaven forever!

Rules
Each turn equals an hour on the clock, you have seven hours to solve the mystery of the ghost’s murder or you lose the game. Once all the Mystics have gotten at least one vision card from the ghost, each mystic has 48 hours to figure out which of them has which location/suspect/weapon out of the eight of said locations/suspects/weapons given. No mystic has the same location/suspect/weapon. Once time is up or all mystics have made a final decision, the host will reveal which choices are correct or wrong. The mystics that have guessed correctly will move on to the next phase. However, the mystics that have guessed wrong will remain on their current phase. The phase order is as follows: Location -&gt; Suspect -&gt; Weapon. If all the Mystics complete the weapon phase within seven hours, then the final phase will be played out. In the final phase, three visions will be shown to all the Mystics to help figure which Mystic’s set is the true event. Whichever set has the most votes is the overall final choice. If the final choice is correct, then everyone wins, if not, the ghost will not be able to rest in peace and everyone will lose.

Roles
**Ghost:** As a ghost, you cannot talk to the mystics, instead, you must use cards containing abstract art to communicate with them. Through DMs, the host will send seven vision cards and a list of what location, suspect, and weapon each Mystic has. In DMs, you must tell the host which card or cards you want to send to which mystic. Once you send cards to a mystic, you cannot send them more or change what you sent until the next turn. When you have less than seven cards, you will be given more cards till the amount reaches seven. You can discard any amount of cards three times throughout the whole game, so use them wisely.
**Mystic:** You are part of a group of other Mystics that must use the cards given by the ghost to figure out which Mystic has which location/suspect/weapon. When the ghost hands you a card or a set of cards, the host will send you them through a DM, you can show the other Mystics your cards to help you figure out what you are looking for. No Mystic has the same location/suspect/weapon, so think of your choices carefully. If you guess correctly, you get to move on to the next phase. If you guess wrong, you have to stay in your current phase and guess again. If you have gone through all the phases and some other Mystics are having trouble, you can still help them out.
[/details]
# Differences
### The main differences are as follows:
- The round timers are *much* shorter, befitting a turbo. Specifically, each round you will have 1 minute to make a decision as to what you think your vision cards apply to, possibly 2 depending on how quickly you guys go. The total game time will be about 30 mins to an hour
- The phase order is instead Suspect -&gt; Location -&gt; Weapon
- Instead of using descriptions of the suspects/locations/weapons, their pictures will be publicly revealed
- Because i cannot pm people all at once, vision cards will be flipped publicly
- *I am the ghost,* as I am already drawing cards. Technically, I will hydra being the ghost with @PoisonedSquid, my effective cohost
- You can vote on other whether you think people&#39;s guesses are right or wrong, before the time runs out. you have 6 tokens, 3 correct tokens and 3 incorrect tokens. If you vote right (an incorrect token on someone who guessed wrong or a correct token on someone who guessed right) then you gain a Clairvoyance point. you can use as many or as few as you want in a round, however once you vote (whether you are right or wrong), the tokens you voted with are used up. you do get all your voting tokens back at the beginning of the 4th and 7th rounds (i.e. you use the 6 tokens for 3 rounds of guessing/voting before getting them back). these points will be useful at the end of the game, which i can explain later, but know that more is better and that they are important in determining whether we win or not.

Sorry for the wordy post. I think thats all the big differences (there are probably more but those can be covered when they come up or if someone asks about it

---

Preferably this will happen tomorrow, Friday, but if that cant happen it may need to be postponed significantly
