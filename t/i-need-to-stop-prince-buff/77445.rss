Please. Tell me this is a terrible buff.

(Just so you know. I hide information for evils in the right side of my book. Perhaps this will help the boy)</description>

            <p>I think Prince right now needs a rework rather than a buff.<br>
The only thing Prince has going for it right now is an unconvertable, empowered, provable Knight that occupies. That isn’t fun in the slightest. What is the point of jailing someone if everyone posts their logs anyways in day chat?</p>

            <p>like Mystic always has and always will fit the bill<br>
it’s not as obscenely strong or limiting as Prince, it has cool abilities, there are many different strategies you can do with it, and most of all it’s nowhere near as strong</p>
<p>I’d be perfectly willing to go forward with Mystic as the central design element rather than Prince.</p>

            <p>That’s not because it’s too weak, or that it’s not receiving investigative results. Neccecarily, you’re getting new info each night.</p>
<p>The reason I’ve seen people think Prince is boring is actually because almost all of Prince’s power comes from it just existing and going by the numbers, occasionally killing a lock wolf or a <em>shudders</em> Fool or two, rather than being allowed to make any remotely ambitious plays.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s because Prince is too strong.</p>

            <p>The point is that you’re buffing a role that needs to be nerfed simply for design health by giving it something that just annoys wolves with particular habits and causes people to lose through the game suddenly making their habits a method of losing the game, which is objectively bad design.</p>

            <p>So what? I’ve seen many many wolves who put two logs in their logbooks for different scenarios, and all this ability does is force those wolves to change their habits. It dosen’t actually impact the balance of the game much beyond that.</p>

            <p>The problem is that Prince already has this ability, and the fact that you’ve codified it as an ability does nothing but remove the wolves’ ability to place multiple logs in their logbook without sacrificing the right side of it, which is more annoying than useful.</p>

            <p>If i can say. Prince is very important. If we remove him. Bd will not stand a chance. Giving him this night ability. Might be helpful depending on situation</p>

            <p>If we remove Prince then we can move the power he once had and redistribute it amongst the other BD, most notably by buffing Princess and Physician.</p>
<p>I’m not saying we can just give the game a Subregulusectomy and then leave it at that, but if the game was redesigned slighty to not be balanced entirely around the BD keeping the Prince alive it would open huge amounts of design space.</p>

            <p>But what if we removed Prince and stopped having an absolutely confirmable overpowered role in the game? Just food for thought.</p>
<p>It’d make balancing the game a way easier job, that’s for sure.</p>
