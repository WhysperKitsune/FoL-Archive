    <title>What makes a &quot;worthless&quot; king?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-makes-a-worthless-king/10130</link>
    <description>There are 2 reasons a king gets executed. Suspected of being evil and being &quot;worthless&quot; because 4/4 times he investigated a BD. 

The latter is not a reason the king should be executed, but unfortunately it is a lot. 

I would never find a king that doesn&#39;t find leads himself worthless. IMO opinion I don&#39;t care what the king finds. A good king that I want to keep around isn&#39;t somebody who can get lucky and find unseen at night. It&#39;s the king that is talking to people all day. Asking for leads, getting people fired up, collecting and putting together the pieces of info he collects in whispers. Delegating tasks to his subjects to try to win the game. 

If you have a king who is talking and working and thinking and getting everybody involved, but not finding unseen at night, and not executing somebody every day just because somebody has a hunch, he&#39;s the best kind of king, don&#39;t kill him. (Unless he&#39;s evil. Then kill him)</description>

            <p>One thing i noticed is the King often gets blame for everything. Examples:</p>
<p>Some dude claims sheriff and says 2 is evil. The person flips BD. EVIL KING</p>
<p>Some dude is insanely sus and everyone ask for his head. King gives in and gets that sus person executed. the person flips BD. EVIL KING</p>

            <p>A good king player should be reading enough to find a scum in at least 1 of 4 checks.</p>
<p>Seriously tho. Not finding scum in 4 checks is a big achievment.</p>

            <p>A King should be leading the court.  Using allies and hoping to ping an unseen/cult is part of that, but no means all of it.</p>
<p>Even if the King never finds an evil, he can eliminate suspects to narrow down who the investigative classes need to check.  He should be voting people up to get their roles, forcing conversation, and not letting BD sit and wait to be picked off.  If it’s day 4 and no one is talking and no votes are going out, then the King is worthless.  Not because he didn’t get any hits off allies, but because he’s not directing the conversation and gathering information.</p>
