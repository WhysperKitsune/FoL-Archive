          <p>While the game is enjoyable to play as of version 1.12, I have some suggestions:</p>
<p><strong>King</strong><br>
I know it is in the guide, but putting the 65%-35% in class description as well would be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemist</strong><br>
Should be able to target the King with both potions. They are neutrals, give them some more freedom to act.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic</strong><br>
They are very bland right now. A Prince-light. I know many don’t want back ’talk to dead’ because it was such a hard counter to evils (Possessor mainly). And I think I agree with that. Being able to talk to dead players decreases the impact of dying. But I also see many dedicated players in dead chat wishing they’d have a little extra to do. Games feel a lot less impactful right now. Dead? Onto the next game!<br>
Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Mystic unique</li>
<li>Remove Link Minds</li>
<li>Give Conduit 5 uses</li>
<li>Change (or clarify?) Private Matter: … hidden from the public (including from Nobles using Maid Spy).</li>
<li>Add night-time ability: Séance (3 uses): Select any BD member that died this game. He/she will get a selection of 3 premade ‘deathnotes’ to show the mystic. This selection of 3 will be from a collection of 20+ premade deathnotes. The dead BD member can show one or none of those 3 deathnotes. These notes won’t include numbers or texts, just drawings to interpret. If a dead BD member is targeted more than once, he/she gets a new set of 3 options to pick from each time. Yes, I know this suggestion is a stretch from a programming stance, but it would make communicating with the dead possible but less powerful and completely unique. This suggestion is inspired by the Mysterium board game btw. As a general quality of life measure: Upon dead, a BD member will be informed whether or not there is at least one Mystic active. (So he knows he can safely leave if there is none active)</li>

<p>Noble/Aristocrat/Apostle</p>
<p>I like the current Noble a lot. But Maid Spy shouldn’t be able to target ALL whispers. I have always been a huge advocate to bring the spying aspect back into the game, but seeing all whispers is a bit much. Suggestion: Make it target 2 players (King should be able to be targeted, Nobles are supposed to be close to the king after all). All whispers to and from these players would be shown. (To avoid confusion: Not just whispers between these two players, but all whispers to/from these two players)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I feel like this wouldnt do anything if it were to target the king. Most whispers are derived from the king/prince , so it would be just as useful to just have all whispers.</p>

<p>Court Wizard</p>
<p>In game people leaving alive are Court Wizards more often than any other class.</p>
<p>The Barrier and limited use tornado are a bit bland.</p>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<p>Ward (1 use): Makes the target night immune once until day 4. Upon using this ability a message that the target is warded will be shown to all current Unseen/Cult members and the Neutral Killer. Cannot target self or king. This ability should not be shown day 4 or later.</p>

<p>Mystic</p>
<p>They are very bland right now. A Prince-light. I know many don’t want back ’talk to dead’ because it was such a hard counter to evils (Possessor mainly). And I think I agree with that. Being able to talk to dead players decreases the impact of dying. But I also see many dedicated players in dead chat wishing they’d have a little extra to do. Games feel a lot less impactful right now. Dead? Onto the next game!</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>Remove conduit<br>
Change (or clarify?) Private Matter: … hidden from the public (including from Nobles using Maid Spy).<br>
Add night-time ability: Séance (3 uses): Select any BD member that died this game. He/she will get a selection of 3 premade ‘deathnotes’ to show the mystic. This selection of 3 will be from a collection of 20+ premade deathnotes. The dead BD member can show one or none of those 3 deathnotes. These notes won’t include numbers or texts, just drawings to interpret. If a dead BD member is targeted more than once, he/she gets a new set of 3 options to pick from each time. Yes, I know this suggestion is a stretch from a programming stance, but it would make communicating with the dead possible but less powerful and completely unique.

          <p>I completely missed that survey, thank you for mentioning it <a class="mention" href="../../u/cheesyknives.html">@CheesyKnives</a> !</p>
<p>And… The options listed there are SO much better than what I suggested here, that I (shamefully) withdrew my CW suggestion from my initial post.</p>
<p>As far as the Noble is concerned, you are right. I removed this suggestion as well. Why change what is so much fun right now <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png!v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>On the Mystic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduit is kinda nice come to think of it. My suggestion now includes giving it 5 uses and removing Link Minds instead. Link Minds is a jail with no uber-occu and no possibity to exe after all. Conduit is more unique.</li>
<li>About Séance: I think the concept itself s really easy to grasp. But what to make of it is highly subjective and not auto-useful at all. Which is the idea. Also, this requires a different type of skill than the deduction based reasoning that is required for most of the rest of this game, which I like. (in fact, these interpretations are not much dependant on IQ at all)</li>

<p>Mystic</p>
<p>They are very bland right now. A Prince-light. I know many don’t want back ’talk to dead’ because it was such a hard counter to evils (Possessor mainly). And I think I agree with that. Being able to talk to dead players decreases the impact of dying. But I also see many dedicated players in dead chat wishing they’d have a little extra to do. Games feel a lot less impactful right now. Dead? Onto the next game!</p>

<p>The reason Alchemist is unable to target King at all is due to A) Alchemists killing King and stepping up for guaranteed Neutral King and B) Not being able to heal for consistency (I assume at least lol)</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think that meta would really apply here. Alch has less bombs than king has guards and even if he could kill the king N1 every game it doesn’t make nearly as much sense to actually follow through with that meta.</p>
<p>With the NK meta it was a way to eliminate the NK without having to actually go through the trouble of finding him.</p>
<p>Here the alch is already on your side as much as he would as king. So voting the alch has no benefit compared to voting a royal or other BD. Especially when you consider that Killing someone doesn’t prove crap because all scum can kill.</p>
<p>That and the alch has no reason to do this either because simply working with a king and thus getting 4 guards AND 4 stoneskins while also not painting a target on your back is a good thing.</p>
<p>TLDR: Alch has no more chance of causing this meta any more than Butler does now.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I suppose it could be read that way, but my OP meant to say: The Alchemist should be able to arget the King with both potions… <em>as opposed to just the healing potion he is currently able to use on the King.</em></p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="../../u/solic.html">@Solic</a> and <a class="mention" href="../../u/nuclearburrito.html">@NuclearBurrito</a>: The king has plenty of counterplay now he has 6 guards and stepping up as Neutral isn’t all that powerful for reasons mentioned. Also note that ‘guaranteed neutral’ is in some cases an overstatement as well. And finally: Yes, the starting king can use OE on Alchemist, but trying to bomb the King is not the sole way of dealing with that threat. Offering the King assistance since you an win with him regardless of his alignment is also a decent move for an Alchemist.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/techwolves.html">@techwolves</a>: I know several people did not like the interaction with dead people because of the sheer impact it had on the game. The knowledge from dead people is extremely powerful. Still, there are also people that feel some limited assistance/interaction is a nice way to stay involved and emerged in a game even after you are killed off.</p>
<p>Also, I honestly don’t think my suggestion is that complex once implemented.</p>

          <p>question “Why remove dead people interactions from living abilities?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dead chat/interactions has always been random and unreliable. There’s no fun factor in forcing people to stay after dead to claim your gp. Died night 1? Still get some gp out of it without waiting til the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We now offer a % gp after the match ends if you left while dead, which discourages players to stay even-more if they don’t want to (most players left or afk’d immediately after death, anyway)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We want dead chat to be more of a spectate/optional thing than being a core part of the game. It’s one of those things that’s “cool at first”, but you realize very fast is both useless and frustrating~ for example, we couldn’t reward a % leaving while dead while these features existed.</p>

<p>TL;DR: We don’t want to hold your gp hostage by making you stay (if dead). Dead interactions were unreliable and too random (mostly bad-random). Died n1? np - quit, queue back up, get gp later when the old game ends.  What he said</p>

          <p>Thanks for linking the post.</p>
<p>I understand their reasoning and most likely they won’t follow up on my suggestion. But their decision was based on actual talking with living people after death and dead people acting as Death Knights. Both were extremely impactful and rather detrimental if no targets were available. That was indeed more like a hostage situation. What I’m suggesting is far less drastic. It is a very limited interaction with limited use. Séance is not where the strength of the Mystic lies. So not being able to use it, doesn’t impact the power level of the Mystic that much (you can’t outright communicate with dead people). Also, I think this unique way of communication could actually be an incentive for people to stay after they die.</p>
<p>I also wonder whether it is just coincidence that we see more people leaving while alive these days. Leaving once you’re dead makes you less invested in individual games. They tend to be more fast paced and less impactful. So less barrier for some to leave even while they are still alive (and don’t like their class or how things are going).</p>
<p>Lastly, I don’t think Mystic needs Link Minds if he/she already has Conduit. Being able to link 2 players with  potentially gives double the information each night. (as such players could give info to one another). And again, Conduit is far more unique then Link Minds, which is quite similar to jailing.</p>

          <p>I think it’s fine that he voices his need for death interaction in some way. Many of us still hold the same sentiment and if enough people speak up about it, the developers might change their mind about their current stance on it. I do agree that this form is needlessly complicated, but I honestly saw nothing wrong with the old incarnations of death interaction.</p>
