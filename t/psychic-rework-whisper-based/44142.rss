    <description>&gt; Psychic (Blue Dragon Social)
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Strong Will: You may use Private Matter and Telepathy in the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Private Matter: Your whispers are hidden from the public until you disable this, or the day ends. You may disable and re-enable Private Matter any number of times a day. Unlimited uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 2: Telepathy: Send an anonymous message to everyone. 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Read Mind: See all whispers to and from your target the next day. Unlimited uses.

&gt; Illusionist (Unseen Social)
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Strong Will: You may use Private Matter and Telepathy in the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Private Matter: Your whispers are hidden from the public until you disable this, or the day ends. You may disable and re-enable Private Matter any number of times a day. Unlimited uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 2: Telepathy: Send an anonymous message to everyone. 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Read Mind: See all whispers to and from your target the next day. Unlimited uses.

Notes: I have always felt Link Minds and Imprison are redundant abilities. This rework changes Psychic into a whisper based class, which makes it more unique, I think. Ideally the Noble would get Orange&#39;s Rework. [Link](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-noble-and-aristocrat-social/28119)</description>

            <p>Psychic doesn’t need to copy Prince. It can and should do its own thing. It doesn’t have to be private communication, but it seems logical to me.</p>

            <p>The only things that they have in common are being able to talk with the target.  Prince occupies the target, prevents visitors(which includes investigations and positive effects), and can kill the target.  Psychic has none of the downsides and allows the target to speak to the dead.</p>

            <p>Talking to the dead is useful, but I’d think it would be better in a class more dedicated to the dead, like Priest was. I have a suggestion for it <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/priest-blue-dragon-support-and-soulcatcher-unseen-support/43853/25">here</a>. I do agree Confessions is to weak, compared to current Psychic or Prince. Prince has anonymous speaking, and this would have whispers. Psychic already has Private Matter.</p>

            <p>Interrogation IS anonymous communication. That’s why the classes are too similar. Also Prince has better synergy, called execution. No need to rely on the other people. The shift to private communication will distinguish the Psychic as not similar to Prince, and also let Noble focus on vote manipulation. The differences are small enough between the classes that I think one has to change. And since Psychic already has the framework for a great whisper based class, it is the logical option.</p>

            <p>Psychic’s thing is anonymous communication. Princes thing is Interrogation. They may have similar uses but they also have many distinct ones. Especially when you consider the synergy linked minds has with telepathy. I consider psychic my favorite class right now and Prince is much lower on the list for this reason.</p>

            <p>It isn’t as powerful as essentially Standing Guard on them. Infinite uses too. While Psychic does have that unique advantage that Prince doesn’t have, it is still a redundant class. Would you like to have 2 slightly different versions of Princess, or any class? Anyways, the bit of difference isn’t worth having 2 princelike classes. It also sucks to be linked and jailed. I think Psychic can be a more unique and interesting class if we put focus into some of its other powers, instead of stubbornly sticking to a power Prince already does. Psychic should have its own thing, Prince should have his.</p>

            <p>What does butler have to do with this? I’m saying that the linked minds Ability to direct others is a BIG upside over Jail as it let’s every other class in the game be better without claiming to an unknown. Prince trying this either requires outing or taking 2 nights to do it.</p>

            <p>I’m saying Prince powers are greater than down sides. Butler’s also occupy random people. It’s the same with Prince. The investigation prevention is annoying, but it stops abilities, gets claims, and heals and stops conversion. It is easily better than link minds. It is even a contest.</p>

            <p>The thing is that link minds has a different utility set than Prince. Prince always jails to interagate and get information. Psychic link however also has the very important utility of informing others of what to do that night due to the fact that Psychic never Occupys them while Prince always does.</p>

            <p>I will undo Telepahy Nerf. I removed Call of the Dead, since I put that in my priest idea. I like this better as Psychic rework, sine I think Noble should be vote manipulator.</p>
