    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-killer-the-cutthroat/13575</link>
    <description>&gt;**The Cutthroat**
Neutral killing
**Passive: Spree**
If you successfully killed someone the previous night, you will be immune to death. If you successfully killed someone each night for the last 3 nights, you will be immune to occupation. If you successfully killed someone each night for the last 5 nights, you will be immune to visits.
**Passive: Criminal record**
Immune to death nights 1 and 2
**Night ability: Slay**
Kill your target. If you successfully killed someone  each night for the last two nights, this will bypass death immunity. If you successfully killed someone each night for the last four nights, you will kill your target and all their visitors.</description>

            <p>I’d say get rid of immunity-piercing attacks, because that basically makes it impossible to stop him after 3 kills in a row.  Or maybe make it an activated day ability (with limited uses)<br>
Keep the attack all visitors though, I think that’s nice</p>
