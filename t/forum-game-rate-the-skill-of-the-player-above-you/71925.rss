            <p>Would consider you to be in the top 5 players on this site.</p>
<p>Village play is solid, but still needs to work out some issue as you kind of just derp around.</p>
<p>Wolf play, eh, you stick way too close to your partners and your entrances as a wolf are just howlers. Would tone them down as you were effectively my first scumread in MUA 2019 because of how terrible your entrance there was.</p>
<p>EDIT: Lol, didn’t see the date.</p>

            <p>Truly a god amongst men.<br>
The best forum player, and moderator on this site without question. You inspire me everyday, and some day I hope to live up to your name. Some may say that your jokes fall flat and that your reads are off from time to time, but it’s all about the ideal. And you set one for all to follow by playing at such a high level that you fold in on your reads in pity for the mere mortals that stand in your presence.</p>

            <p>One of the sleeper best readers on the site. When they want to do well they utterly wreck the opposite team. Of course, their play is very inconsistent and they often get metaread as scum for the worst reasons on the planet (ex: trying is a scumtell?).</p>
<p>As a GM, there is only one tip I can give:</p>
<p><strong>Don’t give Margaret VT if you value your setup</strong></p>

            <p>Overall relatively good player. Tends to be a bit on the memey side and relatively easy to underestimate. However, could easily cause a number of mislynches as “town” leader. Isn’t as useful as town though.</p>

            <p>Actually</p>
<p>The way you go against the grain in reads could be used to gather reactions to further your reads</p>
<p>think of it as a elaborate reaction test where you purposefully have wrong reads to see people reactions</p>
