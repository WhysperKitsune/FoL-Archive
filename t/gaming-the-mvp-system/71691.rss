            <p>Perhaps someone who votes for 3 others gets an extra vote for themselves? You can still game the system by voting randoms, but there isn’t really a way to stop someone exploiting the system in some way for themselves.</p>

            <p>Yeah, there is a large incentive not to vote for anyone else at all if you want the gold. Inherent flaw in the system, I’d say.</p>
