    <description>The Maid, Faction BD, Type Support 
 
(Converted to the Maidservant)

Passive 1: Locked: if you don&#39;t leave you&#39;re house, the king will protect you by locking the door to you&#39;re house making players unable to visit you

Passive 2: Weak: poison and bleeding will make you die in 1 night

Day Ability 1: I&#39;m Royal: can only be used when there is a vote for a new king, this will give you royal blood and the ability to be king, 1 use only

Night Ability 1: Strength Cleaning: use this on the player and it will give him immunity to attacks and conversion and will make his attack/occupation/target change go through immunity

Night Ability 2: Wisdom Cleaning: clean a person from being bleeding/poisoning, unlimited uses, also you can use it on yourself

The Maidservant, Faction Unseen, Type Offensive 

Passive 1: Hidden: if you don&#39;t leave the unseen lair, the unseen will hide you preventing anyone from visiting you

Passive 2: Powerful: bleeding will take 3 nights to kill you.

Day Ability 1: I&#39;m Royal: can only be used when there is a vote for a new king, this will give you royal blood and the ability to be king, unlimited uses

Night Ability 1: Perfume: use perfume to remove all of the player&#39;s immunity, as well as that abilities that go through immunity like happy hour will not go through immunity, only lasts 1 night

Night Ability 2: Fake Cleaning: clean a person from being bleeding/poisoning but this will only make them live 1 day and make them think that they have been cured but then they die after that, unlimited uses

Lore: IDK I am not good with lore

Comments:
I think it&#39;s strange to have a butler but not a maid</description>

            <p>Why did we want to make a class that copies other class’ ability?</p>
<p>As I said it, maybe you should change the ability more.</p>

            <p>Yeah and what if prince/confirmed BD asks you to remove his vote? You’re going to randomly swap to your unseen buddy? Also if you or your unseen buddy die, it instantly outs the other person. It takes the most boring parts of CW and Phys and doesn’t add anything new. Healing is good and necessary, but you only have 2 uses of it and it is not extremely exciting if you don’t actually heal with it. “Smelly cleaning” is just a CW barrier if I understand it correctly, which is the more boring skill of the CW.</p>

            <p>Not really you’re faction can help you in a fake confirm<br>
example:<br>
Unseen dude: Hey you’re claiming maid right?<br>
Random Guy: I thought he was claiming maid<br>
Fake Maid: yes I’m claiming maid<br>
Random Guy: Knew it!!!<br>
Unseen dude: remove my vote<br>
Nighy: I am telling you that random guy is my target I’m a scorned<br>
Fake Maid: sure<br>
Unseen Guy: It’s true he really is maid!!!</p>
<p>Please explain why it doesn’t seem fun to play, instead of just saying does not seem fun to play?</p>
<p>also he does fit in one of the niches, it’s support, 2 of his abilities are support.</p>

            <p>Day Ability should be removed. That makes it instantly confirmable and we have enough of those classes. It doesn’t really fill any unique niches either and it does not seem very fun to play. Do not support.</p>
