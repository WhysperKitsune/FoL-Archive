    <title>The Cleric (Neutral Support)</title>

    <description>&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]The Cleric[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
**Neutral, Support.**
**Goal:** Survive
**Sanctuary (Passive)** - People trying to visit you cannot be occupied or redirected, and their visit will be hidden from investigators. If they are an attacker, their attack will bypass everything except visit prevention.
**Brotherhood (Passive)** - If you would be attacked at night, redirect the attack to one of your visitors except the attacker, bypassing redirection immunity. If only the attacker visits you, you will die.
**Blessing (Day)** - Select a player. If they visit you tonight they will get a blessing that lasts for two days. The blessing makes the player immune to conversion, hides their visits and makes them appear not suspicious to investigators. 2 uses. 
**Curse (Day)** - Select a player. If they don&#39;t visit you tonight they will get a curse that lasts for two days. The curse makes the player unable to talk or accuse anyone of treason. 2 uses.
**Circle of Healing (Night)** - Heal yourself and everyone that visits you tonight. Unlimited uses.

&gt; _Special mechanics and interactions:_
&gt; * _Your sanctuary passive only works on people that TRY to visit you. It will not work on people that are redirected into you by a court wizard or invoker. (Would be weird to make them redirect immune if they were already redirected into you...)_
&gt; * _However, brotherhood passive does work on all visitors, whether they try to visit you or are redirected by someone else._
&gt; * _While Circle of healing heals yourself as well, the Sanctuary passive makes attackers trying to visit you bypass everything including healing. This means you can only heal yourself from poison or bleeding with this ability._
&gt; * _Neither blessing or curse give a notification to the player when you use the ability. This makes cleric somewhat fake claimable (unless someone gets occupied while trying to visit you). This can also be used to convince people to visit you even if you didn&#39;t use any of your day abilities by making them think you did._</description>

            <p>Could be. But you don’t need for people to visit you every night. You could try to convince people to visit you on nights you feel like you might be attacked. You can whisper poisoned people to visit you so they are healed, ask an outed sheriff to visit you for conversion immunity, blackmail people into visiting you with curse. I mean, you could also make a deal with the unseen by blessing the mastermind so they appear as not suspicious for the next two nights.</p>

<p>Cleric wants to survive. To survive, cleric needs people to visit him. If cleric outs publicly, an assassin can decide to target him because: He gets a guaranteed kill on ANY of the cleric’s visitors. All visits to the cleric are hidden, so he doesn’t have to worry about observers either.</p>

            <p>Due to his Sanctuary passive, you cannot be healed from attacks: “People trying to visit you cannot be occupied or redirected, and their visit will be hidden from investigators. <strong>If they are an attacker, their attack will bypass everything except visit prevention.</strong>”</p>
<p>Basically, if the attacker goes for the cleric, it guarantees that either the cleric or one of their visitors will die, which makes it dangerous for the cleric to out in public since assassin could target you for a free guaranteed kill.</p>
