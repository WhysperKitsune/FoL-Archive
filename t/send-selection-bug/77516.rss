    <title>Send selection bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/send-selection-bug/77516</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I hit send selection and it sent the random default right side listing of numbers (i.e 1 king 2 3 ect) even though I already deleted that from my logs. Also in the game before I only got send selection to do my n1 on the left side nothing after that

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
It was supposed to send my updated n1 and my claim which was on the left side of the log book.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Not sure if I can as it is bug with the send logs feature so not sure if it is happens all the time or not

#### Comments:
games were around 12:39 central time. Also I tried send selection in death chat and it still wanted to send the same thing</description>
