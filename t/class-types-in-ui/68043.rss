    <title>Class Types In UI</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-types-in-ui/68043</link>
    <description>In the classes UI, it&#39;s really nice seeing all the classes for each faction, but I think it could also be a good idea to have a small menu near the bottom or wherever there&#39;s space, allowing for the classes in each class type to be viewed exclusively, also sorted by faction, so that new players or  veterans can know which classes are in which class type.

For example: A player could click on an Investigative button and get a list of the following classes:

Blue Dragon:
Observer
Paladin
Princess
Sheriff

Unseen:
Duchess
Marshal
Nightwatch

Cult: 
Seeker

Neutral:
Inquisitor</description>

            <p>Honestly just have a tooltip with the lists pop up if you press on the icon or name of the class type</p>
<p>Then you can do the same with the factions</p>
<p>Boom</p>
