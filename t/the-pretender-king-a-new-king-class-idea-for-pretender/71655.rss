    <title>The Pretender King - A new king class idea for Pretender!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-pretender-king-a-new-king-class-idea-for-pretender/71655</link>
    <description>Whenever a saw the class for pretender, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone when I say I was disappointed. I&#39;m not saying the developers aren&#39;t doing a good job because they really are, with the constant updates. I&#39;m just saying the Pretender is not really something we needed. I want to show my idea for a new King class that is Pretender exclusive. 

&gt;# **[color=gray]The Pretender King[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Pretend)** - You are one-time death immune. This does not bypass empower reap and similar abilitys, except for butler wine, which affects your one-time death immunity.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (The Royal Finger)** - Your next nomination for treason will count twice.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Decide Fate)** - Decide an accused player&#39;s fate.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Fake)** - Choose a player. They will get the notification for being attacked but immune tonight. *1 use*.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Guards!)** - Send a guard to protect a player. You may not target yourself. *2 uses*.
&gt;
&gt;***Goal: Survive***

My plan with making this king class is its a neutral king with 2 guards and 1 fake guard, which total to three &quot;guards&quot;, just like a regular neutral king. They are also 1-time death immune to prevent the pretender king from losing too fast.

With how disappointed or maybe even angry I may have sounded at the start of this, I ensure you I&#39;m not mad and I trust the developers to lead this class in the right direction.

&gt;**As always, suggestions for change are always acceptable and appreciated!**</description>

            <p>Eh the pretender king shouldnt be immune to assassin posion or cult bleed. It shows that if you bleed or poison him and he doesnt do anything you pretty much confirm a king that will more often than not be willing to side with you. The guards are there just to make the pretender be involved, i know you might just want to let everybody kill eachother but sometimes in specific cases (ex. (This has happened to me before, twice) you are alive as neut/pretender king and there is one assassin and one knight left. You die to poison tonight. You can let everybody die, guard assassin or guard knight. Its the little decisions like this that i beleive pretender king should have guards.)</p>

            <p>I changed the posion immunity to be a little less useful because i agreed what with you said. And the guards should be non self-targetable because i dont want the pretender last strech to be too easy. I gave it 2 for use on who the pretender king wants to side with.</p>

            <p>Good points. The night immunity is for normal attacks, not execution or empowered reaps (and similar abilitys.) The fake guard is meant for mainly prince and other confirmed bd incase you want to side with evils to prove your going to “side with bd”. I thing the pretender should get their own king class because of <strong>just how king based they are</strong>, because its kinda overly king focused. The diffulculty of pretender right now imo is CRAZY. Most of the time pretender probably wont even become king much less live. Thanks for the reply!</p>

<p>Eh, I dislike this in general as it doesn’t really fit in with purpose of nightshade wine. The entire point of that ability is to remove Kings that are potentially harmful to BD, which includes Neutral Kings.</p>

<p>IMO, the Pretender should be able to target themselves here. There’s basically no reasoning why they would target anyone else other than themselves as they are a survivor.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, I find it interesting to hear that you’re thinking it should become a king of itself instead of just a neutral King. I’d like to ask why you think it is better to make a unique king just for this new class when we have a collective one for a whole genre of neuts (NK)?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Pretender is how difficult it is to win with it. Getting zero guards means it has to choose its allegiances very carefully. Making Unseen/Cult able to use them and BD too, presenting a whole new social aspect to this already well involved game.</p>
<p>Overall, I actually think your ideas are decent, however, I think that the idea of giving a fake guard is a bit unusual, as often even when you guard, they don’t get hit. So if pretender was trying to keep quiet, they’d be screwed over by this fake. Also, only a 1 time death immunity(?). Can you specify if that’s all death immunity (Including lynch and Prince execution) or just normal night immunity?</p>

            <p>Yes, this is for when pretender becomes king. The before-king pretender class in my opinion is cool and will need some changes and will be changed, but its worst problem imo was that it became a neut king with no guards.</p>
