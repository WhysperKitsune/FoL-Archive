    <title>King/Prince whispers</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-prince-whispers/52398</link>
    <description>So what if we just remove ability to whisper TO king.
But then prince can just claim D1 and get whispers instead of king, the best that i can think about is doing same for prince, but it can out him.

So whisping to king meta is strange. If king is passive or nobody whisping him, BD basicly lose almost every time. But whisping to king is OP. 

So let&#39;s say for example, player 1 whisped to king (you) CW swap 1 and 3
Then a lot of players whisped you that they was swaped from 1 to 3 or from 3 to 1.
Then player 12 whisp to you, princess N1 flirt 1 support/social. So what this mean? 12 basicly whisped to you &quot;I;m MM and converted 1, please kill me and him&quot;. This leaving BD with assasin and NK only. (It&#39;s really hapened, then assasin got killed N3 and ye...)
If you whisped to king your class and then converted into cult, you cannot really confirm youself.
If you whisped to king butler (standart claim if you can OCC people) then you gonna ged executed if you assasin/NK you cannot really claim anything to king, possesor can claim noble at best, while others need to claim something like knight which making you sus.


P.S. Sorry for bad english.</description>

            <p>Yeah, I agree with NightX on this one.  Removing an entire mode of communication with someone is a drastic step that reduces available strategies; it should only be taken if it’s absolutely necessary (ie. if whisper games have taken over the meta so completely that they’re crowding out every other strategy anyway.)</p>
<p>I don’t think things are that bad yet; there’s a lot of room for more subtle changes, especially adding / buffing evil methods of listening in on whispers.</p>

            <p>and now players in ToS will whisper the Jailor every game, (in ranked), since the Jailor is guaranteed and confirmed Town, as well the strongest town role, he get all all the protection possible and all information possible, which make his job easier. … So preventing the mayor from whispering did really help evils.</p>

            <p>This is a way too heavy handed solution.</p>
<p>Town of Salem did this with Mayor and it kinda sucked.</p>
<p>This is a deep rooted issue to be treated carefully.</p>
