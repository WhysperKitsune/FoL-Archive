    <description>Why can the inquisitor keep using his abilities after sorcerer is dead? I propose inquisitor to work like scorned, when he can no longer use his abilities after he wins, I mean if he manages to kill sorcerer he already helped BD, he can still help BD if he wants but he shouldn&#39;t be so powerful after sorcerer is gone, this is specially problematic in cult games.</description>
