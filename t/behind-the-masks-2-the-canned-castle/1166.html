Death can never come too soon, for you there is new life in death. Those that die around you are merely wandering spirits, waiting for your guidance underneath your spiritual light. You offer repentance to all who dwindle on this plain of existence.</p>
<p>During the Action Phase, you may ask any dead players up to three questions divided (question length = 100 characters). The dead player may respond to each question(20 characters).<br>
Three per game, during the Action Phase, you may ask the moderator of the current game and ask 1 question about someone who is already dead. Questions against anyone who is currently alive will be ignored. The Moderator will not lie about what they tell you; the information is correct.</p>

Across the land, your name is whispered in fearful corners and shouted from the peaks of mountains. Mighty conquerors seek mighty trophies, and the Palace is certainly a worthy trophy.</p>
<p>Three times per game, during the Dinner Phase, you may intimidate one player, preventing them from acting (challenging), however they must accept all challenges made against them. PM the Moderator to use this power.<br>
If you intimidate a player, the intimidated player will be announced at the beginning of the Challenge Phase.</p>

<p>You are a <span class="bbcode-b">Blackmailer</span>!<br>
Your hobby is certainly dirty- in that you dig up dirt. Research and preparation are the keys to success. Before you entered the Palace, you were already familiar with every tidbit and secret embedded in the past of the other players- secrets that will make them cringe in fear and do your bidding.</p>
<p>During the Dinner Phase, you may blackmail one player. PM the Moderator to use this power.<br>
Blackmailed players must challenge during the Challenge Phase, or will die. Only the blackmailed player will know that they are blackmailed.</p>

Steel flows like water under your steady gaze and steady flame. The pounding of your hammer crafts works of art and workers of war. One of your weapons in a hand guarantees victory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Action Phase, you will be notified of the intended winner(s) of the accepted duel(s).<br>
Three times per game, during the Action Phase, you may change the winner of a duel. PM the Moderator to use this power. You may use this ability once on yourself.</p>

Entertaining is your bread and butter, you live and breath laughter and lightheartedness. Capable of soothing even the loudest of mobs into a quiet peace and calmness. You will do anything to prevent death, including changing your act when it occurs.</p>
<p>When a player dies by non-execution your position on the duel/dance list is randomized (Credit to Blackajack for this one)<br>
Once per game you may choose to entertain your fellow guests and force a skip of the current voting phase and preventing that the MAA Shot, Poisoner’s Poison and the Current execution from taking place.[/quote]</p>

All these poor people attempting to fool their way to riches, you have, and always has, been an excellent murderer. By detecting weakness in the group, you can spread fear with one simple line - Who done it?</p>
<p>Once per voting phase, you may shoot one person. They will not survive the shot unless they are the Soldier. If you shoot the Soldier, the Soldier will kill you instead.<br>
You can only shoot losers of duels/dances.<br>
Additionally, you also gain an additional shooting every time you defeat a player in a duel or dance.<br>
The shooting is silent, meaning it does not reveal your role.<br>
You cannot store more than 1 shot at a time.<br>
You start off with one shot.</p>

Some claim that the gods do not exist, but how can you deny their existence when they whisper in your ears? A lifetime of physical and mental discipline has brought you to the peak of aptitude. May the gods forgive you when you unleash your force.</p>
<p>You alternate between the top of the Duel List and bottom of the Dance list, and top of the Dance List and bottom of the Duel List. It is randomized which list you start on top of.<br>
Once per game, during the Dinner Phase, you may pray. PM the Moderator to use this power.<br>
After you pray, you will move to the top of both the dance and duel lists until the next Dinner Phase.</p>

Perfect pitch, perfect playing… perfect music. Hands dance across strings and keys as the notes rise and fall. No matter the tune, no matter the tempo, every song ascends to perfection in your grasp. Yet with a single twist, that song becomes an instrument of death.</p>

<p>Whenever you guess a player’s role, you may also submit a secondary guess to the moderator for the same player. If the secondary guess is correct, it will be displayed as your submitted guess, otherwise, your primary guess, whether correct or incorrect, will be displayed.

During your college years, you could never confine yourself to a single field of study. Thankfully, a natural knack for learning led to the collection of a wide variety of skills. In the Palace, this ability will serve you well, as duelling and dancing are simply other skills.</p>

The perfect crime remains unknown. It is a mark of your prowess as a thief that no one had heard your name or seen your exploits. You have stolen from the richest kings, scammed the brightest scholars… Switching plates is like taking candy from a baby.</p>
<p>You may switch player’s plates up to 5 times without their knowledge. PM the Moderator to use this power. If the poisoner dies, you will become the new poisoner.<br>

<h2>Signups</h2>
<p>-Before the game begins, the moderator forms a rolelist of the available core and possibly experimental roles- typically 12-14 roles.<br>
-The number of players is equal to the number of roles.<br>
-Once signups open, players may “/join” the game and provide an <font color="#3333FF">animal mask</font> to be referred to as.<br>
-After all available slots have been filled, the roles will be randomly distributed among players via PM, with no repeated roles.<br>
-Players may still join a backup queue once the game begins</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>-The last player standing is the victor.<br>
-A player’s role is not revealed when they die (of course, if their role was guessed you will know it).<br>
-Players may PM other players during the game as long as the moderator is included.<br>
-Dead players cannot post, but moderator discretion may permit a final post or a pre submitted last will.<br>
-Actions, gifts, and guesses are sent to the moderator.<br>
-No quoting/fake quoting mod messages</p>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>-The game itself has four phases.<br>
-Discussion is permitted and encouraged throughout all phases.</p>
<h2>Challenge Phase</h2>
<p>-The Challenge Phase lasts 72 hours, or until all players have challenged or nochallenged and all pending challenges are resolved.<br>
-The game begins on this phase.<br>
-Players may “/challenge” other players to dances or duels.<br>
-Once issued, the challenged player must choose whether to “/accept” the challenge or use a “/deny” (all players begin the game with a deny).<br>
-If the challenged player does not respond by the end of the Challenge Phase, the challenge is automatically accepted.<br>
-Each player may only challenge once per Challenge Phase (even if the challenge is denied), but can be challenged multiple times.<br>
-If a player does not wish to challenge, they may instead “/nochallenge”. This allows the phase to end earlier. Players must still choose whether to accept or deny challenges.<br>
-The results of the challenges will be posted at the end of the Action Phase (see Action Phase).<br>
-The victors of duels and dances are determined by which player’s roles are higher on the respective list (see below), plus any interfering abilities.</p>
<p>Note: Since duel/dance lists fluctuate based on the host, roles in play, and testing, this will simply serve as an example list.</p>

<h2>Action Phase</h2>
<p>-The Action Phase lasts 24 hours, or until all actions have been received.<br>
-Roles with abilities that are used during the Action Phase can PM the moderator to use them. Currently, this is the Blacksmith and Musician.<br>
-At the moderator’s discretion, players may begin selected gifts (see Voting Phase).<br>

Guess Immunity- You are not a valid guess target during the next Dinner Phase.<br>

<h2>Dinner Phase</h2>
<p>-The Dinner Phase ends after 24 hours, or after all players have switched or noswitched.<br>
-Each player is given a plate of food.<br>
-You may “/switch” the food of any two players, consuming a plate switch (each player begins with one plate switch).<br>
-If somebody has switch plates with you, you may not take it back directly and have to switch/noswitch again<br>
-At the end of the phase, each player eats the food in front of them.<br>
-Players who eat poison food will die (excluding the Soldier).<br>
-The Barbarian, Blackmailer and Monk act during this phase. The Thief may secretly switch plates during this phase.<br>
-In addition, if you received a free guess as a gift, you must use it during the Dinner Phase. If you are correct, that player will be executed at the end of the Dinner Phase. All attempted guesses are revealed at the end of the Dinner Phase.<br>
-If you do not have a free guess, you may still make a guess as to another player’s role as normal. However, if you are incorrect, you will be executed.</p>
