            <p>Chrono, Cw, Sheriff, Maid, some of the most commonly fake claimed classes don’t have passives, while the classes who would be claiming them would. That’s why I think oracle would be good, but not OP, with the simple ability to know passives which would cause you to do more baiting/scum reading than a hard-counter investigator like sheriff.</p>

            <p>Check the passive. It’ll say, for Oracle, “something is off about ____” if the target qualifies for any of those listed things. He will not know what it is, but he knows it’s gonna be one of those. While the prophet will know something is off about them, except, unlike the oracle, he will know what it is that is off about them. He will know if they were reaped, possessed, occd, etc, while the Oracle wont.</p>
