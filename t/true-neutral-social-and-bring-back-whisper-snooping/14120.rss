    <title>True Neutral Social and Bring Back Whisper Snooping</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/true-neutral-social-and-bring-back-whisper-snooping/14120</link>
    <description>I really miss the whisper snooping that the old noble had, but it was just too overpowered in the hands of a BD. I think the ability should be brought back, but to a true Neutral Social class. 
Possible Abilities? 

Day Ability
Lip Read: Can listen into whispers to and from the target

Night Ability:
Deliver Note: Whisper to the target, the target will not see who it is from and cannot reply
Mass Mail: A message will be delivered to everyone at the start of the next day
Journal Peek: Unveil the targets journal (reviewable like a dead persons journal from the side bar) 

Win Condition: Survive

I think the balance is much better had in the role of a Neutral player who&#39;s entire job is focus on collecting information as it&#39;s passed around so they can relay it to the right people. This is the ultimate social or Investigative class for a neutral who can then spread the information needed to make themselves a great tool or pull strings in the right direction to secure a win.</description>

            <p>Being a social class, it relies on information flow to meet it’s goals, so you take information gathered and share it to the right people to make yourself seem useful so they wont kill you, while trying to get people to kill eachother so they end the game.</p>
