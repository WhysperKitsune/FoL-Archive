            <p>Hi there, this is not a usual case – I responded to you on Discord. I need to see your logs to see what happened:</p>
<p>(orange line)<br>

<ul>
<li>Are you in Russia?</li>
<li>Do you have unique characters in your email?</li>
<li>Do you have a REALLY LONG or REALLY SHORT email?</li>
<li>Did you try an alternate email?</li>
</ul>
<p>Logs would tell me <strong>exactly</strong> what happened, though.</p>
