    <title>Mastermind Day Ability: Promote</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mastermind-day-ability-promote/54527</link>
    <description>Dirty Work is a very niche ability, only used in situations when there are almost no converts left and killing becomes more reliable than converting. HOWEVER, this still hinders the progress of the Unseen greatly, and most of the time, you would prefer there to be a Mastermind than an Assassin. So I propose that this ability, Promote, should also be given to the Mastermind, as most cases where Mastermind dies or is kept in jail and such, for people waiting for it to become Day 4. Swapping the class of Mastermind helps for Unseen to live longer, and not rely as a crutch on the Mastermind. But it&#39;s not an auto-upgrade like Cult, so it won&#39;t always be usable.


Promote: (D) (2) (Uses carry over to succeeding Masterminds)
If you and an Assassin is alive at the start of the night, you will swap classes with the Assassin. The Assassin will be notified when this is used.</description>

            <p>It should be one use or only before D4 or else once the mastermind is going to get got before they get voted up they will quickly promote someone so the BD kill an assasin instead. Repeating this sequence another time will by the Unseen good time and make mm impossible to catch for the BD.</p>

            <p>I think just having it be Assassin is good for both thematic purposes as promotion is going to the second-in-command, as well as consistency, because if you have other classes, you always have an Assassin.</p>

            <p>Or let Mastermind target whichever of the Unseen he wants to offer the Promotion to, and let them get a popup box like for Merc contract with the OPTION to accept the promotion</p>
<p>I like this idea</p>
