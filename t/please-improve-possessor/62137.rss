<p>It actually does if use it correcly. If jump into something like Drunk or Butler which is  super confirmable, BD would have a big problem to find out who is actually fake. Killing at night isnt only way to get rid off enemies.<br>

<p>This accomplishes more than you would think. If you jump to a class with provable day Ability’s such as King or Mystic then you can claim Bewildered. And it means that you can win a 1v1 against King and Prince.</p>

            <p>What do you mean by this? If you’re talking about my wording, I mean it in such a way that Shapeshift is better, not because it’s stronger, but because it makes more sense with the Possessor’s theme. Some generic immunity piercing would buff him, but it very boring of an option.</p>
