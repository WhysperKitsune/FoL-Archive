    <title>Forage vs. Assassinate</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/forage-vs-assassinate/2517</link>
    <description>Foraging is very powerful. Confusing roleblockers is just a bonus - the real power in this is the ability to choose your target during the day when claims are made and being almost guaranteed (pants on fire, magical barrier) to land your ability. 

Think of the risk involved with Assassinate;

1) Attacking a target under the protection of CW, Merc, or Prince.
2) Attacking a target being guarded by a Knight or healed by a Physician or Alchemist
3) Getting caught by an Observer
4) Running into a Princess&#39; Wisp
5) Hitting an immune target
6) Hitting a target that was going to die anyway
7) Hitting an incorrect target due to Scorn&#39;s Bait and Switch
8) Hitting a target protected by the King

Forage risks:

1) Observer sees you didn&#39;t visit anyone/didn&#39;t leave (slightly sus to some)
2) Physician healing every poison
3) Allowing important BD roles to live longer instead of killing them immediately
4) Getting Pants on Fire&#39;d or hitting a target with Magical Barrier (this will never happen)
5) Accidentally poisoning a Physician who is immune

As we can see, Physician hard counters the wanna-be arso assassin. Because of this, I will typically try to assassinate the first couple nights and see if I can score a hit on the Physician. If NK kills Physician, hey, thanks pal. Time to forage away. 

There are times and places to assassinate, but in my experience it tends to fail almost as often as it succeeds, putting Unseen at a huge disadvantage.</description>

            <p>Indeed. It is also better to forage earlier in the game because poison takes a while to take effect.</p>

            <p>This is a good idea. I have seen some people forage N1 so they can do this more often. That way you can also have a poison ready if the MM conversation fails because of Prince/NK</p>

            <p>Yeah the Nightshade Assassin…<br>
If there is no CW and no Physician, then well… its bad.<br>
If you are CW then you better use these Pants on Fire, because those who are on fire cannot be Assassin when poison hits the Prince/Sheriff. Bonus points if you make the Assassin nightshade themselves. And you might want to do Protective Barrier on someone who revealed after a poison if you run into someone like that.</p>

            <p>I remember a while ago they decreased butler spawn rate, so clearly the chances of each BD role spawning is not equal. I would like to see an increase in Physician spawn rate as in my opinion one does not exist often enough to put off Assassin using forage and poison as his primary method of killing.</p>
<p>That OR make Alchemist able to heal nightshade to make him more valuable to BD and once again nerd the popular foraging strategy.</p>
