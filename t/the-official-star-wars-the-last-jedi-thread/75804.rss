            <p>I’m not really a big Star Wars buff, so I don’t really care too much about the canon being shit on or things like that, and as a person who just wanted to see a movie, I thought it was fine. Not great (GOD that casino scene) but not terrible. (BTW I only saw the movie once so if anyone wants to tell me about something incredibly stupid I missed go right ahead)</p>

            <p>I was just wondering what the heck happened to Luke</p>
<p>He turned from Happy Go Lucky at end of Return of the Jedi to a fukin guy that taunts whatever the edgy raging kid’s name is, and then just dies from a hologram death. Like what the fuck? I’m confused</p>
<p>At this point I’m viewing the Sequels as non-cannon</p>

            <p>It’s pretty bad, walked out of the theater disappointed on almost every level. Sans visuals to prop it up, hugely flawed film.</p>
<p>And it sucks to see because I feel like Rey has so much potential that is just squandered.</p>

            <p>They are all good points, and I can see why they are big problems maybe except the first one. The first one seemed to be a dumb fueling problem that could have been solved if people just refilled their tanks after every use especially in the resistance.<br>
The whole hyperspace suicide bombers is a great point and j never thought of it like that. Honestly the separatists would have easily won the clone wars with that.<br>
And I think the Kylo thing happened since he knew Rey was on the planet somewhere and he seems to want her alive more than kill her. If he just blew it up he had a chance of killing her</p>

            <p>firstly; suddenly hyperspace travel is limited and so is impulse power, suddenly speed is a thing for literally no reason despite it being established that movement is almost irrelevant in star wars.</p>
<p>Secondly, remember that scene where Admiral Holdo sacrifices herself by blowing the rebel battlecruiser at hyperspace through the imperial supership?</p>
<p>If that’s possible, why don’t people just launch droid-piloted ships through hyperspace as a targeted nuke anywhere in the galaxy? And why can’t Kylo fire the giant door-busting gun from the remains of the First Order’s fleet from space, down to the planet.</p>
<p>It completely destroys my suspension of disbelief.</p>

            <p>I personally liked the movie. There were parts that felt unneeded such as the casino part, Admiral Ackbars death, and many others but overall I enjoyed it more than I hated it. It may be an unpopular opinion but I enjoy most of the star wars movies</p>
