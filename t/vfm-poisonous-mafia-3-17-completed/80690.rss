# [color=green]Gameplay:[/color]

Days last 48 hours and nights last 24 hours.
The mafia will communicate via a private DM on the forums.
The mafia has an unassigned factional kill per night.
Lynches are majority only.
A minimum of ten posts with content every 24 hours is required. If you do not meet this requirement you will be replaced out after one warning.
Players who are poisoned are announced at the start of the day after the night that the poisoner targetted them, and will die by the end of the day.
Both poisoners can choose either to real poison, or fake poison, anyone including themselves.
The Healer may choose one target per day to cure of their poison. The healer cannot target themself.
The backup poisoners are not informed that they are backup poisoners until their team&#39;s poisoner has died. They will believe they are a vanilla town or mafia goon until the poisoner on their team dies.
The backup poisoners are flipped at VT/Goon if they die before the Poisoners and the rolecop checks the backup poisoner as VT.
Real and Fake poisons are both announced SoD, but only players who are real poisoned will die if not healed.

            <p>You were right but you need to provide your thought processes behind your observations or theories. The more detailed you can lay out your thoughts explaining your reads the easier it is too see you are a village.</p>
<p>You often didn’t clearly explain enough of your observations (you did sometimes with your VCA stuff) which is mostly what les to your lynch - we just didnt have quite enough to conclude you were town.</p>
<p>You had a lot going for you though!</p>

<p>Not a bad way to look at things.</p>
<p>Plus also trying to recognize when a person doesn’t really act like a wolf and being able to act on it. Hippo had a strong hunch that CRich wasn’t wolfy, but wasn’t able to overcome the picture in his mind. (for example). And similar thing happens very, very often.</p>

<p>if every villager alive on the last day could do that then they would probably notice how Marshal was trying to get the game to end and didn’t really seem interested/invested in the lynch<br>
but it’s <em>having that perspective</em> which is so difficult to get to. i didn’t have it until I was told in deadchat Marshal was a wolf and then I could see it</p>

<p>yeah no, Hippo was super villagery this game.<br>
I feel like MyLo/LyLo scenarios should be looked at in a complete vacuum<br>
Disregard everything that happened before and look at who’s doing what.<br>
The problem is that it’s hard to do that without an outsider perspective (like a spectator’s), because you get lingering influence like “that guy was towncore” or “i’m ride or die with that one”</p>
