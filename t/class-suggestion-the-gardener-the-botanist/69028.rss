            <p>I really like the abilities. They don’t seem that helpful to BD though, or maybe that’s just me? Have you considered making it into a Neutral Social? I think it could fix a couple of holes in a super interesting concept!</p>

<p>Way too strong. You’re essentially night immune as long as you aren’t occupied or prevented from visiting your target.</p>

<p>Remove the RNG. As I said before, if your class card has an ability with the word “random” in it, then it needs to be scrapped ASAP.</p>

<p>Strong, but will out the user. So I’d say this is fine as a last-ditch attempt to go past MyLo for the Unseen.</p>
<p>Overall this class needs a lot of work. To be frank, this is a BD social class. Even people who typically make very balanced and unique classes tend to absolutely screw the pooch whenever they try to make a BD social class as they’re stupidly hard to make.</p>
