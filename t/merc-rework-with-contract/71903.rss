    <description>                  •Mercenary 

[color=Yellow]Passive 1[/color]: extra files - know your contracts exact class at the beginning of everyday. You may not vote up your target and you must always vote pardon on your contract. You may not kill your target either. 

[color=Yellow]Passive 2[/color]: finishing what i started - if your contract dies then you will commit suicide in two days unless you kill your contracts killer.(If you do manage to kill your contracts killer then your _“stand guard”_ ability will be refilled)
________________
[color=yellow]Day ability 1[/color]: Contract - select a player to contract. If you don’t contract someone in the first 3 days then you will randomly be given a contract. You cannot contract any unique classes, only exceptions are [color=red]CL[/color] and [color=purple]Assassin[/color],they can be contracted. If you attempt contracting a unique player then you will get a message saying you can’t 

[color=yellow]Day ability 2[/color] : paying attention - know who visits your contract tonight [4 uses]
____________
[color=yellow]Night ability 1[/color]: stand guard - prevent all visitors from you and your contract, if your contract is jailed then the prince cannot exe that night. [4 uses]

[color=yellow]Night ability 2[/color]: revenge -  attack a player that accused your target, if your first contract dies then you can kill anyone. (if you manage to kill your contracts killer then you will be randomly given a new non-unique contract, can only be reassigned a new contract once) [2 uses]
_________________
[color=Yellow]Win con[/color] - have 1 of your contracts survive until the end of the game

_______________
[color=black]Notes[/color]: this new mercenary allows you to pick a contract of your choice in 3 days. Allowing the player to get a feel of the players before contracting.  Not being able to contract prince was my main goal because then prince would out every game. If your contract does die then you have two days to redeem yourself by killing your contracts killer. This can seem hard but with your day ability 2, you can get a better idea on who it is. Now you might think that this is heavily favor to BD because most of the time your target will die to cult or unseen but if a knight,hunter or even a poss controlling someone then you have to kill them to redeem yourself. If you successfully do kill them then you will be rewarded a random non-unique target as your contract. The RNG new target is a punishment and reward  for when your contract dies.</description>

            <p>I actually like this. Pretty much the old Merc but it takes away the incentive of killing your first contract to contract a confirmed BD (y’know, the Prince.)</p>
<p>Confirmability isn’t a big deal when it is only confirmable between 2 people. This isn’t Mystic’s telepathy, after all.</p>

            <p>I like it.  The only issue I have with it is revenge.  Mercenary is not a killer.  Maybe it could be given 1 use of the old royal decree instead?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>problem I read the first passive and it’s already confirmable</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Mercenary should be confirmable to their target though.  I’ve seen games where players would refuse to claim to the merc because merc was easily claimable.  It’s hard to coordinate if you don’t know their class or faction.</p>

            <p>I mean that would be a fair nerf and at least give him something, it at least makes him counterable but if he wants to instead be a innocent child with guards instead of a killing machine fine by me.</p>

            <p>you would indeed but that would meen outing all your healers knights and your observer wich honestly the unseen/cult and nk will have enough important claims to kill the following 2 to 3 nights sides this would be a huge buff to sellsword (could use that 2 be honest) cult would feel a littel easy to get yourself a butler or something but still not that easy i can see it would not be so bad for prince if you would remove his passive only i think you would need to give him something in return for it for balance he is there ace in the hole after all he should be just that much stronger then all but the nks</p>

            <p>It does counter himself and imagine this.</p>
<p>Knight outs day one, and everyone protects him. Don’t question why they do it it’s for my example. Literally the counter play is to occupy him. You don’t need to kill the protectives.</p>

            <p>I agree to this but the counter to prince might not be countering the prince himself but countering those around him strip him of his pschycians, knights and a possible good king and whats left to apose the evil a class wich falls as easy as all others</p>
