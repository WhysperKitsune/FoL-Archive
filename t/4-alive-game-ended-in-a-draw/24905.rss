7, 12, 14, 16 were all alive. Game ended in a draw. I will report user 12 &quot;KoreanBeagle346&quot; with a link to this thread for research purposes. 2 BD and 2 Cult still alive, Prince should have run out of Jails and CL should have won with kills. I think?

            <p>Edited: no, you’re right, found the .10 patch notes and Prince is limited to three times total.</p>

            <p>It’s not 3 in a row. It’s 3 total. And jail counts towards that for butler meaning that the butler would be converted after 9 nights</p>
<p>Cl occupies 3 times. Cl jailed 3 times. Butler jailed 3 times</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/kitliz">@KitLiz</a>,  I was in that game (13) and one of the only spectators to stay until the end.</p>
<p>My take was that CL (16) was out of eradicates, and only way to get more was to sac 14, but that would’ve put Cult in the minority and so they would lose the day after the sacrifice. So, killing wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prince (12) could jail CL and Butler (7) alternately so no conversion could happen and nobody trips the 3-in-a-row prevention. CL was occupy immune by then, but it wouldn’t have mattered as long as Prince kept jailing one or the other. I’m pretty sure 14 was just flat out of charges by that point.</p>
