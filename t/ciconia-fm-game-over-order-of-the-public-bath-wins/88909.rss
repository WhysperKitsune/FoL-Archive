    <description>![Ciconia FM|690x465, 75%](upload://3cyxMRacLAlBRykMY841LtDASqP.jpeg) 
## Ciconia FM: When They Cry - designed and hosted by @astand, cohosted by @KyoDaz.
Reviewer is @osieorb18, alt mod is @DatBird.
## Rules:
* Follow all [Global Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) and [Official Forum Game Rules.](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926)
* Make at least 15 game-related posts each day (unless day ends early). If you fail to meet this requirement, you might get replaced. For 0 posting in full game day I will force replace you without any questions.
* Don&#39;t edit posts. This includes quickediting for typos, just don&#39;t do it.
* Alt accounts are allowed. Tell me your identity privately and send an application to @DatBird if you wish to play on an alt. You are allowed to speculate on identities of alt accounts.
## General information:
* Closed setup.
* The game will contain bastard and/or experimental mechanics. However, OP will never lie, your rolecard will never lie, and no flips will ever be false.
* Days are 48 hours, nights are 24 hours.
* Eliminations are majority + plurality. In case of a tie, elimination will be randed.
* At EoD, votes made up to :59 mark will be accepted (but not at :00 mark).
* It will not be announced if the game reaches MYLO/LYLO.
* [color=007F46]**Order of the Public Bath**[/color] is uninformed majority and [color=CC000D]**Ninth Prime Chivalric Order**[/color] is informed minority.
* [color=007F46]**Order of the Public Bath&#39;s**[/color] win condition is: *Eliminate all members of the Ninth Prime Chivalric Order and all other possible threats to Order of the Public Bath.*
* [color=CC000D]**Ninth Prime Chivalric Order&#39;s**[/color] win condition is: *Achieve parity with the Order of the Public Bath and eliminate all other possible threats to Ninth Prime Chivalric Order.*
* Other win conditions may or may not exist.
## Game mechanics:
* There are no conversions.
* There may or may not be lost wolves.
* Flavor/role claims are allowed **at your own risk**.
* Flavor (character name, in-universe faction and kette) isn&#39;t alignment indicative, but might be role indicative for some roles while being misleading or not role indicative for others.
* [color=CC000D]**Ninth Prime Chivalric Order&#39;s**[/color] factional kill is assigned. Performing it doesn&#39;t prevent using other night actions.
* You can&#39;t perform actions on N0 unless specified otherwise.
* Deadline for submitting actions is one hour before the end of the phase (whether day or night).
* If you have several different night (day) abilities, then you can use all of them during a single night (day), unless specified otherwise.

            <p>Yeah, and me clearing Atlas with my N1 check helped a lot too. No idea why people in the dead chat thought I had a third use of my ability since I stated it was a 2 shot cop check when I outed my green check on Atlas D2.</p>
