    <title>What was your first ToL game like?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-was-your-first-tol-game-like/72343</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was wondering how we all started out in the game. Feel free to talk about your first ToL game, what you learned, what mistakes you made, etc.

My first game was as Unseen King. I couldn&#39;t even bother looking at the wikia or anything of sort. I didn&#39;t even realize that I was the Evil King before I was executed on D3. I only guarded myself and I did no talking in the day, I was incredibly confused haha. What I learned was how much communication and how much thinking actually goes in this game üòÅ.</description>

            <p>Also usually as NK I try different fake claims out, since I‚Äôm going to get exed anyway.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of times as Observer(didn‚Äôt work too well)</p>
<p>Mainly if I see a sheep bd I might actually try, but other then that, I try to branch out as claims, seeing what works and what doesn‚Äôt.</p>

            <p>I got onto games of ToL with Smooth streaming a few times. The most recent was when I was the Possessor and I got found as Killer/Offensive by a Princess and I claimed Noble to the King</p>

            <p>Skimm and Wahooz were the ones that got me to play these types of games‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Kinda sad now since Wahooz stopped playing any Lying related games, and all Skimm does is Town of Salt.</p>
<p>I also started watching SmoothTV, was cool. I even got into a game with him once.(was during twitch stream)</p>

            <p>My first game dropped me into a Cult/Sorc game with me as Sorc. I remember putting a Circle of Death on a bleeding person n2 and getting a double kill, but I ended up dying to the Inq in the same night.</p>
<p>Much disappointment. I had fun though, I watched Wahooz and Skimm play this game for a while before I ended up buying it myself and have just loved playing it when I can.</p>
