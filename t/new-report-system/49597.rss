    <title>New Report System?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-report-system/49597</link>
    <description>I think that people should be able to report players in the game for some reasons. One because the report is fresh in your mind and you have all the ideas of what the person did wrong and why he should be reported. Another reason is they what happens if you die mid game and you think someone is cheating, but you cannot be asked to stay the rest of the game JUST to report them when it might actually be false. I am the type of person that if I die night 1 or 2 or even 3 and I am not invested in the game to leave. So I think this is a problem and it needs to be changed. This is not a bug or anything it is just a logic error Devs. At least I feel that this needs to be changed. I was discussing in the discord, I have never seen a report button. I even looked in the game to see if there is a report button. Then someone said to me you have to wait until the end game, then I realized this is a problem.</description>

        <title>New Report System?</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Obviously if you want your report taken seriously, you need to at <span class="bbcode-i">least</span> add an exclamation point to emphasize how bad that person is.  “Bad!”, for instance.  Or even “BAD!!!”  If you’re not bothering to emphasize their badness, how can the mods take it seriously?</p>

<p>Well there’s 2 schools of thought on it. It only takes 1 report to reach the dev’s. so odds are even if you bailed, 1 of the other 14 players probably stuck around and hit it, if it seemed blatant, the one problem is the risk of floods of reports on converteds, fools and who knows what else that actually were playing their roles, but were assumed to be gamethrowing because people didn’t know they actually weren’t good yet.</p>

<p>This explains it rather well – it’s not always as it seems, and it does, indeed, take only 1 report to get all the info (out of 15). If only 1 person out of 15 reported the 1 weird guy, then … that raises a flag he may be inno.</p>

<p>Where you report people is the end of game screen, which lists their starting and finishing class. right next to the button, so you can easilly see if it was actually justified before you hit the button. That being said things like racial slurs in names, spamming etc… should probably be reportable mid game.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeshh, well said. We also want you to take your time on your report – if we had it in-game, people would rush it. People already rush the summary and go “bad” or something (we just delete those reports).</p>

<p>We will likely have a LIMITED in-game report system that will also mute them, likely ONLY for racism/extreme toxicity. I’m thinking a popup warning saying this will mute them, report for extreme racism/toxicity, and not ask for a summary. However, we’ll likely also warn that it’ll backfire if sending falsely~</p>
<p>That’s my thought process, so far.</p>
