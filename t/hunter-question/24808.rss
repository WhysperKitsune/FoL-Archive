    <description>If I am Hunter and I bear but I am possessed into someone the Knight is guarding then who dies?

Btw right now the Hunter Bear &quot;prevents all attacks&quot;. Does that block poison and bleed?</description>

            <p>I’m pretty sure rebound doesn’t peirce night Immunity. I would like to point out that night Immunity and death immunity are the same thing. Also my question is because the bear is NOT night Immunity.</p>

            <p>Well, isn’t the difference night immunity and death immunity. Some is both, others only one or other. MM would still die to Circle of Death, i believe. And the Knight’s sacrifice rebound pierces everything, same with the mercenary rebound. Even if king guards, i believe a merc can kill him if the king has accused his target.</p>

            <p>Ah, OK. I didn’t catch the subtlety on that the first time. Thanks for the correction!</p>
<p>But I tend to agree Knight should still kill the Hunter in defense. It’s not an attack, in the game sense; it wasn’t initiated by a player.</p>

            <p>I’m trying to tell you that the bear is not night Immunity anymore. I know that the knights Ability would trigger off of this and that the poss and the person the Knight guarded would survive. I am asking about the Hunter. I know the Knight bypasses night immunity but the Hunter Bear is not night Immunity so that isn’t the same thing. My question is essentially if the Knight’s counter attack is blocked by a bear and thus considered an attack dispite being indirect.</p>
<p>Btw I am fairly sure that the sorc CoD does not peirce night Immunity.</p>

            <p>Strange that Sacrifice doesn’t have the ignore night immunity in the description, while Bear Companion does.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Companion</strong><br>
Summon a bear to protect you from all attacks at night. The attackers will be dead in the morning (Bypasses night immunity). You will be death and conversion immune.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong><br>
Protect a player, giving your life to kill their attackers.</p>

            <p>What I’m at least trying to understand, is the saying that if you are protected by a bear, you shouldn’t get killed if you are forced to attack someone guarded by a knight.</p>
<p>To my knowledge a knight should kill the hunter, because killing attackers is what knights are supposed to do, and regardless of whether he chose to attack, he did attack.</p>
<p>The way I understand it, night immune protects you from all attacks that target you (with the noted exceptions of prince’s execution, and a reaper using the ability that overcomes immunity). But does not protect you from things that happen because you visit/attack someone, such as walking into a bear, or attacking someone the knight is guarding.</p>

            <p>I don’t think that’s a bug though… bear protects you from anyone attacking you… it does not protect you, I don’t see why it would protect you from the consequences of attacking someone else.</p>
<p>Bears, Sacrificing knights etc… kill attackers, including immune ones. The same reason a bear can maul a sorcerer, is why a knight can kill a hunter while sacrificing.</p>

            <p>Bear was changed recently. Instead if being night Immunity it stops attacks. That would stop an empowered reaper</p>

            <p>I’m not 100% sure you’re right on the bear vs. reaper, unless they changed that recently. IIRC, when I tried that the hunter and I both died–him because I punched through his immunity with the Gather, and me because that didn’t stop the bear from killing me on attack.</p>
<p>Also not sure I’d say Possessor is broken. The mechanism described is exactly how it’s supposed to work, as far as I know. Night immunity has never protected against a Knight (or bear) defense. You can stoneskin and yolo bomb someone guarded by a Knight and get the same result–you and Knight die.</p>

            <p>No no no. I know it bypasses night immunity. I was wondering if it bypasses the bear which is different. The bears ability says it stops the attack. I know that this means that the empowered reaper will not kill a hunter because of this but I am not sure if the knights guard would be stopped by this.</p>

            <p>Really? I would have thought it would fail because the hunter bear isn’t technically night immunity. Have you tested this out or are you just speculating?</p>

            <p>You both do because Possessor is broken at the moment. They can kill Mastermind’s too by possessing them into attacking a player that has a Knight guarding them. Same with Alchemist’s that used a Stoneskin Potion or any other night immune class.</p>
