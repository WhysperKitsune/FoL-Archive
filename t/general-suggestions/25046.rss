    <description>Hey, 
First of all, i really enjoy this game alot and i would like to see it grow. Here are some suggestions which i believe would improve services quality and customers experience.

Chat for friends (whispers) in lobby and main menu area. 
Invite players as friend from chat in lobby, game creating waiting room and in game (invite friend button).

Logs from chats (lobby+in game), so you can check them through afterwards (players can learn this way from their mistakes etc.). 

Player list from last played matches (so you can add friends afterwards).
Some sort of simple match history list, which shows Win/Lose+player list or
just same list/table which presented after every match. 

After match reveal who were who, in game, lower right corner. 

After match lobby, show playerID, ingame name and number in chat, so its easier to identify who were who in match.
Show players leaving chatlobby (simple, &quot;player+nr left chat&quot;).

Maybe lower price of the game to increase player base. 
Like i said i think game is brilliant. And i know its &quot;indie&quot; game so i totally understand if these implementions are not coming for the game, but i still guess customers would have use for these functions.

Best Regards, Ghuz</description>

            <p>They call it “a joke”. No need to get too dramatic here <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Free games may attract unwanted players and i have not say anything about it beeing free.</p>
<p>Price was not the main idea of OP. I wont be repeating myself about it  anymore.</p>

            <p>You have lost all of my respect. Good luck in your future endeavors. The game should be free to play right?</p>

            <p>Sounds something bbiaglla would do.</p>
<p>No but really, that is somewhat understandable in some certain situations, but of course some kids use this refund option “wrongly” which makes it harmfull for small businesses / game developers.</p>

            <p>Of that i know nothing about. Are people buying games and demanding refunds after they get bored of game?</p>
<p>Sound something that would not happen where i come from (most honest people in the world, or so they claim) <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Yes, i bought it too. So obviously im personally with you on that Moleland.</p>
<p>But you know everything is not always just all about us two.</p>
<p>For this game which is unknown to so many. Lower price equals more players, more players means higher conspicuousness which equals even more players… Super simple. But price doesnt have to be lowered for good, limited discounts will also attract some players.</p>

            <p>It’s $10 for a game that gets DLC FOR FREE FOREVER - IT WILL NEVER COST YOU MORE MONEY! $10 is great value IMO</p>

            <p>You know there are studies about people who try to intentionally irritate others online hiding themselves behind some anonymous profiles. Maybe you should investigate on it <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Findings of those studies are most fascinating.</p>

            <p>It really aint about what i want. I said i belive these will enhance the quality of the game and obv i was not clear enough about player list. What i ment is a list and match history “reports” which you can open up after you have left game for main menu. Or when you launch your game you can check last played matches.</p>
<p>In game when the winning faction is announced, reveal player roles to bottom right “player box”.</p>
<p>After match in chat show playerID+nr they played with and name they were in match (this is not that important tho).</p>
<p>Maybe some discounts or something, most people are not willing to pay even 10e/USD for game they are not so sure about in first place. And this really depends on marketing area (US varies from EU markets). You might also argue lowering price would bring players whom dont really get a hang of the game or are simply trolling. But if there is going to be issues in player pool and players cant get games going, you could try put up some discounts on Steam.</p>

            <p>Chat for friends is a good idea. I think adding/inviting friends to a game could be improved</p>
<p>I think improve reviewing of a match would be good</p>
<p>Player list is shown at the end of match already. You can add friends from there as well.</p>
<p>People are revealed at end of match already. All details are shown there.</p>
<p>It does show some people, but not all right now.</p>
<p>Game is perpetually $10 with no DLC charges or anything. What more do you want?</p>
