    <title>Bug report: unable to reproduce</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-report-unable-to-reproduce/32609</link>
    <description>What happened: 
Was in a game as BD.  We won the game because of a bug.  The BD in the game were working together and playing the game appropriately. It happened almost every day. We had assassin up and he said he knew who reaper was.  BD in this game pardoned him so he could tell us, exed the reaper, and then had prince exe him that night.  Also BD put me up because princess said i was killer offensive.  I told them I was phys, which i was, and that mm sees phys as offensive since herbalist is offensive.  they took the time to process that info and pardoned me and exed the MM. Other weird things were happening such as BD reading logs when people died, and reading logs when people were on the stand and posted them.  Nobody called king evil.  Nobody accused somebody of treason without a reason.  Etc.  

What was supposed to happen? 
BD are supposed to not read logs, exe other BD, call king evil, vote somebody up whenever anybody says to without a reason, yell at eachother, and be uncooperative.  

Steps to reproduce?
I have been unable to reproduce this bug since this game, and had never experienced it before.
However if devs could find this bug and implement it into the actual code, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing.

            <p>You may have overlooked, but your report exposes an additional bug.  It appears the prince was able to execute the assassin n2, unless you are saying that prince actually lived to n3 which seems almost too insane to even type.</p>
