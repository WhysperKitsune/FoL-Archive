    <title>Minor Changes Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/minor-changes-suggestion/40457</link>
    <description>The new patch is great, and thank you Devs, so much.

But I feel we have some minor changes that would be useful to help buff up certain classes but not completely change the game.

Noble: Spy Maid - 
I feel that Spy Maid is underpowered a bit, unless it&#39;s a whisper game, but even then, a maid can only do so much and listen to so many people. I feel that the Noble should be able to target 2 people with Spy Maid per night.

Butler: Concentrated Wine -
It&#39;s the Butler&#39;s defense mechanism, but isn&#39;t as useful because Mastermind and almost all Neutral Killers have Occupy Immunity. I suggest that the Butler&#39;s Concentrated Wine should bypass occupy immunity, like the Drunk&#39;s Happy Hour. This would bring the Butler on par with the Drunk a little bit.

Butler: Nightshade Wine -
The main differing ability between the Butler and Drunk, it should be a bit more useful. I suggest that it can be used starting for Day 3, as the earliest King removal. I would also suggest that it kills the King in one night, but that might be too much of a dramatic change.

Butler Rework:

Assassin: Distract - 
Making it so it&#39;s usable during a trial is such a big boon, but I feel it needs some extra time to properly silence some major chatterboxes in the castle. I suggest setting the time it prevents a player from talking to 20 seconds, double of what it is now.

Sorcerer: Magic Dust - 
The whole point of Inquisitor is to find the Sorcerer, but she is almost always outed by a BD member. I suggest that Magic Dust should be changed to an ability that would make the &quot;Sorceress&quot; appear Blue Dragon to faction checks that night. The Inquisitor shouldn&#39;t be messed with.

Example:
Transfiguration: (Day) (2)
Appear as a Blue Dragon to all faction checks tonight.

Inquisitor: Magic Users -
Remove the Cult from the list of Magic Users. This prevents the Inquisitor from being a major player in Cult games. Converted Magic Users would still show as Magic though.</description>

            <p>I mean, I’m just saying my thoughts, but I will agree that Noble was buffed. Because both of my Noble games, I successfully pulled at least 3 clutch whispers every time, either confirming NK to King, Inq to King, or MM claiming to their Merc. More people rely on whispers now.</p>

<p>I disagree that it’s too underpowered. I think Noble has been indirectly buffed with this patch, as everyone will have to whisper much, much more to each other without the immediate point man of the king.</p>

<p>I think 13-15 would be a good balance: It’s half the time an accused has to defend themselves, and would still require some skill in timing.</p>

            <p>I guess that I like the Obs change they almost made.</p>
<p>And the princess results change seemed cool but I can see why they didn’t.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything on this list. There are other changes I’m sure we want but they are not minor and they have their own threads. Mostly regarding Sheriff/Pally and King.</p>
