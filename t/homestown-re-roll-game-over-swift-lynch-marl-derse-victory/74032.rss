    <description>## Homestuck Smalltown 

#### Based off of Andrew Hussie&#39;s Odyssey-like webcomic, Homestuck

##### Click this to read it: [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/)

### [Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515_)
Click the rules link above if needed
No excessive AtE, Swearing, or Emotionally trying to mess with players is allowed with one exception. (See below)
Cohost: Luxy 

### Gameplay
Days will be 48 hours max
Nights will be 24 hours max
Any class can be an order or chaos troll
Roles are revealed at the start of the game
Alignments will not flip on death
Prospit trolls win when all Derse trolls are dead
Derse trolls win when their numbers equal that of the Prospit trolls
Derse trolls have a factional kill, however a Derse troll may use it alongside their given ability only when targeting a player that is lower than them on the blood heirarchy. 
The blood heirarchy also determines the order of abilities being done, from highest to lowest, if there is any conflict.

### Chats
There will be a DM for dead chat
There is a DM for Sollux&#39;s Neighborhood
And there is a DM for the Derse troll chat

### Post Restrictions
All trolls will have post restrictions, also called typing quirks, tied to their role. Break it three times, and you will find yourself modkilled for not staying in character. 

### Lynching
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot; in bold, followed by a @Livicus.
Lynching is both Majority and Plurality
If there is a tie by plurality, no one will die by lynch
Also: No Twilight Posting please (This means you Max)

### After The Night
Feedback will be given via DMs

### Journals
Message me your entire journal in [quote] and [/quote], the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed

### Deathnotes
No deathnotes, a good killer doesn&#39;t leave any traces

### Alignments

_Defeat all the Derse Trolls that hide among you._
