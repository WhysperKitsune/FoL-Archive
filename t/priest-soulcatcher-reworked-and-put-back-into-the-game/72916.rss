    <description>Priest (Social Blue Dragon) 
[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
Passive: Old spirit, You will gain the passive of the class you used at night it will fade after that night (This wouldn&#39;t effect royal blood due to it only lasting that night, and that&#39;s stupid)
Day Ability: Last thoughts, Learn the last results of a dead player the next night, doesn&#39;t learn anything to do with how they died. (2 uses)
Night Ability: Deads blessing, use the power of a dead blue dragon member, you cannot use this on the same dead person, cannot be unique, you cannot use direct killing abilities.
Night Ability(2): Holy Barrier, Make someone Immune to conversion, framing and occupation (2 uses)

            <p>Also Auto confirm-ability isn’t going to be a thing, Cannot use Unique classes (Like Mystic for that exact reason), I’ll have to look into everything a little more.</p>
<p>Also yeah the second ability isn’t social on priest if anyone wants to come up with a good idea for the second ability that sounds good, but remember classes can do things outside there class type aka chronomancer being a support that can kill</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Changes Made:</p>
<p>New Passive (removed the old one)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive: Old spirit, You will gain the passive of the class you used at night it will fade after that night (This wouldn’t effect royal blood due to it only lasting that night, and that’s stupid, with Knight you will survive first defend just like them)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This removes anything to do with there death, aka poss jump, killed to posions ect, and will only figure out there last results, aka sheriff finding someone as unseen or physician healing someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability: Last thoughts, Learn the last results of a dead player the next night, doesn’t learn anything to do with how they died. (2 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also Priest/Soulcatcher cannot use direct killing abilities but can use Defend, because it’s not direct.</p>

            <p>I like the idea, however, maybe make it so it takes weaker versions of dead abilities so it isn’t too OP.</p>
<p>E.g If a phys is dead he can heal bleed/poison but not attacks.</p>

<p>This kind of ability (where it doesn’t have a skill basis, it just auto activates) is inherently poor design. Make this a day ability to make a target unseen not suspicious to investigative results.</p>

<hr>
<p>All in all, this class on the unseen end seems entirely fair (with a few tweaks).</p>
<p>However, the BD version is a cause for concern, specifically because of the potential of the auto-confirm depending on which classes die. It also has abilities a social class should not have.</p>

            <p>Mainly from perspective. Reap is an EXTREMLY powerful ability as it takes away a vote and keeps it as the same amount of votes needed till majority, and I only find it acceptable for reaper to have imo.<br>
imagine a reaper and this in the same game</p>

            <p>How? It’s 2 uses though, so it’s not like it will be on every kill.  It’s similar to Defile and Disguise.</p>

            <p>What’s OP about it?  The only thing that I dislike about it is Dark Curse, and that’s because it’s redundant(Timesnatcher and duchess both have a very similar ability)</p>
