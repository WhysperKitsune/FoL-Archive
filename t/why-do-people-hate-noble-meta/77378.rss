    <title>Why do people hate Noble Meta?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-do-people-hate-noble-meta/77378</link>
    <description>I mean, it&#39;s good confirmation for:

Knights on the king (Knight is already a hard class to prove as)
Healers so that you don&#39;t have to confirm them with heals until very later.
Princesses who use Will-o-Whisp on king.
Nobles who confirm this.
Any investigative that get redirected to the king

This by itself is already 5 ways it can confirm people.

And if a sell sword is on the king, bam. Proven SS ingame and anyone who was on the king is probably good.</description>

            <p>Basically, your fake gossip will last for as long as no one disputes it – so if I put N1 - Gossip 1 - 1xprot, 2xDNR, 1xDND, and there are two knights, they’ll both think ‘Okay, I was on the king, so that’s correct.’</p>

            <p>oh yeah I agree twin is cheese … practically an exploit</p>
<p>i was just talking about gossip. now i do agree gossip is way easier to fake than follow. actually follow would be unimaginably more difficult.  but faking the n1 gossip would still be too difficult to actually do, maybe you could get a trade with it but it’s not like you can reliably correctly guess the number of healers, chronos, and knights on king n1 to “confirm” yourself</p>
<p>however that said i see your point now that the twin to distinguish real from fake gossips is game breaking</p>

            <p>The Noble Meta only really matters when the noble is half decent.<br>
Its a social class so they’re supposed to talk. If a Noble is completely silent sure you confirm them with the noble twin but they have to be aggressive. I was just in a game with a noble who didn’t claim or confirm anybody and got REKT because when I(as hunter) asked for his class twice on both days he didn’t reply.<br>
That said if the Noble is really good then it feels oppressive. Its entire class can confirm so many people. And if the noble is willing to share that information can really help BD make the right decisions in trying to scum read.</p>

            <p>not therefore.</p>
<p>Effectiveness and fun are not directly correlated. Although they do share common variables.</p>
<p>Meta’s form because they are effective. Many meta’s are unfun such as the whisper claim meta’s and now noble meta.</p>
<p>Others are fine, such as log formatting and the optimal reaction to an outed prince.</p>
<p>And others still are debated to this day such as VFR.</p>
<p>Generally the unfun meta’s are the ones that disallow players to make unique plays on either side. But since restricting what moves that scum can do tends to be a good idea Meta’s that go against that form. Not all meta’s are like that and so they aren’t all bad, but the good one’s don’t get talked about because no one complains about them.</p>
<p>This is all highly subjective, but just understand that while effectiveness CAN be unfun doesn’t mean it’s NECESSARILY unfun. But when it does people notice and it sucks.</p>

            <p>You’re right. But Noble meta is more effective therefore it’s bad in terms of fun.</p>

            <p>Duh. But effectiveness is not the only metric by which we judge a meta.</p>

            <p>I agree, but you will still agree that it’s a pretty effective META to get people to claim.</p>
