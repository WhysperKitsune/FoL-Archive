          <p><em>An ill wind sweeps over Castle Adiart this Autumn. Commoners found dead in their homes, their bodies mangled beyond recognition. Rumours of hulking monstrosities stalking the night and ancient curses mount as the days go by; the existence of something truly wicked, beyond the machinations of the Cult or the Unseen, becoming impossible for the King to deny.</em></p>
<p><em>The Prince is found dead in the castle hallways, bitten and exsanguinated. The King has no other choice but to summon the reclusive Monster Hunters to Castle Adiart, certain that supernatural evil has infiltrated their midst.</em></p>
<p><em>Will the Blue Dragon survive the monsters that prowl the night?</em></p>
<p>So I had an idea for a themed event ranging from October 1st to November 30th, based around the classic monsters of horror.</p>
<p><font color="darkgreen"><em><strong>The Setup</strong></em></font></p>
<p>1 <font color="stetblue">Good King</font>.<br>
1 - 2 <font color="cyan">Monster Hunters</font>.<br>
7 - 8 <font color="stetblue">Random Blue Dragon</font> (Other than Prince, Sheriff or Paladin).<br>
1 <font color="gray">Scorned</font> (Frame makes the target appear Neutral instead of Cult/Unseen).<br>
1 <font color="darkred">Vampire</font>.<br>
1 <font color="red">Werewolf</font>.<br>
1 <font color="green">Mad Scientist</font>.<br>
1 <font color="tan">Creature</font>.<br>
1 <font color="gold">Mummy</font>.</p>
<p><font color="darkorange"><em><strong>The Classes</strong></em></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="slate"><strong>Suggested Feedback Messages for the Monster Hunter:</strong></font></p>
<p><em>A Vampire attempted to bite you but your garlic poisoned them instead!</em><br>
<em>A Werewolf attacked you but your silver dagger saved you! You are now bleeding.</em><br>
<em>A Mad Scientist attacked you but your potion saved you! You are now bleeding.</em><br>
<em>Your amulets saved you from the Curse of the Mummy! You are now poisoned.</em><br>
<em>A Creature attempted to attack you but your fire held them at bay!</em></p>
<p><font color="darkviolet"><strong>Design Notes</strong></font></p>
<p>The KPN <em>should</em> be roughly equal to Unseen/Cult + NK. The Vampire and Werewolf are the main killing roles and their abilities alternate, giving the Monsters roughly 1 KPN until Night 4, where it can be anywhere from 1 to 3 KPN depending on coordination/luck (this slow start is intended, as BD does not get Prince under this setup). The Mad Scientist and the Mummy are also designed to alternate with each other, with the Mad Scientist redirecting people into the Mummy when Curse of the Mummy is active, and Harvesting Organs in the off-days.</p>
<p>The Vampire is designed to put a lot of pressure on Physicians, who no longer have a clear Innoculation target, to avoid having a Physician always pocketing a valuable/confirmed target. While the Vampire stays alive, the Physicians should feel like they’re rushing to save people every single night and Self-Healing means letting someone die.</p>
<p>The Werewolf is designed as a very “loud” killer that creates claimspace for the rest of the Monsters. They’re a big priority for BD and can draw a lot of heat off the other Monsters.</p>
<p>The Mad Scientist and the Creature are designed to generate chaos and disruption, to prevent BD from easily and cleanly checking/killing sus claims systematically. The Creature can win with BD and their protective abilities make them a questionable asset, but their dangerous nature can end up backfiring on them.</p>
<p>The Mad Scientist is a lurking threat. They play somewhat similar to an Alchemist and can easily claim Drunk (though the lack of Royal Blood will give them away) and they work best when they can coordinate with other evils. Interesting to note is that, while the Creature wants to get the Mad Scientist killed asap, the Mad Scientist is tempted to keep the Creature around to increase the KPN. A dangerous gamble, of course, as it weakens their claim considerably, but such is the price to pay for extra kills.</p>
<p>The Mummy is designed as a coordinator type. The Vampire can broadcast something they found the previous night (for example, if they found a Monster Hunter) and the Werewolf can discern who to avoid, but it’s the Mummy that has the most potential to bring everyone together on the same page. Their powerful daytime abilities and accurate night-time results justify why they’re the Monster with the least protection.</p>

<p>Maybe it could be given another night ability that allows them to learn their targets class.  Also, rampage shouldn’t have a cooldown.  It’s not that powerful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Already existing != balanced.  Sheriff and paladin need a few changes(they just need to be merged into a single class).  Using that logic, the old priest was balanced just because it existed.  And paladin and sheriff are soft counters, not hard counters(with the exception of smite, but smite needs a rework).  Your monster hunter is more of a hardcounter.</p>

<p>Which ones would you say are too complex? Werewolf, Mummy and Monster Hunter seem fairly straightforward to me. The only classes I’d personally call complex are Vampire, Mad Scientist and Creature, and even then their complexity comes more from the interactions they have (especially passively) rather than their active abilities.</p>
<p>I could try to trim some of the complexity, if you let me know where you think it’s excessive.</p>

<p>What I meant is that it shouldn’t be a timed event.</p>

</aside>
<p>I would love for this to be a permanent game mode, but I’m being realistic. There’s probably not a big enough playerbase to sustain 2 ongoing game modes, or else they wouldn’t have retired Casual Mode to Custom Games only. A timed Special Event can draw more players to the game and sustain two healthy queues until the novelty fades.</p>

<p>Maybe it could be given another night ability that allows them to learn their targets class. Also, rampage shouldn’t have a cooldown. It’s not that powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In my original design, Rampage bypassed healing, but it felt a bit too strong, so I removed it before posting it here. Giving it a cooldown keeps the graveyard from filling up with unknown deaths that provide no logs info. I wouldn’t be opposed to giving Rampage a slight boost to make it more powerful, rather than removing the cooldown.</p>
<p>I also wouldn’t be opposed to giving Remembrance a slight utility buff, like letting the werewolf show up as the remembered class to investigations for that night?</p>

<p>Already existing != balanced. Sheriff and paladin need a few changes(they just need to be merged into a single class). Using that logic, the old priest was balanced just because it existed. And paladin and sheriff are soft counters, not hard counters(with the exception of smite, but smite needs a rework). Your monster hunter is more of a hardcounter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see where you’re coming from, but having some form of counter to the evils (whether soft or hard) is important for the game. For now, I’ll leave it as-is, but I wouldn’t be opposed to reworking the Monster Hunter if more people share that opinion. If the consensus is that it’s an unfun class that needs a rework, I’ll try to come up with something that fits the concept flavourfully and performs the necessary mechanics for the gamemode.</p>

<p>Vampire and Creature.  They need less conditional effects.<br>
Mind Control Serum shouldn’t have an affect on only the Creature.  Class-specific abilities/interactions are bad.</p>
