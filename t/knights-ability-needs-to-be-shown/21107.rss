    <description>Being a Knight on the stand is a death sentence. When Knight guards someone it should say the same as the merc one, &quot;A Knight guarded you tonight&quot;. Only way of proving yourself as Knight is when Sheriff invests you, but conversions happen and BD tends to not want to wait one more night for possible unseen to kill again.</description>

            <p>The game is meant to deduce. You can’t deduce when it’s guaranteed the claim is fake. Be real. Most classes shouldn’t be auto confirmed. Imo, king should be the only confirmed claim. Use your team and actually determine what people are. Everything now is a huge crutch for the unintelligent and lazy.</p>
<p>People forget it’s a social deduction game…just hand everything to me is the mentality right now. Everyone wants instant confirmation on investigations and instant confirmation of someone’s claim.</p>

            <p>Most knights don’t live to see a cold steel go out successfully. Let’s be honest here. DKs have a higher success rate on cold steel…</p>

            <p>Yeah, the raw point of the game is most roles HAVE to be hard/impossible to confirm. especially the killer/offensive category.</p>

            <p>Don’t just guard king for 6 nights is usually a good start. Typically, the silent/scummy people claim knight and die. The best defence is to be VERY loud during the day. Bait the attacks, as knight is not especially valuable. If you have strong suspicion on a player, Cold Steel them.</p>
