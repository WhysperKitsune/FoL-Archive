    <description>

**Name - Parasite** 
**_Faction - Neutral_** 
**_Type - Killer._** 


**Special notes**: The host will know that they have been infected by a parasite. They now will have to work together to win. If you take a host then the host will appear as Killer to all results

**Passive 1:**
_**Stuck inside**_ - if your original body dies then you will still be able to use your abilities. But you will not be able to chat or vote. If your host dies then you die too. 

**Passive 2:**
_**Second thoughts**_ - you will know what your host is doing. If you don&#39;t pick a host on three days then you will die. 

**Day Ability 1:**
_**A new home**_ - pick someone to become your host. (1 use)

**Day Ability 2:**  
_**Taking care of my body**_ - heal your host tonight (4 uses)


**Night ability 1:**
_**Infection**_ - infect a person. The next night Anyone who visit him or if he visits anyone else, they will also be infected.  After that the next day all of them will die(2 uses). Can&#39;t target King directly but if someone visits king then he will be infected. 

Ex;
Night 1 - parasite infects 4
Night 2 - 4 visits 5, 9 visits 4. 
Day 3 - 4,5,9 all die. 



**Night ability 2:**
_**Hunger**_ - feast on a player, killing them. (If your original body dies then your host body will do the killing, meaning if an observer is watching, he will see your host commit the murder and not you) (infinite uses)

**Win condition** - kill ever main faction and win with your host body</description>

            <p>Please explain more. If it makes sense then probrably the parasite should only be allowed to go into a BD’s member body only.</p>

            <p>What happens if your host is a Unseen/Cult would be really unfair for them to have that happen.</p>
