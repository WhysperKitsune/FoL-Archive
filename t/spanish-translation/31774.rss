    <title>Spanish translation?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/spanish-translation/31774</link>
    <description>Just wondering if spanish translation is planned for the future or at least into consideration. I&#39;d love to play this with my friends but none of them speak english. This was probably asked before but I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere so I had to ask, all I found was that several translations were planned as a kickstarter stretch goal but since it wasn&#39;t reached Im wondering if there is still hope for it.</description>

            <p>Ehhhh, since most ppl speak english who play, you can’t really do so as you still have to conversate in English. I mean changing the ingame language is not that big of a job I guess, but according to the rules, you must talk in English.</p>
