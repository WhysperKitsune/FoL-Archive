    <title>Sorc Day Abilities Rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorc-day-abilities-rework/54668</link>
    <description>The idea is to make Sorc hard to find by Blue Dragon, but easy for Inquisitor.

Remove Magic Dust, change Magic Cloak to:

**Magic Cloak (2 uses):**  Select a Blue Dragon class.  Tonight, Blue Dragon players who target you will receive feedback as if you were the chosen class (regarding occupation immunity, class type, visits, and faction).

Now Inq cannot be fooled as to who is a magic user.</description>

            <p>That’s the main problem with inquisitor though.  No class deserves a hardcounter, regardless of how easy their win condition is.  And inquisitor is much easier to win as than sorcerer, they don’t even have to do anything most of the time.</p>

            <p>I like that, but I don’t think you need to select a class, you could get the same effect with something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Magic Cloak (2 uses)</strong>: Your visits will be hidden tonight. People that try to occupy you will believe they succeeded. You will appear as a Blue Dragon Support class if checked.</p>
<p>This would get the same effect, since by choosing the class you will almost always try to select a BD support class. However, I don’t think magic dust should be removed.</p>

            <p>Magic dust was always useful, i mean you can remove a use of ruthless efficiency. So then you can always waste a day or a use.</p>
