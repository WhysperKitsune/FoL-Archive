    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-bastard-remake/51351</link>
    <description>

**Lore**: You slowly realized that you&#39;re father was caring less and less about the war between BD and Unseen. As you accuse him of staying neutral in the war, he gets furious and exiles you from the kingdom.  You swear that you will come back and kill your family for what they did. 


&gt;**Name - The Bastard (Fallen Prince)**
_**Faction - neutral**_ 
_**Type - offense**_

&gt;**Passive 1**: _**hidden in the chamber**_ - you hide in the jail the first time someone tries to attack you, making you immune to death once.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2:** _**taking what’s mine**_ - when the original prince dies then you may choose to kill anyone with your night ability &quot;_execute_&quot;
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability 1**: _**imprison**_ - jail a player at night, when you speak, you will appear as prince (unlimited uses).
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability 2:**  - _**Lost the keys**_ - keep a player in prison tonight having them not participate the next day(you will be able to talk to them as normal). The player will only here people talk but can not see votes, be able to vote, or talk for the day.(3 uses)
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 1**: _**execution**_;
&gt; - execute the player in jail. (1 uses).
&gt;- (If the prince is dead) kill anyone (unlimited uses) _[if you kill someone without royal blood then you are not able to execute anymore, but is still able to jail]_
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2**: _**lit candle**_ - lite a candle revealing yourself to the prisoner. When you speak then you&#39;ll be shown as the bastard instead of just prince. 

&gt;**Mechanics** - this class can be jailed interrupting any day abilities. This class cannot jail the prince. You will be given a message that _&quot;[player name]_ is the prince&quot;. If both the prince and bastard jail the same person then the prince will succeed and the bastard will get a message saying _&quot;[player name] was taken away before you could jail them&quot;._

&gt;**Win condition** - Kill anyone with royal blood and the starting king.

Extra lore: you are not given royal blood because your family doesn&#39;t consider you one of their own.</description>

            <p>Could even change the name to “The Bastard” and make him an envious outcast of his half brother, the prince.</p>

            <p>This is a remake to a class I suggested a long time ago. I made some changes to the class and hopefully it should be good now. Tell me what you think.</p>
