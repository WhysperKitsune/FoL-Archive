    <description>In ToS everyone says report someone for the smallest things most I am not enough sure you can report for such a thing.

I was hoping at some point in the game&#39;s development you would a section in game so everyone could view the rules and know what they can all be banned for and what people can&#39;t be as well</description>

            <p>Would love to have this. It’s good to have the rules easily accessible. In ToS it was rare for people to show signs they have ever read the rules.</p>
