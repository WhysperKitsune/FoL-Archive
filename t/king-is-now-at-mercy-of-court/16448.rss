    <description>What the hell did you do to the king?! He is now 99% useless....except for that ONE time he gets to exe someone....Now, as king, you get to listen to a hundred whispers, with NO WAY to confirm any info given to you yourself. I have over 100 hours playing up until this patch, but nerfing the king, the ruler of the fucking realm, was a lame and bad move. Like many of my friends, I will check back after you fix this travesty.</description>

            <p>Yeah there is no counter claim to King calling you out.</p>
<p>You can say you’re framed, but no one will ever buy that given just the statistical odds of it, nor should they.</p>
<p>And even an evil king isn’t likely to fake a claim like that since they’ll die for it.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I also massively hated the reversal of it. I always enjoy the contest of claims in these games, you are accused, you go up, you put up your logs, demand your accuser put up his so people can compare which one seems more credible… everyone second guesses whether the accuser is a scorned, unseen etc…</p>
<p>Or you get put up by the king… you know normally in these kinds of games it’s considered gamethrowing not to put up a defence, but if you are accused by the king, there’s really no point in that formality. It doesn’t matter what your logbook says, or your claim. You are getting executed, end of discussion.</p>

            <p>You know, without the king’s allies ability I thought the game was in a much better place… I’ve heard earlier versions the king didn’t even have the ability and only 3 guards. The games dynamic was so much better and the neuts felt strong now that the king can’t just random spy people and get neuts killed. Made fake BD claims for neuts much stronger.</p>

<p>People will be more inclined to whisper knowing it doesn’t paint a target on them, but since the King might be Evil it balances out a bit.</p>

            <p>Since many people think the King is a whisper mule, why not go tongue-in-cheek and actually empower his whisper mule status, give the king unlimited or limited uses of “Kings Quarters” and make all whispers to and from King hidden from chat.</p>

            <p>I think the new king feels good. Being able to instantly reveal a player’s faction is simply too big of a decisive investigation ability. It leads to some really unfun situations where a random check on night 1-4 gets you executed as an alchemist or a scorned BD or something.</p>
<p>Now the king doesn’t have decisive investigation abilities and actually has to rely on the court  mostly for information. Allies isn’t completely useless though, since common claims for scum are often princess/drunk that you can easily find out if they’re lying. The new allies requires players to work together to socially deduce baddies instead of just getting a lucky check. Or it can outright help an evil king find a suspected prince.</p>
<p>I’d be fine with buffing it a bit since finding royalty isn’t that useful at all, but not putting it back where it was last patch.</p>

            <p>I understand why the king change was made, but I feel like the nerf was too harsh. There’s not really any reason to keep the original king now. Why should knights guard him or healers heal him if he could be any faction and he can’t really do anything aside from force a vote once. The meta I see is killing king and just letting the neutral killer take his place to make it easy for him and the BD. Or just killing king and letting a confirmed BD take his place. What can king even do? Prince and other investigative classes can just carry the game.</p>

            <p>If people are whispering you info there are ways to confirm info, by doing tests and having people use abilities that confirm them.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is there is zero reason to whisper the King in the first place.  You might as well pick a random player and whisper them all your roles than whisper King.  The chance they’ll be evil is lower.</p>

            <p>Agreed, it’s so frustrating to see the king just be a whisper mule and people are just ignoring the king now or wanting to kill the king right away.  I miss the old king of faking out BD if we are good, neutral or evil and faking out the BD by pretending to earn their trust by sacrificing a few scum.</p>

            <p>The original king had only 3 guards and no other night ability at all. And Royal finger had a cooldown</p>

            <p>Agreed. Making the King the chief investigative crutch for players to carry themselves with was a bad idea in the first place. This is much better.</p>

            <p>I gotta say completely the oposite here. To me the key to social deduction games was always the contest of claims for the accuser/accused. IE, is the accuser legitimate, scorned? Cult? Fool? NK trying to act like a scorned?</p>
<p>When the accuser is king, all of that is taken off the table. OK maybe he’s evil king, but even an evil king wouldn’t want to look evil early game, so that’s off the table. There’s no social deduction at all, if you are one of the first 4 checked, and you aren’t BD, you die… no if’s ands or buts. To me that is kind of pure luck, with no social deduction whatsoever.</p>

            <p>What the hell did you do to the king?! He is now 99% useless…except for that ONE time he gets to exe someone…Now, as king, you get to listen to a hundred whispers, with NO WAY to confirm any info given to you yourself. I have over 100 hours playing up until this patch, but nerfing the king, the ruler of the fucking realm, was a lame and bad move. Like many of my friends, I will check back after you fix this travesty.</p>
