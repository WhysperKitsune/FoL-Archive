          <p>“I seek justice for my family,and I will  find it.”<br>
One night, a young boy heard doors opening while everyone in his family was sleeping.<br>
He got scared and ran into pantry.<br>
He closed the door and was peaking from the keyhole.<br>
Few moments later, he heard loud screams,and a stabbing sound.<br>
He was shocked so hard,he wasn’t able to talk.<br>
What he saw after some time was a black shadow,which was moving fast and agile.<br>
After some time, he heard door closing.<br>
After he was sure murderer was gone,he decided to get out of the pantry,and called for help.<br>
Soon enough,few Nobles appeared,asked the boy what happened.<br>
He lead them inside,and soon as they saw a horrific scene,they decided to discuss about who did it.<br>
After they ended their discussion and left the house,boy was left alone.<br>
No parents to care about him,no knowledge to live alone.<br>
Two days and two nights later,words about the crime that happened,reached King.<br>
He sent one of his loyal guards for the boy.<br>
Boy was scared and confused why would King want him,but he still went with the guard to the castle.<br>
Soon as they reached King’s doors,guard stopped boy and waited till the King came out.<br>
“Is he the one who were people talking about?” , asked the King.<br>
“Yes,my King.” , Answered the Guard.<br>
Then,King turned to the boy,and asked him :<br>
“Tell me,young boy,did you see any parts of that evil deed?”<br>
“N-no,my noble King,but…”<br>
“But what?”<br>
“I saw killer’s face. He had sky blue eyes,but a bone-shattering look. Also,he had a mark on his hand.”<br>
“And what did that mark look alike?”<br>
“Like a rose. A dark,purple rose.”<br>
King soon wishpered to the Guard :<br>
“Search for our Sheriff and make him take the boy with himself.”<br>
King then asked the boy :<br>
“Did you see anything else?”<br>
“N-no,my King.”<br>
At that moment,Guard came in with Sheriff.<br>
Then,King said :<br>
“Ivo,our noble Sheriff,you will take care of this child,and teach him your ways. You won’t pay taxes,as a reward.”<br>
Young boy jumped into conversation with a question :<br>
“What’s Sheriff?”<br>
King then answered :<br>
“It’s a person who finds evildoers,like Unseen,and brings them to justice. I know you surely want to revenge your family,don’t you,my child?”<br>
“Yes,I do,and i won’t stop until I find who did that to me and my family!”<br>
“Farewell,my child.Ivo,take good care of him,and learn him to be filled with justice,same as you.”<br>
“Yes,my noble King.” , answered Ivo.<br>
As years were passing by,boy was growing and learning more and more,until he was ready.<br>
Ivo was too old for being Sheriff,so the man decided to take his place as King’s loyal Sheriff.<br>
He went to the castle,and soon as he entered castle,he noticed something that was Butler doing.<br>
Butler was pouring green liquid that looked dangerous into King’s drink.<br>
He also noticed something suspicious about Butler.<br>
He had a mark on his left arm.<br>
A mark that looked like a dark,purple Rose.<br>
He didn’t reveal as future Sheriff to Butler,he only asked where King’s room is.<br>
“Oh,come with me.I’m comming to the King’s room now,so you can come with me as well.”<br>
They walked upstairs where guards were waiting.<br>
One of them asked him :<br>
“Who sent you here?”<br>
“Ivo,the retired Sheriff.”<br>
Guard stepped back,and Butler opened door.<br>
Then the man and the Butler stepped inside.<br>
“Oh hello,I haven’t seen you in a while.” , said the King with a smile on his face.<br>
“Yes,my noble King. I’ve come to serve you.”<br>
“You may serve me as King’s Sheriff.”<br>
Then,Sheriff turned to Butler who was about to serve the drink to the King,and spilled his drink.<br>
“Why did you do that? That is a royal disgrace!” , said the angry King.<br>
“No,my King,you must understand me. Butler poured something in your drink,and i think he is part of the Unseen. He has a dark purple rose on his hand.”<br>
King asked Butler to leave tray aside,and show his left hand.<br>
Soon as King saw the rose on his hand,he immediatly called guards to put “Butler” in a dungeon.<br>
Then,King turned to the Sheriff and said :<br>
“Thank you for saving my life. I am greatly thankfull to you.”<br>
The Sheriff said :<br>
“That’s my duty,and my goal. To stop all evil,to seek justice and revenge to evildoers.”<br>
Later that day,the Sheriff visited Butler,and looked into his eyes.<br>
Butler had blue eyes.<br>
All of a sudden,Sheriff remembered something that happened to him in the past.<br>
“Is that the killer who killed my whole family? Is this him? Is justice fullfilled?”<br>
Then he went back to the King,and asked :<br>
“May I be the one to execute the traitor?”<br>
King said :<br>
“We already got our executioners,but do as you wish. After all,you did save my life,so I owe you.”<br>
The next day,member of Unseen was executed by Sheriff.<br>
Sheriff was happy that he finally found justice for his family,but he knew something.<br>
He knew,his mission isn’t done.<br>
He knew,he needs to exterminate all evil and bring it to justice.<br>
And with that goal set,Sheriff did his best at seeking and finding evildoers,while saving innocent people.</p>
<p>And that’s how Sheriff became Sheriff.</p>

          <p>It’s a strong idea and a great foundation for someone who will be on the side of justice and immune to being converted by the Unseen. I’d like to see some ways where you can work the Sheriff’s abilities into the story, but that’s obviously hard to do when he is a child.  Perhaps he can witness the existing Sheriff doing his duties. Maybe the child catches a brief glimpse of the murderer through the cabinet doors and can help with the investigation or after the Murder there is a scout that’s present and he is able to give clues to the Sheriff. This could endear the child to the position of Sheriff and make him a hero in the boy’s eyes.</p>
<p>Just a few things to think about.  I would’t worry about the English too much.  You seem to have a good grasp on the language and we can definitely help you clean things up once you need help.</p>

          <p>You’ve got plenty of room for expansion.  The first lore I posted today was over 1,000 words. If it’s good, people will read it. If it’s too long, you can always work on making it shorter. Whenever I’m writing, I try not to worry about length too much. No point in getting slowed down by details that can be fixed as you revise.</p>
<p>Focus on the characters and their motivations. Create an outline, if necessary, to help keep yourself on track.  And most importantly, enjoy what you’re doing. That’s key.</p>
