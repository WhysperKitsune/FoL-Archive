            <h1>Night</h1>
<h2>Scavenging</h2>
<p>Players will be given a list of locations to potentially scavenge. Some locations may be convered by the <strong>Fog of War</strong>. Only one player per shelter may scavenge.<br>
Players will scavenge at the location they chose. They will have 10 minutes to get items and leave.<br>
10 seconds distance to the exit will be added for every turn moved.<br>
If the scavenger’s time expires or TR (time remaining) - DtE (Distance to Exit) = &lt;_0 the scavenger will become <strong>lost</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lost</strong></p>
<p>A 1d10 will be rolled.</p>
<p>If the dice rolls one, the scavenger will instantly die.</p>
<p>If the dice rolls two or three, the scavenger will be put under a trial. Success in the trial will have the scavenger emerge injured inside the shelter. Failure will cause the scavenger to become seriously injured in the shelter.</p>
<p>If the dice rolls a four or five, the scavenger will be put under a trial. Success in the trial will have the scavenger emerge unscathed inside the shelter. Failure will cause the scavenger to emerge injured.</p>
<p>If the dice rolls anything else, the scavenger will return home safely.</p>
<h2>Defending</h2>
<p>Defending your shelter is a primary mechanic during the night. If you are raided and don’t assign anyone to defend your shelter more resources will be stolen. Some people on defense may be injured however you have a chance to save your resources.</p>
<h2>Sleeping</h2>
<p>Sleeping allows your party to increase your tiredness level by one. Sleep is a priority for scavengers as without it you will become exhausted, limiting your ability to <strong>scavenge</strong> and <strong>defend</strong>.</p>
