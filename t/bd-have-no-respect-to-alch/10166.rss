    <description>they only think if they will win but not you an alch will also win. whatever how much you did to help them they just use you as a tool in the end of game and throw you to test the others even there is no point to do so. they don&#39;t even try to care if you are alive or not, they just throw you to the exe and laugh at you because you are just an alch. I don&#39;t like to be treated like this I get salted.</description>

            <p>I was in a game last night and 5 players where left one of which was alch , and it had got to a bit of a stalemate , I couldn’t understand why the alch didn’t simply stop healing bd and kill someone .<br>
He was being very loyal to the bd until the bitter end . If he just flipped he would of won instantly .</p>
<p>This kind of behaviour is not normal for an alchemist , it nearly cost him the game . If he had just killed the last bd rather than heal him the game would quickly end .</p>
<p>Unseen often throw alchemist under the bus , but not when they have control of the game . If someone wants to hang an alchemist I am all onboard with that as cult unseen and will get on the neuts out bus . It means one of my guys isn’t getting hung this turn .<br>
Although if I don’t think BD have the number to get alchemist hung themselves then I wont hang the alchemist . Instead Ill point at a BD and start a run on him . Late game the alchemist should get on board with the lynching . If it get through the land should keep sliding .</p>

            <p>I have noticed if you instead decide to help unseen, they will rarely betray you, but for some reasons BD will gladly throw you under the buss. Kinda weird since in the end, its the same players.</p>

            <p>In my experience Alchs will back the King, regardless of their allegiance.  Also they keep bleeds and poisons from killing people.  Unseen and Cult usually want them dead and soon if possible.  Unseen can’t easily turn them, they can’t offer protection after all and the Alch can just turn on them and survive.</p>
<p>Now Yolo Alchs… just kill them imo.</p>

            <p>They’re an extra vote for unseen late game. And if unseen are smart and convince alch, he can be an extra 2 kills late game for unseen.</p>
<p>Not to mention YOLO Alchs.</p>

            <p>Alch will always be a two edged sword. While I always try to save them, I completely understand why people hang them.</p>
