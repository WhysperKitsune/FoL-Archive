    <title>Poss facelifted victims appear white</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/poss-facelifted-victims-appear-white/37679</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I disconnected and reconnected due to bad connection and a &quot;Knight&quot; who had died had his class name appear white instead of blue, we later found out he was actually a poss who jumped. He was the only dead person with a white name.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
His class name should&#39;ve appeared blue since poss used facelift. I was the only one seeing this the others saw it as normal.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Im not sure how to reproduce it but I guess you should disconnect and reconnect at the end of a night when poss jumped?

#### Comments:
Although this might be a rare bug I believe it can be exploited since it basically tells you if the person who died was a possessor or not.</description>
