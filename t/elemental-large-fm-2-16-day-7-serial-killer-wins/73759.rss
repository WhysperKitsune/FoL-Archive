Days will be 72 hours long, or shorter if majority is reached. Nights will be 24 hours long.
Lynches are majority and plurality, no lynch is an option.
Mafia have both a day and night chat.
The Mafia have an assigned factional kill.
If one of the members of the mafia dies, another one will assume their element as well as their own, and they may choose between the two elements they have to attack with. 
When you receive your classcard, you have 24 hours to confirm you have received it.
There is a day one lynch.
There are no journals or logs of any kind.
Elemental Doctors can only heal an attack if it is of the same element as their chosen element that night.
The element of a goon is not revealed upon their flip. If a goon dies, they will be revealed as Elemental Goon.

<p>Water. Earth. Fire. Serial Killing.</p>
<p>Long ago, the four scum lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Mafia attacked.</p>
<p>Only <a class="mention" href="/u/solic">@Solic</a>, tracker of all four elements, could stop them. But when the forum needed him most, he vanished.</p>
<p>A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Tracker, a townie named Geyde, and although his scumreading skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he’s ready to save anyone.</p>
<p>But I believe Geyde can save the forum.</p>
