<blockquote>
<p>as long as you have the upper hand</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For me, this is the issue. Once you lose the upper hand, if the Alch is alive, BD is in a really tight spot. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>No guarantee of BD King - many Alchs will simply be the King’s gopher, no matter the faction.</li>
<li>If Evils don’t start dying quickly, siding with Evil/Neuts starts quickly looking more attractive to Alch</li>
<li>Alch can <em>say</em> they’re healing BD when they are not in an attempt to stay neutral.</li>
<li>Alchemists are completely unreliable late game and can turn on you for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying “Neuts out”, always kill Neuts, etc. Of course it depends on the situation. If there is any other credible lead, I’d obviously try to exe an Evil over an Alch. All I’m saying is that I’m perfectly willing to kill Alchemists early for the reasons above.</p>

            <p>Why? You’re killing a healer.</p>
<p>They can be turned, but generally as long as you have the upper hand, they can prevent BD losses and can’t be converted. The only reason to kill them is if they decide to yolo bomb you.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have reason to believe they are fake claiming, you should certainly kill them.</p>
<p>The extra healer is worth having someone who could flip around.</p>

</aside>
<p>I disagree. I usually vote to exe Alchemists because they will always turn on you when it would benefit them. That malleability and unreliability is the heart of Neutral classes.</p>

            <p>Although if it is to survive, then I think this would be more suitable instead of the Tricks of the Trade Passive.</p>
<p>Trickery: (D) (2)<br>
Make yourself Night Immune tonight.</p>
<p>This way, it’s not a guaranteed Night Immunity once, but he can choose to be night immune twice. And there’s more strategy, as the Accomplice can choose to either Snitch or use Trickery that night.</p>

            <p>Not quite what I had in mind. Also 2 problems.</p>
<p>1: Neutrals are not leaders. Especially the non-NK ones</p>
<p>2: That’s far more arbitrary than what I had and thus harder to remember.</p>
<p>How do you determine if someone is a leader? That’s not a trait of the class itself. For example I consider the hunter a leader and yet it’s not on your list.</p>

            <p>Would this work?</p>
<p>Survive to see only leaders of each faction be alive.</p>
<p>Leaders:<br>
Neutral Killer<br>
Mastermind<br>
Cult Leader<br>
King<br>
Prince</p>
<p>Even then, I still feel that a simple win con like<br>
“Survive to see the Blue Dragon fall” is perfectly fine too.</p>
<p>Scorned, Fool, these are Neutral classes that are 95% of the time bad for the Blue Dragon. It wouldn’t be devestating for the Accomplice to be part of this group too in my opinion. And I suspect that the BD has the highest win rate currently.</p>

            <p>Survival ones are boring though, so should we go down the line for win cons?</p>

            <p>I may be willing to debate the wincon. But I am not going with a survival wincon. That would accomplish NONE of the goals I am trying to achieve with this class.</p>

<p>What if the Accomplice’s goal is to ensure a Neutral Killer wins?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s also a huge buff to NK - NK should be alone at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>I’d say <strong>Goal: To survive until the end of the game.</strong></p>
<p>It works for Alch, it could work for Accomplice. Accomplice could put her efforts toward helping whoever she chooses. It would feel very different to play than the Alchemist.</p>
