    <description>Physician have no way to prove himself... It is bad especially in Cult games, when you cannot do literally anything to prove yourself, because bleeding may be healed by 2 physicians and 2 alchemists, and noone knows who actually healed. This is very annoying, when noone believes you if you are converted YET or you are still TO BE converted ;p</description>

            <p>First of all, who tracks who is talking in dead chat? On top of that who, that is living, tracks dead chat? It’s white noise. How many games have you known there was a dk even with talking? So many people go ago during dead chat. It’s impossible to determine that for confirmation.</p>
<p>Hell even now without the DK stating he just got revived no-one knows there is one.</p>

            <p>unfortunately that problem exists regardless. You’ve got 3 dead BD, chatting it up in dead chat. Bob suddenly stops talking in dead chat… and then the phys announces that he resed bob. Not talking does the same as talking. It puts a falsifiable claim that is auto debunked if a psychic is present. If it were a lie, bob would tell the psychic that night, if it’s true the other dead would tell the psychic bob was almost certainly revived.</p>

            <p>I think talking to dead needs to be removed. Death knight killing people based on the dead’s information is fine, but not if they can confirm the phys to psychic</p>

            <p>I think DK shouldn’t be confirmable as to allow phys fake claims. To the dead is fine as long as the psychic is dead</p>

            <p>An announcement to the other dead seems right, though–I don’t think we get that now? At least a system message in chat.</p>
<p>I DK’ed the other night and picked up all kinds of info by not telling any dead and listening to them talk game. I’d think a ghost would notice if the ghost next to them suddenly hulked out and grew armor.</p>

            <p>Dk is already extremely strong because he can talk to the dead and anyone who just died and can out evil. No deduction involved there. Just tell DK that player X was checked as unseen. He kills them. No thought process at all.</p>

            <p>This only works if you are the solo healer. If someone claims to heal someone and someone else dispute it and claims they healed. You will die immediately. Happens every game.</p>
<p>I like that physician isn’t confirmable but at the same time I do agree DK should be able to be seen. Only for the reason of I want to know if I have to outplay him or not. Your strategy is different depending on if someone is a DK. This is because dead have a LOT of useful info, especially when dead evil start blabbing and don’t know there is a DK. I really dislike the dead talking or interacting with alive players mechanic.</p>

            <p>You seem to miss the point of the game… roles being able to “prove themselves” takes away the game. IMO if anything there’s too many roles that are too hard to fake claim, we really didn’t need physician being made one of them during that time.</p>
