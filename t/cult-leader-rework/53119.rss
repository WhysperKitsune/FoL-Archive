    <title>Cult Leader Rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cult-leader-rework/53119</link>
    <description>Cult Leader (Special)

Day ability 1 - Rupture: Cause a player to bleed, they will die in 2 nights unless healed. (4 uses) (unchanged)

Day ability 2 - Rattle: Cause a player to silently lose their day abilities. A use will count upon trying the day ability and every player can only be Rattled once. This includes Prince. (4 uses) 

Night ability 1 - Brainwash: Attempt to Convert a player to the Cult. (unchanged)

Night ability 2 - Eradicate: Kill two targeted players. Can target cult even at 0 or more uses to sacrifice them. (3 uses) 

Sacrificing the following cult roles will have the following additional effects to gaining 2 extra eradicate uses:
Ritualist: Will become a cult DK with the same powers as a BD DK, except CS now kills upon hitting cult.
Invoker: Every class except the cult, will be occupied the following night. Does not go through occupy immunity.
Seeker: The identity of the Prince and NK will be made known to the cult.
Apostle: There cannot be a vote the next day similar to the fool/BD king execution.

Simply an idea to bring the sacrificial aspect of the Cult back, alongside a way to finally make day abilities less of a instaprove and have a possible defense for scum claiming psychic/noble/butler or so. Let me know what you think.</description>

            <p>I tried to sacrifice a Ritualist yesterday because I knew they were getting jailed and executed.  I didn’t get any more eradicate charges so I guess it doesn’t work on jailed targets.</p>

            <p>I disagree, I thought that was actually one of the least overpowered ones. Any suspicious claims can be occupied/jailed/excuted/CS’ed/wolfed, BD has ways to deal with scum aside from execution at day, but this fits the social theme of the Apostle. I do not understand why you people think this is so overpowered. You not only lose one kill attempt of eradicate, you lose a member of your faction too!</p>

            <p>An alternative, if more people are of the opinion the seeker’s sacrifice is OP, reveal all killer classes to the Cult. This will reveal knights/hunters/princes/NK’s, but doesn’t tell the Cult, which is which.</p>

            <p>Now compare that to the other sacrifices and you think that is balanced? Your suggestion is basically one slightly more powerful use of the Seeker’s Gaze. Also there is no way for the target selection to work then as well.</p>

            <p>1 for 1 is typically not worth it in cult games. I have rarely ran out of eradicate uses as well to be honest. So getting more of them is not really that great. In my rework, a prince jail would mean the CL would be prevented visit upon trying to sacrifice, so you wouldn’t be able to suicide accuse in the same manner.</p>
<p>The mere fact that it is a question whether sacrifice has been used in a player’s lifetime should be reason enough to question if it does not need a rework.</p>

            <p>Invoker claims drunk or something and accuses someone of attacking them. CL saccs him. We execute the guy he pointed out. He gets jailed. Prince is occupyed, looses an exe, BD loose their lead and a member and CL gets 2 Erraticates.</p>

            <p>I think sacrifice is useful for a similar reason as dirty work. You use it when you can’t act any more. You get to a full cult and then sacrifice someone so you can convert again.</p>

            <p>You have any other suggestions for a seeker sacrifice then? It needs to be of an investigative nature to fit the theme and it needs to be strong enough to warrant a possible sacrifice at one point ever. An alternative is to make visible all players that can win with Cult.</p>
<p>Can you honestly say you needed to use sacrifice even once since the cult changes? It needs to be “OP” for it to be brought back in some capacity. Can you also elaborate which one and why’d you find them OP? Do you have any alternative suggestions that still give a bonus to sacrifice?</p>

            <p>Cult Leader (Special)</p>
<p>Day ability 1 - Rupture: Cause a player to bleed, they will die in 2 nights unless healed. (4 uses) (unchanged)</p>
<p>Day ability 2 - Rattle: Cause a player to silently lose their day abilities. A use will count upon trying the day ability and every player can only be Rattled once. This includes Prince. (4 uses)</p>
<p>Night ability 1 - Brainwash: Attempt to Convert a player to the Cult. (unchanged)</p>
<p>Night ability 2 - Eradicate: Kill two targeted players. Can target cult even at 0 or more uses to sacrifice them. (3 uses)</p>
<p>Sacrificing the following cult roles will have the following additional effects to gaining 2 extra eradicate uses:<br>
Ritualist: Will become a cult DK with the same powers as a BD DK, except CS now kills upon hitting cult.<br>
Invoker: Every class except the cult, will be occupied the following night. Does not go through occupy immunity.<br>
Seeker: The identity of the Prince and NK will be made known to the cult.<br>
Apostle: There cannot be a vote the next day similar to the fool/BD king execution.</p>
<p>Simply an idea to bring the sacrificial aspect of the Cult back, alongside a way to finally make day abilities less of a instaprove and have a possible defense for scum claiming psychic/noble/butler or so. Let me know what you think.</p>
