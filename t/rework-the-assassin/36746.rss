    <title>[Rework] The Assassin</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rework-the-assassin/36746</link>
    <description>The Assassin (Unseen Killer)

**Passive 1:**
**Steal Herbs** - If you kill a person with healing capabilities you will gain 2 Nightshade. If a person with healing capabilities gets executed you will gain 1 Nightshade. (Original Assassin only.)

This allows the Assassin to have a 2f1 whilst being able to poison more. It also discourages the execution of Alchemists.

**Passive 2:**
**Forage** - If you do not choose to kill anybody you will receive 1 use of Nightshade.

This allows converted Assassins to gain Nightshade.

**Day Ability 1:**
**Nightshade** - Expose a person to deadly nightshade, poisoning them. If not healed they will die within a day. (2 uses) 

Buffing poison allows more worth to Alchemists and not insta executing Physician claims. The amount you have is heavily reduced though.

**Day Ability 1:**
**Blinding Dagger** - Cause a player to go blind for 25 seconds making them miss everything that was said during that time. (2 uses)

Distract was useless and it was not worth using over a poison. Making a player miss a whole 25 seconds worth of text is worth it.

**Night Ability 1:**
**Assassinate** - Attack a player. (Infinite uses)

**Night Ability 2:**
**2 for 1** - Attack 2 players. (1 use)

I believe this will bring more worth to healers, giving the Assassin less boredom and more strategy along with Physicians and Alchemists.

Credit to NOBLE1 for thinking of the idea for “Blinding Sword” (I balanced it a tiny bit.)

<p>That’s better, but it shouldn’t be only for starting assassins</p>
<p>And either change blinding dagger so it is not temporary, or replace it with another ability.  Blinding dagger fits more with a social class anyways.  Here’s a possible ability to replace it: Frenzy(2 uses)- Guarantee that assassinate will kill the target</p>

            <p>I really do like this. It adds a new layer of strategy to the game. Also for the people saying this is bad for new players well it’s the assassin class. You’ll play assassin 90% of the time you get converted because of the system they have. Overall really good</p>

            <p>Assassins are already strong as they are. Buffing Nightshade is pointless in my opinion because it’s already extremly powerful once the healers are dead. And “Blinding Dagger” is basically an empowered Chill which would take out the unique Ability of the Reaper.</p>
<p>In general, i do not like your ideas as Assassin is currently in a very fine position.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think most of these changes needlessly complicate things without much gain. This makes the game a lot less accessible to newbies and assassin is a role any convertable player can become . I also feel unseen is balanced enough as it is. Buffing distract to work under trial, or 20 seconds normally, is the only change that I would advocate for. The version that the player cannot speak to clarify. Blinding dagger seems way too strong and allows for faking being blinding daggered and promotes passivity in BD. It also takes away some of the reaper’s uniqueness. It’s good to have ideas brewing and balance discussed though.</p>

<p>Buffing poison allows more worth to Alchemists and not insta executing Physician claims. The amount you have is heavily reduced though.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1:</strong><br>
<strong>Blinding Dagger</strong> - Cause a player to go blind for 25 seconds making them miss everything that was said during that time. (2 uses)</p>
<p>Distract was useless and it was not worth using over a poison. Making a player miss a whole 25 seconds worth of text is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1:</strong><br>
<strong>Assassinate</strong> - Attack a player. (Infinite uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2:</strong><br>
<strong>2 for 1</strong> - Attack 2 players. (1 use)</p>
<p>I believe this will bring more worth to healers, giving the Assassin less boredom and more strategy along with Physicians and Alchemists.</p>
<p>Credit to NOBLE1 for thinking of the idea for “Blinding Sword” (I balanced it a tiny bit.)<br>
