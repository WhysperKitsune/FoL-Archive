    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Minx and the Slayer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-minx-and-the-slayer/45176</link>
    <description>Hello all. This is i guess part 3 on an unintentional series of ideas. At first , it was a rework on the Inquisitor:
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-rework-the-inquisitor-bd-and-the-heretic-unseen/44594

Then a sorceror rework came around:
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-rework-the-sorcerer-now-fully-nk/45081

But this lost, in my opinion , that cat and mouse play between the two. Now that the Inquisitor is BD , he has much less incentive to primarily find the NK. These two classes(names are both pending) were made to fill that void.

Enter the Minx and the Slayer (NAMES ARE PENDING OK)
The Minx is the mouse. She runs away from the cat (Slayer) causing havoc in her wake. She can be a bit of a pest as she constantly manipulates information and actions. Shes based of the Witch in Town of Salem.

&gt; ## [color=crimson]The Minx[/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color=gray]Neutral Offensive[/color]**
**Book of Cunning (Passive) -** Occupy and Redirect immune.
**Book of Protection (Passive) -** Immune to death once.
**Cloud of Corax (Day) -** Make someone appear as magic tonight. - 3 uses
**Confusion (Night) -** Anyone who targets you tonight will target someone else of your choosing. Choosing yourself will make them target themself.- 2 uses
**Abracadabra (Night) -**  Attempt to control a player, choosing who they target tonight. - Infinite Uses
_Live to see the Blue Dragon defeated._

Now the Cat , Slayer. His goal is to kill the Minx. (hopefully) this is easier said than done. Hoplefully (now watch it get taken apart by Buritto, NightX and RHCube &gt;-&lt;) He uses his investigative abilities to counter the Minx.

&gt; ## [color=turquoise]The Slayer[/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color=gray]Neutral Investigative[/color]**
**Bad Blood (Passive) -** Immune to death once.
**Extra Focus (Day) -** You will not need to visit your target with your night actions tonight. -2 uses
**Won&#39;t Stop (Day) -** You will be immune to all negative effects but killing for the night. - 2 uses
**Find Magic (Night) -**  Check if a player is a magic user. - Infinite Uses
**Attack on Magic (Night) -**  Kill a player. If they are not magic , this will initiate a 2 day cooldown. - Infinite Uses
_Have the Minx killed before you are._

            <p>Attack on magic should have 2 or 3 day fail cool down. We don’t want them yoloing everybody. Other than that, I like it.</p>
