    <title>Phys rezzing Possessor&#39;s original body - Breaks the game for Poss</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/phys-rezzing-possessors-original-body-breaks-the-game-for-poss/13695</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was Posessor, got poisoned so I jumped bodies from 1-&gt;15. After I died, the Phys somehow rezz&#39;d my **NEUTRAL** Poss body (1) into a Death Knight. After that happened, I lost **ALL** my abilities as a Poss and had **NO** night abilities whatsoever. During the nights where I was a Poss with no abilities in the body of 15, I could also see the Death Knight (1) standing behind me in my room. I was then poisoned again, and died due to the poison which I assume shouldn&#39;t have happened because of Poss death immunity at night. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Phys shouldn&#39;t have been able to Rez 1, I should of kept my abilities in my new body (15), and I assume shouldn&#39;t have died from the poison?

#### Steps to reproduce:

Attempt to get a phys to rez the Poss&#39; original neutral body.

#### Comments: 

Dis shit was broke.</description>

            <p>I am bumping this thread because this happened to me again today. I was Poss and jumped 3 different times throughout the game. There was a phys in the game that rez’d a DK (One of my old bodies), and it ended up removing my abilities again and making me lose the game.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed, please.</p>

            <p>death immunity is bypassed by bleeding, poisoning, execution by prince, knights guarding, bears from hunters, reapers who consumer darkness, etc.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, a lot of classes bypass death immunity…</p>

            <p>probably not ideal in most cases. if the possesors jumped, and you can revive anyone that isn’t afk, the possesors already good as dead.</p>
