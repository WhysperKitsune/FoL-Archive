    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The King&#39;s Daughter</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-kings-daughter/70353</link>
    <description>The Royal Family of Adiart if full of many Lords and Ladies that rule over Adiart. There is the fearless Prince, the good Noble who curries favor with the &quot;working&quot; people of Adiart, the Drunk who keeps folks merry and cheery through dark times in the tavern, but the most cunning of them all is the youngest one...The Princess. 

The Princess is the youngest member of the Royal Family who has mastered the art of deception and is always in the mist of court intrigue. She has been to far off places whether it be Kingdoms or the Magical Forests that run along the border of Adiart. It is said that she has even befriended the magic wisps of the forest that not even the Court Wizard himself could control. 

No man or woman can resist her advances, she merely has to look at you with her sea blue eyes, or twirl her scarlet hair, you will tell her your secrets with a smile on your face. It is said that she surpasses even The Prince&#39;s favor with the King and one day she will rule Adiart and not her brother. One whisper to her father or brother could have you kneeling to the Executioner or it can have you clamped in irons that night...</description>
