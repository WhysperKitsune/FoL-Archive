<li>
<img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:"> = Unique</li>
<li>Each Face/Heel/Tweener Killing class has a “Signature” ability or passive that is unavailable at the start, but can be accessed by being voted to receive said ability during the Signature phase.</li>
<li>Each day will have a <strong>Lynch Phase</strong>, and on even days (D2, D4, D6 etc) there will be a <strong>Signature Phase before the Lynch Phase</strong> to decide which person gets their Signature unlocked, this is done by typing <strong>/sig NameHere</strong> into your class card (or Heel chat if applicable). The person with the highest votes gets access to their Signature ability.</li>
<li>Signature Phases last <strong>24 hours, or until everyone has submitted their votes.</strong>
</li>
<li>You can vote for yourself to receive a Signature.</li>
<li>
<strong>You cannot vote someone up that has already been voted to receive a Signature.</strong> This means that if on D2 Johnny was majority voted to receive a Signature, he could <strong>not</strong> be voted up to receive another one on D4.</li>
<li>In the event that a person is chosen to receive a Signature, and that person’s class does not have one to be unlocked, <strong>you will not be told this.</strong> You will only ever be given confirmation that someone has been given votes by majority to receive a Signature, regardless of whether or not that person actually has one to use.</li>
<li>Someone will always receive a Signature, and if there are no votes or if the vote is a tie then it will be decided by RNG.</li>
<li>Lynch Phases last <strong>48 hours, or until a majority is reached.</strong>
</li>
<li>During the Lynch Phase, everyone may vote for a person to be lynched. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched.</li>
<li>If your class has a Day Ability, you may activate it <strong>during this phase only,</strong> by submitting your action through your class card (or Heel chat if applicable). Any Day Abilities that are submitted during the Signature Phase will take effect immediately at the start of that day’s Lynch Phase.</li>
<li>Night Phases last <strong>24 hours, or until everyone has submitted their action(s).</strong>
</li>
<li>During the Night Phases, you may submit your actions through your class card (or Heel chat if applicable).</li>
<li>You may not target yourself with abilities, or force other people to target themselves, unless your ability states that you can.</li>
<li>You may use no more than one Day Ability each day and one Night Ability each night, unless your class card states that you can.</li>
<li>As previously stated, the Heels will have a private Day/Night chat.</li>
<li>The most recent version of your logs will be shown when you die.</li>
<li>You may submit Deathnotes in text or picture-based form alongside your killing Ability. This includes any Day Ability that may result in a death.</li>
<li>There can be a maximum of 3 of each non-unique class.</li>
<li>If two abilities would conflict with each other, their effects are cancelled.</li>
<li>There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only receive a message saying, “Your sleep went undisturbed” or “You have died”. If you receive an Injury during the Day or Night, you will be notified with the message, “You have been injured! You will die in 1/2 night(s) if not Alleviated!” The following list details possible exceptions:</li>

<h1>Direct Attacks vs Indirect Attacks</h1>
<p><strong>Direct Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can be seen by classes that would allow you to see who a person visits</li>
<li>Can be seen by classes that would detect if someone attacks</li>
<li>Do not bypass death immunity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indirect Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot be seen by classes that would allow you to see who a person visits</li>
<li>Cannot be seen by classes that would detect if someone attacks</li>
<li>Bypasses death immunity</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other Interactions</h1>
<ul>
<li>If the Luchador is prevented from performing their ability, the dead person affected by Enthrall Dead will be prevented as well.</li>
<li>Players gain occupy and redirection immunity after being occupied, redirected, or otherwise prevented three times.</li>
<li>Reversal will always redirect the visitor back to themselves, regardless of swaps.</li>
<li>The Rival will be informed if one of their Nemeses dies.</li>
<li>If The Tag Teamer uses Double Duty on a target that visits them, the Tag Teamer will <strong>not</strong> be protected from direct attacks.</li>
<li>Self-targeting abilities cannot be redirected.</li>
<li>The Luchador/Showboat will not be given feedback for a separate Luchador/Showboat using Interpret/Instigate on their target.</li>
<li>The Traitor’s Paranoia will not reverse the effect of frames or mindwarps.</li>
<li>If the Rival or Jobber complete their goals before the game is over, if the Chaotic Stooge is alive but the Tweener Killing dies, or if the Manager’s target dies and they are still alive, they will “leave” the corresponding night to prevent kingmaker scenarios.</li>
</ul>
