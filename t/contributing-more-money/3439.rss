    <title>Contributing More Money</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/contributing-more-money/3439</link>
    <description>I would like to put more money into the game.... but other than buying the game for people (Which i have bought  game  for 2 friends) there isn&#39;t any option of contributing..

Sure there is Patreon.... but for a discord tag... Im not really bothered about a lame discord tag... nobody is gonna notice discord tag... I want a reward - INGAME.
If it said &#39;Aristocrat, Supporter, Donor, Super Donor or Legendary Donor&#39; Above my (3D Model Name) INGAME.... Then I would definatley sign up to Patreon

            <p><strong>Hisses at Premium currency</strong></p>
<p>Seriously though, even tho ToL’s gold is purely for buying cosmetics there should always be a way to grind up c: <s><strong>throws shade at ToS for suddenly bringing on premium currency</strong></s> Anyways, what is said is said. Even tho I loathe the thought of premium currency if the dev team ever do consider it, they would do it right, by y’know having it alongside normal grinding currency. c:</p>

<p>We will always have <strong>one</strong> currency. We want anything obtainable if you want it. If we ever make “extra badass” items, we can always add a new price tier. That means people are more likely to buy extra gp to afford it, but IF you wanted to, you could save up.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, we actually make dramatically more (we skip the middle man - that is, Steam. Steam is non-exclusive, so we don’t get in trouble, we just make more profit - thus supporting us more).</p>
<p>The keys are <strong>immediately</strong> shipped to your email address. There’s also a benefit too if you plan to gift it – it’s less of a hassle since you get the key instantly via email AND it’s worldwide unlocked. You can give to anyone in the world and it’ll 100% apply to their account.</p>
<p>We don’t even ask for billing address – it’s very fast checkout.</p>

            <p>Split currencies can be done REALLY well. Just look at Rainbow Six: Siege.</p>
<p>All of these purchases are cosmetic-only. Most things can be bought for Renown, the earnable currency. Some things require R6 Credits, which are purchased with real money in packs and given to season pass buyers, including boosters to gain more Renown and some exclusive cosmetic items. However, these items can also be earned through a loot-box system called Alpha Packs (which currently has no way to purchase them with real money, only with Renown), along with rare “Legendary” items which can only be found in these Alpha Packs (which, again, you cannot buy with real money). Then there are also some things purchasable as “Digital Content”, which are essentially tiny cosmetic DLC packs with several items (usually with a theme, such as gemstones, other Ubisoft games, or packs to support the game’s Pro Leage) that you can only purchase directly with money instead of having to buy a currency pack to purchase it.</p>
<p>Long story short, things can be priced well enough to be reasonably earn-able in-game, still get money for Ubisoft, and everybody is happy.</p>

            <p>I look forward to seeing what your future in-game store has to offer.<br>
So wonder what other things could perchase from the store…</p>
<p>Perhaps, Premium Rooms. Like alternative rooms to spend the night… which you could buy from the store.<br>
Which get displayed when dead bodies are found. This would be awesome.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmm, I think you guys are getting your terms mixed up (Donate vs Buy). Patreon is simply here to support us – at first, we had nothing offered except secret art (which we still do). Then we added “some stuff” as just extras, like the Discord roles.</p>
<p>If you’re in it to get in-game stuff, that’s not <strong>donating</strong>, that’s <strong>buying</strong> ;D</p>
<p>To buy more stuff (which still supports us), we’ll soon be implementing ways to buy in-game gold with RL$, as promised we’d do in the past. <strong>There’s still ONE currency</strong>, I like to emphasize each time: If you see an item you want, <strong>you can <em>play</em> to buy any of them</strong>.</p>
<p>We have other goodies, too, that we plan to do. Eventually we’ll split off the RL goodies from the Patreon and add it to a “real” online store (that’s the only reason we have “stuff” on Patreon is because we don’t have time to add a store yet – this was just too easy to setup).</p>
<p>There are plans – however, we wanted a stable game before we added anything. For anyone that purely wants to <em>support</em> us, the Patreon does have cool goodies as bonuses and you get to see secret art concept sketches.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Other ways to support the game is to purchase keys for friends <strong><a href="https://www.ThroneOfLies.com?ref=forum">from our website</a></strong> instead of Steam. The devs get to keep a dramatically greater cut of money when keys are purchased from the site, instead. One day, we’ll likely have some bonus promo goodies if you purchase from the site instead of Steam (not enough to wait around for, though – perhaps some bonus starting gp).</p>

            <p>I play game with Pkr a lot. He always uses the name “Pkr,” so I know it is him.</p>
<p>People don’t target him because they suspect that the phys or obs will be on him.</p>

            <p>Nice idea, I don’t think people are going to target you more because you have a nicer gametag than anyone else.</p>
<p>Boslof said: The problem with in-game titles is that people will probably target you because of them. My problem with what Boslof is saying here is that the same thing can happen with limited edition armour, so the argument is pretty much dead. However if people do target you, it wouldn’t matter for some, but it would for some… so what I suggest is that you can turn the display off/on in the settings if you want it to be shown or not ingame. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Having the title “squire” “Archduke” shown ingame would be pretty cool too <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Why do you want a tag above your name? My experience is people will just call you some kid using mommy’s money (even if you aren’t)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>$1200 per year for Discord tags (Which can be given to people for free on any other server) is not really incentive for me to invest money.<br>
Yea you get a call out in the credits. stickers, a tshirt, and mouse pad.</p>
<p>I could use $1200 to Fly from UK to Disney World Florida for 8 Nights. or get a discord tag, and a callout in credits.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong im not here to criticize the Patreon itself. I’m just here to explain why I wouldnt join the patreon right now as it currently stands from my own perspective.</p>

<p>If that were true then the devs would not be giving rewards to patreon supporters, which they are.</p>

            <p>As a poker player… I wouldn’t go to a poker tournament or cash game with a bag over my head to avoid my opponents telling if I’m bluffing or not. Its a part of the game… Learning how to bluff or pretend to bluff is part of the game, and players will recognize you if you are a regular player, its your job to change your play-style to throw your opponent offguard.</p>
<p>Many players already choose the same name. I recognize their names… Sure if someone is good at being Unseen, I might pick them over the other players, but not always… I keep changing my playstyle, or attempt my best at doing so</p>

<p>An example of what I am talking about.<br>
I definatley would consider being a Super Donor or Legendary Donor if this was implemented.<br>
Also a Super Donor / Legendary Donor Custom Made Outfit/Weapon for the inventory would be nice.</p>
