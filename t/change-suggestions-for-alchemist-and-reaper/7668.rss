    <title>Change suggestions for Alchemist and Reaper!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/change-suggestions-for-alchemist-and-reaper/7668</link>
    <description>Here are a list of ideas that I have for the above classes!

**Alchemist**

Alchemist has some difficulty closing out the game when it comes to end game (n7+) due to the wildcard nature of it. While this is somewhat fine it does lead to the Alchemist being difficult to reach their win condition! One suggestion I have for this is making it so that the day ability - the potion that makes you immune at night - also makes you appear Not Suspicious when used! 

With a bit of luck and skill you could potentially reach the point in the game to finish out your win condition which I believe is a positive thing and most abilities already in the game have similar elements.

**Reaper**

Neutral killers have a lot of trouble honestly closing out the game at all skill levels, deducing who is lying about their role becomes easier and easier as the time passes and without allies to back them up neutral killers end up getting that axe all too soon and fall short of their goal.

The abilities of the reaper are very strong - as a class themselves they are a force to be feared. The issue doesn&#39;t lie with their abilities in my opinion but rather the win condition - it is essentially somehow live until the end of the game. My suggestion is simple and goes with the story and the character of the reaper! Instead of kill everyone else the reaper instead wins the game when they collect a certain, set # of souls. 

There&#39;s a lot of nuance to this and some abilities might have to be reworked but the thought of a killer who doesn&#39;t care what his targets are and just killing randomly while creating chaos I think is a fairly good and intended aspect of the neutral killer role and allowing for more craziness after the win condition has been met.</description>

            <p>If you get investigated as alchemist, and are not confirmed already, and somebody calls you out on being not an ally, depending on the situation I will act like a fool (like I want to be assassinated) or if the prince is still alive I’ll probably claim alch, and if they want me out for being neutral, I’ll EP whoever initially called me out if I make it to the night phase. I haven’t had too much trouble as alchemist though like a lot of people have.</p>

            <p>^This is a particularly not-good idea. The Poacher already tried this and was awful, I don’t think we need another role.</p>
<p>Punishing correct (non-BD) lynches will never work. You should not be killed for identifying and pushing a <em>Neutral</em> role correctly.</p>
<p>As for the original suggestion, why not I guess? Hiding better is the only Alch buff I’m comfortable with.</p>

            <p>i would much more prefer for the alch to have a similar ability than the hunter. If he gets executed the first accuser will bleed. This will make people much less likely to execute them. to balance them out, remove one of the kill skills from them instead. Maybe make the bleed also happen when the prince executes, but that is debatable.</p>
<p>The irony of that is that a second alch is the one that could heal the person if no phys is alive anymore…but will he do it when people are on a neutral lynch path?</p>

            <p>For reaper, my suggestion might seem strange, but i think he should have royal blood. This would make it a lot easier to win as reaper.</p>
<p>For alchemist, you mean appear as BD? That actually is a good idea.</p>

<p>Welp, actually Reaper’s winrate is very low, I guess this changes will boost up his win rate.</p>
