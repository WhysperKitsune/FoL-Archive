    <title>Why I Quit ToL And Why Does Title Need 15 Characters?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-i-quit-tol-and-why-does-title-need-15-characters/76312</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got an obscene number of hours played on this game (much more than my Steam actually says), so maybe someone would be interested to know why I quit for good:

- Logging claims is too tedious.

I want to be able to right click a player&#39;s name and select the class that they&#39;ve claimed so it can be displayed beside their name.  Generic labels should be allowed also, like class type, occupy immune, healer, royal, etc.  

This will make it a billion times easier to note mechanical contradictions (the person I labeled as a phys claim is saying they are bleeding), and allow me to focus on the fun part of the game:

- Social deduction.

I see mechanical deduction as boring.  I&#39;m not impressed when someone calls out the fake phys claim because he asked someone to heal his bleed, and I doubt anyone else with over 100 hours playtime thinks that&#39;s an interesting play either.

If you think this feature would be a cool and useful addition to the game, please heart this post so it gets attention from the devs because I really want to enjoy this game like I did before I realized that mechanical deduction is more important than social deduction ... yet it&#39;s the least fun of the two.

**For the naysayers who responded to my last thread on this topic:**

I just tested my typing speed at 137wpm but I still don&#39;t have enough time to log all claims, pay attention to the rest of chat, and choose ability targets before night runs out or I actually forget what people claimed.</description>

            <p>Btw I think we were using different definitions of “mechanical deduction”, I just meant making inferences based on how abilities interact, but perhaps you meant “rigid logical analysis” in general</p>

<p>Actually, I like this idea and have thought of something like this before, but been careful to present it because it has to be perfect. The original idea of logs was never meant to be this tedious – that was a meta that evolved to super scumread your log formatting. This destroys new players and gets tedious for vets. It feels like you’re doing homework.</p>
<p>I was thinking about a “minesweeper” style logs that I may get further opinion on soon in Discord. You click to toggle keywords and such. Semi-auto, but you can still make adjustments. You know Minesweeper how you have bomb, not bomb, or “?” – something similar. <code>sus</code>, <code>ns</code>, <code>-</code>. You can click to toggle these with ease and speed. Maybe a class and type beside it.</p>

<p>Then even if you rush your logs or you’re new at them, they’re always consistent at the very least.</p>

            <p>But thank you for all the class creation time you put into this game and hopefully it did something. Maybe create / code a social deduction game yourself in the future and use those classes and designs and your own changes where it will 100% be implemented</p>

            <p>I actually agree, when you log things during the day you miss out on key points and information.</p>
<p>For instance, when king/ prince / mystic are bombarded with claims to log -  which takes a long time -  they get a lead and waste a day not paying attention to the chat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people who see this post are from fm and don’t really care about the ToL changes. So a good ToL change like this will rarely ever occur</p>

            <p>I am fine with complex mechanics and all the numerous clues (well, proofs) they provide.  As long as these clues are obvious to everyone so that there’s no advantage to excessively tedious logging. Because that means the best playstyle (as in, the most likely to win you the game) is also the most boring.</p>
<p>I don’t think I understand why you are calling the mechanics limited.  The consensus seems to be they are complex, or at least that there are many possible interactions even if ultimately you’re just clicking a button.</p>

            <p>When I say limited, I mean it’s limited in complexity. The problem is you can’t exactly keep the multiple abilities AND conversion but at the same time limit the clues that the people are being given.</p>

<p>In my opinion the game is already unwinnable for evil if all 16 players were to log like myself.  But it’s too tedious, so most people don’t do it, even the ones who understand the most complex of mechanical interactions.  And now not even I do it.</p>
<p>Hence, this thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the mechanical deduction is limited to the point where there’s never anything more interesting than a single-chain logical inference happening commonly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you mean to say mechanical deduction is too large a factor, as opposed to “limited”?  Because I would agree with that completely.</p>

            <p>ToL is basically unplayable for me because I’m so used to wolfreading people who know what they’re doing without needless WIFOM, so I guess this isn’t that relevant for me.</p>
<p>More importantly, it’s not that mechanical deduction is bad in ToL, it’s that the mechanical deduction is limited to the point where there’s never anything more interesting than a single-chain logical inference happening commonly.</p>
<p>still like ToL, it’s just I prefer FM</p>

            <p>I use a lot of my nighttime for that, first doing my action, then skimming the chat of the day again + compare it with my notes, then change my night action based on my reads, if there is enough time.<br>
Basically helping BD with their logs or giving them more time to log it would give BD an immense advantage (e.g. FoL a.k.a ToL on the forums had to give BD major disadvantages because you have so much time to reread and reread again).</p>

<p>Thanks for the recommendation. But, I like how ToL games are short (btw I don’t think my simple feature request is asking to have my cake and eat it too).</p>

<p>Turbos exist</p>
<p>Generally last about as long as two games of ToL back-to-back</p>
<p>And I agree you’re not asking too much, but I also think you can find what you’re looking for in multiple places</p>

            <p>On the right page of the log book, for player 4, I might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 - royal s/i, bled d2</li>
</ul>
<p>Too much of my game is spent opening my logbook, writing something down, and closing it.  And even after it’s written, I may forget the guy who’s bleeding claimed phys earlier, since I can’t keep my logbook open all the time (it obscures either the chat or the accusations of treason).  These two reasons are why I want to be able to record info with just a couple clicks on their name.</p>
