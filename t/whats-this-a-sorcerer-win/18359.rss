**Game Story**

Random killed the alch first night. King mentioned that he knew it was a sorcerer game so I checked back up to see if anyone whispered king (3 was only person)

Despite his pleas for help, I killed him over 2 nights. He was salty

Accidently killed the last cult Day 5, and then slowly picked off the BD with the King wasting time and confusing people. Helped out when A hunter retributioned another BD.

Carried until game end, with Evil King ensuring the rubbish cult also won.
