<p>This Aristocrat suggestion would be unable to meet up with the rest of the Unseen at night, which seems counterproductive because the scum should be able to talk amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Hmm yep you are right- I added Secret Meeting(day) for Aristocrat.<br>
Yes those who share a room can talk to each other <em>and know what the other one does</em> at night(this is how every shared room works)<br>
There is a reason for the Noble having only 2 uses of its ability! And there is also a reason for the wipe, obviously… if a Killer meets with you they can still kill you!</p>
