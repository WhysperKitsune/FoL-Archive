    <title>Seeker check got wrong result on poss</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/seeker-check-got-wrong-result-on-poss/70417</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was seeker and checked the faction of a poss. He showed up as bd.
I should point out, that wasn&#39;t the night that poss jumped. He was already in my target.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Well, possessor should show up as a neut.

#### Steps to reproduce:
(Be a pally.)
Become a seeker.
Let poss jump into some bd.
After the jump, check the faction of the possessed.
Get a BD result.

            <p>Frame would do it since you are cult and since he was neut it would give fake results so it would give bd.Apostle cannot mindwarp cult tho not sure why if he was not possessed the same night you checked him</p>

            <p>No, It was pretty much endgame. Besides, he appeared BD, so frame wouldn’t do that anyway.</p>
