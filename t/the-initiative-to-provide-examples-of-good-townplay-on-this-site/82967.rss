    <description>Did someone play really well as town? Did someone noticeably improve their townplay? Did someone apply a lesson from the townplay thread to positive effect? Discuss it here!

It&#39;s easy to get discouraged by the incessant scum wins on this site, but -- even when town as a collective does very poorly -- individual townies can still make good plays that people can learn from. And looking at examples of things people did well is ... probably more productive than &#39;what the frick how could you be so bad at this game.&#39;</description>

            <p>I want to mention specifically the LyLo performance of the town in ToS FM (this is not a comment on their performance for any other part of the game), especially <a class="mention" href="/u/datbird">@DatBird</a></p>
<p>DatBird enforced a voting order on the town such that he was able to force a thunderdome that contained a wolf, and by enforcing the order was able to get the town to correctly eliminate the wolf (despite the village as a whole being largely divided on which was scummier)</p>

            <p>I think this thread is more valuable if there are less posts but more explanation - and not how X play was good, but moreso what we can learn from said play going forward</p>

            <p>I think for good town play it can just be summarized as this.</p>
<p>A) Don’t tunnel and keep your mind open to new posts.<br>
B) Keep re-evaluating, especially if flips have proven you wrong.<br>
C) Make sure your reads have an actual basis otherwise it’s a crapshoot.<br>
D) Actually post reads and make yourself readable.</p>

<p>To clarify, RM is a setup where you remove 2 players from the game each day; one is a regular yeet, the other is a <strong>sacrifice</strong> which is supposed to target town (and it mechanically benefits town when it hits town, but it hurts the town when you yeet mafia). Town correctly yeeted town (specifically, <em>town which were not towncore</em>, which <strong>allowed the towncore to keep solving the game and working together!!</strong>) in sacrifices and wolves in regular yeets <em>every single time</em>. That’s pretty damn impressive.</p>

<p>This is a very old game, but one that really stuck in my mind. Town was incredible that game. Perfect sacrifices, perfect yeets, every part of their play was on the money. They caught wolves early, they found each other, they cleared LHF villagers, they kept pushing and the wolves were forced to concede because of how good the town was. When there was a possibility of a wolf infiltrating the towncore on day 1, one of the villagers used their day ability to force the yeet onto that wolf (which might deserve an individual nomination, even though the player in question isn’t playing here anymore). And of course, the town bounced their reads off of one another <em>a lot</em>. Cooperation was the key to victory. Wolves couldn’t blend in when the village was doing so well, and consistently.</p>

</aside>
<p>A follow-up on that, from the perspective of a wolf who was caught by him day 1 and needed to kill him.</p>
<p>Solic was the reason scum pushed for a mechanic that gave them a strongman kill on night 1. I repeat, Solic was the reason the wolves desperately wanted a strongman kill just to remove him from the game on night 1. On day 1, he managed to get himself townread, had multiple wolves nailed, never relented, correctly interpreted several of his accusers as scum, and more.</p>
<p>Aside from read accuracy, he was also more than willing to work with others instead of just screaming alone. That is what really makes this nomination important. He had influence in the thread, and having that while fighting wolves who are actually posting and trying to seize control is praiseworthy.</p>

            <p>BlueStorm from NDFM</p>
<p>Whereas Geyde in that game played very well but had some minor hiccups (mainly in locking Math as V), BlueStorm filled in the gaps with reasonable takes both before and after their death that left essentially no stone left unturned. They were on the money and cleared quite a few LHF villagers (?) who would otherwise have been food for the wolves desperate for more town flips.</p>

            <p><strong>Group Town Performance – Randomizer</strong></p>
<p>Was the setup townsided? Yes. Does Town still deserve the nomination? Yes. Going mostly off of social cues, supplemented by mechanics used <em>correctly</em> (such as the ways people claimed rather than the claims themselves), they had incredibly accurate reads and found each other very easily. While both wolves were close to getting cleared, they never quite managed to get themselves fully cleared, and it was difficult for them to do much in a highly villagery thread, mechanics aside. With so many villagers correctly finding each other, they yeeted the NK on day 2, and would have probably yeeted a wolf on day 3 had the wolves not conceded beforehand.</p>
<p>Also, a ton of villagers successfully contributed in ways that made them readable and allowed town to have excellent teamwork. I don’t think there is a better candidate for a group town play nomination, other than NDFM, perhaps.</p>

            <p>Marshal in Randomizer</p>
<p>Marshal (and many other townies) did a lot of things right that game, but the <em>specific</em> one I wanted to highlight is him actively working with other people he trusted to develop his reads, which allowed him to improve his read accuracy <s>and thereby avoid tunnelling the Priest</s>. It’s easy to fall into the trap of assuming your reads are always right, and that you should never consider the input of others, and he didn’t let that happen</p>
