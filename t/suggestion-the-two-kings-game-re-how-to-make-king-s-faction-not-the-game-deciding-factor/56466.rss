    <title>Suggestion: The two kings game (re: How to make king’s faction not the game deciding factor)</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve thought of another way to make the game not decided by the king faction: 2 kings!

Why we need this?
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/how-to-make-kings-faction-not-the-game-deciding-factor/55580

Also, to make a game more about deception and less about keeping good logs. choosing the right king and not ust randomly getting an evil king.


The idea:
At the start of the game, there will be 2 kings, one of them  is &quot;fake&quot;, and the other is good (1,16 posiotions)
This could be in every game of some of them.

**Abilities:**
**passives:**
1) immune to deaths first 3 nights
2) all the current king&#39;s passive

**day **abilities**:**
**defile** (starting evil king only): when a player die at day, change the way he his apeared to the court. (2 uses)

**Night abilities:** 
**Allies**: check if a player is cult/unseen (1 use, only useable on first 3 nights)
**Speech**: talk with 2 players at night



**Election:**
At the beggining of day 4 (can be day 5 too) the town will have an election, and vote for the king who stays at the game. The losing king will be executed. His identity won&#39;t be revealed until the new king dies. the day won&#39;t end after the election.

**The new king abilities:**
**passive**: current king&#39;s passive, the new king can&#39;t be voted out of the game, can&#39;t be poisioned by butler, for the first 3 days after the election unless he executed a blue dragon player.
**day**: royal finger, defile (evil only)
**night**: 4 guards: 2 order execution.</description>

<p>They do it all the time, just combine few passive in one passive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t trust starting King’s” Meta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s doesnt metter as long as the game is balanced. You can also buff the king since the game won’t be decided by a 65% head coin anymore.</p>

<p>Wellt it’s imposible since a class can’t have more than 2 passives and the Devs clearly said they never change this so it’s this passive and swap with something else or nothin’.</p>
<p>Sorry but even if the change would be inplemented into the game, your hopes and preditions won’t go your way since every player is different and because of that some people might just play as they want and will turn out making “Don’t trust starting King’s” Meta.</p>
