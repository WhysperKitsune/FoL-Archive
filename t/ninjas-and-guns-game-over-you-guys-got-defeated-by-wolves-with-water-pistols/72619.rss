&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;big&gt;:crossed_swords: Rules :gun: &lt;/big&gt;

 1. All standard forum rules apply, as usual.
2. Do not communicate about the game outside the game, and don’t angleshoot.
3. Please be respectful to your fellow players. Keep your salt in until post-game.
4. Don’t post in big text or otherwise pretend to be a host of this game.
5. Have fun.

&lt;big&gt; :crossed_swords: Mechanics :gun: &lt;/big&gt;

  * Day Phases will last for 48 hours unless shortned by majority lynch.
* Night phases will last for 24 hours.
* The lynch is decided by Majority AND plurality.

&lt;big&gt; :crossed_swords: Roleset :gun: &lt;/big&gt;

The setup is Ninjas and Guns 17p from MafiaUniverse. Credit to Apoc for this setup.
The game will feature [color=green]**13 Villagers**[/color] VS **[color=brown]4 Wolves[/color]**. The Wolf kill is factional and assigned.

To decide the power roles, take a random row OR column from the below table to decide the power roles. In a case of OR, do a coinfip to decide which role to use. The same Wolf role cannot spawn twice (with the exception of Vanilla Wolf, obviously.)

Village Seer starts the game with an N0 peek on a random Villager, and learns the allignment of whoever they peek every night. (excluding Wolf JOAT)
Wolf Role Seer starts the game with an N0 peek on a random Vanilla Villager, and learns the entire role of whoever they peek every night.

Village JOAT has 2 uses of Seer, 2 uses of Vigilante and 2 uses of Jailkeeper, but must cycle through all the abilities before being able to use one again (EG: JOAT peeks someone with Seer, they must then Jailkeep and Shoot a player before they can use their second use of the Seer ability).

Wolf Ninja JOAT chooses one of these three passive abilities every night.  This cannot be blocked by anyone or anything.
- **Ninja** - Your visits will not show to anyone who Tracks you tonight.
- **Godfather** - You will appear as a [color=green]**Villager**[/color] to any Seers who target you tonight.
- **Bulletproof** - You cannot die tonight. After this ability has blocked a kill you will be informed and may never use this ability again.

Jailkeepers and Angels cannot target the same player two nights in a row, everyone else can.
Nobody can target themselves except for the Ninja JOAT

Fill the rest of the setup up with [color=green]**Vanilla Villagers**[/color] and [color=brown]**Vanilla Wolves**[/color] to reach 13v4.

            <p>One other side note. This here being an Aspie myself is a huge pet peeve.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t find it acceptable for me to go “oh he’s so stupid and dude with an H avatar” then don’t use autistic or gay in the same way. It only makes you sound like you have a limited vocabulary.</p>

<p>Try to avoid speculation in a matrix setup first unless it has been started by a townie and you’re following that up. If you for some reason had flipped here you’d have tipped your hand scum were IC hunting which meant that may be possible and you narrow down what doesn’t exist.</p>
