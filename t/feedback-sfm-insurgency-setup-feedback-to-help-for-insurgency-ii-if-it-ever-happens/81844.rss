    <title>[Feedback] [SFM] Insurgency Setup Feedback (to help for Insurgency II, if it ever happens)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/feedback-sfm-insurgency-setup-feedback-to-help-for-insurgency-ii-if-it-ever-happens/81844</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m seeking feedback for the Insurgency setup to use for Insurgency II if that ever happens.
Insurgency II, if it happens, will be based on Fire Emblem 7 and 6.
https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_The_Blazing_Blade
https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_The_Binding_Blade

There are no skills in FE 7 or 6 so those would be gone.
However, in their place will be named weapons of each type, some of which will be more powerful than others in terms of hit chance and special abilities (For example, Iron Axe / Steel Axe / Killer Axe / Silver Axe / Devil Axe, or something). Maybe stat-boosters in the shop as well, and I might add new stat types, like skill, luck, and/or others too.

Many features will remain the same, just different flavour. It would still be a dual-gen game.

Gib feedback pls.</description>
