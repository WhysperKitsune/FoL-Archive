    <title>[Class suggestion] Archchemist</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-archchemist/9332</link>
    <description>Archchemist(Neutral Special)

Passive: Cannot be killed by Alchemists
Passive: Occupy immune
Passive: (Optional) Able to talk to fellow Alchemists at night.
Day Ability 1: Stony Survival
Give all Alchemists(including the Archchemist) in the game a stoneskin potion (3 uses )

Day Ability 2 (Optional): Chemist&#39;s Secrets
Whisper all Alchemists a one time message, possibly to reveal yourself to them. (One use only)

Night Ability 1: The heart of the chemists
Give all Alchemists(not including the Archemist) a healing potion that does the exact same thing as Alchemist&#39;s potion (unlimited uses)

Night Ability 2 Suicide Poison.
If an Alchemist gets attacked, you immediately run in and sacrifice your life to save your fellow Alchemist, instead of the alchemist getting attacked, you will get attacked and you&#39;ll throw a poison potion at the attacker (if attacker is night immune, you will not kill the person and instead sacrifice your life for the alchemist)(3 uses)

Lore:
The Alchemists have been bullied on for long enough. A person from far away lands came, claiming to be the leader of all alchemists. He quickly managed to get the alchemists on his side and even became their true leader. The Archchemist will lead his people to victory, and make sure that nobody messes with the alchemists

Comments:
Kind of a leader to protect the alchemists, maybe add an ability to talk to them like Unseen, but I think whispering to them one time is enough, it would be a special whisper tho. I think the winning condition would be to see at least one alchemist survive throughout the game, and if all other alchemists die, he becomes one with used up poison and stoneskin potion. Oh and ofc it can only appear in game with only Alchemists in them :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>God damn mate, I’m gonna have to write a lot <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>I just thought it up as like Archduke and Archmage, but other names are fine too.</li>
<li>I mean, it helps the Alchemists stick together, but whispering could also be fine.</li>
<li>Well then we should add the Day Ability 1 to include only the Archcchemist, and then we should probably add more charges to the 2nd one.</li>
<li>Pretty much heals all the alchs, maybe could add to make them occupy immune or something aswell, maybe limit the use?</li>
<li><img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></li>
</ol>
<p>This is simply one of the variations of a Neutral Leader. Maybe we could have 2 Alchemists whenever there’s an Archchemist? But now that I look at it, the class does look a bit narrow down the line. Having this class as a neutral protector/leader would actually make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback mate, you dedicated a lot <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Have no fear, the sheep is here!! Let’s feedback the hell out of this!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have no idea what an Archchemist is. Maybe another name? Thaumaturge maybe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m okay with the first two passives, not the optional one. He can whisper Alchemist when they out themselves, in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for his day abilities, I really like the second one and it could have more uses than just one. I dislike the first one. It is too powerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night ability 1 gives the alchemists a potion so they can use it later or heals them? That’s unclear. I believe it heals them, right? Night ability 2 is ok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with the win condition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I like the idea of a class that helps the alchemist but this class is useless in their absence. Most of the games that have an alchemist, usually have only one. Giving this class to a player, revolving all of his game to keeping one player alive is bad. I think you could maintain the idea of a neutral support that helps neutral, but make it so that he helps all the neutral. A neutral leader instead of an alchemist leader. Your daytime whisper would be heard by all the neutrals (even the NK). The neutrals (not the NK) would be shown to you. Your night healing ability could target one neutral of your choice or two. If you chose one, it could be unlimited, if you chose two, it would need just a few uses. Suicide Poison protects neutrals (not the NK). What do you think? If you follow this route, I would suggest that the win condition becomes “Survive with at least one another neutral alive.”</p>
<p>Hope I helped here!! You have a nice base of an idea in my opinion! Make it a diamond!</p>

            <p>It heals all the Alchemists, since Alchemists can’t heal themselves (maybe even add it so it even heals the Archchemist)</p>

<p>Only one thing, they all have unlimited healing potions, so this is kinda useless giving them something they already have</p>
