    <title>Ritual Mafia Turbo - Canned</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/ritual-mafia-turbo-canned/74436</link>
    <description>Im trying to run an experiment by hosting a turbo version of Ritual mafia. Some classes have been removed or simplified in order to make this faster and easier to host.

### :skull: [color=darkred]Rules[/color] :skull: 
1. Follow the Global Forum Rules
3. No private messaging others in the game about the game.
4. No angleshooting. This includes any attempt to gain info about the game from external sources. 
5. Do not screenshot or quote private host messages
6. While the nature of the game can make it easy to accidentally screw up your own faction, intentionally throwing the game is against the rules.
7. Players are not allowed to use big letters. These are reserved for the host.
8. Do not post in the main thread or like posts if you are dead or not in the game.
9. Remember: its a game so have fun!

### :skull: [color=darkred]Gameplay[/color] :skull: 
* Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch 
* Ritual Phase lasts 10 minutes
* During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.
* Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.  
* &quot;The Ritual was interrupted&quot; message means that the player&#39;s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.
* Self-voting is allowed in both Ritual and Lynch phases.
* Lynch Phase lasts 10 minutes or until majority is reached.
* You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.
* If the sacrificed player hasn&#39;t picked their targets on time their ritual ability will be skipped. If said player is a heretic, other heretics will be able to choose a target for them. Ritual of initiation cannot be skipped this way, and if no one picks a convert target for any reason it will be picked randomly.
* During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched. 
* Nights will be 10 minutes long
* During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.
* You cannot target yourself with an ability unless stated otherwise.
* Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.
* The Heretics will have a day/night chat.
* Heretics have a factional kill. Whoever performs it cannot perform any other night action.
* There are no logs
* There can be a maximum of 3 of each non-unique classes.
* There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get &quot;You slept peacefully.&quot; or &quot;You died&quot; as feedback. The exceptions are the following:

[details=&quot;List of night results&quot;]
If you use an investigative ability and you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.
_If an investigative ability fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action._
_If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target&#39;s class type is [class type]._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!_
_If an Diviner uses Change of Faith on a player: Your target is the [Class]._
