<ul>
<li>Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch</li>
<li>Ritual Phase lasts 10 minutes</li>
<li>During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.</li>
<li>Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.</li>
<li>“The Ritual was interrupted” message means that the player’s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.</li>
<li>Self-voting is allowed in both Ritual and Lynch phases.</li>
<li>Lynch Phase lasts 10 minutes or until majority is reached.</li>
<li>You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.</li>
<li>If the sacrificed player hasn’t picked their targets on time their ritual ability will be skipped. If said player is a heretic, other heretics will be able to choose a target for them. Ritual of initiation cannot be skipped this way, and if no one picks a convert target for any reason it will be picked randomly.</li>
<li>During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched.</li>
<li>Nights will be 10 minutes long</li>
<li>During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.</li>
<li>You cannot target yourself with an ability unless stated otherwise.</li>
<li>Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.</li>
<li>The Heretics will have a day/night chat.</li>
<li>Heretics have a factional kill. Whoever performs it cannot perform any other night action.</li>
<li>There are no logs</li>
<li>There can be a maximum of 3 of each non-unique classes.</li>
<li>There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get “You slept peacefully.” or “You died” as feedback. The exceptions are the following:</li>
</ul>

List of night results</summary>
<p>If you use an investigative ability and you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.<br>
<em>If an investigative ability fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action.</em><br>
<em>If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target’s class type is [class type].</em><br>
<em>If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious.</em><br>
<em>If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!</em><br>
<em>If an Diviner uses Change of Faith on a player: Your target is the [Class].</em></p>
