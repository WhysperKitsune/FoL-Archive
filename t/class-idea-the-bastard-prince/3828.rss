    <description>I&#39;m surprised that a game inspired by game of thrones has no class whose goal is to be king. Here are some ideas, feel free to reject them.
The Bastard Prince (Neutral)- same abilities as prince but their win condition is to Become The King, their class can help either faction all while pretending to be the real prince. since the bastard&#39;s rivals the king and prince have night immune he has to fight them for the crown indirectly through intimidation,deceit, or allying with evil</description>
