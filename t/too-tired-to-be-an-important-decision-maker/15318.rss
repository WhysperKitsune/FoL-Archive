    <title>Too tired to be an important decision maker</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/too-tired-to-be-an-important-decision-maker/15318</link>
    <description>I have had a few games where i ended up being Prince or King, and was too tired, and too overwhelmed to actually play the roles as needed. Missing key information, or going against agreed tactics, because i did not have the energy to pay the needed attention to the chat going on. I have on a few occasions ended up making it a loss for my faction.

So i kinda miss an option to prevent me from being an important decision maker when i feel i am too tired, but still want to play. In my opinion, it should only relate to King and Prince, since other key roles still are less stressful. You can still be a good MM while being tired, and you can still be a good Neutral Killer as well.

Just throwing my idea out there.:) Maybe make it a feature under the account management, or in the game settings.</description>

            <p>I agree. I don’t think we should ever be able to opt-in for select classes, but being able to opt out, especially if it’s just being able to opt out of specials or uniques would be great. I find playing MM very stressful, and while I enjoy it, and often make it from day 1 to win, I don’t always want that level of responsibility or stress.</p>

            <p>Yea, there are definitely times I don’t feel like handling the pressure that comes with being king. I would love a feature where I could just click a check box to determine if I could become king (or some other class) or not.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I do feel like we should stop getting the same classes in a row not because I am tired but the fact it just gets repetive and at some point I kind of get targetted for my name XD. Other then that I agree with this</p>
