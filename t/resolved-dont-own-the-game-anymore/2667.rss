    <title>[RESOLVED] Don&#39;t own the game anymore?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-dont-own-the-game-anymore/2667</link>
    <description>What happened: I logged into steam today and steam told me that Throne of Lies is no longer activated on my account due to a payment problem.. Yet I&#39;ve owned and played the game for a few months now. There&#39;s proof of that on a couple Youtube video&#39;s (IGN AIVION). Unsure why it would be telling me this when I&#39;ve bought the game and played it already. I can no longer play it anymore.


What was SUPPOSED to happen: None of the above was suppost to happen I paid my 10 dollars for the game. What gives? 

Cheers.

(P.S I also still have the email with the CD Key + Receipt as well for further proof I&#39;ve successfully bought the game)</description>

            <p>We found the pattern and all accidental deactivations were emailed a replacement key + a bonus key from Elsa. If you still cannot find the email, continue with the above task ^</p>
