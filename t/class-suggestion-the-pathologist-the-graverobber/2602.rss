            <p>It probably can be tested now, but be aware: The ability might be still very strong for someone who died Night 1. At least if those kept a proper will.</p>

<p>Autopsy was the main focus I had for this, I had a few other ideas written up but the one right now really seemed to shine. I always discuss my stuff with Ruby or Tryphon too so, unless they didn’t like it, I wouldn’t post it.<br>
I also had a backup for Warrant, it was an ability I moved from another idea I had for a Class.</p>
<p>Obituary, honestly, seemed to be more of a “is Physician converted? Better check” kinda thing, that’s one of the reasons I had it. Tryphon especially liked that and clicked onto to it’s purpose before I ever said anything.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about visited/visitors, it shows “Interacted with”</p>

            <p>Dunno your latest change isnt really that helpful. There is no reason to delay Autopsy further anyway.<br>
And Obituary doesnt make it better- you can rule out princekilled people that way if there is more than one kill. At least the visited and the visitors should not be distinguishable.<br>
Warrant and Obituary are already powerful abilities that honestly do not match with a powerful ability like that.<br>
Maybe ditch Warrant? It does not fit the main theme, and this class does not really need it to be powerful.</p>
