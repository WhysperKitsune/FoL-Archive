    <title>Inquisitor killing assassin during night</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/inquisitor-killing-assassin-during-night/16402</link>
    <description>I was just in a game, where i was killed by the inquisitor as assassin during the night. According to the info on inq, he can only use his kill ability to kill magic users, which is not the assassin. I was a sage and our assassin got executed during the day, turning me into the new assassin at the end of the day... So, a bug still recognizing me as an magic user, while i am not?</description>

            <p>going to go out on a limb to guess… but maybe sorcerer framed you? Not 100% sure if the frame works for both detection and attack, but it would fit.</p>
