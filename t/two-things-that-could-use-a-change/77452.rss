    <title>Two things that could use a change</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/two-things-that-could-use-a-change/77452</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing the game for a while and I have things in the game I really don&#39;t think it is the way it&#39;s supposed to work. Let me list them out.

**1. King**
Players are overly obsessed with the &quot;point meta&quot;, which basically doesn&#39;t help the game and just bring a major annoyance to me whenever I play as king.
&gt; 
&gt; __Example:__ I was BD king and I asked people on D1 to share their findings with me in whispers on D2. On the second day, I indeed got several whispers with useful information which I needed some time to process, in the meantime people got suspicious at me for not pointing randomly and even got executed that day, even though I clearly stated I was busy on working something out with the info I got.

**Idea for change:** Have the Royal Finger disabled for the first few days, since it doesn&#39;t help anyone much (or at all) early on. Decide Fate should still be active, however, which I think it would encourage players not to vote up anyone early without evidence.

**2. Pretender**
The so-called pretender that doesn&#39;t need to pretend to win, you start out as a buffed Princess and you can just publicly claim Pretender with basically zero negative consequences and achieve victory.

I don&#39;t think I need an example, everyone who has played the game enough will know.

I do not have an idea on how to fix this at this time, but I&#39;d like to see it change (for the better).</description>

<p>Not a bad idea, but wouldn’t that give the king too much power? If king wins a 2v1, then it’d be too powerful in my book.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Limit Royal Finger to 2 or 3 uses then?  So if King still has a charge left in a 1 v 2, he earned it, similar to Noble or Possessor.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Nvm, people would hang him if he didn’t waste all his fingers day2/3/4.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> I KNOW! Make King’s Royal Finger disabled slightly longer than general voting is at the beginning of the day, so that in a 1 v 2 the 2 others have 5 seconds to vote the King out before he can point, if they so choose. Actually the meta would then become, vote up the king for time immediately in every 1 v 2 situation just in case, and pardon if you decide king is good.  But that’s okay, because it prevents king from auto-winning a 1 v 2 just because he has Decide Fate.</p>
<p>Honestly though I don’t think it’s that big of a deal that King can win a 1 v 2 if he has saved Decide Fate up to that point.</p>

            <p>Would you say it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>King has way too much confirmability with it early game.</li>
<li>Too powerful.</li>
<li>Not powerful enough, since there are more people to outway the votes?</li>
<li>All or combination.</li>

            <p>Wouldn’t just letting King use Decide Fate the same day that he points resolve all current problems?  Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kills point meta, because pointing itself isn’t a threat early on and decide fate remains active even if pointing</li>
<li>Kills VFR meta, because king can slam pardon or execute anyone on trial</li>
</ul>
<p>I think each NK should turn into their own special King btw.  Sorc King, Poss King, Reaper King.  Because for Reaper and Possessor you actually lose extremely useful daytime abilities by getting elected King.  Force-vote is more useful than Royal Finger when you’re Possessor, because it makes you win a 1 v 2 whereas Royal Finger only puts someone on trial but the other can still pardon. <strong>EDIT:</strong> nvm, if decide fate is usable with point you can then slam and it’s even.</p>

            <p>Best part is. Fixing this problem will also help with the VFC meta. It won’t STOP massclaims per say but it might mitigate them.</p>

            <p>This sort of meta has made day 2 fool executions extremely common. It’s no problem with fool. The 2-day thing on day 2 does not make fool overpowered, and this would and should be a nerf, as I have argued before, if people would think and stop being so trigger happy. It’s a huge problem with the massclaim meta and the tendency to just execute anyone with even the slightest hiccup.</p>

I agree on two fronts.</p>
