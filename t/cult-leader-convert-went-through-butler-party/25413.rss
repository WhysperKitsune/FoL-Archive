    <title>Cult leader convert went through Butler party</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cult-leader-convert-went-through-butler-party/25413</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
1. Night 1: I used Party as a Butler.
2. Cult leader converted me on Night 1
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Cult leader was supposed to have been occupied.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Use court wizard swap on target
2. Use butler party
3. Use Cult Leader conversion on target of swap (not the butler).

#### Comments:
Apparently a Court Wizard swapped 11/12(me). This must have caused the convert to go through party.
