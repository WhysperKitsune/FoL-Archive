    <description># [color=blue]Welcome to uCreate![/color]
Where you create your own class! ~~Because Luxy wanted to host something but was too lazy to make a setup~~

Hosted by Luxy
Co-Hosted by @MaximusPrime and @Marcus_Doodalee 

# [color=blue]Rules![/color]
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515?u=luxy

# [color=blue] Gameplay and Mechanics![/color]
Days will be 72 hours long, or shorter if someone is executed.
Nights will be 24 hours days long.
All actions are done in your class card.
Lynches are majority and plurality, no lynch is an option.
This is a closed setup.
When you receive your class card, it will contain your alignment and you will make your class based on that.
You have 72 hours to create your class.
Your moderated class will be added to the OP of your class card.
The mafia will be able to work together to make their classes.
The mafia will be able to choose an assigned, factional night kill or have one class that does the kill that other mafia become when the killer class dies. (Think assassin from FoL)
Conversion mechanics are banned.
The mafia will be able to choose their faction name and colour, however, for clarity, the Town and Neutrals will be referred to as **[color=green]Town[/color]** and **[color=grey]Neutral[/color]**.
The power level of classes will be balanced on the average that people make, meaning if yours is too OP, it will be nerfed and if it is UP it will be buffed so don&#39;t worry about that.
Classes will need to have their own niche.

# [color=blue]Wincons![/color]

The Town Wincon is: You win when you defeat the Mafia and the Neutral Killer.
The Mafia Wincon is: You win when you have majority and nothing can stop this from occuring.
The Neutral Killer Wincon is: You win when you are among the last two players alive.
