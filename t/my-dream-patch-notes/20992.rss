    <description>1. **Make Psychic Unique**

The mechanic of talking to the dead is arguably bad for the health of the game. Besides that, having two psychics that can coordinate information with the dead and easily confirm themselves to the living people is just too much for the neutral/evil factions to deal with. I made a separate topic about this here: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/two-psychics-is-too-many/20846/1

2. **Rework CW/Tornado or bring back the previous version**

The Tornado meta isn&#39;t very fun and ends up with CW being a hindrance to the team more than a useful ally. Target switching should be an ability that&#39;s used sparingly throughout the game. Playing the class in the current state isn&#39;t very fun. The tornado meta isn&#39;t good for the game.

3. **Don&#39;t let neutral killers become neutral king** 

Having Reaper or Possessor become neutral king is bad for the meta. It&#39;s the &quot;easy way out&quot; for the entire table and shouldn&#39;t be rewarded. They should turn into some Neutral Killer Specific King or an Evil King.

4. **Make jail block everything**

Don&#39;t let healing or anything happen to people when they&#39;re jailed. It should be a perfect block.

5. **Don&#39;t guarantee a NK every game**

Neutral Killers are fun to play but it makes the deduction much easier when you can just assume there&#39;s one every single game. It&#39;s also bad for Alchs and other neutrals playing for the table. It would be much more exciting for everybody to have to wonder if there&#39;s one or not. Removing the limit of 1 would be a more exciting option as well.

6. **Create separate queues for solo and groups**

I don&#39;t like it when people in game are teamed or on voice chat with somebody. It makes it so easy to coordinate outside of the game. Sometimes they&#39;ll admit it in the game.

If I&#39;m playing solo I only want to play with other people who are playing solo. If people want to group let them play with other grouped people.  A queueing system that makes it harder to get into the same game would be nice too. It&#39;s really easy to snipe people at the moment. Maybe shuffling the open lobbies or something.</description>

            <p>number of NKs changes would work best if scum had three starters in games with no NK, but still only one assassin as unseen, because two assassins would have the potential of getting 4 kills N1.  In games with two NKs, there would have to be only the MM or CL starting.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>BD’s win-rate would plummet massively if two NK’s were a thing again. Imagine <strong>three~four kills N1</strong> from just Assassin/CL+NK&amp;NK alone. Not even factoring other neutrals that can kill here like Alchemist &amp; Inquisitor, either… Which would bump it up to <strong>five~seven</strong> kills the first night. Too much, imo.</p>

            <p>So from time to time CWs in your game are newbs? Can I que with you? I’d say 1 in every 30 CWs are pro and pay attention and don’t cause complete chaos. I feel like CW is secretly evil disguised as BD tbh.</p>
<p>Ranked will never happen. They barely have time and resources to keep the classes fun and balanced.</p>

            <p>The only thing I’d disagree with is the NK part. 0 isn’t enough killing power for scum to win and 2 is too much killing power for BD to win. It’s perfectly balanced with 1 every game.</p>

            <p><strong>1. Strongly agree.</strong> Two psychs is too much of a mess<br>
Hope they bring Noble back soon and if possible a new version of Priest too. And make Psychic Unique again.</p>
<p><strong>2. Strongly disagree.</strong> Court Wizard is awesome as is! It used to be the most boring class, now it has so much potential! Yes, you need to pay close attention to the game, but I’d much rather be in a game with a newbie CW from time to time than dumbing the class down… Also, eventually we might get Ranked anyway?</p>

            <p>In regards to 6) you also have to consider the consequences for being caught cheating are much worse here than TOS for example. NK isn’t underpowered so much as it is too easily threatened by King Allies ability. The reason I kill the king so often as NK is purely because of that.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>1: Psychic is probably intended to be a unique class, but now with the Priest and Noble gone and CW being unique, BD is lacking in the number of classes available to them. Enjoy the experience while it lasts.</p>
<p>2: Those are some strong claims you make without any evidence. I find CW very powerful and fun to play. It’s current iteration may be less powerful than the previous one but the importance here is that you can feel yourself making an impact which wasn’t really the case with the previous one. Don’t blame people failing to use a class on what.</p>
<p>3: Agreed but first it should be addressed why nk go for the king’s seat anyway: they are underpowered to what is tasked with them. Hitting the 1/16 chance of the nk should be a fun experience. Like a powertrip. But the currently in games I play, people sometimes end up leaving the game the moment they’re nk because of how unrewarding it is to play. It’s mostly just point and click on people to die, a slightly amped up assassin, while I feel it should be a major powerhouse that’s a threat on its own.</p>
<p>4: Agreed. Jail should block everything.</p>
<p>5: With the current balance of the system, guaranteeing an NK in 16 player games is a must. I do agree that it was fun seeing double NK games and just preserving the possibility, even if it was close to 1/20 games, would cause people to always keep it in mind at least.</p>
<p>6: I do not think the player base is big enough for that yet. The chances that the group is in a private chat I feel is so low that segregating the queues isn’t necessarily because of it and shorter queues are much more important.</p>

            <ol>
<li>I think part of the idea of having 2 psychics is that if one goes dark, both of them are suspicious, albeit breifly, due to day ability.  As it stands though, I agree 2 psychs is just too much.</li>
<li>I have to agree. While it can be a strong ability for BD, there’s just way too much going off the reservation with it. If it’s going to get kept, CW should be locked to extremely veteran players.</li>
<li>I somewhat like this idea. Perhaps even break it down to what neut classes turn into what.</li>
<li>Absolutely agree.</li>
<li>Agree with this also, assuming the other idea above about increasing the roster for unseen/cult if no NK is also in place.</li>
<li>No opinion about this. Typically I support the separation, but not sure if voice comm meta cheating is really prevalent enough here to matter.</li>

<p>Ways the Court Wizard avoids these issues</p>
<p>1: You are not alerted if you are swapped and there is more than 1 way to be redirected<br>
2: You always know who you actually target so you know who’s invest results you are looking at<br>
3: The Sage and Ritualist have the same ability</p>

            <p>Yes, it does. It says, “You targeted 7 for some reason!”</p>
<p>“Some reason” lol. What else would it be if not a Drunk or Invoker?</p>

            <p><strong>1</strong> I have nothiing to add, it is normal to me.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Yeah I don’t like the ability too much either, for support class this tornado ability leans towards Offensive since that technically works like Debauchery.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> While I don’t agree making them Evil King since Reaper and Possessor have to kill Unseen/Cult as well - specific killer king do make sense for their part, Psychopathic King is one good example what they should be.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> Well you can’t block Observer’s tracking ability who stand nearby target’s door and waiting for them to come out, the prince seize the target before Observer could make it and Prince won’t leave the dungeon’s entrance.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> It’s guaranteed to have 2 Neutrals to 4 Neutrals, turns out it’s not always guaranteed to spawn NK except Inquisitor is must with Sorcerer around</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> Yeah I agree, not only with gamethrowing communication but sometimes I am still getting “Failed to join” error message.</p>

            <p>Wow, I agree with everything. I really hate in particular how many redirections was added in the last patch, too. It hinders investigations so much and only contributes positively to the game if Court Wizard is good and has some idea of who to swap. Which is sometimes rare.</p>
<p>I wasn’t that big of a fan of Transporter in ToS, either. Same problems. =/</p>
<p>[Edit]</p>
<p>On a side note while Psychic isn’t really a good scum claim I do believe there needs to be made more classes that aren’t <strong>Unique</strong>. Right now I feel claims are really limited, even Drunk is a hard claim atm because people know who redirects them when they’re Debaucheried… And of course CW claims are 9/10 out of the question, too.</p>

            <p>I still don’t understand what number 2 means. You commented that on one of my CW posts as well.</p>

            <p>Group play will never and should never be a thing unless you play with each other and against each other without coordinating outside of the game. If someone does at least male it legit by whispering each other.</p>
<p>Also I like not having a NK in every game. Games without NK just increase the unseen numbers by 1 or 2 OR give the game one more assasin OR spawn  second alch.</p>
