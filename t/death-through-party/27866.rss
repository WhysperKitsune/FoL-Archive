    <title>Death through Party</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/death-through-party/27866</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Prince was Possessed and attacked me, because he is occupy immune the attack went through.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Honestly this is up to the game designers on how they want party to work. If you get visited/attacked by anyone who is occupy immune, party will fail.</description>

            <p>Exactly what you said.</p>
<p>Party is just occupation. Every occupation immune class can attack you through it.<br>
That’s totaly fine and was designed this way.</p>

            <p>Possessor is Occupy immune. Party won’t stop their attack on you.</p>
<p>Party doesn’t stop Occupy immune classes targeting you.</p>

            <p>Was there a Possessor? That happened to me last night when I was killed by using party, and that breaks immunity.</p>
