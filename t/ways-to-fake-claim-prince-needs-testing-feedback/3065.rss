    <title>Ways to fake claim Prince (NEEDS TESTING/FEEDBACK)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ways-to-fake-claim-prince-needs-testing-feedback/3065</link>
    <description>The Prince is one of the hardest Classes to fake being. This isn&#39;t because making a Journal for him is hard (though it is) but rather because he will just kill you the next night. Remember that claiming Prince to out the Prince is worth it.

Key:
*** - Will let you maintain a Prince claim
** - Will get the real Prince killed
.* - Will have some other benefit

Solutions.

1. claim privately rather than on the stand. If you are linked with a Psychic and an Unseen/Cult ally then claim prince. If the Mystic finds the real prince then the Mystic will have to out both you and the real Prince to reliably kill the faker. This can work even better if the Mystic has already talked to the real prince and immediately tells you. **

2. Step up for king while you claim. This will force the Prince to out in order to lynch you. The Prince cannot target you directly and kill you once you become King. WARNING!!: Only claim AFTER you have became king. ***

3. Find him first and make him flip as someone else with an Herbalist. Then claim Prince the next day. The mechanics are clear. (Unseen Only) ***

4. Claim Prince on the Stand and then use Herbalist to make him flip Prince (Unseen Only) (Needs Testing) This won&#39;t stop the Prince but it will fool everyone else and possibly cause a misslynch **

5. FOR FOOL ONLY!!! If you think the King is evil an you are voted on to the stand then you can claim Prince to bait him into using Decide fate. It works for other classes but only the fool actually benefits from this. *

6. If the Prince has executed a bd then you can claim Prince without doing too much special. If you can frame someone but not get them lynched then the prince will likely execute them, especially if people suspect a fool. Since the Prince can&#39;t execute you he is forced to CC you in the day or jail you forever until you can figure out who he is. (Works best with cult or an unseen with Herbalist) ***

7. If you have a full unseen/cult. Claim that you are Prince and that someone&#39;s claim in jail was contradictory with something they just said. People will usually listen to you and lynch the person you framed. When the Prince executes you then you can convert someone and also waste a Prince exe (works best with Cult). You can also do this as Scorned.*

8. Similar to the last idea. If you are accused of being unseen/cult in a way you can&#39;t defend from and you haven&#39;t claimed then claim Prince. They will vote you down and let the Prince kill you. This can both waste a Prince exe, draw away protectives from other people and give them 1 night less with info that your evil. Don&#39;t do this if you have a full Unseen/Cult and having you die at night would let them convert. In that case just let them kill you.*

Note: If you succeed in convincing people that you are Prince then people are unlikely to Suspect you later. Unlike the Psychic you won&#39;t be asked to prove with a link too much

Conclusion: Herbalist hardcounters Prince</description>

            <p>Doesn’t work. People just pardon him and let you fight to the death. Or Lynch you as no real Prince would do that if he could avoid it. The idea is to force the prince to counterclaim you somehow or otherwise reveal him.</p>
<p>Also 4 doesn’t work anymore now that prince prevents visits.</p>

            <p>That’s right. All of these are for the Unseen and Cult. A neutral (other than the fool strat) can’t really benefit too much.</p>

            <p>Cool thoughts.</p>
<p>Yes, the Fool play was something I’ve been interested in trying but have never gotten a chance to do.</p>
<p>Another time to claim Prince is when you <em>know</em> you’re screwed, and that you have no way out. This can usually get you off the stand to get executed by the Prince later that night. And even if the Prince does CC you, at least you’ve given valuable information to your scum team.</p>
<p>Sometimes the town asks you “What night did you jail so-and-so?” and that can urge them to guilty you, but that is uncommon in my experience. Usually a Prince claim just gets down because the real Prince will execute them.</p>
<p>This play is only good for helping your teammates. BD doesn’t use their day lynching you and Prince has to use his night killing you, giving your allies a night of relief. Only do this if you’re desperate and you’re not the LAST one alive on your team.</p>

<p>Okay lemme see…<br>
Generally claiming Prince is a bad idea… But I like your last 2 tactics. It depends on very specific requirements, but if you pull it off you’re now able to claim one of the most powerful classes in the game!</p>

<li>
<p>Find him first and make him flip as someone else with an Herbalist. Then claim Prince the next day. The mechanics are clear. (Unseen Only) ***</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim Prince on the Stand and then use Herbalist to make him flip Prince (Unseen Only) (Needs Testing) This won’t stop the Prince but it will fool everyone else and possibly cause a misslynch **</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOR FOOL ONLY!!! If you think the King is evil an you are voted on to the stand then you can claim Prince to bait him into using Decide fate. It works for other classes but only the fool actually benefits from this. *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Prince has executed a bd then you can claim Prince without doing too much special. If you can frame someone but not get them lynched then the prince will likely execute them, especially if people suspect a fool. Since the Prince can’t execute you he is forced to CC you in the day or jail you forever until you can figure out who he is. (Works best with cult or an unseen with Herbalist) ***</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a full unseen/cult. Claim that you are Prince and that someone’s claim in jail was contradictory with something they just said. People will usually listen to you and lynch the person you framed. When the Prince executes you then you can convert someone and also waste a Prince exe (works best with Cult). You can also do this as Scorned.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the last idea. If you are accused of being unseen/cult in a way you can’t defend from and you haven’t claimed then claim Prince. They will vote you down and let the Prince kill you. This can both waste a Prince exe, draw away protectives from other people and give them 1 night less with info that your evil. Don’t do this if you have a full Unseen/Cult and having you die at night would let them convert. In that case just let them kill you.*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you succeed in convincing people that you are Prince then people are unlikely to Suspect you later. Unlike the Psychic you won’t be asked to prove with a link too much</p>
<p>Conclusion: Herbalist hardcounters Prince</p>
