    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/unable-to-resolve-priest-not-able-to-revive/2868</link>
    <description>####What happened? I was Priest and I tried reviving 2 different players that were BD... I got the same message both times
&quot;you were unable to revive [player]&quot;

####What was SUPPOSED to happen? it was not a Reaper game, there was a possessor tho... so idk why I was not able to. Unless I was being role blocked and it was saying a weird message

####Steps to reproduce:

####Comments: Just wanted to know why I couldnt revive... because I died from not being able to back up my priest claim that I actually was</description>

            <p>Since there were no logs presented in the Bugs post and it’s far past it’s time to retrieve said logs, I’ll have to close this thread and deem it unable to be resolved. It could be a case that there was no bug however, and it was indeed an Invoker’s ability that controlled you.</p>

            <p>There isn’t much we can do without Host logs. Next time, if you’re able, try to ask the host of the game to post their logs if this bug ever presents itself again.</p>
<p>I went back and looked for the game you were in and found the player list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] Violet (Ritualist)<br>
AIVION<br>
[2] Ogrelord (Physician)<br>
Flashu2<br>
[3] Vicious (Scorned)<br>
Ash<br>
[4] Reginald Yonge (Mercenary)<br>
IdanFt<br>
[5] Swedish Viking (Possessor)<br>
OgreMerchant<br>
[6] John Atlee (Seeker)<br>
PeakToilet<br>
[7] Edmond Selwyn (Seeker)<br>
Grizzchan<br>
[8] Purple (Apostle)<br>
Arath<br>
[9] Dansken (King)<br>
Traenor<br>
[10] Lurkinglotus (Mercenary)<br>
brettcm82<br>
[11] Dunderpatrullen (Cult Leader)<br>
Kirkus<br>
[12] Kill Me Night Two (Invoker)<br>
Lemarcus716<br>
[13] Thomas Drayton (Prince)<br>
Fright<br>
[14] Veedish Swiking (Paladin)<br>
Methnor<br>
[15] England Is My City (Psychic)<br>
Luxx<br>
[16] Lawrence (Priest)<br>
Alkander</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may well have been either Invoker controlling you into someone else, or Possessor had been in that body previously. Either way, we can’t do anything without logs.</p>
<p>I also heavily urge you to post future bug reports in the Discord first, especially if they’re in game bugs. Boslof is always watching that channel and the logs can easily be posted there.</p>
