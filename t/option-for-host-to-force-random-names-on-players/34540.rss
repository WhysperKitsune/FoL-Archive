    <title>Option for host to force random names on players</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/option-for-host-to-force-random-names-on-players/34540</link>
    <description>This suggestion is pretty straight forward.

I have roughly 130 hours of playtime on ToL now and not a single minute of it was improved by the feature to pick a name before u enter a game. In my experience this feature has only led to nickname-yoloing and what i call retardo-larping. 

People give themself stupid names and get yolod/exed by people that are offended or they proceed to spam chat with their larp which usually takes the form of quotes, song lyrics or animal sounds. I guess some people play ToL purely to annoy people doing this. If this is okay for the devs so be it but at least give lobby hosts the feature to tick a &quot;force random names&quot;-box in their lobby. 

This would be fairly easy to implement and it would improve my playing experience significantly. 
People solely in it to annoy can annoy each other while people that actually want to play the game for what it is can play amongst each other.

I would be really grateful if you would consider this suggestion.</description>

            <p>And if you are evil/neut there you go as well.<br>
Sorry but i find this even more retarded than spamming “Penis” in chat as “bait”.</p>
<p>I never heal or guard people with retarded names if not absolutly necessary.</p>

            <p>i choose stupid names on purpose because i know evil will attack me. i almost always get nk and assasin to attack me n1. This helps because observers will always follow the stupid name. If im princess well then there you go.</p>

            <p>Hmm, sound slike a good idea, but at the same time, it doesn’t really matter I guess.</p>
<p>You say that people that make the names like cat and then making their equivalent animal sounds will then get yolo steeled, exed and what have you from trolling the game. In my opinion, it might not work. People can still troll if they wished to anyway.</p>
<p>So to me, including this will not stop the problem from persisting</p>

            <p>Hence why I am suggesting it be a thing in ranked. In casual it’s not a big enough deal to do something about. In ranked every bit counts.</p>

            <p>well I’d personally say an all or nothing kind of thing… Host is just a random of 16 people meaning if it is detrimental to gameplay, it should be blocked in all games with a possible option to add in in custom private games.</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn’t oppose the change, though I can fathom a large amount of bitching after it is put in. Of course… there’s already large amounts of bitching about not being allowed to put in variations of racial slurs… so what else is new.</p>
