    <description>Hello people,

Here is 3 little things you may have noticed yet but need to be changed to me.

* The fool can be the contract of a mercenary. Since the mercenary change, the fool have 8% winning and the mercenary have obviously 80% chance to lose since the fool just want to be executed.
* The abilities charges are used even if you got occupied. I mean, you are occupied, so logically it would not use a charge since you have been roleblocked... i mean you could not use it, this is simply wrong.
* The knight should not protect target from another BD member... I mean possessor controlling prince on target protected by knight is just wrong. Prince should not be controllable already since he&#39;s jailing someone he cannot just go out of the jail and kill someone. Common sense.</description>

            <p>Balance is more important than logic.  The point of possessor is to counter knights and hunters.  And BDs shouldn’t have omniscient killing.  It’s bad enough that cold steel doesn’t kill its target if it is BD.  Killing attackers is almost omniscient, possessor is its only downside.</p>

<p>No.  Prince is already strong, it shouldn’t be made stronger.</p>

            <p>I missed the knight part.</p>
<p>Now, the possessor controls the BD member. The Knight sees them. “Oh hey, you’re BD, please perform the kill in front of me. It won’t hurt. Ya know…”</p>
<p><em>No. That doesn’t make much sense… Right?</em><br>
Knights don’t actually care, because when you’re being controlled, you are treated as an attacker. An Attacker is a danger. If the Knight chooses to guard the person, that person should stay alive at all cost.<br>
<em>“I don’t care who you are. If you dare to touch who I chose to protect, you be best prepared to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p>Also, if they only choose to let BD kill, this will cause an imbalance. Especially for the Knight, how would you code in this? IF [faction=BlueDragon], Don’t Guard?</p>

            <p>Game Balance =/= Game Logic.<br>
If that were true, Court Wizard wouldn’t exist, nor would reapers and possessors.</p>
<p>Anyways… Let’s get to the OP.</p>

<p>This should not be true. Unless he flipped Fool during the day, note that deaths at night can be <em><font color="purple">Defiled</font></em> or <em><font color="grey">Facelifted</font>.</em></p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, I think I can understand a little from your point-of-view. Using an ability and a charge being used while not being able to do anything sucks. However, I’ll rephrase it. You <em>attempted</em> to use a charge of an ability, and while in doing so, got role-blocked. Certain abilities (<font color="blue">Reanimate</font> from old Physician) didn’t get eaten. It doesn’t feel good, but I think it’s <em>ok</em> currently for the game.</p>
<p>After all, imagine you’re a butler. You occupy someone, only for them to use that ability you wanted to prevent. Certain abilities are powerful with limited usages, that is what makes them precious.</p>

</aside>
<p>True. However, will the Prince know any Possessors exist in the game? Like everyone else, they are susceptible to being controlled against their will and knowledge. The jail is another mystery we can discuss on, but the Prince like the others is a person. They have to go to sleep… and they will have their guards release the person after they’re done interrogating if he so chooses not to execute.<br>
The Prince doesn’t spend the entire night with the prisoner you know. (I know in ToL you technically do, but then the assassin doesn’t go into the jail cell and openly kill the Prince in the jail for the prisoner to see.)</p>

            <p>Why do you disagree with it? You’re basically saying that you want the game to be easier, less harsh, where every mistake can be undone.</p>
<p>If your Prince outs and they get killed by the Posessor that’s the Prince and the Kngiht’s fault. If you get blocked as Assassin when using 2-for-1, that’s your fault. You shouldn’t be given a consoling pat on the shoulder and a chance to try again. That’s against what ToL IS</p>

            <p>The whole point of charges being consumed is that it makes occupation worth something. What’s the point of blocking a powerful scum action when they’ll just do it the next night? A scum-alligned player should have to think carefully about using their powerful x-shot abilities so they don’t get blocked.</p>
<p>So you want to nerf Poss into the ground?  Without this poss would basicallty just kill every night, because that’s Possessor’s main dynamic: How do you want to use your abilities? Poss attacks can be blocked at two steps, being the possession and the attack itself. If we remove that Poss becomes a far less threatening and much less powerful NK, even with Facelift and Posssess being incredibly good abilities when used correctly.</p>

            <p>Hello people,</p>
<p>Here is 3 little things you may have noticed yet but need to be changed to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fool can be the contract of a mercenary. Since the mercenary change, the fool have 8% winning and the mercenary have obviously 80% chance to lose since the fool just want to be executed.</li>
<li>The abilities charges are used even if you got occupied. I mean, you are occupied, so logically it would not use a charge since you have been roleblocked… i mean you could not use it, this is simply wrong.</li>
<li>The knight should not protect target from another BD member… I mean possessor controlling prince on target protected by knight is just wrong. Prince should not be controllable already since he’s jailing someone he cannot just go out of the jail and kill someone. Common sense.</li>
</ul>
