    <description>So if you go to Account and click Get My Data and open the file, a few lines down are shown the wins and losses you have with each class with which you can calculate your winrates (I prefer percentages).

An interesting contrast is between my Inq and Sorc winrates, 86% and 38%.

My second best winrate is with Paladin, 83% (I don&#39;t know why this one is so high).

My worst is sadly with my favorite class, Possessor: 13%.</description>

            <p>It is, though I have 2 theories on what the Templar could be:</p>
<p>I) This is a placeholder in the event that somehow a Paladin does end up spawning with a MM and gets converted by them. It was probably added as a way so the game had some way to respond to that event without the potential complications of getting a null value returned for the converted Paladin’s class.</p>
<p>II) This was probably a class idea that never made it to the final build, which is still plausible as the Priest and Soulcatcher are still in here.</p>
<p>Right now I’m leaning towards I. It’d be interesting if we get a response from Boslof here as all of this is pure conjecture, though.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately the wins and losses are only counting the class you started with.  Nobody ever starts the game as Enforcer, for instance, so Enforcer winrate isn’t recorded separately from Knight winrate.</p>
<p>Your Knight winrate includes games where you were converted to Enforcer, and even those in which you were turned into Assassin.</p>
