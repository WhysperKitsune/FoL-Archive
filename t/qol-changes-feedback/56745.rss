    <title>QoL changes feedback</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/qol-changes-feedback/56745</link>
    <description>Hello. Really fun and well done game. Played around 30 hours and want to share my feedback with you.

**1. Logs**
There is really not much time for deep analysis and that&#39;s ok, I think the average game time is in the sweet spot. Still, when someone posts their logs and it gets formatted in a single line in the chat window, it mostly creates a mess and makes it hard to extract anything useful from them. Please support multiline formatting in chat with some number of consecutive blank lines constraint to prevent abuse.

**2. Default log layout**
I want to use it all the time. Can I not start the game by always: opening log -&gt; clicking default layout -&gt; yes I really want to use that, yes clear my logs?

**3. What if... ability explanations**
The game desperately needs it. For instance, when I am a hunter and wolf someone who gets occuppied by a drunk, will it go through? There should be some simple hover dialog explaining basic scenarios that can happen when choosing the ability target. Same goes for priority of actions, what happens first, what after etc.

**4. Premade death notes**
Are they possible?

There is more but these I feel should be priority. Also, some classes require redesign as they are just not fun to play period. Phys should be rewarded for successful healing (extra charge for some other newly designed ability that starts at 0 charges or +1 to self-care). CW suffers from similar passive design issue but has at least tornado that can cause some fun moments.</description>

            <p>I will ignore your offensive tone for now as I cannot really be bothered.</p>
<p>I argue that phys and cw are boring classes. I said many players think the same and that comes from my personal experience from simply seeing way too many people complain about getting phys in the game chat. I am absolutely sure you are well aware of the fact a random guy who bought the game has no access to the game telemetry.</p>
<p>His gameplay in a nutshell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>poisoned<br>
ok I heal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whisp: heal 4<br>
whisp back: ok</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If none of these occurrs phys can either selfcare or randomly select a guy who gets healed. I say randomly because in solo (which is the main mode, more people always go solo than group) noone evers shares anything with phys even when he asks for it and is confirmed (which can be sometimes hard to do witch alchs around).</p>

<p>Is that so? Im not gonna alluwed to statistics that noone is aware of but there is one thing you forgot: Physician is <strong>support</strong> class. You know what is that mean right? His specialization is back up teammates with their abillities in his case: the healing. As 3+ people said above me, healing is pretty confirmable in lot’s of situations. Even if i understand your concern, you need to know that he’s not some sort of superhero who is able to wipe all evildoers in one move. If you can’t understand this dependance then further conversation is pointless.</p>

            <p>Hello. Really fun and well done game. Played around 30 hours and want to share my feedback with you.</p>
<p><strong>1. Logs</strong><br>
There is really not much time for deep analysis and that’s ok, I think the average game time is in the sweet spot. Still, when someone posts their logs and it gets formatted in a single line in the chat window, it mostly creates a mess and makes it hard to extract anything useful from them. Please support multiline formatting in chat with some number of consecutive blank lines constraint to prevent abuse.</p>
<p><strong>2. Default log layout</strong><br>
I want to use it all the time. Can I not start the game by always: opening log -&gt; clicking default layout -&gt; yes I really want to use that, yes clear my logs?</p>
<p><strong>3. What if… ability explanations</strong><br>
The game desperately needs it. For instance, when I am a hunter and wolf someone who gets occuppied by a drunk, will it go through? There should be some simple hover dialog explaining basic scenarios that can happen when choosing the ability target. Same goes for priority of actions, what happens first, what after etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. Premade death notes</strong><br>
Are they possible?</p>
<p>There is more but these I feel should be priority. Also, some classes require redesign as they are just not fun to play period. Phys should be rewarded for successful healing (extra charge for some other newly designed ability that starts at 0 charges or +1 to self-care). CW suffers from similar passive design issue but has at least tornado that can cause some fun moments.</p>
