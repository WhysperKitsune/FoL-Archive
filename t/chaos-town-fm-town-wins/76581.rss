Host: NuclearBurrito

Days are 48 hours long
Nights are 24 hours long
Actions are done by messaging me
The mafia have a day chat
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it
The game will start with Day 1

### Imprisonment 
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
The majority of players are accusing the same person then they will be Imprisoned ending the day
While imprisoned you are NOT eliminated. You may still speak during the day
Imprisoned player have their role revealed. A players faction is never revealed
Imprisoned players may be freed via some role ability&#39;s
Imprisoned players may not use their ability unless specified otherwise
Imprisoned players may not vote
Players may not target imprisoned players unless specified otherwise
**Imprisoning someone each day is mandatory. If you do not chose someone then the player with the most votes will be imprisoned instead. RNG will break a tie if necessary** 

### Roles
The roles are completely separate from the factions and any player can be any role regardless of alignment
Your role will likely change throughout the game. At the start of every night you will be informed if your role has changed. You will not find out before hand unless specified otherwise. If an imprisoned players role is changed it will be publicly revealed at the start of the day.
