    <description>Allow us to buy something for gold that increases our chances slightly to get a class. You could even limit it to class types (except Special).

These would cost a lot of gold to buy though.</description>

            <p>No. Please don’t.<br>
It creates a whole new level of meta gaming.<br>
Over at SC2 we have a system and it makes it so X person is more likely town’s, y is more likely neutral.<br>
It’s terrible, and creates a borderline meta gaming that is so close to cheating.<br>
On top of that’s if a prefer system is ever put in place, you can not remove it after without a large wave of backlash.</p>
