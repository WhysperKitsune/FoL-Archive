</aside>
<p>And if it’s negative, it’s probably a cloak, or if it’s possitive, it’s probably a magic dust… so long as those abilities exist checking magic users is a silly exercise of futility.</p>
<p>Plus time is a bit of the essence.<br>
N1. Stab find immune<br>
N2. Check for magic (pray your result wasn’t tampered with).</p>
<p>N3.If non-MU, blind stab or check someone else<br>
N3. if MU- stab again.</p>
<p>By the time you are half way through checking the second one, BD’s either found the sorc for you… or cult/unseen are nearly in control of the court.</p>

            <p>I still find the entire concept of the sorc’s day abilities… as just ridiculous. even 1 use of full court frame… basically negates the entire find magic skill.</p>
<p>Currently inq is OP in the sense that there’s a 80% chance the BD will do his job for him early on… he’s UP in the sense that 99% of the time, he’s completely incompetent at his job.</p>
<p>Personally I think if the inq is to stay in the game… the sorc needs added buffs to hide from BD, and a total removal of his “make sure the inq’s abilities are too unreliable to even consider” abilities. This doesn’t seem to help much with what I consider the core problem.</p>
<p>IMO the inq either needs to be hands down better than the BD at finding the sorc… or he needs to be removed because he is currently best suited to sitting on his ass doing nothing while the BD does his job for him.</p>

            <p>May I say something?</p>
<p>If you give a class like sorc a thing to counter inquistor checks…</p>
<p>Why are you giving the inquistor a thing to counter the thing that’s countering inquistor</p>

            <p>I think you buffed inquis far too much. You made him pre patch along with removing most of his weakness with no real trade off. Sorc got a no visit passive, which is nice, but I don’t think it does enough to compensate for turning inquis into a free win again</p>
