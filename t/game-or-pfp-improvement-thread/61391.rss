    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-or-pfp-improvement-thread/61391</link>
    <description>~~Hi! I am Nerbins, and you know what I like? Cool/very stupid PFPs. If you are thinking of getting a PFP, and can&#39;t decide on which one to get, come here so you can&#39;t get mixed up with the 43 other observer PFPs! We&#39;ll try to find the best one for you!

Kitten, do you need anything improved in Murder Day and/or Forum Poker?</description>

            <p>I am sick of seeing Observer PFPs left and right, okay?<br>
I also want to possibly help improve some FM games, like Poker Mafia and Murder Day.</p>
