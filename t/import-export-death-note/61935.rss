    <title>Import/export death note</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/import-export-death-note/61935</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure this must have been mentioned at some point but I haven&#39;t found it... I find it very frustrating when I spend time, effort and talent :) to create a death note and when for any reason I am not able to show it. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;d be great to save, let&#39;s say, 3 different death notes to use them at any point in any game? I&#39;m not asking to be able to import it from outside the game but at least to be able to save our hard work for later.</description>

            <p>I have to disagree. I don’t think it’s difficult to implement at all. Especially considering the simplicity of the tool.</p>

            <p>I don’t think that is the reason.</p>
<p>I’m more thinking on how hard it would be to implement a save function</p>

            <p>Ok, so I find out that the reason that death note can’t be imported is because people using all the time the same death note could be used to find the killer based on it.</p>
<p>So I have a suggestion: when the player dies or the game ends, ask him if he wants to save his death note for the next game (but only if it wasn’t shown at all).</p>
<p>Basically once the death note is shown once, it can’t be saved for later.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
