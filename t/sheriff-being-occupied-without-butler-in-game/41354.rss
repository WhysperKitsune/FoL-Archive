    <title>Sheriff being occupied without butler in game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sheriff-being-occupied-without-butler-in-game/41354</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was sheriff. I got poisoned d4 and after this both my checks failed because it said I was occupied. We executed physician due to this (I failed to check him) and eventually lost the game. There wasn&#39;t any butler in game and illusionist got executed way before this. Probably this 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
My checks should have been done.

#### Steps to reproduce:


#### Comments:
Unfortunately I didn&#39;t save any screenshots. This game ended approx. 20:10 UTC 30th January and my in-game nickname is Thad. Probably poison now prevents sheriff from checks? Definitely a bug.</description>

            <p>I am 99% sure there wasn’t a poacher cause I am aware of this ability.</p>

            <p>It’s probably not a bug. Did you have a poacher in your game, because if there was, then they were probably the issue you were facing.</p>
