My headcanon about the Physician is that he&#39;s not smart to work out how people died, everyone else is just really dumb
Like:

Phys: &quot;So, as you can see, there is a knife left in the victim&#39;s back, and a piece of paper with a flower on it, specifically a rose, so we can deduce that this poor man was killed by...&quot;
Sheriff: &quot;The Butler!&quot;
*Physician bang his head against the wall*
Phys: &quot;No, not the Butler, see the pattern in the drawing?&quot;
Sher: &quot;Why, that pattern, so dark and floral, like a deadly plant&quot;
Phys: &quot;Exactly, so this man was killed by...&quot;
Sher: &quot;The Alchemist&#39;s deadly poison potion!&quot;
Phys: &quot;Oh my god you&#39;re an idiot&quot;
Phys: &quot;Look, there is a knife in his back and a note with a ROSE on it, the ROSE is in BLACK ink, so he was killed by...&quot;
Sher: &quot;The Knight?&quot;
Phys: &quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;</description>
