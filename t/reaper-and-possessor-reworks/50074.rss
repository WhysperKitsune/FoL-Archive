    <description>The Reaper
Faction: Neutral
Type: Killer

Passive 1: Consume Soul: If you have at least 1 soul left  and you are attacked you will survive

Passive 2: Focused: you are occupation and target change immune

Day Ability 1: Icy Touch: prevent a player from talking or voting for the day, he can only talk to YOU in a private chat box (like psychic&#39;s one) but you will not appear to him, he will see you as the reaper, requires same amount of souls (note: psychic/illusionist/apostle will be immune to this)

Day Ability 2: Frozen Touch: prevent a player from talking or voting for 5 days (or 2 days) unless healed requires 5 souls and it is only useable once, (note: psychic/illusionist/apostle will be immune to this) (note: the person will still be able to talk to the psychic, prince, or unseen/cult)

Night Ability 1: Reap: pretty much the same except it can go through night immunity

Night Ability 2: Frighten: fright a player causing them to be occ&#39;d, 4 uses only

Comments:
Most people I have met say reaper is weak and boring, so maybe adding these things will make reaper less boring to people



The Possessor
Faction: Neutral
Type: Killer

Passive 1: Driven to Insanity: Immune to occupation and target change

Passive 2: Blackened Shield: immune to death at night

Day Ability 1: Facelift: same thing as normal

Day Ability 2: Body Control: Possess another player in the day, making him unable to talk or vote but you will control him to say whatever you want and voting, you can switch back to yourself anytime and then switch back to him but after that day you will no longer be able control him, 2 use only!

Night Ability 1: Puppet Strings: Same but now you well be informed of their class type

Night Ability 2: Possess: Same old thing

Comments:
Most people I have met say that possessor barely wins so hopefully these changes can help it!</description>

            <p>Good point, but you still cant be 100% certain, what if reaper decided to do nothing just to frame the actual butler?</p>

<p>Than the lack of a reaped (which now stands out even more… as the reaper couldn’t have hit an immune with your added buff). would undo any proving this could accomplish.</p>

            <p>for the first one all NKs are immune to occupation and target change except reaper it feels a bit strange, also it comes up as offensive/killer most of these classes are immune occupation and target change</p>
<p>for the second one i don’t like the current system because they talk to the dead, the dead might give them valuable info like whose reaper</p>
<p>for the third one I can kind of see why you would</p>
<p>for the fourth one, reaper comes up as offensive/killer, what if they claimed butler and someone told them occupy me to prove</p>

<p>So a day Psychic chat? The current system is fine.</p>

<p>It is a terrible experience to be unable to participate in one of the main parts of the game. And 5 days is ridiculous. I would be outraged if this was even 2 days.</p>

<p>Interesting… I’d have to think more about this.</p>
