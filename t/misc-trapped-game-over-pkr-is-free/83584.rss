    <title>Misc: Trapped - Game over. PKR is free</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/misc-trapped-game-over-pkr-is-free/83584</link>
    <description>*For Hundreds of years,  bobbing craft full of Unfortunates have been brought to the Tower, keen to take on* &#39;**The Voice**&#39; *And its dark, magical forces. Challenges await them on every floor, and someone not to be trusted! But only one can win the &#39;Key of freedom&#39;. And the rest? Well...*&quot;

&quot;**You&#39;re Trapped! Mwahahahaha...**&quot;

**Game rules**

Up to 8 players will take part in tasks, with one player selected as a saboteur.
The saboteur will be guided by &#39;The Voice&#39; in Pms, and be tasked with ensuring the task is failed. **Saboteurs cannot talk to The Voice - only recieve orders from it!**

**Task outcomes**

If the Unfortunates complete a task, the Saboteur is automatically locked in the room - with the others advancing.
Regardless of the result, players in order instructed by the Voice will be asked to vote for the Saboteur at the end of the game. **Other than when voting, players may not talk once a game ends**
If the challenge was failed:-
If the Saboteur recieves the most votes, they are &#39;Detected&#39; and will be locked in the room
If a normal unfortunate is voted, the Saboteur chooses any player, except someone who voted for them, and they are locked in the room
If 2 or more players are tied for highest votes, as long as at least one is the saboteur, they will draw straws. The shortest is locked in the room.

**Fight for freedom**

**This game requires discord**
The 2 remaining players will face a quickfire quiz about events in the Tower. Pay close attention...

*Cast*

*Caretaker* - He will comment from time to time and provide a tldr explaination to challenges
**The Voice** - Will talk directly to the participants. Will be critical of saboteurs who don&#39;t try hard enough to sabotage challenges.

            <p>Ok. I made a few changes from the original show. Like majority vote doesn’t just yeet the unfortunate person lol wagoned and having each player make choices. The latter didn’t work as I hoped…</p>
<p><strong>Perilious presents</strong></p>

This clip is what that game was based on.</p>
<p>I was happy how this went. App did well to solve the game but Boss missed his window to disrupt discussion due to timezones. He did well otherwise.</p>

<p>Although <a class="mention" href="/u/Wazza">@Wazza</a> called this game BS, Apprentice did well to not stand out while using the trigger word. Easy enough to sabotage, harder to get away with though.</p>

<p><strong>Lost Invitations</strong></p>

Featured here at 2:10</p>
<p>This game really suffered from people not submitting actions for some reason. I’m not sure why that was but it was disappointing. Hippo threw with a bad vote though.</p>

<p><strong>Midnight Bride</strong></p>

As seen here from 7:13</p>
<p>Jane could have done more. If she wanted to pick a ‘Good’ husband, she could have picked one that wasn’t the complete opposite of all the bad husbands.</p>

<p>Disappointed that App basically killed Wim for this game by not acting.</p>

<p><strong>Fight for freedom</strong><br>
(Watch the end of any clip except the last for the version I used)</p>
<p>I nearly ran out of things to ask. Appel nearly won it. Lol.</p>
<p>All in all, I feel I did a good job recreating these games, but there are some issues to iron out. The question is, would it be worth it?</p>

            <p>I think Saboteur was PKR.  I think Appel was aggressive about accusing me and PKR just kinda sheeped it although I don’t really have anything else to go off of.  The reason that the boxes makes zero sense for me as Saboteur is because it makes it 100% impossible for me to lie.  In a 3/2 split the Saboteur can lie about which color they take, but since I have all of the boxes it makes it impossible for me to mess with things and lie.</p>

            <p>You guys wanna vote already?</p>
<p>(I also agree. The game is going much slower because people aren’t submitting actions despite multiple prompts)</p>

As much as I appreciate you hosting the game, I feel like some of these minigames have been dragged out to extremes. Such as the mail one, I feel like having it be 10+ days kind of killed everyone’s motivation. I apologize.</p>
