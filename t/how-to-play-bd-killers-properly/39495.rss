    <description>Note: This guide is not for Prince.

If you are playing Hunter and especially if you are playing Knight you may have asked what it is you are supposed to do.

The first mistake players make is playing these classes like killers whose job it is to go out and shoot bad guys. This will get you killed or BD killed because you don&#39;t have any information others don&#39;t and if a bad guy is outed then he is killed in the day.

The second mistake is playing like Support. As Knight this makes sense. You have sacrifice so you may as well use it. As Hunter you should not be playing passively. Your job is not to stay alive either.


So what is your job? You need to play agressivly during the day. You think someone is suspicious? Don&#39;t kill him yourself. Instead whisper him for a claim and tell him he will die otherwise. Your weapon is a bargaining chip more than anything. 

If you do this right then everyone quickly learns that you are Knight and you have plenty of Information to work with. From there you can start actualy using that sword of yours to do some damage.</description>

            <p>Safe-ish. It does give him some time.  Most unseen, as soon as they know Hunter is in, will start picking off phys, and then poison him.  Hunters are also liable to get reverse baited, getting them to say something out loud that makes them suspect and attack and they waste a bear, or you wait til someone makes themselves look a little suspect, and hit hunter that night, cause he’s wolfing instead of bearing. As always, a lot of factors go into everything in this game. The wolf example is way less likely if prince is still up.  When you get right down to it, There is NO “right way” to play these classes, because everything is greatly affected by up to 15 other people, day to day.  Sometimes Hunter is better of going loud and harsh early on, sometimes better to play it quiet and mop up evil endgame.  It’s never certain.</p>

            <p>Prince is always at risk when outing. Even a “confirmed” guard or healer is risky due to converts. Hell, his safest outing option is to an alch.  A knight can do a lot more late game for BD, if they can survive to get there.  If everything goes well, and Prince isn’t out until late, they can be guarding, and can double or triple BDs killing power.  Hunter works well when played aggressively, but once again, outing yourself is usually a bad idea. The sooner evil can figure out who Hunter is, the safer they are.</p>

            <p>I didn’t say to CS everyone that claims to you. I said to threaten anyone you WANT to claim to you. The response the gone is useful even if it isn’t a claim. This is especially true when you realize that an Unseen/Cult is more likely to feel threatened by this and is thus more likely to claim and a Non-Prince can float a claim and it’s no big deal.</p>
<p>The point is to be a agressive and active to get information. A passive BD is a dead BD</p>

            <p>No, what’s very anti-BD is outing you’re prince to everyone who asks, even though they have zero confirmability or town cred. If the knight publicly claims a CS on an assassin, it’s a different story, but we are not talking about just that specific scenario. Typically it’d be early to mid game, the lifespan of a knight, and I think it’s horrible to float your prince claim to everyone like that. If the knight is actually so stupid as to CS anyone that doesn’t claim to you, it at least confirms you to the court and you will not be put on the stand, where you have to claim prince publicly.</p>
<p>Another thing is that announcing your CS can go terribly wrong, especially in a cult game. You’re just setting yourself up to be ritualist swapped, or invoker redirected.</p>
<p>Note that I’m not saying that playing aggressively as a knight is wrong period. I’m saying that it’s wrong to showcase that as the only strategy for playing BD killers throughout each phase of the game.</p>
<p>A hunter is a different story, because he can prove himself by wolving somebody, or by calling out another false hunter claim. Plus he also has a means to protect himself from conversion.</p>

</aside>
<p>You should play agressivly whenever you have leverage. That does not just have to be conformability. It could also mean Immunity or in the case of Knight or butler a harmful Ability.</p>
<p>I actually think that Sheriff/Pally and CW are the only 2 BD that you can’t play particularly agressivly with in the day (and Hunter is the king of doing so having all 3 types of leverage). I’d do this Strategy as an unconfirmed Physician even because when Unseen see someone playing agressivly their first thought is “POISON HIM!”. Even as the CW and Sheriff you can play like this the second you get town credit.</p>
<p>The reason why this applies spacificaly to Knight and Hunter is because those classes have core Ability’s that are ONLY useful if used this way.</p>
<p>And Incase you are wondering. Yes this works. Yes I do it a lot. It still works if you are converted. You example despite being the worst example possable is still a somewhat legit play.</p>

            <p>It’s interesting that the consensus so far is that the information that you are the knight is not worth anything and can just be whispered on a whim to try and gather information. You might just give cult/unseen their next convert or have narrowed it down for NK to find prince.</p>
<p>Secondly, the knight is not one of the proveable claims, hence it’s fake claimed a ton. If someone healed me and asks for my class. Sure, that makes sense I have had some confirmation to believe he’s telling the truth. Was I changed target to someone, he claims drunk and asks for my class. Did a princess wisp me and knows that I visited her. Did an observer know who I visited. All of these things have one thing in common. You give away some information that the other person knows to be true and then you ask for some of their information. Aggressively threatening someone with one of your skills is something that is way more suited for the offensive classes, but showcasing this as THE strategy to play is flawed. It is your strategy and it has pro’s and con’s just like any other.</p>
<p>A sheriff could do the same thing, “Claim to me or I check you”. How is this scenario any different than a knight using this strategy. Or you actually believe this is a valid thing for the sheriff to do as well?</p>

            <p>If you think thier refusal is a sign of a Prince or other BD you could always just not CS them. The strat is to SAY you will CS them. Wether they actually do should be decided by scumreading.</p>

<p>the knight has this second button which alot of people tend to push. It’s called Cold Steel. He should be quiet about his refusal to claim then CS. Also the prince in your scenario is kinda stupid as it kills a BD</p>

            <p>Remember that them refusing to claim is still Information. Especially because it’s risky for Unseen/Cult</p>

            <p>If there is no basis for accusation (which a knight typically doesn’t have), you shouldn’t claim or be put on the stand. If I’m prince and knight whisps me that I better claim to him or he CS’es me, I’ll let him CS me and I’m not outing myself to him. Knight can support known BD roles by guarding and CSing quiet players lategame/sus claims if there is no prince. I see zero basis for why I should claim to a knight.</p>
<p>If I would be put on the stand for not claiming to a knight, I’ll find that even worse than: “He’s occupy immune, GET HIM, HE’S MM!”</p>
