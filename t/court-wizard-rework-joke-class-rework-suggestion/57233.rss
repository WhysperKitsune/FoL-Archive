    <description>Made this in 5 seconds on the discord, and one or two other people suggested new abilities/the passive.

this is not for the contest btw this is not a serious rework suggestion

CW Rework:

[color=gray]Court Wizard **Neutral Social**[/color]

[color=red]**Passive 1: Not Today! - If you try to convert the CW, you lose. (So if MM/CL try to convert the CW, their faction will automatically lose, because reasons)**[/color]

[color=red]**Passive 2: Targeted - You will know who the Prince is.**[/color]

[color=red]**Day ability 1: Whoops! - Make the prince jail himself.**[/color]

[color=red]**Day ability 2: Where are my keys? - Prevent the prince from jailing anyone.**[/color]

[color=red]**Night ability 1: Superultramegablockade - Occupy the prince! (Bypasses Prince&#39;s Super-Occ Immunity)**[/color]

[color=red]**Night ability 2: Wash - Remove any effects (heals, defends) from prince, and allow attacks only. The Prince will also be forced to execute the jailed target. (Yes, they can end up executing themself)**[/color]

[color=red]**Goal: Troll the Prince until he dies (Aka &quot;Ensure that the Prince dies&quot;)**[/color]

give feedback or die &gt;:D 

(I think I made this too serious, but eh)</description>
