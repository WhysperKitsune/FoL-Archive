    <title>[Class Suggestion] Vengeful Spirit (Unique Killer) - First Blood Death</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-vengeful-spirit-unique-killer-first-blood-death/7052</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if it would be possible, but it would essentially be a &quot;class&quot; given to the first blood victim of a night one killing as a means for that person to continue with the game with the job of interference of their killer until night four, since nobody enjoys being the first victim and having to wait the match out or leave.

Day Ability 1:
TODO

Day Ability 2 (Optional):
TODO

Night Ability 1:

Goosebumps- 1 use 

Causes the target of the killer to become &quot;occupied&quot; or be unreachable, resulting in a failed attempt. Perhaps a way to bypass occupy immune, or just false flag the person as occupied.

Night Ability 2 (Optional)

The Dead Give Life- 1 use

The vengeful spirit gives its &quot;life&quot; to protect the victim of the killers next attack. 

1) Causing the killer to either fail and be chilled for the day.
2) Causing the killer to be chilled during the day after victims death.

Lore:
TODO

Comments:

Their goal would ultimately be to see the person that killed them executed or killed by night four.

They should unable to speak with the priest or the dead until their vengeful target is executed/killed.

It could use some sort of passive.


That&#39;s about all I can think of right now, or remember anyways. Was kind of brainstorming some class ideas of which I have a few, just unsure if I should post them all at once or not.</description>

            <p>Fair enough, then would it be more offensive/support? And in the case of multiple deaths it should just default to the first reported death? And if more people survive N1 then we get more information for D2!</p>

            <p>This is not a killing class FYI! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Killer classes tend to mainly have killing abilities! This one has 1 offensive and 1 support.<br>
Their goal yes might be considered a bit too “killing” but remember Scorned is not a Neutral Killer even if he wants 2 specific people dead <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Hmm the problem here arises when multiple people die N1! As they tend to do. And it’d encourage killers to stay passive N1, which is something we wouldn’t want.</p>
