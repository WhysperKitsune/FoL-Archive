    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/chronomancers-and-temporary-death-immune-abilities/73950</link>
    <description>So I finished playing a game in which I was assassin and attacked a hunter who was time warped by chrono. I killed the chrono that same night, and there were no more healers in the game.

Unfortunately, the hunter used a bear on the night he was supposed to die, which delayed (or eliminated) his death, giving BD the win. I&#39;m not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I wasn&#39;t aware of the possibility that a bear could stop a death that had already happened. I was told that any ability that makes someone death immune (stoneskin, guards, etc.) stops the delayed death.

In my opinion, this is a poorly balanced side effect that allows characters like hunters or kings to stay alive for several nights after their deaths were supposed to happen, without healers in sight. My two cents on it, but this could be because I was on the losing end of this trick. Perhaps others could chip in with their thoughts as well, for or against this wrinkle.</description>

            <p>Wait but the interactions makes sense when the attack doesn’t initially pierce immunity (the situation above is with assassinate which doesn’t pierce immunity). Or are you suggesting the same thing I am?</p>

            <p>I agree, and the reason this occurs is because Chrono’s don’t technically “delay” deaths, they “replace” the current attack with a regular attack in 2 nights, even if the attack was one that bypasses immunity.  I was also very annoyed to find that I delayed the Mastermind’s death from being thrown by possessor into hunter’s bear … When the death caught up to him, he survived.  Which doesn’t make sense for a “delayed” death.</p>

            <p>I agree, but they could’ve used OE instead.  Safeguard and OE are much better than allies and SF.  They also could’ve made guards give feedback</p>

<p>ehhhhh. Having the same mechanic produce different interactions depending on source is just the most confusing thing you can have (and really cut’s down on the possibility for emergent play).</p>
<p>Personally I’d want chronomancer to just maintain all of the initial attack’s properties. (Delayed poison still bypasses but Delayed stabs won’t suddenly be stronger)</p>

            <p>$0.02 time</p>
<p>Heals should stop it<br>
Passive immunity should stop it<br>
Immunity-granting abilities should not</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a particularly large problem but I agree that having a bear or whatnot stopping a delayed death <em>feels</em> wrong</p>
