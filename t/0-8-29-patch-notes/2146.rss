    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/0-8-29-patch-notes/2146</link>
    <description>## General:
* Armor and weapon customization has been added. Prices are lower for now to test. Your inventory will be wiped at some point during the beta.
* Added an option in the settings to turn the camera rotation off.
* New class added to Casual Mode called The Scorned.
* Some optimizations for lower-end PC&#39;s.

## Butler:
* If a player has Black Wine on them, there will be a character minimum of 3 for their messages.
* Added a day ability called Nightshade Wine. After 3 days you can poison the King, causing him to die in two nights if not healed by a Physician.
* You will take your own life if you kill a Blue Dragon King.

## King:
* The King will no be able to be accused of treason until day 4.

## Noble:
* No longer dies when their twin dies.
* A Blue Dragon Noble can now win with the Unseen/Cult if their twin was converted.

## Scorned:
* The Scorned will be given three targets at the beginning of the game, they must live long enough to see their targets die by any means.
* The Scorned is a unique class with night &amp; occupy immune and has two night abilities.

* Bait &amp; Switch - 2 uses: Swap a player with one of your targets, causing anyone targeting that player to now target your target.
* Frame - 2 uses: Make a target appear suspicious to investigative roles.

* The Scorned will not start with the King or Prince as targets.

## Bug Fixes:
* Apparently the talking animation that&#39;s supposed to play when you type something in chat hasn&#39;t been working for a long time. It is now fixed.
* Fixed the inability to whisper while black wined. The content of the whisper can still be scrambled.

            <p>I love this different spin on Executioner. It’s much more interactive than its ToS counterpart. Requiring 3 targets to perish is a lot harder, but at least it counts if they die at night. Swapping your target into a Prince claim that will likely die that night sounds fun. I assume Scorned is just a wildcard like the Fool is.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the point of Black Wine is for BD Butlers. Even if you hit a scum with it you are giving them an excuse not to divulge any important information that day and stay quiet.</p>

            <p>First here and I have to say, I could imagine that these are going to be great changes.<br>
I like the idea of customisation and considering how early on this is, it’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The King also now stands a better chance. So when I get it, which I normally do when playing, I think I can say a collective thank you for those who roll it.</p>
<p>Also, as patch note changes get implemented onto Forum games too. I think that while this will improve the game experience itself, improving many roles, it will improve games here too. Nice choices for what was worked on. I like it.</p>
