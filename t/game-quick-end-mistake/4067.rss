    <title>Game quick-end mistake</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-quick-end-mistake/4067</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Survivors were 1 Good King, 3 known prince, 4 known assassin, 5 hunter, 11 mastermind. 5 bled 11 while 3 jailed 4. Next day, 5 announced he had bled 11. 1 accused 5, 3 and 11 voted with. 1 died from hunter strike, 5 died from execution. That left alive 3 (known prince), 4 (known assassin), 11 (mastermind bleeding out at end of night).

Game declared unseen victory.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Should have been BD victory. 3 imprisons 4 and executes, 11 bleeds out, 3 only one standing next day. Or if Prince had no execute left (not sure), should have been stalemate - 11 bleeds out, 3 indefinitely imprisons 4.

#### Comments

Suspect the problem was that 11&#39;s bleeding status wasn&#39;t taken into account. Just a guess.</description>

            <p>I don’t get why the game is so desperate to auto end matchs . Why not just let the players play it out</p>
