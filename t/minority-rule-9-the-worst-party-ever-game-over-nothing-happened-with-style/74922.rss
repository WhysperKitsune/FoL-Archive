    <description>[color=red]**Okay, listen up. You guys agreed to this party, but it&#39;s now clear to me that you&#39;re all fucking morons since you, oh, I don&#39;t know, agreed to a fucking death game?
&lt;filler&gt;
*sigh* You have one way to survive. Be a hipster and never agree with the majoriity, because as we all know everybody is always wrong all the time**[/color]
&lt;small&gt; yes i&#39;m copying the starship enphiron flavour style because why the fuck not.&lt;/small&gt;

# Welcome to Minority Rule 9.



**How to play?**
Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. If you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated.  **Only one room can have majority. If there is a tie the room which is higher up on the hierarchy (because as we all know alphabetical order determines absoloutely all cases in death games) has majority.**  The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. Do  **/Join**  to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me. 

## Rooms:

[color=lightblue]**Air**[/color] - All pickers become light.
[color=801080]**Betrayal**[/color] - If this room is tied for the minority, it gains infinite picks and becomes the majority.
[color=red]**Bloodlust**[/color] - One random player in this room will be Marked.
[color=darkred]**Communism**[/color] - If this room is not the majority, then everybody in it will be evenly distributed throughout the rooms. [color=red]**Because that&#39;s how communism works in this game.**[/color]
[color=black]**Death**[/color] - Everyone who picks this dies, even if it is not the majority.
[color=lightgrey]**Dice**[/color] - Everyone who picks this is given a random status.
[color=BFBF00]**Divide**[/color] - Everyone who picks this counts as half.
[color=505050]**Duplicacy**[/color] - Takes the effect of the room with the majority, after all other room effects are applied.
[color=forestgreen]**Earth**[/color] - A random picker becomes heavy.
[color=darkred]**Evil**[/color] - All pickers become cursed.
[color=deeppink]**False**[/color] - This room does nothing, but it takes the name of another random room.
[color=khaki]**Feast**[/color] - All pickers gain a key :key:, because I dropped some of my keys inside of my roast beef.
[color=darkviolet]**Force**[/color] - A random person who did pick this will change to a random room in the current pool.
[color=darkred]**Graveyard**[/color] - If this room is the minority, or tied for the minority, 3 random dead players will be revived
[color=BF0080]**Gravity**[/color] - A random person who did not pick this will change to this room.
[color=mediumspringgreen]**Herd**[/color] - This room will take the name of a player that is currently living. A random player who picked this room will gain the Sheep status for the next round, with the player who the room is named after is the shepherd. This does not count the player who the room is named after.
[color=cornflowerblue]**Holy**[/color] - A random picker becomes a saint. All other pickers become cursed.
[color=purple]**Illusion**[/color] - This room takes the effect of another secret item before the start of the round.
[color=gray]**Insanity**[/color] - All pickers becomes insane.
[color=cyan]**Life**[/color] - If nobody picks this, everybody dies.
[color=green]**Luck**[/color]  - If this room is the majority, then one random picker will survive. If this is not the majority, then one random picker will die.
[color=red]**Locked**[/color] - All pickers lose a key :key:. Only people with at least one :key: may enter.
[color=FFBF40]**Multiply**[/color] - Everyone who picks this counts as two.
[color=chocolate]**Mundane**[/color] - This room literally does nothing.
[color=red]**Murder**[/color] - One random picker becomes a Serial Killer
[color=royalblue]**Protection**[/color] - All pickers are immune to death this round for any reason other than the majority. A random picker becomes a bodyguard.
[color=dodgerblue]**Purity**[/color] - Everyone who picks this loses all statuses.
[color=red]**Rejuvinate**[/color] - Everyone who picks this becomes healthy.
[color=steelblue]**Secrecy**[/color] - All pickers become cultists.
[color=lime]**Spite**[/color] - A random picker will becomes cursed.
[color=orange]**Thief**[/color] - All pickers may steal one :key: from another player in the room.
[color=blue]**Unity**[/color] - If all players pick this, nobody will die due to the majority.

## Statuses

[color=#408000]Bodyguard [/color]- Nobody who picks the same room as you can die for any reason other than the majority. If anyone who would die without your intervention is saved, you will die instead.
[color=Steelblue]Cultist[/color] - If there are any cultists, then there will be an item that only its members may pick. It will be denoted in [brackets].
[color=#804080]Cursed[/color]- You will die next round unless your status is removed or your death is prevented. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=#FF0000]Healthy[/color] - You cannot die for any reason except for the majority. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#808080]Insane[/color] - Next round you must pick the majority or you will die. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=skyblue]Light[/color] - You do not count as a picker for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=lightbrown]Heavy[/color] - Your pick counts as two picks for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=gray]Marked[/color] - :x: will appear next to your name on the playerlist. If you die next round, all players who were in the room with you the previous round gain a key :key:. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=Cornflowerblue]Saint[/color]- You are immune to death. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#0000BF]Serial Killer[/color] - A random person who picks the same item as you will die.
[color=bisque]Sheep[/color] - Next round, you are forced to pick exactly what your shepherd picked. This status is removed afterwards.

**Order of application goes:**

Effects of the Room
Existing Statuses
Majority calculated (Death from majority happens here.)
New Statuses

## Extra Rules

1. This game will be played on your own. No partners. Sorry.
2. [color=red]**I left my keys all over the fucking place. Each round, one room will have a key :key: in it, and if you manage to coordinate your motor functions long enough to, all pickers who picked the room with a key in it will get a key each, because I&#39;m so fucking nice like that. Keys break ties.**[/color]

## Hippo’s Changes

There are several changes within the rooms and statuses this time. The aim was to try to reduce RNG a bit (only in a few rooms where it wasn’t necessary) and make more rooms present interesting scenarios. There is still the same amount of rooms. Look at the Change Log in Minority Rule 7 for precisely what was changed.

The way the game works is fundamentally different in this one. The rooms will be drawn in an order, and if multiple rooms are tied for majority only the room first drawn (highest up on the list) will be eliminated.

This will make the game last longer so you do not need so many people, and reduces the chance of a draw. It should also make the game more tactical hopefully, which is the main aim of most of the other changes.
