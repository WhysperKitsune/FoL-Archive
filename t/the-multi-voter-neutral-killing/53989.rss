    <description>The Multi Voter (Neutral Killing
I decided to make a Nobliesh Verison of a Neutral killing since This will help a NK claim this easier. Don&#39;t yell at
Me saying it&#39;s just a noble.
Passive 1:Diplomatic Immunity-Since you explain to the person attacking you that you can&#39;t attack them cause politics you are Death Immune and Occupy immune/Redirection Immune

Passive 2:Royal Blood:Since you are a loyal voter for the king, he has graced you with a vial of royal blood that you may show to step up for the throne incase he dies. Turns into a psycho king

Day ability 1:Poltics-Make somone vote somone else because you explain politics to them which really confused them. (3 uses) 
Day ability 2:Illegal double voting:Illegally you double voted for a trial making your votes count twice (3 uses)

Night ability 1:It&#39;s not personal kid it&#39;s just politics-Kill someone (Unlimited uses)

Night ability 2-Your vote is mine-Pick a player to kill. Then pick another player to vote the same as you. (It would show as a noble making you vote somone) (ever had those times you could never click the button fast enough) (now use this night ability for when you need to fast)(they can&#39;t vote anyone up unless you choose to vote someone up) (3 uses)


This class is designed to help NK be a 2 man army.

Don&#39;t yell at me it&#39;s a noble ripoff. By your point aristocrat is also a ripoff of noble.</description>

            <p>Isn’t this pretty obvious for an an NK</p>
<p>Your vote counting doubles is a glaring difference.</p>
<p>And making someone follow your vote can get this NK found by process of elimination</p>
<p>Can’t you just name it Politician</p>
