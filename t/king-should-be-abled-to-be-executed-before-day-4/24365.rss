    <title>King should be abled to be executed before day 4</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/king-should-be-abled-to-be-executed-before-day-4/24365</link>
    <description>From my experience, evil kings win the games like 70%-80% of the games.
I had some games when we exed mm like day 4 or day5, and NK day 5-6, and we still lost because that wasnt fast enough and unseen got numbers by day 6-7 beause of evil king.

Also butlers can&#39;t poision the king because every alch will heal the king if he is good or not.

I think king should be able to executed by day 3 and not day 4.
Day 4 is the first day somone get executed usully, and after that day there is no good chance to kill evil king.
most of the games, you just have to hope the king is good or natural.</description>

            <p>I’ve seen some old posts about this before. If you were able to execute the King early then you’d execute him day 2.<br>
Why? Because the king has a 66% chance of not being BD. Not only that but the next day you can move a Royal blood forward. Everyone with royal blood starts out as Blue Dragon. Meaning that only if the Cult Leader or Mastermind converted someone with royal blood and the council elects that person you get an Evil King.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Cult Leader can be occupied and redirected the chances in cult games are naturally lower than in Unseen games. This would only enhance the meta idea of executing the king day 2.</p>
<p>Regardless with such a meta you’d have less than 10% chance to gain an evil king while otherwise guaranteeing a Blue dragon king. Even worse would be that the Neutral Killer could simply step up day 3 as the new king. Meaning you dont waste time on the NK, less people die and the Evil Factions will struggle more.</p>
<p>No the whole idea about loyalty is to prevent this from happening and i am not a big fan of removing the immunity to votes day 1-3</p>

            <p>It’s fine the way it is. King shouldn’t be executed at all. It’s bad logic. Cultures don’t exe kings so they. If he is evil sneak in his room and murder him.</p>

            <p>I think that would just create a bad meta like NozBugz said. Just lessen the chance of  Evil King being the starter King instead.</p>

            <p>If king could be lynched D2, they would be auto lynched because “Could be evil”. Thing is, BD wants BD King<br>
Noot noot doesn’t care. Scum wants Evil King</p>
