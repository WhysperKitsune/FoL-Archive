    <description>Hi,

I wanted to try play again but I got a message saying that I was banned for a &quot;dicknote&quot; - But I did not do this, I did not play TOL for a long time. I think I played it abit after I bought it on the 16th december 2018 - fell alseep and then racked about 15 hours in play time but I never really understood what I was doing. The linked picture of the dicknote that gets shown when I login shows 5th april 2018 when it was upload on imgur LONG before I purchased the game or even played it.

if you look through my account details i assure that you will see that I did not play for pretty much all of 2020 so far also.

My current steam account name is &quot;First we eat, then we yeet&quot;. im not sure if thats different from my ign. it maybe acraaron.</description>
