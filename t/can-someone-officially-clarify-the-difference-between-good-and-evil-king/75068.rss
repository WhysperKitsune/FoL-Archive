    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/can-someone-officially-clarify-the-difference-between-good-and-evil-king/75068</link>
    <description>For instance, I&#39;m told that Evil King Allies is not fooled by frames, but Good King Allies are.

Is this true?  It says nothing about this on the class card.</description>
