    <title>Invite Code Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/invite-code-error/57126</link>
    <description>What happened:
Copied and pasted an invite code and it tried to connect and it just kept saying verifying for ages

What was SUPPOSED to happen:
It reads the invite code and joins the game

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Get invite code
2. Submit it into invite code box
3. Join game

This seems like a personal problem so please contact me with support. Forum message me please thanks</description>

            <p>If the host was in an older version that could also be the problem if it only happened once there.</p>

            <p>It worked for public lobbies did not try private ones yet, but will update you on when I test it out. I usually never use invite codes, but during the TOL IV tournament I was sent an invite code and it did not work.</p>

            <p>Did it happen once, or can you still not join with codes? Trying verifying your files just in case thereâ€™s something missing. Also, checks that you are on the latest version, there was an update couple hours ago. If you keep having issues, try to put a code and send us the logs before restarting the game.</p>
<p>Let us know if it was fixed!</p>
