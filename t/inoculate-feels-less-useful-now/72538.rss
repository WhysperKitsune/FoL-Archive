    <title>Inoculate feels less useful now</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inoculate-feels-less-useful-now/72538</link>
    <description>So inoculate was a situational ability originally but could be useful but I feel as though it’s usege has been drastically reduced 
This is because assassin and cl only have 3 charges of poison/bleed now it has less use than before 

Tell me your thoughts is inoculate still good or does it need a change</description>
