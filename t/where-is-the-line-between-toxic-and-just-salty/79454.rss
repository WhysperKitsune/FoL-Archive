    <title>Where is the Line between Toxic and just Salty?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/where-is-the-line-between-toxic-and-just-salty/79454</link>
    <description>Wasn&#39;t sure where to post this Long ass Post, tried in Discord, buuut I wrote more then 2000 words, so here we are instead

I kinda want the opinions of the community on ...let&#39;s call it 2 &quot;interactions&quot; I&#39;ve had

First one, let me set the screen:

Player 13, claims D1 Knight (he is 2nd D1 knight claims)
then late game, he is found to be Incomp with player 6

then he claims Chrono and that he delayed the death of player 5, his only argument is that he delayed 5, don&#39;t post logs or anything called BD imbeciles, and says nothing other than &quot;5 can confirm me&quot;  (5 is very slow to confirm this so 13 get exed, and he flips Chronomancer )

Then!
In dead chat, I tell him, that next time just post full logs (since going over the same line again, and again, and again only makes you look bad, right)

His reaction to that is &quot;bullshit&quot; there was nothing that could save him, 
I try to counter argue with that&#39;s its still much better to just post logs, then repeating the same thing over and over

that escalates into &quot;I should not give useless advice&quot; 
Clearly I don&#39;t think its useless to explain why a specific behaviour is bad, and asking questions about that behaviour
quickly turns into that &quot;I cant comprehend English&quot;
you know the full on &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to argue with so I&#39;m Just going to do personal attacks instead&quot;

He could simply had said &quot;I disagree&quot;

Now I don&#39;t know if this guy is new, or vet or something in between, I think I&#39;ve seen him a few times before
all i know is, I do not wish not play with him anymore (not that I can really do anything to avoid him)

And when the game ended, I gave him a report for &quot;game throwing - Fake claiming Knight as Chronomancer&quot;
(and something about shit posting)

I feel like its a Toxic behaviour and for the most party Ruins the game alltogether
well mostly I guess I&#39;m annoyed by the the way he &quot;argues&quot; cant stay on topic, and defaults to be a gramma Nazi 

what do you guys think?
is it a perfectly reasonable reaction?, is it a Minor thing, Don&#39;t care ? or are you in the same boat as me, and find it super annoying
that people are so narrow minded, they believe that they, and they alone knows what is rights and everyone else is just bad
I encounter this more frequently as of late, 

last Week _a streamer_ told me I played the game wrong, always fun when the Big boys are calling you out on stream
he got 3300 hours played, and I &quot;only&quot; got 1200 hours, clearly I don&#39;t know how the game works, and needs to be told by a grow up

What was the &quot;wrong play&quot; you asked ? 

I outed as INQ D1,
I stab King, Night 1, killes him
Vote Pretender for King
I whisper the Newly elected Pretender King &quot;hey lets go for a neut only win&quot; - hes down
2 or 3 days later he tell me he is PK

we continue to stab people untill we win (and we did)

then in prelobby, le streamer, salty as ever, tells me &quot;I need to stick to objective, simple as that&quot;
despite I won with the play I made, it was stll very wrong

And now I don&#39;t want to play with that guy anymore, telling me how I should have my fun


what both players seems to forget,
we play this game for fun, to relax (streamer aside, but the rest of us, the other 15 players, to have fun)

and being shit on, for no reason, is not fun

Over and out //Netulven</description>

            <p>Hi, this has gone to the realm of gamethrowing and therefore not in accordance to discussing on the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Well… speaking as an ex-guide… Please finish your discussion in a PM, and then come back here. If the person did not turn off email notifications, that man will have a headache from all the notifications stemming from your discussion.</p>

            <p>It’s a rule that is not even discussed really, but if you where to ask most guides, mods ect. They will say it’s a rule or apart of “Game throwing” (Which no it really isn’t game throwing)</p>

            <p>Actually it’s just straight up not the rule.</p>
<p>If you actually check the rules it says nothing about fake claiming on the stand as BD. So it’s just straight up fine so long as it wouldn’t otherwise be breaking a rule (so it’s not that it’s always gamethrowing, it’s just that if you are gamethrowing then that’s one method you might use in order to lose).</p>

            <p>Yes TOL has the wrong use of game throwing</p>
<p>Game Throwing = <strong>Purposely</strong> trying to put your team at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The rule claiming not being able to fake claim on trial has nothing to do with throwing it’s it own rule.</p>

            <p>Let’s take Looming Threat as an Example. You practically cannot claim ever as Prince/Justicar, and especially not on the stand (or theoretical stand, as there were no trials in that game)</p>

            <p>Uh not really I’ve had this arguement many times but fake claiming on stand isn’t game throwing it’s only game throwing for “TOL”</p>
<p>most social dudection games and fm wouldn’t class it as throwing, while I respect the rules of Tol game throwing isn’t fake claiming on stand as the good/town faction.</p>

            <p>Didn’t read ~90 posts from others. Posting this after finishing reading the wall post OP.</p>
<p>My opinion of the guy: It sucks to play with the him, but reporting someone for claiming A while he was B is kinda too much for me. Perhaps it’s because I never had toxicity, but I don’t mind getting attacked personally. (Yes, I know this is sounds like I don’t have the right to say that since I don’t know how you feel, but I don’t have anything else to comfort you with.)</p>
<p>Note: Reporting for game throwing is too much for me, but you can still report him for being toxic if you feel that he’s crossed the line.</p>

            <p>Do you know how the law works? If you murder someone and aren’t caught, are you still a murderer? Of course you are.</p>
<p>If you had the intention of losing, then you are a game thrower. Courts don’t decide whether or not you are innocent or guilty and the same as moderators. They decide whether or not they have enough evidence to convict you of a crime, because they can’t prove you didn’t do it or you wouldn’t be in the court anyway. There being no evidence of you killing someone doesn’t mean you didn’t kill someone.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be banned if the case was a grey line, but you would be hard pressed to find a case where intention is impossible to prove.</p>

            <p>To be honest I don’t really blame the OP for thinking that. One of the things that is a problem in social deduction games like ToL and ToS is how hard it is to explain your actions. You don’t have a lot of time to do that, and you have limited word space. Cuz of that, miscommunications happen like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wasn’t sure where to post this Long ass Post, tried in Discord, buuut I wrote more then 2000 words, so here we are instead</p>
<p>I kinda want the opinions of the community on …let’s call it 2 “interactions” I’ve had</p>
<p>First one, let me set the screen:</p>
<p>Player 13, claims D1 Knight (he is 2nd D1 knight claims)<br>
then late game, he is found to be Incomp with player 6</p>
<p>then he claims Chrono and that he delayed the death of player 5, his only argument is that he delayed 5, don’t post logs or anything called BD imbeciles, and says nothing other than “5 can confirm me” (5 is very slow to confirm this so 13 get exed, and he flips Chronomancer )</p>
<p>Then!<br>
In dead chat, I tell him, that next time just post full logs (since going over the same line again, and again, and again only makes you look bad, right)</p>
<p>His reaction to that is “bullshit” there was nothing that could save him,<br>
I try to counter argue with that’s its still much better to just post logs, then repeating the same thing over and over</p>
<p>that escalates into “I should not give useless advice”<br>
Clearly I don’t think its useless to explain why a specific behaviour is bad, and asking questions about that behaviour<br>
quickly turns into that “I cant comprehend English”<br>
you know the full on “I don’t have anything to argue with so I’m Just going to do personal attacks instead”</p>
<p>He could simply had said “I disagree”</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if this guy is new, or vet or something in between, I think I’ve seen him a few times before<br>
all i know is, I do not wish not play with him anymore (not that I can really do anything to avoid him)</p>
<p>And when the game ended, I gave him a report for “game throwing - Fake claiming Knight as Chronomancer”<br>
(and something about shit posting)</p>
<p>I feel like its a Toxic behaviour and for the most party Ruins the game alltogether<br>
well mostly I guess I’m annoyed by the the way he “argues” cant stay on topic, and defaults to be a gramma Nazi</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh what do you know, there seems to be two sides of the story.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/netulven">@Netulven</a>  hey that was me, yes I was claiming knight to bait attacks and using pocket dimension to waste them (but I never actually got attacked for some reason)</p>
<p>i delayed the hunter because he died to bleed but still got executed because he didn’t confirm me until the very last second.  I questioned OP’s English comprehension in that argument because he kept acting as if the reason I got executed was MY fault when it was obviously the hunter’s … To me he was clearly very intelligent and not trying to troll me on purpose, yet he kept talking over me as if I got executed for a legit reason so there must have been some extremely fundamental misunderstanding.  That’s why I said that</p>
<p>It’s silly to say it’s because I didn’t post full logs, that would be an empty formality (or a worse-than-useless distraction) when the biggest proof that I’m chrono is the fact I literally just delayed someone who the day previous said they were dying that night to bleed.</p>
<p>Also I know you were trying to help me but it was very annoying because sadly your advice was just plain wrong and in effect blaming me for something that wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/poisonedsquid">@PoisonedSquid</a> hey that was me also lmao</p>

            <p>Salty - This game is stupid urgh! ;/<br>
Toxic - fuck you, you smelly old Twat with no IQ, I hate you so much uninstall.</p>
<p>Be mad at the game not the player, but just don’t spam swears is all my advice.</p>
<p>I’ve never been warned and I’ve been pretty salty at times so you should be fine.</p>
<p>[Swearing can be fine just don’t use it at players and not excessively].</p>
