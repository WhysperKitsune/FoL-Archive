    <title>Hidden Rules in ToL</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hidden-rules-in-tol/48138</link>
    <description>I have recently learned that a Healer is confirmed, and that only 2 of a class can appear in the game. The game did not tell me any of this.

There should be no hidden rules. It gives players an unfair advantage if they know something others don&#39;t. I don&#39;t see any problem with this being explained anyways. Players will learn, so hiding them won&#39;t do anything.

I see no reason to hide these rules. Players need to understand how the game works, and this hinders that.

These should be made common knowledge, and also shown by the class cards, class list, etc.\
For example, put 1+ Physician/Alchemist on the class list, since it is guaranteed.

I see no reason to keep this hidden.</description>

            <p>There are wrost “hidden” rules, I’ve learnt that when princess wisp and mm convert her, the mm convert wont shown in wisp, but the other players will show, so if somone scouted the princess, it will looks like somone else have converted her.</p>

<p>It’s accurate. At the time Apostle was useless early game. They could change it now but they haven’t.</p>

<p>EDIT:  The wiki also says that the guaranteed second cult member in a cult game is either The Seeker, The Ritualist, or The Invoker.  Is the omission of The Apostle an accident or it being out of date?  Or is that accurate?  I assume it’s an accident, but I figured I should confirm.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Still Healer shouldn’t be hidden. Just put it on the class list.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a> Healer is guaranteed.</p>

            <p>The two classes maximum is not a hidden rule. If you play the game and click on the Guide tab and read the section that says “Setup” in the Basics tab, it does say, and I quote fully</p>
<p>“A max of two of each non-unique class can spawn at the start of a game”.</p>
<p>I guess it should state that there should be a guaranteed healer/confirmed healer, but as Nuclear said, there should likely be some kind of healer anyway, whether they be Alche or Physician.</p>
