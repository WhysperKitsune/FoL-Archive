    <title>Knight - died on my first successful guard</title>

    <description>Night 1
You will guard Kingcake [15] tonight.
You watched over Kingcake [15].

Night 2
You will guard Hair [2] tonight.
You watched over Hair [2].
You killed someone while guarding Hair [2] last night.
You died guarding Hair [2] last night.

The player I killed claimed to have been possessed to kill 2, so maybe if possessor sends a BD at a guarded player, it bypasses the &quot;Armored&quot; passive?</description>

            <p>I’ve done this, in my case I killed 2 people in one night, which is probably what happened for you.</p>
<p>In my case I killed the Assassin and Possessor attempting to jump in the same night.</p>
<p>The messages are independent kills.</p>
<p>“You killed someone while guarding X last night.” = kill that you survived because of Armored<br>
“You died guarding X last night.” = kill that you didn’t survive.</p>
<p>Normally you don’t see both messages at the same time.  Normally you’d only see one of them.</p>

            <p>If that’s the case case, I believe it should be made clear from the results that I killed two people. “Someone” is a singular noun and so very directly indicates that I killed only one person.</p>
