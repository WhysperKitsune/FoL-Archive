    <description>**Viking - Neutral Killing**

**Passive - For Odin!**
By the name of Odin, you shall kill anyone who attempts to convert you at night.

**Night ability 1 - Rampage** ( Unlimited )
Go on a rampage in someone&#39;s room tonight, killing your target and everyone who visits. Pierces night-immunity. 1 day cooldown.

**Night ability 2 - Feast** ( 3 uses )
Tonight you feast, making you immune to incoming attacks.

**Goal** 
Kill everyone that does not need to survive as an objective ( Same as Reaper and Possessor )


----------
So who wants a spooky Neutral Killing Werewolf clone? :sunglasses: 
I&#39;m just throwing out ideas at the moment, haha!</description>

<p>This mindset is ignorant. “If you don’t agree with me I don’t want to listen to you.”</p>
<p>We’re giving suggestions to your class as you requested. I assume you posted this class to get some sort of feedback from the community.</p>
<p>The class type shouldn’t always be indicative of what the class does. There’s no good reason why an NK shouldn’t have an investigative ability. The only reasoning I’m seeing here is “they should only kill because they’re a killer.” If any killer needed to have an ability that better directed their night kill at night, I would be giving it to the one that can only kill once per 2 nights.</p>
<p>The dev team will seriously hinder their design space if they limit a role’s abilities to ones that strictly adhere to the class type.</p>

<p>This comment is ignorant. “If you’re not going to implement a mechanic you don’t want to, I’m gonna call you ignorant”</p>
<p>She’s responding to suggestions like she said she would. I assume you posted those ideas to see if she liked them</p>
<p>The class type should be indicative of what the class does, that is the precise reason why they exist, but I digress. There’s no good reason why your idea <em>should</em> be implemented on this class if the creator doesn’t want it to be. The only reasoning I’m seeing here is “because other people like it”. If any class creator needed to have suggestions for their class, I would be giving them ones they didn’t already say “no” to/</p>
<p>The mod team will seriously hinder their free time if people keep making arrogant comments like this one.</p>

<p>Don’t tell other people they’re ignorant because they don’t like your ideas. It’s her idea, her suggestion, she doesn’t have to add anything you tell her to and she can have her own opinion.

            <p>I would be fine with an occupying ability of some sort.</p>
<p>It just needs a -I-can’t-kill-tonight ability, and I thought the most logical choice was investigating.</p>
<p>Other options:</p>
<p>-occupy (previously mentioned)<br>
-fake night results<br>
-control to change targets</p>
<p>the last two would be limited use</p>

            <p>The thing is that this role can’t kill every night. This means every attack counts. It also means that every other night you aren’t attacking. So on off nights you investigate to prepare for the next attack. Just like the MM with reveal. MM already knows his Ally’s and always wants to convert. But he has an invest ability because he cares about what he does on off days. The CL kills on off day’s. Why can’t this role be like an MM that tries to find optimal target’s?</p>
<p>Otherwise this role is hopelessly UP</p>

            <p>Seriously, Neutral Killers don’t benefit knowing other people’s classes since they need everyone dead but 1 to 4 depending on how many other neutrals are in the round, and king.</p>
<p>Max 4 neutrals spawn in 16 player games. 1 of them is you, the NK, and if you’re lucky the other 3 are Alch, Mercenary and/or Scorned.<br>
If you’re really lucky king spawns as Neutral too. So 4 potential allies at most.</p>
<p>You already know everyone’s your enemy, so you don’t need to investigate that. You also don’t need to investigate specific classes cause your job is to kill everyone regardless of class.</p>
<p>And don’t come at me with the “but if you investigate you know who to attack next and if they’re an important class to kill”<br>
<em>It’s a social deduction game use the chat to try and figure that one out <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></em></p>

            <p>NK shouldn’t waste time investing; As a minor third party, it is to his advantage to reduce the total population as soon as possible, regardless of classes.</p>

            <p>Several classes have abilities that don’t fit their type.</p>
<p>The invest ability is just a side ability.</p>

            <p>Knight defending (support). Butler poisoning (killer). Assassin distracting (social). Illusionist framing (offensive). Ect ect… Also Herbalist doesn’t examine and Phys only sees the result himself.</p>
<p>Wether NK’s in general need an invest ability or not is irrelevant. This one in particular would benefit a lot from one.</p>
<p>Plus. Don’t forget how hard it is to prove yourself without info on not dead people.</p>

            <p>I’m simply pointing out that a NK really doesn’t need an invest ability. I personally don’t like classes having abilities that don’t fit the type. Physician’s exhume is technically an investigative ability and can be used to prove themselves. I forget if the Herbalist fake Exhume still works the way I think it does. (I.e It truely announces what class killed  the target to the Unseen and a fake one is shown to everyone else) Imo Physcian is one exception</p>
