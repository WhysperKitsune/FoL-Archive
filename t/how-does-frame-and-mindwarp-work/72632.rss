    <title>How does Frame and Mindwarp work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-does-frame-and-mindwarp-work/72632</link>
    <description>There are many peoples out there still confuse when getting incorrect result.
So in this topic today, i will show you most of the work on Frame and Mindwarp.
I had not tested on some ability, so you can come up and tell me the result you got.

*Frame:
This basicly effect investigator ability.

-Sheriff/Pally:
 +Make target show up as Unseen/Cult.
 +Sheriff&#39;s Surv: Make target show up as Assassin.

-Obs:
 +Follow: Make target seem visited the person who was attacked last night. If there is no attack then the Framed target will show up as not visiting anyone.
 +Window Peek: Same as Sheriff and Pally.

-Princess:
 +Flirt: Make target show as Killer/Offensive.
           Killer/Offensive target will show up as Special/Invest. - Info by WazzaAzza.
 +Will-o-Wisp: Make target seem attacked someone.


*Mindwarp:
This one is a bit harder.

-Drunk/Butler/SS/Invoker:
 +Normal target will show up as Occ Immune, and Occ Immune target will show up as Occ&#39;able.

-Princess:
 +Flirt: No info
 +Will-o-Wisp: Make non-attack target show up as attacked someone and vice versa.

-Sheriff/Pally/Obs Window Peek:
 +Make NS show up as Evil, and Evil as BD or NS. Also make Neut show up as Evil. - Info from NuclearBurrito.

-Obs:
 +Follow: Make target not seem visited anyone or getting visited.

-Hunter:
 +Bear: Make Hunter bielive they was attacked last night.

-Noble:
 +Gossip: Mindwarp will reverse every ability you see. Example: If you see DNR Heal on target, you will rather see Healed on target.

-Phys/Alch heal:
 +Make DNR show up as healed, and vice versa. No effect on target who was cured from poison/bleed.

-Prince:
 +No info.

-Pretender:
 +No info same as Princess Flirt.

-NK:
 +No info.</description>
