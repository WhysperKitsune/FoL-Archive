    <title>Gamethrowing Neutrals</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/gamethrowing-neutrals/69827</link>
    <description>Can we clarify in the rules that Neutrals must also try to win like any other faction?  Too many Alchemists think they can sacrifice their own victory at whim to secure the win for someone else.  This can and does ruin the game for players who work under the assumption that an Alchemist can be coerced by provable threats of death and defeat.  

Then when you complain these Alchs are like &quot;Im neut i cant gamethrow LUL i choose who wins&quot;  and a surprisingly large number of players agree with them.

**UPDATE**: just read updated rules:

&gt;No Gamethrowing. Going against your goal in any case will be considered gamethrowing. **Neutrals cannot gamethrow.** 

&gt; [color=red][b]DEV EDIT:[/b]
OP caught this during a change discussion -- this wasn&#39;t necessarily the final change. 
**UPDATE 2:** 
After discussion, we have decided **not** to change the rules, as the rules have always reflected our original intention: Alchemists choosing a side is **not** going against their own objective. If they want to choose and they still aim to win, that&#39;s not going against their objective -- just a perk of being neutral.

**WOW** 

so apparently i can side BD as NK now ... very disappointing but im going to try it out... really takes away a huge part of the competitive element out of the game  since now you can have up to 4  trolls every match</description>

</aside>
<p>Note that this is a <em>separate</em> rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t leave the game early. It is okay to leave while dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also applies to neutrals. I’d like to work rules as short as possible so it doesn’t get TL;DR, but we may add a mention that leaves while alive are also punishable. Anyway, WIP~</p>

            <p>It’s true – we don’t want people leaving or outing themselves d1, going against contract, etc. OP caught the edit literally seconds after it was updated while I was still editing before the change was even announced. The current version looks like this:</p>

<p>You’re NK - that is, <strong>neutral</strong> killer. You can side with whoever you want. If it doesn’t work out, you can blow them off at the last second. It’s not troll – it’s <strong><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neutral">neutral</a></strong>.</p>

<p>doesn’t matter, he admitted to suiciding, please don’t miss the point, i’m not talking of an alch trying to win but dying, i’m talking about an alch who got killed on purpose and we know he got killed on purpose because he admitted to it in-game and in post-game chat, you are missing the point</p>
<p>according to the rules that is clearly admitting to gamethrowing</p>

            <p>The thing was that it’s not a guaranteed suicide to do it. You could’ve been bluffing as Unseen or so on. It’s not like the Alch pressed a suicide button or something. If he had SS potions at that point in the game, you would not consider it gamethrowing, right? So why is it any different now?</p>
<p>The ones who killed the Alchemist were Unseen.</p>

            <p>It’s because unlike other classes, an Alchemist doesn’t have teammates to work with. They are basically, a solo wildcard. Gamethrowing would be where your actions hinder the chance of your faction’s victory, which ruins the game. But as an Alchemist, you’re not obligated to help anyone win. It’s Neutral.</p>

            <p>I’d say that as long as there was some incentive to win (meaning survive) it wouldn’t be gamethrowing, like in this situation. HOWEVER I understand that this guy had the chance to win with Unseen but because the Alch was threatened, he decided to ruin your day by siding with BD King. It’s a thin line, but if you guys hadn’t threatened to kill the Alch, maybe he would’ve sided with you guys.<br>
It’s like man’s inherent free will and how we all don’t like being forced to do something. Because he was forced to do it or be killed, the Alch chose to rebel at the cost of his own life. But if asked politely and given a choice, he would’ve listened. As an Alch I usually bomb people who give me death threats but ally with people who ask nicely, be it BD, Unseen, Cult, or the NK. It isn’t gamethrowing.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: be polite to your neighborhood alchemist.</p>

<p>Of course, but as I pointed out, I’m talking about alchs who admit it point-blank without shame</p>

            <p>I don’t think you understand what i’m saying.  Your own rules state that going against your objective is considered gamethrowing.  An alch deliberately getting himself killed is going against his only objective, which is surviving.</p>
<p>So I’d like a clear response to the question, if an alch admits to getting himself killed on purpose, is he admitting to gamethrowing?</p>

<p>You can always argue that it was your strategy to survive and that’s a hard claim to defeat</p>

<p>That’s not gamethrowing. Alch doesn’t have to side with the majority</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m going to have to take <a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a> 's side on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrals are… well, neutral!</strong> They are wildcards. Chaotic. They can go either way and choose any side they want for any reason. If they “throw”, they only threw their own game for themselves. If they promised you something and lied, they are allowed to do that. It’s a gamble whether or not to trust Neutrals.</p>
<p>Be nice to your neutrals for a better chance of them siding with you (not saying you weren’t, but a general tip)~ if people go <span class="hashtag">#neoutsout</span> and you survive as a neutral, do you want them to win? I’d go the opposite way out of spite as long as I’m a neutral and not breaking any rules.</p>

            <p>Not true, the rules state going against your objective is gamethrowing.  An Alch’s objective is survive so getting killed on purpose is gamethrowing.  I guess the replies here are proving my point that we need this clarified in the rules lol</p>

            <p>Alchemists are not capable of throwing by their design (solo play style and various strategies to survive). They are the wildcards. However imo NK can still “throw”.</p>
