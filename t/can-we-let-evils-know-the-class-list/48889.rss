<p>MM can discover classes, as can Seeker and some converted Unseen. Also, I’ve found out people’s classes as a “confirmed” BD after getting converted just by lying and acting like I’m trying to gather info.</p>

            <p>It still feels a bit like a shortcut to me. I think <a class="mention" href="/u/aquillion">@Aquillion</a> has a point that there is room for improvement in making it easier to fakeclaim, but I don’t see this proposal as one that rewards deduction and risk-taking. It feels like the clues are simply given to you.</p>

            <p>What if instead all evils received a list of (only BD) classes that are already present at their maximum number? So, instead of being told exactly what every class in the game is, they would only be told that there’s a hunter and 2 physicians?</p>
<p>This prevents being able to confirm that there’s no healers left and immediately using all poison/bleed, since alchs aren’t revealed. It also stops them from spotting other evil claims immediately.</p>
<p>The only big negative I can see with this is that it allows evil to know if a psychic is present in the game, which might be a bit too much info for a possessor since they know they can go ham if a psychic didn’t spawn.</p>

            <p>Yes and no.  Uncovering false claims is a huge part of the “meat” of the game, so it shouldn’t be too easy for BD (and it currently is, IMHO.)  It also shouldn’t be impossible, but I don’t think that that’s a major risk at the moment.</p>
<p>That said, for all that I want to make it easier for evils to fakeclaim, I don’t like this suggestion.  This is just handing them too much information.  They should have to use deduction and take risks, too.  This seems like something that <span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span> one particular NK might have, but not all evils as a group.</p>
<p>(It would also make it much easier for evils to spot each other, especially Poss / Reaper vs. Cult / Unseen.  That’s not desirable.)</p>

            <p>I think there’s a value in needing to keep your claims flexible until you’re forced to claim, though. If I were Evil/NK and I saw on the class list that there was no Princess or no Hunter, that gives me a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Assuming you’re not choosing an easily confirmable class, making fake logs is not the difficult part of lying as Evil/NK; it’s choosing which class to claim, when to claim it, and who to claim it to. It would be a big advantage for Evil/NK for BD to be delayed in suspecting any of their claims. Many times BD puts someone up because there’s too many claims for that class - reducing that would be a huge buff for Evils imo.</p>

            <p>It would still be risky in the sense that you don’t actually have the claimed class’s abilities.  Getting outed because you’re the 3rd of a class isn’t social deduction.</p>

            <p>I’d agree with this, with the stipulation that neutrals are not revealed on there. Evils should still do some reading to discern fools/scorned/alchs/what kinda NK.</p>

            <p>Well there’s certainly pro’s and cons to the concept, I mean the big ones are people can know if say hunter etc… is on the table. The con, is of course, unseen/cult and NK aren’t on the same side, and would certainly rip eachother new ones. As to avoid BD, the smartest play for scum that doesn’t want to get executed, is to claim the classes that are flat out not in the game. But then the OTHER evil faction will spot them instantly upon claim. So not only would the reaper know he can claim sheriff… but he also will sell that sheriff claim via calling out the assasain, which he knows because the assasain claimed CW, and there is no CW in this game.</p>
