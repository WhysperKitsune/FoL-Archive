    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Accomplice (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-accomplice-neutral-offensive/60614</link>
    <description>**The Accomplice - Unique Neutral Offensive**
_Your objective is for the Neutral Killer to win._

&gt; **Watchful** (Passive) – You will know whom the Prince jails.
&gt; **Black Heart** (Passive) – If the Neutral Killer dies before Day 3, you will win if the Cult/Unseen win.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carbon Copy** (Day) – Select a target and you will see the feedback of that target&#39;s abilities tonight.  Will not show conversions.  Not usable until Day 2.   (unlimited uses)
&gt; **Level Playing Field** (Day) – Disable a target player&#39;s day abilities. (2 uses)
&gt; 
&gt; **Interfere** (Night) – Control a player, choosing whom they target. (unlimited uses)
&gt; **Do Not Disturb** (Night) – Occupy all players who attempt to visit the target.  Bypasses occupation immunity. (2 uses)

_Note: Depending on win rate balance, Sorcerer&#39;s &#39;Perception&#39; passive could be changed to include the Accomplice as a target the Sorc will not attack_

The Accomplice is designed to give a boost to NK win rates, but also to boost evil win rates when the NK dies early (particularly from leaving), which tends to give BD extra time to find evils.  The first day and night abilities are meant to help the Accomplice find the NK, while the second day ability and both night abilities can help protect the NK.

Watchful allows the Accomplice to know who is in jail.  This can help piece information together and maximize the effectiveness of Interfere and Carbon Copy.  It also gives the daring Accomplice the opportunity to claim Prince, which could shake up the meta a bit and have some situational uses.

Carbon Copy is a modified day version of the Noble&#39;s Gossip night ability.  Unlike Gossip, CC can detect attacks.  The ability is not usable D1 to (1) provide some cover to MM/CL and (2) prevent the Accomplice from finding and outing the NK d2 to get themselves aligned with evil.

Interfere can also be used to find the NK.  Since Sorc and Poss are redirect immune, successful interference rules the target out as one of those.  While reaper can be redirected, Accomplice could deduce the reaper by tracking reaper deaths.

Once the NK is identified, Accomplice can use Level Playing Field to prevent king from pointing finger or Prince from jailing, buying valuable space for the NK in crunch time.  Do Not Disturb can protect the NK from Order Execute, Cold Steel, Debauch, and Attacks.

While the Accomplice does have powerful abilities that can help the NK, the Accomplice is vulnerable to death (including at the hand of the NK) and struggles to have a convincing claim as a K/O that is not occ immune.</description>
