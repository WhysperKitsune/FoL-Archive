    <description>* As Soulcatcher, please don&#39;t let one of the souls randomly choose King as a target. Yes, the King is a Special class type. No, you didn&#39;t help at all you little piece of junk soul. Randomness is lame enough, but when it hits the King it feels especially bad.

* Allow the Illusionist to erase EVERYBODY&#39;S chat history. Erasing a single player&#39;s history is a fantastic idea in my opinion, but is very, very underwhelming. It&#39;s unique and cool and I dig it. But I&#39;d rather have the public announcement ability instead of this so that getting converted as a Psychic isn&#39;t an insta-lynch the next day.

* Replace Black Wine with...anything. It doesn&#39;t do anything but allow for a few giggles. It confirms a Butler&#39;s presence, but it also doesn&#39;t accomplish much. If a Scum is Black Wined, then they have an excuse not to contribute to discussion or give a proper defense.

* Remove Alchemist&#39;s Blur because it is basically auto-win when you are a neutral who can confirm themselves 100%. BD never hangs Alchemist claims and evils never waste a night killing Alchemist claims. Easy ELO.

* Add a discussion during King elections. If neither candidate confirmed themselves before the election, it&#39;s basically a game of chance on who to pick. I&#39;d like to hear them sell themselves on why they should be King.

* If you send a message during a period of time where they aren&#39;t allowed (Defense of the Accused, King Elections), please do not let it send upon hitting Enter! Just let it sit there so you don&#39;t have to retype the same message once your time to talk comes again.

Just some random thoughts. That Soulcatcher suggestion is what really prompted this post. PLEASE CHANGE THAT.</description>

            <p>The problem with ELO is that gamethrowing becomes a bigger problem.</p>
<p>If players don’t really lose/gain anything from following the rules of conversion related gamethrowing, they will likely follow them. However, if you have the classic 1 MM 1 assassin 1 neut king and 1 butler with parties left, AND they gain points for game-throwing (not throwing party), then people will be much more likely to throw the game when it comes to conversion</p>

<p>Alchemists aren’t dangerous to BD at all. Like you said, this isn’t ToS where you insta lynch survivor claims. Alchemist can win the game for BD outright. They are more BD aligned than scum aligned in every game because they don’t know who scum is, so they might accidentally help BD anyway even if they try their hardest to make them lose.</p>
