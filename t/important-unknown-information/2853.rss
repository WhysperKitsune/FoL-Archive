Throne of Lies Chat Log Feedback
-
There is a lot of information in Throne of Lies, that is actually your #1 weapon in the game. Sometimes the information you get in the in game chat log is confusing or vague, and you don&#39;t really know what that means... of what possibilities that could be. 

**Example:**
If you are a Drunk and use Debauchery on player 5... you get the feedback info in chat of: &quot;You were unable to target player 5&quot;

That is not a direct quote to what the exact phrasing is but the problem I have is... what exactly does that mean? 
Is it the Prince? 
Is it the person the Prince jailed?
Turns out... it was the Mastermind... 

So I have played the game a lot at this point, and I have lots of options running thorough my head, but I&#39;d want to have a for sure list of possibilities that each message could mean. 

I don&#39;t think that the games chat log should necessarily change but I wanted to make this post to help people understand what is said, so it is clear what the information you got actually was. 

**Another example:**
&quot;something prevented you from visiting your target&quot;

So was I role blocked?
Were they jailed?
Were they the cult leader and an Invoker used their night ability?
Turns out that is the message for targeting a player that has a Court Wizard Barrier used them.

I know multiple of these messages will be used for the same thing... but as a &quot;min-maxer&quot; I want to know exactly what each of those phrases means so I can memorize them and know what my possibilities are.

**Solution:**
- I need help from the Devs to make a post clarifying what each phrase is triggered from/ possible outcomes
- We make this (or a new post) Wiki and we collectively compile what each of the chat log phrases means and what outcomes are possible. I will start writing down exact quotes from in game and compile them to this post.

I definitely believe their should be some ambiguity with the phrases and each one have multiple reasons that caused it... I just need to know what those possibilities are.</description>

            <p>I went back and edited some information about the Unique roles, but still believe that there should be markings on the class cards, especially for new players.</p>

<p>It all depends on who it was that tried visiting, if someone tried to convert the target then it would be ice ward. In this case I was a Butler who tried to role block the target, but the target had a Barrier from a CW.</p>

            <p>Prince and Sheriff/Paladin are obviously unique. As well as Priest, Hunter and Psychic on BD side. Unique neutrals are reaper, possessor and scorned. As far as I know they can all 3 spawn in the same game. Depending on how you define a unique class, all unseen classes could be considered unique. There can never be more of 1 at the same time after all. For Cult there’s at most one Cult Leader at a time, rest of the cult classes can be as many as 3 even.</p>
