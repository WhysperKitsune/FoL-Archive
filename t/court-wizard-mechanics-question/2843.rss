    <title>Court Wizard Mechanics Question</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-mechanics-question/2843</link>
    <description>I am trying to clarify some mechanics on the Court Wizard.
- Barrier and Ice Ward. What do those look like to the person they are casted on? Do they get a message saying that it happened? or do they get a message if it was a successful protect? or no message at all?
- What does barrier actually protect against? If it doesn&#39;t work on kills/ converts... then would it only work against role blocks/ drunk redirects/ hunter dogs?

I am making a &quot;Fake Journal&quot; Guide updated for current patch with some ideas and this is the last class I have some confusion about the feedback/ true capabilities of each ability.</description>

            <p>I wish CW barriers would let the protector know. I was in a long match with a CW protecting me, as a prince, and I had to go by only their word.</p>

            <p>Barrier should protect against roleblocking, Sage’s firewall and Shock, Invoker’s mind control, Scorned’s Frame…</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>Uhh<br>
…</p>
<p>Yeah, so Barrier is pretty fucking weak.</p>

<p>The person that has the ability used on them will not receive a notification. However, whoever tries to visit (in ice ward’s case) or use a negative effect (in Barrier’s case) will get this notification. <code>Something prevented you from visiting &lt;Player's Name&gt;[Number] room last night</code> (or something like that)</p>
