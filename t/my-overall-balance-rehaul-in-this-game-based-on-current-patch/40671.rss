    <title>My overall balance rehaul in this game based on current patch</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-overall-balance-rehaul-in-this-game-based-on-current-patch/40671</link>
    <description>Will go through all the roles the way they are sorted from the class list:

**Butler:**

    Changed day ability Nightshade wine:
    Now kills the king the next night. Cannot be healed. If you kill a good king with this ability you will commit suicide (1 use)
    New passive:
    Royal Servant:
    Your vote on who should become king now counts twice. You will keep this passive even if your role changes.

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Butler feels underwhelming compared to drunk. First of all his nightshade wine ability is way too slow for when he detects king to side with the evils and second of all even if that one is buffed he should get a special incentive since he is the class thats supposed to counterplay evil kings.
[/details]

**Court wizard:**

    Changed night ability barrier:
    Now occupies the person attempting to harm your target the next night.
    Removed Tornado
    Added new night ability aegis of light:
    Protect your target with a gleaming aegis of light preventing them from being visited and killing anyone trying to visit this person. (1 use)

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Cw feels very underwhelming to many people. Hence i thought of how to make cw have more possibilities on counterplaying his opponents (occupying evils that seek to do harm were perfect for me since it wont make cw a killing role but more aggressive). Also i think tornado causes way too much harm, which is why i decided to give him aegis of hope which should be crucial on the development of the game (hence 1 use only)
[/details]


**Death Knight:**

`No changes`

**Drunk:**

`Removed royal blood passive`

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Drunk is kinda a hit or miss role. I feel very sceptical about them able to know deb and attack and hence out an evil person. I however did not want to fiddle with it too much which is why i decided to just remove his royal blood since he can kinda confirm himself too easily.
[/details]


**Hunter:**

`No changes`

**Knight:**

`No changes`

**Noble:**

`No changes`

**Observer:**

    New passive sneaky:
    Following does not count as visiting

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
2 Observers watching the same target causes unnecessary confusion and furthermore would give him a slight deserved buff since the other investigative roles get buffed anyways.
[/details]


**Paladin:**

    Think hes fine maybe needs Immunity to bleeding though.

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Just cause he seems underpowered compared to sheriff (even though sheriff is unique)
[/details]


**Physician:**

`No changes`

**Prince:**

`No changes`

**Princess:**



    Change results of flirt.
    Already in the works though so no need to comment on it here

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Flirt results are kinda hit or miss atm.
[/details]

**Psychic:**

`No changes`

**Sheriff:**

    Now is convertable again.

    Surveillance reduced to one use.

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like sheriff is really overpowered now because he can out the evils without having bd fear he might be converted.
Also i think surveillance with its 3 uses is too high since it can basically make you find even more evils easily.
[/details]


**Alcoholic:**

`Removed royal blood passive (look at drunk)`

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Look at drunk
[/details]


**Assassin:**

    Changed day ability distract:
    Make a player vote for guilty during trial (one charge)
    (that one might be too op)

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Feeling like distract is borderline useless. This is just a (very powerful) suggestion im not sure about myself but wanted to add for people to give feedback on.
[/details]


**Aristocrat:**

`No changes`

**Duchess:**

`No changes`

**Enforcer:**

`No changes`

**Herbalist:**

`No changes`

**Illusionist:**

    Changed night ability Mental Blur:
    Now randomizes the people that upvoted a person on trial in the logs of your target. Also changes everyones guilty and pardon votes. Your target wont be notified they have been mental blurred (2 uses)
    
Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Some people state that this change would involve Rng, which is correct and i agree that its not the best way to change this ability. However it feels very useless right now because psychic is a role which is usually known to court and as soon as you use mental blur everyone will know youve been converted which makes it a no-no imo.
[/details]


**Mastermind:**

`No changes`

**Nightwatch:**

    New passive sneaky:
    Following does not count as visiting (look at obs)

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Look at Obs
[/details]


**Poacher:**

`No changes`

**Sage:**

`No changes`

**Sellsword:**

    New passive: Efficiency

    Whispers to unseen members will be hidden from the public (look down for mercs version of this)

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Cause otherwise people would know the merc has been converted
[/details]


**The Servant:**

    Royal Servant:
    Your vote on who should become king now counts twice. You will keep this passive even if your role changes. (look at Butler)


Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Otherwise people would know easily the butler was converted.
[/details]


**The Apostle:**

`Lowered Snoop charges to 1`


Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like cult sacrifices its members basically never. So i tried to give the stronger roles less charges of their abilities to make them more short term.
[/details]


**Cult leader:**

`lowered starting eradicate charges to 2`

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like cult sacrifices its members basically never. So i tried to give the stronger roles less charges of their abilities to make them more short term.
[/details]

**Invoker:**

`no changes`

**Ritualist:**
    
     Brotherhood charges reduced by one.

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like cult sacrifices its members basically never. So i tried to give the stronger roles less charges of their abilities to make them more short term.
[/details]

**Seeker:**

    New function to expose:
    Also listen in on the conversation between prince and his target.

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
On this one i felt like its ability is kinda weak compared to the other ones.
[/details]

**Alchemist:**

    Stoneskin portion charges reduced to 3
    You may only use emerald potion at or after night 3
Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Prevent yolobomb (Why would you want to kill someone so early as a role that wants to live??) also stoneskin portion charges reduced in order to not just stoneskin all the time and then claim alc in the end.
[/details]


**Fool:**

    No changes

**Inquisitor:**

`Cult members are no longer magic users.`

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like this gives BD too much of an incentive to help and trust an inquisitor.
[/details]


**Merc:**
`    New passive loyalty: Whispers between you and your contract target are hidden from the public EDIT: for the first 3 days` (credit to NuclearBurito for this idea)

    (Saves merc from being exposed too easily)

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Many times when two people whisper each other often (and neither of them is king) its a merc and its target which makes them being outted easily. (Im not saying thats always the case but it would be a justified buff imo)
[/details]


**Psycho King:**

`No changes`

**Possessor:**

`You will no longer keep the logs of the person you possessed.`

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Currently the strongest nk class. I feel like if you have to bait out the logs of the person you possess you require the possessor to have to be more active in order to remain trustworthy in his new body.
[/details]


**Reaper:**

    New passive: Innocence 
    Will appear as a neutral &amp; social class to investigative roles

**Scorned:**

    New passive Despair
    If both of your targets get killed at night become a desperate fool.

    New role: Desperate Fool
    Same as fool but you have to be formally executed the next day or you will commit suicide.

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I dont think the Scorned should lose when both his targets die from an eradicate or something. However he then should not have the same possibilites as a fool cause that would just be a fool powercreep class imo.
[/details]


**Sorcerer:**

    Changed passive mage armor:
    People that attempt to kill you will be prevented from visiting you. People that try to occupy you or change your target will believe they succeeded (you will not attack the drunk though)

Increased magic dust charges by 3`

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Currently the weakest nk role. Mainly because she shows up as occupy immune and target change immune which makes her too weak as a fakeclaim. But making people believe they couldnt visit her should give her some safe space.
[/details]


**King:**

`Splitted Kings secondary night abilities depending on their faction`

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Feel like its hard to give a king a universal ability no matter whats his faction.
[/details]


**Good King:**

    Chance that a good king spawns: 47.5%
    Changed guards:
    Your target wont know you send them a guard. 
    Reduced guards uses to 3

Killer guards:
No changes

Reason for changes: 

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
Guards is a really strong ability and can also make Bds believe the king is a good king by making it possible for them to see who he guarded and who not.
[/details]

**Neutral King:**

    Chance of the Neutral king spawning decreased to 5%
    Now can only side with neutrals
    Changed guards:
    Your target wont know you send them a guard. (6 uses)

    New passive: Brotherhood:
    You will know who the neutral killer is.
    If the neutral killer gets formally executed you will take your life the following night.

    New passive: Diplomatic Immunity:
    You are always immune to death at night.

    New second ability Allies:
    Determine the faction of the player you are checking. You will ignore frames and deceives. (3 uses)

Reason for changes:
[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
This was the hardest one out of all for me. I was thinking on how to balance him so he can side with both factions but i couldnt come up with anything. So i thought it would be a really cool idea to make him a rare wildcard which people will still have to play around though.
The fact that he has to side with nk/neuts makes him a bit weak though which is why i gave him super abilities like better check and let him know his ally (the nk)
But knowing that people are trolls; the king will have to take his life too and hence lose if he outs the nk cause otherwise there will be some trolling neut kings.
[/details]


**Evil King:**
    Chance that an evil king spawns: 47.5%
    Changed guards:
    Your target wont know you send them a guard. (3 uses)

    New second ability Deceive:
    Choose a player and change their class results to a chosen option. {Options: Attacked and healed; Member of the Unseen; Member of the Cult; not suspicious; has been converted; Attacked but immune; occupied; changed target to} (3 charges)

Reason for changes:

[details=&quot;Zusammenfassung&quot;]
I feel like herbalists defile ability is really strong in the right hands. This combined with an evil king who knows who sheriff is gonna check will make stuff more interesting i think. Also gives some counterplay to the invest results of a sheriff for example.
[/details]




Alright i hope some people like atleast some of these ideas lol.</description>

            <p>Also I think the reason you disagree is because unlike you I think of the NK as a faction on a similar level as the other 2.</p>

            <p>I remember disagreeing with those at the time, and I still do. 20% NK wins is way too many and starts to detract from the core faction gameplay.</p>

            <p>I’d say an NK win every 1/10 games is more than enough. Any higher and something is up. Any lower than 1/20 or so is around the low bounds, and 1/25 is definitely too low.</p>

            <p>He wouldn’t need it now.</p>
<p>Also the Reaper change you suggested is straight up a Nerf.</p>
<p>Also the King change makes king convertible.</p>
<p>Also even the possessor is super hard to win as, I’d say he has the correct power right now and that the other NK’s need buffing.</p>
<p>Sorc passive change is good but she doesn’t need more dust. Ironically the more dust she has the less effective the ability is.</p>
<p>As for the inquis I would make it so that the starting CL and any converted magic uses are magic, otherwise magic uses are cleared not cult.</p>

            <p>Good idea that would make it not too op but also possible for them to safely confirm themselves to their contract.<br>

            <p>Thank you for your comprehensive feedback:<br>
CW: Yea i kinda agree but idk how to make him feel more impactful <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Drunk: Well he somehow needs a nerf and i didnt wanna nerf his core gameplay. Maybe give royal blood to some other classes instead?<br>
Illusionist: I couldnt figure out sth better on this one. The current ability is just straight off bad which is why i included this one.<br>
Merc: With timed you mean make it like psychics private matter?</p>

            <p>Butler: Support so long as it’s usage isn’t shown outside of ties.</p>
<p>CW: New Ability seems cool but Barrier change is Def bad.</p>
<p>Drunk: No Support. There needs to be a good amount of royals so that converting one isn’t rare</p>
<p>Obs: Support 100%</p>
<p>Paladin: No need, he’s fine as is.</p>
<p>Princess: Support</p>
<p>Sheriff: not really sure. I’ma play more games with him and get back to you on that.</p>
<p>Illusionist: What even is this suggestion!? Also no RNG plz.</p>
<p>Merc: Make it timed and you have a deal. I don’t want sellswords being outed this way.</p>
<p>Almost everything else I’m either not sure on or don’t support.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your Feedback:<br>
Well overall I was trying to give meaningful buffs to Butler and King, while kinda nerfing drunk and sheriff<br>
Also the cult number changes i made cause it usually isnt mandatory to sacrifice a cult member and by changing the numbers i believe it might become an option<br>
Also tried to reflect my cw changes on people claiming cw to be boring and really defensive and some QoL changes which i thought would be fitting.</p>
<p>If you got any specific question about a change hit me up.<br>
The amount of time i put into these thoughts was  already quite huge which is why i didnt add reasoning (yet) Might do that tmrw though if people are interested.</p>
<p>EDIT: i added reasons for every change in the main post in a spoiler.<br>
Pardon any mistakes english isnt my first language.</p>

            <p>Like the Butler/Drunk ideas a lot. Probably going to suggest those ones be implemented.</p>
<p>Not convinced on the rest - any chance you could explain some of them?</p>

            <p>Will go through all the roles the way they are sorted from the class list:</p>
<p><strong>Butler:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Changed day ability Nightshade wine:
Now kills the king the next night. Cannot be healed. If you kill a good king with this ability you will commit suicide (1 use)
New passive:
Royal Servant:
Your vote on who should become king now counts twice. You will keep this passive even if your role changes.
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Butler feels underwhelming compared to drunk. First of all his nightshade wine ability is way too slow for when he detects king to side with the evils and second of all even if that one is buffed he should get a special incentive since he is the class thats supposed to counterplay evil kings.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Court wizard:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Changed night ability barrier:
Now occupies the person attempting to harm your target the next night.
Removed Tornado
Added new night ability aegis of light:
Protect your target with a gleaming aegis of light preventing them from being visited and killing anyone trying to visit this person. (1 use)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Cw feels very underwhelming to many people. Hence i thought of how to make cw have more possibilities on counterplaying his opponents (occupying evils that seek to do harm were perfect for me since it wont make cw a killing role but more aggressive). Also i think tornado causes way too much harm, which is why i decided to give him aegis of hope which should be crucial on the development of the game (hence 1 use only)</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Death Knight:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Drunk:</strong></p>
<p><code>Removed royal blood passive</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Drunk is kinda a hit or miss role. I feel very sceptical about them able to know deb and attack and hence out an evil person. I however did not want to fiddle with it too much which is why i decided to just remove his royal blood since he can kinda confirm himself too easily.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Hunter:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Knight:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Noble:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New passive sneaky:
Following does not count as visiting
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>2 Observers watching the same target causes unnecessary confusion and furthermore would give him a slight deserved buff since the other investigative roles get buffed anyways.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Paladin:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Think hes fine maybe needs Immunity to bleeding though.
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Just cause he seems underpowered compared to sheriff (even though sheriff is unique)</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Physician:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Princess:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Change results of flirt.
Already in the works though so no need to comment on it here
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Flirt results are kinda hit or miss atm.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Psychic:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Sheriff:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Now is convertable again.

Surveillance reduced to one use.
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>I feel like sheriff is really overpowered now because he can out the evils without having bd fear he might be converted.<br>
Also i think surveillance with its 3 uses is too high since it can basically make you find even more evils easily.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Alcoholic:</strong></p>
<p><code>Removed royal blood passive (look at drunk)</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Look at drunk</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Assassin:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Changed day ability distract:
Make a player vote for guilty during trial (one charge)
(that one might be too op)
</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Feeling like distract is borderline useless. This is just a (very powerful) suggestion im not sure about myself but wanted to add for people to give feedback on.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Aristocrat:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Duchess:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Enforcer:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Herbalist:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Illusionist:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Changed night ability Mental Blur:
Now randomizes the people that upvoted a person on trial in the logs of your target. Also changes everyones guilty and pardon votes. Your target wont be notified they have been mental blurred (2 uses)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Some people state that this change would involve Rng, which is correct and i agree that its not the best way to change this ability. However it feels very useless right now because psychic is a role which is usually known to court and as soon as you use mental blur everyone will know youve been converted which makes it a no-no imo.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Mastermind:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Nightwatch:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New passive sneaky:
Following does not count as visiting (look at obs)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Look at Obs</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Poacher:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Sage:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Sellsword:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New passive: Efficiency

Whispers to unseen members will be hidden from the public (look down for mercs version of this)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Cause otherwise people would know the merc has been converted</p>
</details>
<p><strong>The Servant:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Royal Servant:
Your vote on who should become king now counts twice. You will keep this passive even if your role changes. (look at Butler)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Otherwise people would know easily the butler was converted.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>The Apostle:</strong></p>
<p><code>Lowered Snoop charges to 1</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>I feel like cult sacrifices its members basically never. So i tried to give the stronger roles less charges of their abilities to make them more short term.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Cult leader:</strong></p>
<p><code>lowered starting eradicate charges to 2</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>

<p><strong>Seeker:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New function to expose:
Also listen in on the conversation between prince and his target.
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>On this one i felt like its ability is kinda weak compared to the other ones.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Alchemist:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Stoneskin portion charges reduced to 3
You may only use emerald potion at or after night 3
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Prevent yolobomb (Why would you want to kill someone so early as a role that wants to live??) also stoneskin portion charges reduced in order to not just stoneskin all the time and then claim alc in the end.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Fool:</strong></p>
<pre><code>No changes
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Inquisitor:</strong></p>
<p><code>Cult members are no longer magic users.</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>I feel like this gives BD too much of an incentive to help and trust an inquisitor.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Merc:</strong><br>
<code>    New passive loyalty: Whispers between you and your contract target are hidden from the public EDIT: for the first 3 days</code> (credit to NuclearBurito for this idea)</p>
<pre><code>(Saves merc from being exposed too easily)
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Many times when two people whisper each other often (and neither of them is king) its a merc and its target which makes them being outted easily. (Im not saying thats always the case but it would be a justified buff imo)</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Psycho King:</strong></p>
<p><code>No changes</code></p>
<p><strong>Possessor:</strong></p>
<p><code>You will no longer keep the logs of the person you possessed.</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Currently the strongest nk class. I feel like if you have to bait out the logs of the person you possess you require the possessor to have to be more active in order to remain trustworthy in his new body.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Reaper:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New passive: Innocence 
Will appear as a neutral &amp; social class to investigative roles
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Scorned:</strong></p>
<pre><code>New passive Despair
If both of your targets get killed at night become a desperate fool.

New role: Desperate Fool
Same as fool but you have to be formally executed the next day or you will commit suicide.
</code></pre>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>I dont think the Scorned should lose when both his targets die from an eradicate or something. However he then should not have the same possibilites as a fool cause that would just be a fool powercreep class imo.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Changed passive mage armor:
People that attempt to kill you will be prevented from visiting you. People that try to occupy you or change your target will believe they succeeded (you will not attack the drunk though)
</code></pre>
<p>Increased magic dust charges by 3`</p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Currently the weakest nk role. Mainly because she shows up as occupy immune and target change immune which makes her too weak as a fakeclaim. But making people believe they couldnt visit her should give her some safe space.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>King:</strong></p>
<p><code>Splitted Kings secondary night abilities depending on their faction</code></p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Feel like its hard to give a king a universal ability no matter whats his faction.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Good King:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Chance that a good king spawns: 47.5%
Changed guards:
Your target wont know you send them a guard. 
Reduced guards uses to 3
</code></pre>
<p>Killer guards:<br>
No changes</p>
<p>Reason for changes:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Zusammenfassung</summary>
<p>Guards is a really strong ability and can also make Bds believe the king is a good king by making it possible for them to see who he guarded and who not.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Neutral King:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Chance of the Neutral king spawning decreased to 5%
Now can only side with neutrals
Changed guards:
Your target wont know you send them a guard. (6 uses)

New passive: Brotherhood:
You will know who the neutral killer is.
If the neutral killer gets formally executed you will take your life the following night.

New passive: Diplomatic Immunity:
You are always immune to death at night.

New second ability Allies:
Determine the faction of the player you are checking. You will ignore frames and deceives. (3 uses)

<p>This was the hardest one out of all for me. I was thinking on how to balance him so he can side with both factions but i couldnt come up with anything. So i thought it would be a really cool idea to make him a rare wildcard which people will still have to play around though.<br>
The fact that he has to side with nk/neuts makes him a bit weak though which is why i gave him super abilities like better check and let him know his ally (the nk)<br>
But knowing that people are trolls; the king will have to take his life too and hence lose if he outs the nk cause otherwise there will be some trolling neut kings.</p>

<p>I feel like herbalists defile ability is really strong in the right hands. This combined with an evil king who knows who sheriff is gonna check will make stuff more interesting i think. Also gives some counterplay to the invest results of a sheriff for example.</p>
