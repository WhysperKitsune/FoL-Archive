    <description># Duchess
&gt; Bat Eyelashes also returns faction in addition to class type. Ex: Neutral Killer or BD Support

# Nightwatch
&gt; Follow renamed to Stalk. It now returns the full Night results of target player instead of who they visited in addition to who visited them. Ex: 5 Found that 7 was Unseen! 5 Was attacked and healed. 2 and 3 visited 5

&gt; Watch carefully now also returns how meny charges of limited use Ability&#39;s they have. Ex: 4 is the Hunter. 4 has 1 bear and 2 wolves.</description>

</aside>
<p>Skewed balence is bad because it results in random swing.</p>
<p>The benefit you mentioned can be achieved without skewed classes by making classes that are more or less versitile and making those that are less versitile stronger at what they do but useful in less situations.</p>
<p>For example the Sage is incredibly versitile. Swaps can screw with invests and healers but can also be used to Doge attacks and to prove yourself. WoF can bypass defences on a prince and can protect Unseen from the attacks of the NK</p>
<p>Yet Frenzy is just better for killing high profile targets such as Prince due to the granted Occupy Immunity. And Protect is simply better than WoF for defence due to having additional uses.</p>
<p>Thus Sage is not better or worse than Enforcer. Yet I can find plenty of reasons to spacificaly seek one over the other depending on the situation.</p>

            <p>I don’t agree with you, but why is skewed balance such a bad thing? It gives evils more incentive for better target selection towards making quality converts, instead of only having to deduce prince. That gives evils way more strategic depth and simultaneously the same holds true for BD trying to protect their “higher quality” possible converts. Of course it should not be too skewed, because that will lead to problems of people not being happy with their impact on the game.</p>
<p>This thread mostly compares bat eyelashes to all of Marshal and Nightwatch from what I have read so far. With what you only half-quoted, I tried to say that that is an unfair comparison and Duchess also has royal blood and can hide the entire unseen, but more importantly the MM, from Sheriffs. I am personally happier to convert a sheriff/observer n1, but prefer a princess convert all nights after. That means I disagree with the premise of this thread that duchess needs buffs, because she is underpowered relative to other investigative converts.</p>

            <p>Duchess is supposed to be underpowered as compared to Marshal and Nightwatch, if purely thinking about their investigative abilities. The same holds true for their BD counterparts. Duchess has royal blood, which makes the path to an evil king so much easier, which fills up a conversion slot on the unseen roster. This is extremely powerful and I haven’t even seen it mentioned here. She also has Dark Wisp, which is the only real defense against a confirmed sheriff checking MM.</p>

</aside>
<p>Seriously? An Unlimited use day fullcop? That’s OP AF even on scum. Also I am not trying to make the ability better than Probe in every way.</p>
<p>Also a faction and type check narrows it down to at most 3 classes compared to prove that narrows it down to 1 or 8 classes depending on faction.</p>
<p>BD offensive = Drunk/Butler<br>
BD Investigative = Princess, Sheriff, Obs<br>
BD Social = Mystic/Noble<br>
BD Support = CW/Phys<br>
BD Killer = Knight, Hunter, Prince<br>
Neutral Killer = Sorcerer, Possessor, Reaper<br>
Neutral Support = Merc/Alch<br>
Neutral Social = Fool/Scorned<br>
Neutral Investigative = Inquisitor</p>
<p>As you can see the Duchesses results are HUGELY impacted by including faction.</p>
<p>For example right now Support contains 2 Neuts and 2 BD that you might want to convert</p>
<p>Killer contains 6 classes!</p>
<p>Including faction almost doubles accuracy. And with the remaining uncertainty it isn’t usually that important besides with killer (Hunter vs Prince is definitely important. Obs vs Sheriff however… Not so much)</p>

<p>Probe should determine your target’s exact class regardless of their faction if watch carefully is changed though.  There’s no good reason why it shouldn’t be able to find neuts.</p>

            <p>Defile is extremely hard to use effectively and I seldom see it used well by the majority of the playerbase. The logs discrepancy is also quite obvious usually. It also effectively outs the herbalist. I more often than not see a herbalist being caught, because he used drug too, instead of actually saving the herbalist. The abilities are also useless aside from attempting to deceive.</p>

            <p>Watch Carefully literally gives more accurate results when checking a neutral, and the same results as Probe when checking BD. I don’t see how you can see Probe as a better Watch Carefully.</p>
