    <description>Okay, I was just in a game where i was the sole BD left with an evil king and a scorned. The scorned kept demanding things to vote for either side, not deciding at all. It continued 3 times before it would end in a draw and i had enough. He demanded i would &quot;sing&quot; a serenade for him to get his vote, while the king argued his own things. I was Psychic, linking him with the dead. Still he did nothing to end the game until i had enough when he demanded the serenade.

It really ruins the game experience when a narcissistic personality abuses the game to get his ego stroked on behalf of so many others, who just want the game to end so they can get into a new one.

I am not sure how to deal with this issue, but it sure ruined a good game for me.</description>

            <p>Personally most neutrals want the game over with too.So the player you have may be a troll.I usually don’t end up in this situation as the neutral will decide who they will vote with the day you(butler or drunk) vs CL/Assassin vote each other.</p>

            <p>Well, hey. If this is a problem in particular with Scorned why not just suggest they can’t vote anymore nor be factored in auto-resolve should they successfully execute one of their targets? Either that or have the Scorned just ‘die’ happily, satisfied with getting their revenge. (They could still “trollbox from the grave”, just not be a part of voting, etc)</p>

            <p>I did what i could within my limits. I am not going to degrade myself in front of someone who kept voting and pardoning for 3 days in the game, still wanting ego stroked. Yeah, he was not obligated to vote a certain side, but the thing is, he did not vote for anyone, he just kept it going left and right, playing both me and the king.</p>
<p>Then when i didnt want to play after his tune, he finally sided with the king. If i hadn’t snapped, it would have gone into a draw.</p>

            <p>Scorned is Neutral, they’re not really obligated to vote for either side. After their targets are dead there’s not much left for them to do. Many other Neutral’s are the same way, except for Mercenary <em>most of the time</em>.</p>
<p>Next time just be more persuasive with swinging the Neutral vote in your favor, is all I can suggest. This is a problem that will never go away so as long as there’s a Neutral faction.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, scorned suicided when both they’re targets died.  I was a fan of taking that out, but maybe it needs to come back.  Things like this are a big part of why neuts out is so strong though.</p>

            <p>I agree on this. I’m tired of games ending like this. Fix the algorithm to force a vote, kill the scorned, make his vote not matter since he won already (why is he even voting), or end in a draw.</p>
