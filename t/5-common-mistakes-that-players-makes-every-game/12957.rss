**1) Worst mistake: Voting unseen in the first days before the MM is dead.**
By voting out assasian/converted unseen you just help the MM getting more progress and converting more people. the best way to deal with it is just block the assasian with night occupation.

**2) Guarding king as a knight on first nights**
Almost every possessor game i&#39;ve played started with a knight and another random character dies in N1 because the knight who guarded the king killed the possesed character and his own life.
Futhermore, there is more then enough defense for the king in d1, as most of physician and alchs decide to heal the king, what I think should be alch job only.

**3) Make the king- the king of the game.**
I see alot of games where players just do whatever the king is telling them, even if he want&#39;s to exe a player that noone checked. You can make your own decisions.
King have the best chance to be evil from all the players (33%), and even natural kings often side with unseen/cult. giving the king unneeded information is also a bad habit.

**4) Killing the NK when the unseen will get majority.** 
I&#39;ve seen players killing the NK when there were 6-7 players and the unseen had 3 players for sure.
On those situation killing the NK will just lose you the game the next night when the unseen will get their majority, unless there is a prince alive.
Don&#39;t forget that the NK have to keep the game balanced in orders to surivive so he may as well kill some of the unseen members.

**5) Not doing anything in day on the end of the game.**
I&#39;ve seen alot of games where players just don&#39;t vote out anyone, and the cult/unseen win just because of that. Somtimes you&#39;ve got to gamble, and its not that hard if you can see the logs.
 

**In conclusion**
It&#39;s have been frustrating to see players making the same mistakes over and over again. I would love to see some guides about tactics in the game that can be available for newer players.</description>

<p>1 is very bad. There’s a 1 night cooldown for the Mastermind to convert. Kill the Assassin’s freely at your leisure. You can only occupy someone three nights in a row anyway until they’re immune.</p>

</aside>
<p>So a kill every 4 nights? sign me up! BD needs this time to find the MM.<br>
If you’ll exe the assassin they will get a new 1 in n3, while bd will lose a player, most of the time the investigator who found the assassin.<br>
Before the MM dies assassin kills are irrelavent, unless its really the end of the game.</p>

            <p>The other mistake is NK killing super badly.<br>
I have made this example ALOT.Once upon a time,i was an alch.<br>
There was a Reaper,3 unseen,2 Bds,and a BD king i think.<br>
Reaper has to reap unseen to win.<br>
Reaper then proceeds to reap the ALCH.<br>
HIS ONE POTENTIAL ALLY.<br>
Then he loses to unseen bc unseen have majoirity.<br>
All bc he reaped the alch.</p>

<p>-Poison/bleed him<br>
-All knight will proceed to guard the enxt most important person, all physician/alchs will heal him<br>

            <p>what I see a lot of is people making their mind up pre trial .<br>
they get someone up and then the guy gives a good account of class and log and people just exe him without getting fact checks etc .</p>
<p>Some people  are terrible at not making themselves suspicious. Either as bd or unseen you need to come across as not suspicious .If you actually get put up on trial just state your class and log at the very least or you are getting exed</p>

            <p>Well i’ve seen evil king get some BD on trials without evidence and then say that they made a mistake.<br>
For example, kill a paladin that gave a wrong information about a scorned target, a good king can just check the paladin.</p>
<p>Neutral kings tend to side with the winning side, so when the priest was around that was BD, now its unseen/cult more often.</p>
<p>And while I do agree about the sheep thing, I think players should have more trials  to get info,<br>
Also I think that a prince that out himself isn’t that bad of idea when alchs,physicians,drunks and court wizards can protect him.<br>
As a known prince you can just force everyone to give you logs and role, and that can make your life alot easier</p>

            <p>I don’t really agree with 3 just because i’ve never seen an evil king just kill a BD for no reason as they will just get exe’d the next day. I have however seen plenty of BD kings kill BD as they are more likely to make that mistake.<br>
I also rarely see neutral kings side with unseen/cult especially as they don’t know who unseen/cult are and most people root for the good guys(atleast until its inconvenient)</p>
<p>You should have something similar on your list about not being a sheep. When 1 person votes for someone for no reason or getting yolo forced by a noble suddenly the entire court just votes that guy for completely no reason and now you may have the prince on trial that has to give the game away just because 1 guy decided to randomly vote him.</p>
<p>Also people should be more aware of checking for trollboxes, they usually are pretty obvious but people tend to jump to mass voting when the king gets trollboxed.</p>

            <p><strong>1) Worst mistake: Voting unseen in the first days before the MM is dead.</strong><br>
By voting out assasian/converted unseen you just help the MM getting more progress and converting more people. the best way to deal with it is just block the assasian with night occupation.</p>
<p><strong>2) Guarding king as a knight on first nights</strong><br>
Almost every possessor game i’ve played started with a knight and another random character dies in N1 because the knight who guarded the king killed the possesed character and his own life.<br>
Futhermore, there is more then enough defense for the king in d1, as most of physician and alchs decide to heal the king, what I think should be alch job only.</p>
<p><strong>3) Make the king- the king of the game.</strong><br>
I see alot of games where players just do whatever the king is telling them, even if he want’s to exe a player that noone checked. You can make your own decisions.<br>
King have the best chance to be evil from all the players (33%), and even natural kings often side with unseen/cult. giving the king unneeded information is also a bad habit.</p>
<p><strong>4) Killing the NK when the unseen will get majority.</strong><br>
I’ve seen players killing the NK when there were 6-7 players and the unseen had 3 players for sure.<br>
On those situation killing the NK will just lose you the game the next night when the unseen will get their majority, unless there is a prince alive.<br>
Don’t forget that the NK have to keep the game balanced in orders to surivive so he may as well kill some of the unseen members.</p>
<p><strong>5) Not doing anything in day on the end of the game.</strong><br>
I’ve seen alot of games where players just don’t vote out anyone, and the cult/unseen win just because of that. Somtimes you’ve got to gamble, and its not that hard if you can see the logs.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong><br>
It’s have been frustrating to see players making the same mistakes over and over again. I would love to see some guides about tactics in the game that can be available for newer players.</p>
