    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-sorcerer-neutral-wildcard/2929</link>
    <description>**Passive: Magic surge**
You have 2 charges. You lose 1 every night you don&#39;t kill. You gain 1 every time you kill someone. If you ever have 0 charges, you will explode in a rush of pent-up magic, causing you to die.

**Passive: Meditate**
You do not lose charges on night you are occupied


**Night ability: Flaming bolt**
_Infinite uses_
Kill the target.

**Night ability: Chain lightning**
_infinite uses, 2-day cool down_
Kill the target, whoever they visit, and whoever that person visits. 

**Day ability: Arcane ward**
_expends a charge_
You will be immune to visits the follow night.


goal: survive</description>

            <p>Yeah, this class would be frustrating to play as, or with. There’s no reason why it wouldn’t have standard NK goal, or why it can’t just be a killer. In saying that, if it did have a standard NK goal, there’s no reason for its passive to even exist, since you would be killing to reach your goal. Also, Wildcard is reserved for classes that don’t fit in anywhere else. This is not that. Refer to the two existing wildcards, the Fool and the Scorned. Both have unique win conditions (read: not just surviving) and abilities the specifically cater to reaching their goal. This is just a neutral killer with a goal that doesn’t match. I will also say how ridiculously powerful Chain Lightning could be, even with a 2 day cooldown, but, since this class doesn’t have death immunity, you would almost always kill yourself with it. This class is all over the place.</p>

            <p>Why does it have to kill?</p>
<p>This is just frustrating to both the sorcerer and any potential allies</p>
<p>Alchemist is already executed purely because it can kill people, and this class<br>
A. Must kill to survive<br>
B. Must bring itself closer to death in order to protect itself from death<br>
C. Has abilities that do not match its goal</p>
<p>The best thing to do as this class would be to kill the king on night 1 and step up to become king “I’m sorcerer guys, make me king so i don’t have to kill anymore”</p>

            <p>With immunity to occupation that doesn’t lose charges as passive is quite OP alongside with Arcane Ward spam since you cannot get touched except for The Prince’s Imprisonment or accusation on Trial.</p>

<p>It is an NK… It has two night abilities that kill. Alot. Both abilities have infinite uses…</p>
<p>At least Alchemist can only kill a certain number of times. Same as Merc.</p>
<p>But no, this “neutral survivor” has infinite uses of his killing abilities, albeit one of which has a 2 day cool down for whatever reason. Still, it can kill infinitely. Not so much a survivor than he is a killer.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, not quite good idea when occupying roles will spam occupy your Sorcerer to the death, sparing the execution for that.</p>
<p>No, literally what I just said, losing charges to be immune to visits one night and you are forced to attack or die trying, and the worse thing that can happen is imprisoned or occupied by butler, court wizard and I can go on.</p>

<p>they are not supposed to, you chose between doing them and randomly killing.</p>
<p>will revise so killing is not random but is mandatory.</p>

<p>If you did not use an ability the previous night or this night (be it from choosing not to or being occupied) you will release magical energy, killing a random player.</p>

<p>So if they do nothing they can just kill people? Thats not fun for the person who is playing it -_-</p>

            <p>Random chance based abilities are a personal hate of mine, as it makes your win chance luck based. This class would just be executed as soon as they ended up having to claim, as you offer nothing to Blue Dragon, and would likely be revealed too early to have evil majority, and even then, don’t offer much to an evil faction that has majority, either. The neutral killer goal would suit a class like this better, but still, random chance and what seems like doing nothing for large parts of the game.</p>
