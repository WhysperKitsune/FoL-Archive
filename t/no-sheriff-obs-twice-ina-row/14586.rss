    <title>No Sheriff/Obs twice ina row</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/no-sheriff-obs-twice-ina-row/14586</link>
    <description>Two games in a row BD didnt even start with a Sheriff/Paladin or an Observer. Seems like this needs to be fixed. A min of 1 each of those should spawn, if they get converted, whatever gg bad guys, but its pretty hard to sus out factions with only prince and princess to investigate.</description>

            <p>It used to be a thing where a Paladin would be guaranteed to spawn in a Cult game while a Sheriff was guaranteed in an Unseen game.</p>
<p>After that point when the two classes became convertible, they removed the uniqueness of the class, and then up to two could spawn. We were warned that the two classes are no longer guaranteed to spawn at this point.</p>
<p>As the others had said, you need to start learning to scum read people and notice carefully for mistakes such as a third Paladin claim or incorrect results as a Princess (I learnt that the hard way as the MasterMind…)</p>
