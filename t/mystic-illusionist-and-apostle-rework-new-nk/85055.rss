    <description>&gt; # [color=&quot;steblue&quot;]The Mystic[/color]
&gt; [color=&quot;steblue&quot;]**Blue Dragon Social**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Busy Mind: You are immune to occupation and redirection. This is kept upon changing class.
&gt; Passive: Linked: You may anonymously speak with anyone else with this passive. At the beginning of every night, you know how many people have this passive. This is kept upon changing class. (People with this passive are distinguishable, however the people originally linked will be randomly given numbers, and then anyone who is added will get a subsequent number. Ex. There are two mystics and a seer at game start. They will each be randomly assigned a number 1-3. They each use their day ability. Their targets will be randomly assigned numbers 4-6)
Day ability: Link: Give target player the *Linked* passive. Only you will know their identity. Usable Day 1. Unlimited uses.
Night ability: Power of the Mind: Grant a player with the *Linked* passive a slight buff  tonight based on class type. Unlimited uses.
Night ability: Protect Minds: Heal everyone with the *Linked* passive. 1 use.
&gt; 
&gt; **Power of the Mind Buffs:**
Killer: Target player&#39;s attacks bypass death immunity.
Offensive: Your target&#39;s ability bypasses immunity to occupation and redirection. They will know whether or not their target was immune to occupation and redirection, but not that this ability was used on them. Their ability will not bypass the Court Wizard&#39;s *Intensify* ability. You cannot be occupied or redirected by using this.
Support: Your target will be redirected to themselves.
Social: Your target will be immune to conversion.
Investigative: Your target will always receive correct information with their ability.
Special: Your target will be aided if they are occupied or redirected (same as Intensify)

&gt; # [color=&quot;purple&quot;]The Illusionist[/color]
&gt; [color=&quot;purple&quot;]**Unseen Social**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Busy Mind: You are immune to occupation and redirection.
Passive: Linked: You may anonymously speak with anyone else with this passive. At the beginning of every night, you know how many people have this passive. This is kept upon changing class.
Day ability: Link: Give target player the *Linked* passive. Only you will know their identity. Unlimited uses.
Night ability: The Illusion: Target player with the *Linked* passive receives a debuff based on their class type tonight. Unlimited uses.
&gt; 
&gt; **Illusion Debuffs:**
Killer: Target player&#39;s attacks can be stopped by anything, regardless of buffs or the ability. Note that on the night after someone is reaped, that person cannot be saved, even by this ability.
Offensive: Target player is no longer immune to occupation and redirection.
Support: Target player is redirected to you.
Social: Nothing happens.
Investigative: Target player will receive results as if their target was framed.
Special: Nothing happens.

&gt; # [color=&quot;darkred&quot;]The Apostle[/color]
&gt; [color=&quot;darkred&quot;]**Cult Social**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Busy Mind: You are immune to occupation and redirection.
Passive: Linked: You may anonymously speak with anyone else with this passive. At the beginning of every night, you know how many people have this passive. This is kept upon changing class.
&gt; Day ability: Cult Pressure: Force your first target to accuse your second of treason and prevent them from voting or accusing for the rest of the day. 2 uses.
Day ability: Link: Give target player the *Linked* passive. Only you will know their identity. Usable Day 1. 1 use.
Night ability: Intrigue: Frame target player and receive feedback for any abilities used on them. 3 uses.
Night ability: Silence Minds: Debuff target player with the *Linked* passive tonight based on their class type (check Illusionist debuffs)

&gt; # The Seer
&gt; **Neutral Killer**
Passive: Linked: You may anonymously speak with anyone else with this passive. At the beginning of every night, you know how many people have this passive. This is kept upon changing class.
Passive: Foresee Attacks: You are immune to death at night and bleeding.
Day ability: Link: Give target player the *Linked* passive. Only you will know their identity. Usable Day 1. Unlimited uses.
Day ability: Isolate: You cannot be accused of treason today. 1 use.
Night ability: Mental Force: Attack target player. Unlimited uses.
Night ability: End Links: Attack two players with the *Linked* passive. Bypasses death immunity. 4 use.

Changed Social buff to make target player be immune to conversion.
Apostle now has 1 use of *Link*
End Links now attacks two linked players, uses raised to 4.

<p>They will think any target is not immune to occupation and redirection.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yikes, this is no buff.</p>
<p>Changing to:<br>
If your target hits an immune target, your target will know that their target is immune, but not that their ability succeeded anyway.</p>

            <p>Plus even if you change it, I dislike the concept of neighborizers in ToL and this can cause the problem of like 3 mystic game which would likely be very painful and confusing for even pro players.</p>
<p>All in all: Mystic in ToL is one of my least favorite classes since a Neighborizer in a game where the meta is to out immediately, this class is basically just a boring link prince class and do nothing for the rest of the game kinda deal.</p>
