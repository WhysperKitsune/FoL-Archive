            <p>Fixed it to your suggestion. My other question was how do you think this would fit into the game and is it balanced?</p>

            <p>Just remove as much RNG from the class as you can and you will be fine. Make entity’s vision a pariy cop check for example.</p>

            <p>I actually like this idea a lot. I think I’m going to change this to your suggestion. What’d you think about the abilities and the class concept in general</p>

            <p>I’d just make the wincon: Survive to see the BD fall. Cuz that what it really is.</p>
<p>Also the buff should be based on that person’s class rather than RNG.</p>
