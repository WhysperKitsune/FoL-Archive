[Only usable if you have died while performing a dark ritual] You will haunt a player, killing them(their role will be hidden), you shall then use their corpse to resurrect yourself, however, you will realise what you have done and feel stricken with guilt, and decide to finish what they started(you become their role)
Note: All neutrals and the Cult Leader are immune to haunting

Lore:
Something about worshiping a demon IDK

Notes:
Immune to conversion
