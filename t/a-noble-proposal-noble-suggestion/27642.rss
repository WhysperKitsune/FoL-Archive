    <title>A Noble Proposal [Noble suggestion]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-noble-proposal-noble-suggestion/27642</link>
    <description>Pondering on it a while, I came up with an idea for how to make a Noble useful and interesting enough to be brought back. The aim is to add some depth and counter play to discovering a king&#39;s allegiance. May be a bit too much, but I&#39;ll let you all take a look and decide for yourselves:

&gt; **Noble:** 
&gt; - Passive: Royal Blood 
&gt; - *New* Passive: Trusted Successor
&gt; If you become a king, gain 2 uses of the Allies ability.
&gt; 
&gt;  - Day Ability: Overthrow
&gt; Put the king on trial and attempt to become the new king. If the king is executed and was a good king, guards will kill you at night. Cannot be used the first 3 days (1 charge).
&gt; 
&gt; - Night Ability 1: Royal Informants
&gt; Discover the king&#39;s actions tonight (3 charges).
&gt; 
&gt; - Night Ability 2: Rig the Trial
&gt; Tomorrow, you may vote an additional time during a trial including your own. This vote will appear as anonymous (Infinite uses).


**Reasoning and thought process:**
[details=&quot;Trusted Successor&quot;]
Normally, deciding who becomes king is based on which class is least important when trying to become the next king. This ability aims to change that a little. Now there will be a class that is an appealing choice for the next king, and also gives evil/neutral classes an interesting class claim when trying to become the next king. It is independent from the Noble&#39;s Overthrow ability so as to not encourage using Overthrow too hastily.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Overthrow&quot;]
Makes an announcement in the chat box saying &#39;A Noble is attempting to overthrow the King!&#39; This skips the process of voting up the king and immediately puts them on trial. This might be the most imbalanced part of the ability. Guards killing the Noble at night if a good king is executed is a means of adding risk to the ability.

**Alternative Suggestion:** Put the king on trial and attempt to become the new king. If you fail to execute the king or if the king is a good king, guards will kill you. Cannot be used the first 3 days (1 charge).

^ Increased risk to the Noble, should the king be pardoned.
[/details]


[details=&quot;Royal Informants&quot;]
Helps the noble determine if the king has discovered evil players or taking suspicious action with their guards. Given limited charges since it is a powerful ability.
[/details]


[details=&quot;Rig the Trial&quot;]
A new default night ability for the Noble, when Royal Informants is out of charges. When a trial happens the next day, a second pair of voting options appears beneath the others with a title &#39;Anonymous Vote.&#39; Anonymous votes will appear at the end of the list of player&#39;s votes during a trial saying &#39;An anonymous vote was made for Execution.&#39;

Might be easier to make this a day ability instead of night, but Noble would still need one more night ability.

**Alternative Suggestion:** Rig the Trial instead reduces the number of necessary votes to start a trial tomorrow by 1.
[/details]

Please, give this a look over and let me know what you think :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>While I don’t disbelieve they would have trouble being important, I do think the investigative ability is important. It enables them to have reason to overthrow the king. I would not want every game to have a Noble just choosing to overthrow the king because they can. I want them to be able to see the king is good, too.</p>

            <p>As I said above, I actually think it’s still a social class.<br>
I think he would survive ok without his investigative ability also.</p>

            <p>I do agree that ‘Rig the polls’ isn’t a great name for an ability. It was just off the top of my head. That being said, BD aren’t necessarily good from what I understand.</p>
<p>Aristocrat is pretty straight-forward. You said exactly what I had planned for them. Just make it disguise a good king if they are overthrown.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t know if the Noble would be Social any more. They do have a social ability, but this change also gives them an investigative ability and an arguably offensive ability as well. This may be a big enough problem that abilties would need to be reworked. I was a little iffy about this idea for a Noble being too strong.</p>

            <p>I think it still would, yes. His second night ability is the first indicator of that. It’s clearly a social ability.<br>
When I first looked into his day ability, I thought it was an offensive ability but it’s vote manipulation which I think counts as social. The only one that really differs is the first night ability which is investigative.</p>

            <p>Both of these ideas seem quite balanced and would be good successors to the old Noble and Aristocrat</p>
<p>But would this still make him a Social class?</p>

            <p>Ok, let’s say we know that X person is Noble because he claimed it. If it stops showing the double vote? Converted. If it doesn’t show the same as your vote? Converted. If it was a limited use secondary Ability I wouldn’t care but it isn’t.</p>

<p>Just show everyone that the Noble double voted to execute a BD? Maybe the Rigged Trial could hide your second vote but count it? I mean, that would also make Aristocrat presence obvious. I don’t know.</p>

            <p>I like your idea. May I add to it? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
One thing I dislike is voting on your own trial. Like… what? That’s not cool in my opinion. Also, the double vote should appear as the Noble vote. “The Noble voted to execute” (or pardon).<br>
Yes, “the” Noble. I believe this class should be unique.<br>
Nothing to add regarding the Passive, the Day ability and the Night ability 1.<br>
The second night ability’s name bothers me. The act of rigging a trial is evil. Maybe something simple as Noble’s Vote would already suffice.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the most important part, the Aristocrat (Unseen conversion of Noble).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No Passive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day Ability: Dethrone.<br>
The same as Overthrow, except you get killed if you dethrone an Evil King. If the King was BD, he will be masked as Neutral King.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night Ability 1: Same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night Ability 2: Rig the Trial (Remember I suggested to change Noble second ability’s name.)<br>
Tomorrow, you may vote an additional time during a trial. This vote will appear as Noble’s vote but will appear reversed. (If you vote exe, it will count toward exe but appear that you pardoned. This apply to your regular vote and for Noble’s vote.)</p>
</li>
