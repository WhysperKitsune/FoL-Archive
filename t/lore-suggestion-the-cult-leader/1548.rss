_Extract from the Book: Teachings of Mithras_

**Ex Doctrina De Mithras**

In the beginning, Mithras seemed only mythical to those with lesser minds. But those with the lesser mind would fall victim to the teachings of the saviour. It was only ever taught by priests that only a powerful mind could be worthy and strong enough of becoming one with Mithras, but alas, anybody who sleeps as night is at risk of having their mind broken by him.

If your dreams are invaded by Mithras, you can&#39;t avoid him. Should your mind be trapped, you can&#39;t escape him. You will eventually succumb to his torture and become one with Mithras. Being executed sounds only slightly better than this.

A vessel for Mithras is what you become. Mithras, however, would never be satisfied with just one. As his vessel, you must bring him the blood of the others. 

Using the knowledge instilled upon you by Mithras, you must break the minds of the other lesser mortals then use their blood to kill those who would slander the saviour.</description>
