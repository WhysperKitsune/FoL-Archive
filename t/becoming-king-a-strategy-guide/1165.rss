    <title>Becoming King, a Strategy Guide</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/becoming-king-a-strategy-guide/1165</link>
    <description>Hello

Today I&#39;m going to give strategy for which classes to become king as:

Firstly, classes you should UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES trade for being King:
For Blue Dragon: Knight, Paladin, Physician, Prince, Sheriff
For Black Rose: Mastermind
For Cult: None
For Neutral: Alchemist

Next, classes that you should ONLY trade for King IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES(and even then you should CONSIDER NOT DOING IT):
For Blue Dragon: Priest(If Revive used), Psychic(If both uses of Visions used)
For Black Rose: Assassin(If Mastermind is still alive)
For Cult: Cult Leader(If at least 1 cultist alive)
For Neutral: Possessor(If caught or under serious pressure), Reaper(If caught or under serious pressure)

Now, classes which are OKAY to trade for King but you should CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS:
For Blue Dragon: Butler, Court Wizard, Observer, Princess
For Black Rose: Enforcer, Illusionist, Nightwatch, Sage, Sellsword, Servant, Soulcatcher
For Cult: Apostle, Invoker
For Neutral: Mercenary, Fool

and Finally, classes which you should ABSOLUTELY trade for King, given the chance:
For Blue Dragon: Noble
For Black Rose: Herbalist, Traitor Noble, Traitor Princess
For Cult: Ritualist, Seeker
For Neutral: None

Hope this helps, if it doesn&#39;t then that&#39;s okay I guess</description>

            <p>Nice guide, <span class="mention">@JammySplodge</span> – even useful for me. Boslof does most of the in-game, I’m mostly pre-game, so still learning strategy for my own game ha. Beware of playing against <a class="mention" href="/u/ellie">@Ellie</a> though – anyone beat him yet?</p>
