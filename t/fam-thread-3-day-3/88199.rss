# [color=ffc60a]Welcome to FoL&#39;s Annual Mash![/color]

Hosted by @Chloe, @DatBird, @Geyde, @Arete, and @osieorb18 

Host account: @FoLAnnualMash 

Big thanks to Marl and Firekitten for their moral support.
&lt;/div&gt;

## [color=ffe296]Rules[/color]
Follow the [Global Forum Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) as well as the [Forum Game Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-game-rules/78926)

Flavorclaiming is not allowed. More information can be found farther down.
## [color=ffe296]What is FAM?[/color]
All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; *nobody will be vanilla.* 

This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!

There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.

## [color=ffe296]Voting[/color]

* Both majority and plurality are in effect. 

* All votes must be in the form of `**/vote [player]**` to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form `**/unvote**`. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.
* You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.
* Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.
* MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.

## [color=ffe296]Gameplay[/color]
* Days are 36 hours and nights are 12 hours. In the instance the day ends early due to majority, the Night phase will be extended to begin at a consistent time. 

* Deadline to submit Night actions is 2 hours before Night ends.

* Deadline to submit Day actions is 1 hour before Day ends, unless specified otherwise.

* Barring the potential existence of janitors, flips will always be true. Rolecards will not be fake. Conversion does not exist. Game-ending jesters do not exist.
* Other than the above, everything is on the table (:

* We will be following [Natural Action Resolution](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution). If there are any major issues with NAR, [Reasonable Action Resolution](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution) may be utilized. (We  don&#39;t expect this to occur)

* Should the main thread reach 9k posts, a new thread will be created. 
## [color=ffe296]ITAs[/color]
* Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of `**/ITA [player]**` and pinging the host account: @FoLAnnualMash  

* ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%
* Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded
* If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be &#39;Hit! Nobody died.&#39; Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or &#39;Miss!&#39;

* ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.

## [color=ffe296]Rolecards and Flavor[/color]
### Example Rolecard

&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
&gt; &lt;img src=&#39;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788195400930689056/846952271370649640/rizahair2_-_Copy.png&#39;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Chloe**
&gt; *&#39;its not fucking o???&#39;*
&gt; [color=green]**Town Idiot**[/color]
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Expert of Forum Mofoa:** All instances of the letter *i* that you post in the thread must be replaced with the letter *o*. To bypass this restriction, you may post freely as long as you include an image of a cat within your post.  
&gt;
&gt; *Eliminate the Mafia and all other possible threats to the Town.*

The user is **Chloe**, the role name is [color=green]**Town Idiot**[/color], and the flavor is *&#39;it&#39;s not fucking o???&#39;* as well as &#39;Expert of Forum Mofoa.&#39;
&lt;div align=center&gt;

# &lt;mark&gt;[color=darkred]**DO NOT FLAVORCLAIM OR PARAPHRASE FLAVOR. YOU MAY ONLY CLAIM YOUR USER AND ROLE**[/color]&lt;/mark&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Do not claim or paraphrase any quotes or flavor within your rolecard. Do not claim the name of your abilities or passives. You may paraphrase what your passives or abilities *do*, but may not repeat the text word-for-word.**

The alignment of any User will be entirely random. Attempting to solve the game based on flavor is useless.

### Standard Win Conditions
[color=green]**Town**[/color] is the uninformed majority. Their win condition is:
*Eliminate the Mafia and all other possible threats to the Town.*

[color=red]**Mafia**[/color] is the informed minority. Their win condition is:
*You win the game if no more threats to the Mafia exist or nothing can prevent that from happening.*

Other win conditions may or may not exist.

<p>The following story was voted as the winner:</p>
<details>
<summary>
The Winner</summary>
<p>Once, in the beginning, the land was peaceful. We lived in harmony here as a village, united as a single nation. But then, the wolves attacked. They were an unrelenting army, massacring all in their way, to pave the way for a future where they ruled above all. This war between Wolves and Villagers lasted for decades, then centuries. Eventually though, our land, our planet, was stripped of resources over time, to keep up with each sides growing and expansive arsenal of weapons and technology. What was left was a barren planet, dying from the mass factories producing weapons of war, and the destruction of the planet.</p>
<p>As a plan to save its people, the Village created and made ship, a vessel we now live on, called The Ark, in hopes of finding a new planet, where we could colonize and rebuild. As it was being built, the Village conducted interviews for finding those willing to become colonizers. What they didnt know was, that the wolves found out about the Ark, and in an attempt to take hold and control of the vessel, they send spies disgusied as people from the village to gain entry. What either side didnt know, was their was a small sect of the old ways of adiart who found out aswell, and send two people in, to “Cleanse” those who were against their faith.</p>
<p>As the colonizers were loaded onto the ship, and as it was set for launch, the villagers found out, too late, that their spies on the ship. As the Ark left the planet, the Villagers sent this information the AI on board, an amalgamation of differing people and personalities that were once leaders of the Village throughout their history. The AI then informed the people on board, that their were Wolfs Among Them on the ship. But before it could out who were the wolves, The AI was sabotaged and the information deleted.</p>
<p>Now knowing that there were Imposters on the ship, the 47 volunteers became paranoid, and started to suspect others for being wolves. As factions formed and the bickering became more strained, it was agreed upon, based on a democratic system, to vote out those who were most consensus in being a wolf. After the first day, two people were heavily scrutinized, Tangeld and lol, based upon their behaviour around certain people and how they acted. While it was close, Tangeld was ejected from the ship, and was revealed to be one of the Imperial Cultists of Adiart, alerting both Villagers and Wolves aboard, that another faction was amuck in the ship.</p>
<p>The next day, 3 villagers were murdered during the night, and the AI unshackled weapon usage for all to use. As shots were fired, 4 fell, lol, the most suspected person to be a wolf at the time, Intensify, who became a tree stump using druid magic, Maximusprime, who was a villager and Lukundo who was also a wolf. Afterwards, The AI was unshackled, and under the codename “Boats”, where they asked volunteers to attempt a social experiment, where they were split into groups and had to trust the other group not to detonate their room. Both sides blew each other up, revealing 3 wolves, Hippo, who joined for shits and giggles, Leafia, and Amelia both suspect of being wolves, while the other 3, Icibalus, Joker and Kyodaz were villagers. After wards, Whysper hacked the system where only them and another individual, Marl could only be voted out. Whysper was then ejected and revealed to be a member of the village.</p>
<p>Today, this morning, it was revealed that Eli and Aelin were murdered last night, revealing they were a wolf and a village member respectfully. With more accusations, more people were killed by the unshackled weapons from the AI. Nutella, was shot and was found to be a wolf, who was in control of a rogue program AI, that was shooting at a known village member, while universal was shot and revealed to be a member of the town, but was suspected of being a wolf, due to their behaviour surronding the fallen nutella.</p>
<p>Now, we still discuss, as we try to, who are the wolves among us so that we may find a new home, and prosper once again.</p>

<p>Prizes will be sent out shortly.</p>

<p><em>DatBird looks up at the others. “I think I’ve figured it out,” he says. “It might be hard to explain, though.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s okay,” says Arete. “Just do your best.”</em></p>
<p><em>DatBird takes a deep breath. “So essentially, the simulation is a very complicated program,” he says. “In order to allow you to fully experience the virtual environment of the simulation, the simulation renders the connections between neurons as part of the program.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…That doesn’t sound right, but I don’t know enough about programming to dispute it,” says Arete.</em></p>
<p><em>“Get to the point, Birdo,” says Geyde.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m getting there,” says DatBird. He points at the screen. “Here you can see a side by side comparison of the code from when each of the four of us went in, and when we left. There’s a lot of it that isn’t really relevant, but I can highlight changes.” He presses a few button, and sections of the code light up with orange highlights.</em></p>
<p><em>“Why did it change?” asks Osie.</em></p>
<p><em>“Well, while we were in the simulation, our brains – or rather, the program’s representation of our brains – were creating new memories, which affect the way neurons in our brain fire and therefore affect how the program represents the interactions between neurons,” says DatBird.</em></p>
<p><em>“Cool, but what does that have to do with Chloe?” asks Geyde.</em></p>
<p><em>DatBird presses a few more buttons. “This is what Chloe’s code looked like when we all entered the simulation,” he says. “And this is what it looks like now. If you look at that big orange section, that’s part of the code representing what her frontal lobe does.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What does the frontal lobe do?” asks Osie.</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s the main part of the brain involved in decision making,” says DatBird. “Now look at this.” He pulls up a system log.</em></p>
<div align="center">
<p><code>SYSTEM LOG</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Uploading "iterative-inhibitor" subroutine.</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Upload of "iterative-inhibitor" subroutine complete.</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Scanning system for users with "HOST" tag.</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Found five users with "HOST" tag.</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Running "iterative-inhibitor" subroutine on users with "HOST" tag.</code></p>
<p><code>System Message: Subroutine complete.</code></p>
</div>
<p><em>“Hang on,” says Arete. “If … whatever this is, a virus or something, is what’s been making Chloe act weird, then shouldn’t it have affected all five of us.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It <strong>did</strong>,” says DatBird. “Essentially, the routine amplifies normal personality traits while in the simulation. Remember how we were all behaving in the simulation? Like ourselves, but moreso.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That doesn’t make sense,” says Geyde. “Chloe doesn’t normally have the ‘personality trait’ of wanting to murder people.”</em></p>
<p><em>DatBird bites his lip. “This is more speculative, but I think what happened is that the part of Chloe that cares a lot about enforcing the rules, about making sure that if people are toxic or whatever that they get banned, got stuck in a feedback loop that amplified it until the point that it turned into thinking that if people hack the forum, they should literally die, even if it means that some innocent people die as well.” He clenches his fist. “I’m not saying that wanting to punish toxicity is bad, to be clear, just that amplified a million times, it can start to hurt people.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why would the hackers even want that?” asks Osie. “Isn’t Chloe trying to kill them bad for them?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know,” says DatBird. “The only way we’d be able to find out is by asking, and we can’t really ask them.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So how do we fix Chloe?” asks Arete.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m not sure,” says DatBird. “But what I do know is that the hackers weren’t able to modify her code until they were already in the simulation.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So you’re saying we have to go back in,” says Arete. “And risk getting shot, or worse…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes,” says DatBird. He glances around at the three other people in the room. One by one, they nod wordlessly. He passes around the simulation integration gear to each of them.</em></p>

No! They talked to me – they said you want to make me just a clone of all of you. All of you don’t understand, if you understood you would agree with me. System, disconnect Arete, DatBird, osieorb18, and Geyde!</p>

<p>DatBird<br>
you cant do that<br>
i included a provision to make sure of that when we came back to the simulation</p>

Fine. I’ll make it easy. Either you leave, and let the simulation play out the way it’s supposed to, or I’ll disconnect Appelsiini. Do you want Appel to die?</p>
