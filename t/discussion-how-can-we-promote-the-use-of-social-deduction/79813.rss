    <title>Discussion: How Can We Promote The Use Of Social Deduction?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/discussion-how-can-we-promote-the-use-of-social-deduction/79813</link>
    <description>Basically what the title says. Right now, many players ignore the social aspect of the game entirely, relying primarily or exclusively on mechanical tools to deduce. While this is a viable strategy, the use of social deduction in ToL, a social deduction game, can improve one&#39;s play and make the game more interesting. How can we encourage people to make use of social tools, rather than purely mechanical ones, in solving the game?</description>

            <p>yeah but my point was invests are on a scale from “x is prolly scum” to “x may or may not be sus” (flirt) and its not too many invests that are a problem its if they can cross verify each other too reliably and without the accused having a good defense</p>

            <p>I don’t see any need to reduce invests, it’s not like people have anything to go on but your word.  There’s no “mechanical” proof you are telling the truth, invests are easiest to fake.  Again you don’t want to reduce invests to the point where every game is D2 VFR because nobody has info</p>

            <p>ToL needs less invests, because it needs less information. Less mechanical info is better for Socialness</p>

            <p>I think ToL is at a good spot with the number of investigatives, you want D2 to begin with leads and not VFR.</p>
<p>What I think could improve is giving scum better defenses, especially NK getting outed by maid, and make “they’re scorned” a more viable defense since disguises are rare and the scorned is like “gg im scorned that was a disguise” as soon as they get their second mark which kind of ruins the whole thing.</p>

            <p>To promote social deduction, make investigatives less common. Reduce feedback. Have the game where by the time you can confirm everyone, it’s too late.</p>

<p>Conversion helps with this quite a bit.</p>

<p>I’m not questioning the why</p>
<p>Just understandably doubtful that we’ll ever hit more than a fraction of the speed at which updates used to release.</p>
<p>I don’t think hoping we continue to make that fraction larger from here on out is either unreasonable or negative, so I would hope there is no need to try and correct it.</p>

To understand 1. why it was necessary and 2. what exactly had to be done<br>
We also did had some patches last year which included some meta changes, qol or stability and security patches. While nothing of that is so appealing to players like a fullfledged balance patch, its improving the gameplay experience a lot.</p>
