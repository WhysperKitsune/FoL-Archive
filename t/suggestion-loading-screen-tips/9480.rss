    <title>[Suggestion] Loading screen tips</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-loading-screen-tips/9480</link>
    <description>I believe this item could be useful but will probably be fairly low on the list of priorities. 

Premise: As a Throne of Lies player, I would like to be presented with tips on the loading screen to help me become more familiar with the game.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Change is applied to the loading screen after the match has started and the loading screen after a new name is selected.
* Once the user is on the loading screen, they will be presented with a random piece of information that already exist in the &#39;Classes&#39; or &#39;Guide&#39; section of the game.
* A player is only presented with one tip per loading screen.
* For classes the tip would be presented as follows:
** [Class] - [One of the class&#39;s abilities or win condition(s)]
* For Guides, one line from one of the guide sections displayed for the tip

Not In Scope (Future):
*Providing the user the option to turn off loading tips.
*Adding a bias to classes that have recently been modified / changed to appear more frequently on the loading tips.
*Loading tips will not include niche scenarios and player interactions.
**Example: After a player is occupied 3 times in one game they will become immune to all future night occupations. 

Additional Notes:
* The primary reason for this suggestions is I would expect that new (and some experience players) may not revisit the &#39;Classes&#39; information as much as they should to become more familiar with each role and what they do (or did in some cases). Some days (in game days) discussions are sometimes consumed by general class mechanics in a small handful of games I&#39;ve participated in. This change I believe would cut down on those conversations and improve the overall player knowledge base. Also with patch changes sometimes altering how a class works, seeing a loading tip explaining the new interaction could be useful (but I would imagine this being a future change).

Thank you everyone for your time in reading this. Happy Deceiving!</description>
