    <title>Appeal Request: 3-Day Ban</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/appeal-request-3-day-ban/40497</link>
    <description>Hi, I just got a 3-day ban for the username &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;, but in that game someone (with the username &quot;Evil&quot;) told me that his friend had already gotten banned for using a similar username so I had already decided to never use that sort of username again.  Please reverse my ban, I won&#39;t use that sort of username ever again.  Thanks.

In case anyone was wondering I used that name to fit with someone else&#39;s who had chosen &quot;Mein Fuhrer&quot;.  Before that I had only had &quot;Hitler&quot; in my name twice, probably less than 1% of my games.  I don&#39;t like Hitler and I love Jews so I&#39;m not a nazi and it was intended to be funny not offensive.</description>
