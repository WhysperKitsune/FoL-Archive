            <p>It’s better to become important class than stay as Squire just for the sake not to die, the hunter can still screw you up so better train as Physician.</p>

            <p>Finally, a Squire, plus Squire’s Armor and Squire’s Sword makes a Squire roleplay possible.</p>
<p>On a side note, maybe add a time limit by which you have to train? N5 maybe? Otherwise the immunity all game seems a bit OP.</p>

            <p>I compare Squire to Sans the Skeleton, you know?</p>
<p>A trusted Squire that doesn’t remember can still win with initial role they have, their advantage to not die except by bypassing immunity kills and executions, they also have voting power of Citizen, a small role like this one can deal sufficient damage if left ignored too long.</p>

            <p>Hmm these two look more like wildcard types for me, because all their abilities cause a change on the class itself(<strong>You</strong> do not get killed by normal attacks, <strong>you</strong> change <strong>your</strong> class) and none of the abilities affect those who are not targeting you, while support normally helps someone else(which these classes cant do).</p>

<p>Is that such a bad thing? I tried thinking of what that would look like if one did.</p>
<ul>
<li>MM claiming Squire = it would only be a temporary cover, or get CC’d if the Squire is in the game (assuming its unique). The MM would be openly claiming something that he would have to back up within 1-2 days, and be way out in the open. Sheriff could still check him night 4 or after.</li>

<p>That is another option, so once he gets “popped” he would have to go pick a class.</p>

            <p>I love the idea, and would love to see this “copy dead persons class” mechanic in the game.</p>
<p>The only issue I’d have is the death immune mechanic.<br>
When making a class you have to think about how people would play it/ play around its strengths and weaknesses. So here are my concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Squire could just sit there and be immune to death, and would actually be motivated to NOT “train” to a new role since if they did, they would lose their death immunity. Their best strategy would be to just hang out and wait till “late game” to finally take on a role and go from there. The Evils would just convert him if they find out he is death immune and would most likely end with him being on their side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Solution: Give him death/ night immunity but only for first 3 nights. This would motivate him to train himself onto one of the earlier dead targets, unless he wants to take on the risk and keep waiting for a better option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I do love this class concept and it would be interesting if a Squire is put up for lynching and has to defend themselves as basically nothing. They could confirm by taking on a dead role then doing that action over multiple nights though. Very interesting. The unkillable at night just seems to strong, especially for someone who could be an Evil that is unkillable.</p>
