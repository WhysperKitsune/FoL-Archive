    <description>So basically there is one thing I personally have a slight problem with in both Throne of Lies aswell as Town of Salem. It&#39;s the typical &quot;post will&quot; scenario. Having someone to copy a will that is formated with line breaks clutters the chat and makes it incredibly hard to even get any information of that will. So heres what I thought. 

Since the game already allows having two pages in your journal, how about actually being able to phsyically show either specific page to everyone in the game for x amount of seconds. That way you can still put in specific information you want to keep from the public on one page, while using the other to convince players. To not let people randomly open their journals in front of others for confusion it could be restricted to only people that were voted for treason. So far, atleast in my experience, all games barely have treason votes for a lot of days and I can surely imagine that it would make the game more exciting if theres more interaction by voting up others. This change should also probably higher the timer when being voted up as you should still be able to actually defend yourself with words.</description>

            <p>I actually do like this idea. +1 on this.<br>
<img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/3/34c29dd4f09e296422bc652345951acb39ba4e44.gif"><br>
Mainly because you’re right- people will copy and paste anyways, so why not just make it easier?</p>

            <p>I’d still show it upon death if you are BD (and show it to your team if scum), but I’m down with this “secret page” idea.</p>
<p>Maybe I’d stop having to use Notepad++ every single game.</p>

            <p>How about one page is your public page And the other is your secret page where you can keep secret notes you want to keep. The secret page won’t be shown when you die.</p>

            <p>Good idea, but it would look weird to show only one page. Maybe have a code that allows you to make parts of your journal invisible to others until death?</p>
