    <title>Why we need more interaction with the dead</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-we-need-more-interaction-with-the-dead/50284</link>
    <description>I feel it is important to allow the dead to have some influence on the game.

For one, it makes for all sorts of interesting abilities. Call of the Dead is a good example of this. It allows the dead to get information to the living, and also allow them to tell the user things they have noticed, which can help the living immensely.

It also helps keep dead players engaged in the game, which stops them from just leaving.

When I was thinking about the Priest Rework in the Master Rework of Doom, I realized one problem in giving all the interaction to a single class. If that class dies or is converted, you have cut off all access they have to the living. If you give them power after death, they can still be converted, and we don&#39;t want unconvertibles.

So I feel we should have many classes that can interact with the dead in small ways, probably including the Priest. But we can&#39;t let it all rely on one  class, so we should have a host of minor abilities.

This could come in the form of the classes for living players, or even possibly very minor powers for dead players.</description>

            <p>a simple solution to this is to make all dead appear as anonymous to the psychic or the psychic</p>
<p>its that simple. that way unseen are still in the game, even when they are dead.</p>

            <p>I would have to say no to this, on the basis it would severely impact NK and in some instances Cult/Unseen.</p>
<p>For example, the biggest impact would be Possessor, as already if there is a Psychic in game, it negates one of their abilities, at least until the Psychic is dead.</p>
<p>This would also impact Reaper, and of course if Unseen/Cult killed a Sheriff/Paladin on the night they were checking, they’d still easily be able to share that information without the need of a Psychic.</p>

            <p>It is exactly for the casuals we should do it this way: No interaction with the dead at all. And no penalty for leaving game after death on the other side, <strong>because that would no longer be necessary.</strong><br>
Because… a good number of casuals simply want to leave after death, and actually do so(despite it harming their team and giving them no reward).</p>

            <p>Would like to say, it would work for a hardcore/veteran group, people who can actually and properly socially deduce, but there’s a lot of casuals here, and quoting <a class="mention" href="/u/ellie">@Ellie</a>, we have to think about more people than just ourselves</p>

            <p>Let me explain why the dead should stay dead, ESPECIALLY in ToL. Here, we have NKs that have their most powerful ability involve swapping bodies and killing people, so they can instantly be called out by a Psychic, last messages which should be more than enough to get your info to the living. If you’re killed the night you find an Unseen as Sherrif, you shouldn’t be rewarded with a saftey net of ‘there there, now get your info to the psychic and everything will be fine’ .</p>
<p>Reading xblade’s banner post at the top of the page should reveal that there are plans to make retention to the game while dead no longer completely neccecary. We keep the death-guessing minigames, but sever the ties ot the dead otherwise.</p>
<p>The only time I’m willing to add a ‘talk to the dead’ mechanic is in a flipless game, and even then in only a very limited manner. Throne of Lies is far from that, so we should remove Call The Dead.</p>

            <p>I don’t get the reasoning for removing them. Call of the Dead and Reanimate are interesting abilities, and also help keep players engaged. Even if we don’t add more, I see no benefit to removing them, and harm in it. We shouldn’t make players more likely to quit after dying.</p>

<p>worse than that, direct motive to not do so. When you are alive, you always have the potential of being converted… When you are dead, is when you are 100% sure of your final side, and thus can safely bring down the unseen without worrying about joining the side you just doomed.</p>

            <p>I’m not saying the dead should have nearly as much power as the living. I’m talking about minor abilities.</p>

            <p>Citizens are only boring if you only play to press buttons!</p>
<p>The true fun comes from having the ability to win the game, find the scum, convince everyone you are town by only using your words, no trusty night actions, no stilly little comfirmable message.<br>
Pure Skill.</p>
<p>Also, what would be the deterrent of death if you could still play?<br>
By having the ability to still play after death, you remove some of the deterrent that night kills/lynches have.</p>

<p>Citizens are pretty boring. There’s a reason they aren’t in the game.</p>

</aside>
<p>Citizens are boring cause you don’t do anything a night. That’s the main argument against citizens  I see. but not doing anything gives you time to review the day looking for scummy posts</p>

            <p>Citizens are pretty boring. There’s a reason they aren’t in the game.</p>
<p>I see no reason to force dead players from ceasing to participate in the game.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be the same as being alive, but it shouldn’t make you powerless.</p>
<p>Ressurections are definitely bad though.</p>

            <p>I have two things built into me:</p>
<p>Once a player is dead, they are no longer able to influence the game, this means no dead chat, or resurrections.</p>
<p>Citizens are Important!</p>
