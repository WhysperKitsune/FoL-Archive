    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/dc-bug-patch-1-0-10/20750</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I dc&#39;d and when I rc&#39;d chat wouldn&#39;t work, I would type into chat and no one could see what I wrote

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
When I type into chat and hit enter other players can see my words
#### Steps to reproduce:
DC, RC and type into chat?
#### Comments: Lost the game from this bug was mastermind with 3 unseen, 3 neutrals and 1 bd left
couldn&#39;t type so I couldn&#39;t really play when it was an easy win. got executed because I couldn&#39;t respond</description>
