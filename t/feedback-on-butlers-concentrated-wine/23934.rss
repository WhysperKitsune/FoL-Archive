    <title>Feedback on Butler&#39;s Concentrated Wine</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

I think we really need a moment to talk about Bulter&#39;s Concentrated Wine.
My opinion is that it should be removed from the Butler and maintained in the Servant. Let me tell you why.
This ability on the Butler was supposed to be his protection against the rest of the table, does it work? Kind of. 
Here&#39;s a quick list of classes that can kill you. I placed them into two categories, those who get occupied by this ability and those who are occupy immune:
Occ immune: Mastermind, Hunter, Possessor and Sorcerer. Assassin can fit in this category if paired with an Enforcer.
Can be occ: Alchemist, Mercenary/Sellsword, Cult Leader and Reaper.
I mean, yes, it does protect you against Reaper and the conversion of CL. Mercenaries are very unlikely to kill a BD at random like that. Alchemists are unpredictable, so nothing to say there.
My point here is, outside of the rarest possible occasion where it&#39;s a cult game with a reaper, a very bloodthirsty mercenary and an alchemist that yolos, Butler&#39;s Concentrated Wine will not help you and not help BD.
Investigative roles get set back by this ability. Even Drunks and another Butler will lose a day getting occupied by you.
One thing is to randomly wine a target that happens to be BD. This is different.
A servant with this ability protects himself and sets BD back, it makes sense and is a great ability for him.
Please, take this ability out of the Butler. Replace it with another one, something that doesn&#39;t set back his alliance.
Thank you for your attention. Hope you have an awesome week.</description>

            <p>I like the idea but I think it’s too much like the psychic’s link and since psychic rely only on linking people they would lose importance. Don’t you agree?</p>

            <p>I think they should remove concentrated wine and add a day ability where you “invite” some amount of people to a dinner party and they can talk at night and the Butler would show up as “Butler” in the chat. At the end of the night they would be occupied and occupy immune classes would not show up.</p>

            <p>Getting occupied by the Servant’s Concentrated Wine wouldn’t really be an instant kill in my opinion.<br>
In order for that scenario to happen, you’d need more than one person visiting the Servant in that night and telling chat they were occupied on the next day. Which isn’t the rarest thing but isn’t so common as well.<br>
Even with that, if there were two people claiming that, you can still claim to have occupied one of them and the other wouldn’t have a strong enough claim to instant kill you. There could be another butler, a poacher, a drunk, etc.<br>
Dunno, just my opinion.</p>
