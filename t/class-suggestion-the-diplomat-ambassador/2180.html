          <p><strong>Diplomat</strong> Bluedragon social</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: <strong>Non-aggression pact</strong><br>
Ability details: 3 uses; Target is forced to rescind current accusation of treason, and cannot accuse anyone of treason the rest of the day. In return, you may not vote <em>execute</em> on this player today if they are put on trial.<br>
Night Ability 2: <strong>Negotiate</strong><br>
Ability details: Do not select target; speak with a random player as though you were psychic and linked minds, except it is anonymous; you are informed what class they are, however.</p>
<p>Goal: Wins with the blue dragon</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Ambassador</strong> Converted from diplomat; social</p>
<p><strong>Private line</strong> (passive) Players will not be informed when unseen members are whispering to you; they will still be informed if you whisper to other unseen members, however.</p>
<p><strong>Non-aggression pact</strong> (day, 3 uses) exactly the same as the diplomat’s ability <em>Non-aggression pact</em></p>
<p><strong>Intervene</strong> (day, 3 uses) For the target to rescind any accusations they currently have made, and they will be unable to accuse anyone else of treason the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Goal: Wins with unseen</p>
<hr>
<p>Credits: Used Plex’s format for class suggestions.</p>
<p>Tips for diplomat:</p>
<p>-Use <em>Non-aggression pact</em> to prove you are diplomat; this only works if you are being accused of something other than being a member of the unseen, as ambassador has the same ability.</p>
<p>-Disclose your name when using <em>negotiate</em> always if the target is a blue dragon that is immune to convert; you can still disclose if they are a convertible blue dragon, however, especially in cult games, they can be converted and have you killed.</p>
<p>Tips for Ambassador:</p>
<p>-You can’t relay messages between the other unseen members, because players are only not informed of whispers when it is from an unseen member to you.</p>
<p>-Use <em>intervene</em> sparingly, as it confirms that a diplomat has been converted to the unseen.</p>
<p>-Unseen players can still have the ambassador reply to yes/no questions; they can say "were you occupied last night? if yes, say (code word); if no, say (code word).</p>

          <blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 1: Non-aggression pact<br>
Ability details: Infinite uses; when either target player accuses the other of treason the following day, the required amount of votes on them will be silently risen by 1 until they rescind.<br>
notes: You can target yourself with this ability; you may not target the originalking with this ability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t make sense, whatever sense I got from it, it doesn’t sound like it benefits BD… raising vote cap damages BD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 2: Negotiate<br>
Ability details: Do not select target; speak with a random player as though you were psychic and linked minds, except it is anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useless to you. If you end up talking to an Unseen, they can lie about who they are etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability 1: Intervene<br>
Ability details: 2 uses; can only be used on two players accusing each-other of treason; players will be forced to rescind, and will be unable to accuse anyone of treason the rest of the day<br>
notes: selects 2 players (clearly)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So almost like Duchess slap? Which would probably, again, hurt BD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private line (passive) As long as you are alive, members of the unseen will be able to whisper to each other without non-unseen being informed that they are (players will not see “first name last name [x] is whispering to first name last name [y]”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t be a Passive, this is far too powerful for Unseen too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name TBT (night, infinite uses) target will be unable to accuse others of treason the following day. May not select king.<br>
notes: They will not be informed of this. Rather, anytime they accuse a player of treason, the required votes to put that player on trial will be raised by one until target rescinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So like Duchess slap but at Night?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name TBT (night, infinite uses) Target will be unable to vote guilty the following day.<br>
notes: If targt attempts to vote execute, they will instead abstain. This ability can be used on the king; the king will still be able to use Decide fate without fail, even if they decide to execute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t be infinite. Far too powerful for Unseen.</p>
<p>Once again, no effort in your Suggestion. It looks like it took you 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Like, don’t just sit there with your suggestion page open and think of every ability on the spot. Take at least 2 days finishing your suggestion, rather than throwing together something right there and then.</p>

          <p>Social type is far away the hardest type of class to balance and make new roles for. Nobles and Psychic are both INCREDIBLY strong and cover drastically different niches.</p>
<p>Having said that, I LOVE the Ambassador (I think it should stay Social due to it’s stress on voting patterns). It all seems to work fine and would add refreshingly interesting mechanics. Although you may want to remove of the night abilities as at the moment he is very strong.</p>
<p>I am not so sure about the Diplomat in it’s current state.</p>
<p>Non-agression Pact seems gimicky and far too niche to get any real value out of as it is very hard to predict who will be voted by whom the next day. Vote manipulation of this ilk is also a bit icky.</p>
<p>Negotiate literally is just a weaker Psychic’s link minds. As they are both Social it seems odd that this night ability is basically a straight downgrade of the Psychics.</p>
<p>Intervene, although slightly gimicky seems fine (most day abilities are pretty weak anyway so I don’t view this as that important as long as it is not gamebreakingly strong)</p>
<p>Basically I would completely re-work The Diplomats night abilities as they are both incredibly weak. I really like all the abilities of the Ambassador but I would tone him down a bit to bring him in line with over converted roles.</p>

<p>Whenever the target’s vote for each other, they vote will show up, but it will do nothing as immediately the vote cap for that player is raised by one until they rescind.</p>

<p>The butler’s <em>Serve wine</em> ability hurts blue dragon if used on blue dragon, which is likely if doing it randomly as most players are blue dragon. Additionally, on the wiki, the duchess has no ability listed “Slap” or anything similar to the word “slap”</p>

<p>Negotiate is now perfect and my hat is off to you for fixing that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also like Private Line. Personally I didn’t think it was too strong before but I can see why you nerfed it a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intervene is nice. It’s similar to the Slap we had a while ago and I feel like it was a shame to have lost that ability (I’m glad it went for balance reasons but the ability itself is a fun one with decent strategy to it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My ONLY problem with it now is that Non-agression Pact is pretty weak on a Diplomat as BD won’t be expecting to be hung anyway unless Unseen have majority at which point it is too late. It is a decent ability on the Ambassador, but obviously you can’t have it as an Ambassador-only ability or it would reveal the Ambassador as unseen.<br>
Also there is never any reason to use non-agression pact instead of negotiate. Negotiate is just infinitely stronger. Not sure what direction you should move in to fix it but I think these 2 (or 1 depending on perspective) abilities need to be addressed.</p>
