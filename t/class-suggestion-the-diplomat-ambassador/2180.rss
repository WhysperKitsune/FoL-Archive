    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-diplomat-ambassador/2180</link>
    <description>**Diplomat** Bluedragon social

Day Ability 1: **Non-aggression pact**
Ability details: 3 uses; Target is forced to rescind current accusation of treason, and cannot accuse anyone of treason the rest of the day. In return, you may not vote _execute_ on this player today if they are put on trial.
Night Ability 2: **Negotiate**
Ability details: Do not select target; speak with a random player as though you were psychic and linked minds, except it is anonymous; you are informed what class they are, however.

Goal: Wins with the blue dragon

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Ambassador** Converted from diplomat; social

**Private line** (passive) Players will not be informed when unseen members are whispering to you; they will still be informed if you whisper to other unseen members, however.

**Non-aggression pact** (day, 3 uses) exactly the same as the diplomat&#39;s ability _Non-aggression pact_

**Intervene** (day, 3 uses) For the target to rescind any accusations they currently have made, and they will be unable to accuse anyone else of treason the rest of the day.

Goal: Wins with unseen

--------------------------
Credits: Used Plex&#39;s format for class suggestions.

Tips for diplomat:

-Use _Non-aggression pact_ to prove you are diplomat; this only works if you are being accused of something other than being a member of the unseen, as ambassador has the same ability.

-Disclose your name when using _negotiate_ always if the target is a blue dragon that is immune to convert; you can still disclose if they are a convertible blue dragon, however, especially in cult games, they can be converted and have you killed. 

Tips for Ambassador:

-You can&#39;t relay messages between the other unseen members, because players are only not informed of whispers when it is from an unseen member to you.

-Use _intervene_ sparingly, as it confirms that a diplomat has been converted to the unseen.

-Unseen players can still have the ambassador reply to yes/no questions; they can say &quot;were you occupied last night? if yes, say (code word); if no, say (code word).</description>

            <p>I just changed NAP; now, as a day ability, it both confirms you as diplomat/ambassador and can be used to stop a player from putting you on trial.</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>Negotiate is now perfect and my hat is off to you for fixing that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also like Private Line. Personally I didn’t think it was too strong before but I can see why you nerfed it a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intervene is nice. It’s similar to the Slap we had a while ago and I feel like it was a shame to have lost that ability (I’m glad it went for balance reasons but the ability itself is a fun one with decent strategy to it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My ONLY problem with it now is that Non-agression Pact is pretty weak on a Diplomat as BD won’t be expecting to be hung anyway unless Unseen have majority at which point it is too late. It is a decent ability on the Ambassador, but obviously you can’t have it as an Ambassador-only ability or it would reveal the Ambassador as unseen.<br>
Also there is never any reason to use non-agression pact instead of negotiate. Negotiate is just infinitely stronger. Not sure what direction you should move in to fix it but I think these 2 (or 1 depending on perspective) abilities need to be addressed.</p>
</li>

            <p>Social type is far away the hardest type of class to balance and make new roles for. Nobles and Psychic are both INCREDIBLY strong and cover drastically different niches.</p>
<p>Having said that, I LOVE the Ambassador (I think it should stay Social due to it’s stress on voting patterns). It all seems to work fine and would add refreshingly interesting mechanics. Although you may want to remove of the night abilities as at the moment he is very strong.</p>
<p>I am not so sure about the Diplomat in it’s current state.</p>
<p>Non-agression Pact seems gimicky and far too niche to get any real value out of as it is very hard to predict who will be voted by whom the next day. Vote manipulation of this ilk is also a bit icky.</p>
<p>Negotiate literally is just a weaker Psychic’s link minds. As they are both Social it seems odd that this night ability is basically a straight downgrade of the Psychics.</p>
<p>Intervene, although slightly gimicky seems fine (most day abilities are pretty weak anyway so I don’t view this as that important as long as it is not gamebreakingly strong)</p>
<p>Basically I would completely re-work The Diplomats night abilities as they are both incredibly weak. I really like all the abilities of the Ambassador but I would tone him down a bit to bring him in line with over converted roles.</p>

<p>Once again, no effort in your Suggestion. It looks like it took you 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Like, don’t just sit there with your suggestion page open and think of every ability on the spot. Take at least 2 days finishing your suggestion, rather than throwing together something right there and then.</p>
