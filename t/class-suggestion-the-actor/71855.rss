    <description>**The Actor (Neutral Social)**

_Passives:_
**Economic interests:** You need to get 12 gold coins to win. You win gold coins with your abilities.

_Day abilities:_
**Seduce:** If you perform for a female tonight you will get 1 extra gold coin. _(Unlimited)_

**Crossdress:** If you perform for a male tonight you will get 1 extra gold coin. _(Unlimited)_

_Night abilities:_
**Perform:** Entertain a player tonight. Win 1 gold coin if you are successful. _(Unlimited)_

**Last play:** Entertain everyone that visits you. You will be immune to death. At the end of the night, if you dont have enough gold coins to win, you take your own life. *(1 use)* _Tragic_


**Win condition:** Survive to get 12 gold coins.


Random social class with its own agenda, you want to pay atention to the claims, to get good use of your day abilities, and maybe get some atention lategame to close the game with **Last play**.

_Thinking about a new effect for **Perform**, got a few ideas:_
- When he performs for a player, that player cant target him, or they will be prevented from visiting him for the rest of the game.
- Perform can occupy the targeted player.
- Perform frames the targeted player.
- Perform gives extra gold if you perform for a player with Royal Blood.
- You are immune to most harmful efects effects while **visiting**.</description>

            <p>prehaps make it so that preform will distract the user for the night making it so that they dont recieve feedback of there abilities like it will say an actor preformed for you tonight distracting you and you forgot what you were doing tonight or you can make it so that you cant talk for the first half of the day or vote because you are still thinking about his show the last thing i can think of is they cant use there day abilites tomorrow if you preform of them<br>
dont use them all at the same time but prehaps one of them will fit him</p>

            <p>He already gains more depending on the gender, he can “investigate” people in a new way.<br>
Maybe people that he performed for cant target him anymore, and thats his way of protecting himself. Like if you perform for the Assa, he cant kill/poison you anymore.</p>

            <p>So what’s the point of visiting them other than performing? I think there needs to be something happening on the other side, like a frame or possibly a prevent. Right now this is uncomfortable and does nothing to harm BD at all so they can leave him.</p>

            <p>Successful means your visit is not prevented, basically. Its a pretty vague class concept, I think we need more social neuts that dont just fuck up BD.<br>
Maybe Perform could occupy too, or maybe he should win more gold, everything can be changed.</p>

            <p>I like this play on the <em>accumulate some sort of currency</em> class, however I think the concept needs some specific analysis on <strong>what counts as a successful performance and what doesn’t.</strong></p>
