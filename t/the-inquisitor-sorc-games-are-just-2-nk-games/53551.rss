    <title>The inquisitor- sorc games are just 2 NK games</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-inquisitor-sorc-games-are-just-2-nk-games/53551</link>
    <description>The next patch going to make inquisitor ability useless.

1. if he find magic, that might be the magic dust
2. if he find non-magic, thats still be the sorc.
3. Ruthless Efficiency will kill anyone so his best way to discover magic is no longer avaiable.

Right now, as a good king or prince I think bd should exe **every single inquisitor**, even if they try to kill the sorc they will end up killing everyone, and they have no way to find the sorc.

The only way to change it without reverting the changes, is to change the inquisitor win condition.

**Goal:** Survive to see the Blue Dragon win.</description>

            <p>I think we should get rid of Magic Dust and change Magic Cloak so that it hides visits and makes Sorc appear Blue Dragon to faction checks instead. This will make it so the Inquisitor is the only person who actually has the power to get rid of Sorcerer.</p>

            <p>OK that I may be wrong on… but the core point is still 100% in place. The inq is only designed to exist to be the sorc’s worse fear… and he isn’t even in the top 5 threats to it because the sorc’s day abilities are effectively “make sure the inq can’t do anything”</p>

            <p>I just now realized the patch notes for 1.1 as they currently stand lol.</p>
<p>The description implies magic dust stays (or doesn’t mention it going away anyway), and magic cloak makes you appear non MU.  That’s pretty ridiculous to me. 4 checks that are just totally tainted for the inq, no ability to understand which 2 checks they are… So in short… all the inq can do is blind stab.</p>
<p>The sorcerer is waay to hard to win as even in terms of being an NK… and the inq is way too easy to win… however the inq is already completely incapable of doing his job… he only wins because his job is easy for someone else to do… and someone else is motivated to do so</p>

<p>Magic Dust will make the sorcerer Not MU in the next patch.</p>

</aside>
<p>Which still doesn’t help the problem. The sorc can’t fool bd… can fool inq. While I agree it isn’t as bad as the full court frame. (It doesn’t make positives entirely useless). it still massively slows down the checks etc… It wouldn’t be so bad… if the inq weren’t still massively inferior to the butler. observer, drunk, or princess in some cases.</p>
<p>now you could argue that say, most of those classes have to worry about false positives, IE the killer/offensive the princess finds could be knight, or the occ immune could be a drunk etc… but those all put them ON even ground with the inq (ie psychic, CW etc…)… right up until you then factor in false negatives… which those classes don’t have.</p>
<p>What on earth is the case for giving the sorc abilities to hide from, the class that’s only goal is to catch him… Generally speaking when a class has only one job… he should be miles and a head the best at that one job. Just as the paladin has no abilities to help him find the NK… which is made up for by him being the best at finding cult…</p>

<p>That will make it into another BD.  Why not make it BD investigative?  Inquisitor just needs a complete rework.  No class deserves a hardcounter, regardless of how easy they are to win.  And inquisitor’s win con is much easier than the sorcerer’s, they don’t even have to do anything most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not like another BD because he still needs to survive. so he may as well kill some bd if it will make the game go faster.</p>
<p>Also, the sorc is an extra EVIL killer. that much more important than 1 extra BD</p>

            <p>Honestly I think either inq needs to be removed, or sorc needs massive buffs to his ability to hide from BD, and complete removal of all abilities that fool the inq.</p>
<p>even before this change, I’d still say inq is the least likely person in the court to catch the sorc… now that’s just been magnified</p>

            <p>Actually RE is just as good at helping you find magic users as before. If someone is dead and has flipped then BAM! You know if they are the sorcerer or now.</p>

            <p>It’s not bd playing bad, its inquisitor does’t care and don’t have any ability to find the sorc,</p>
<p>Inquisitor doesn’t know who is suspect, he doesn’t get claims from people.</p>

            <p>They will only end up killing the suspect people. If BD plays bad it is their fault.</p>

            <p>Well the Sorc is basicly another unseen killer so why not?</p>

            <p>I don’t know how you’d change the inquisitor to prevent this besides keeping it as it currently is, but one thing I do know is that I’d rather not see a neutral turn to blue dragon.</p>

            <p>The next patch going to make inquisitor ability useless.</p>
<ol>
<li>if he find magic, that might be the magic dust</li>
<li>if he find non-magic, thats still be the sorc.</li>
<li>Ruthless Efficiency will kill anyone so his best way to discover magic is no longer avaiable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Right now, as a good king or prince I think bd should exe <strong>every single inquisitor</strong>, even if they try to kill the sorc they will end up killing everyone, and they have no way to find the sorc.</p>
<p>The only way to change it without reverting the changes, is to change the inquisitor win condition.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Survive to see the Blue Dragon win.</p>
