    <description>Warlock - Neutral Killer

Win condition: Live to defeat all factions that opposes you.

Passive 1 - Unholy Visage
You are immune to death (at night).

Passive 2 - Firing Up
If you are occupied, target an imprisoned target, are jailed or choose not to make an action during the night, you will gain one charge of all abilities, except Evaporate.

Day ability 1 - Evaporate (2 charge)
Target a player. For the rest of the day that player cannot be accused of treason, they cannot be the target of abilities, they are silenced and cannot vote.
(Players can still see the Evaporated&#39;s number as selectable but they cannot select them if they try.)
(You can target yourself.)

Day ability 2 - Portal Warp (1 charge)
Target two players. Redirect all players targeting either of your targets to the other during the next night. This does not count as visiting if you activate Meteorite. (You cannot be occupied or redirected for this ability. You will receive notification whether the targets were successfully swapped.)

Night ability 1 - Meteorite (2 charges)
Attack target player by sending a meteorite down upon them. The meteorite will also attack another player X spaces down from your selection, rotating at the last player back to the first player, skipping dead players, the primary target and you. The secondary hit will bypass all forms of protection but can be redirected with the Court Wizard&#39;s and the Sage&#39;s Tornado and the Warlock&#39;s Portal Warp.
(At the beginning of the game X is randomly chosen to be 3, 4, or 5. Each day the X increases or decreases by one until it hits the upper or lower limit, then goes the other way.)
(You will only visit your selected target.)

What&#39;s the reason to make this neutral killer?

Well it&#39;s a different variant that utilizes a much higher kill pressure, but it has some built-in downtime. It has some patterns so you can deduce the presence of a Warlock. The offset secondary kill can give away the Warlock player&#39;s position as it skips him. Even if the Warlock attempts to hide their position by not having the secondary hit skip their position, it may still be caught by the Court for information.

The built-in downtime is mitigated by being OCC&#39;d, hitting imprisoned targets or getting jailed, which replenishes your charges. So in games where you are getting unlucky, you&#39;re given some second wind. In games where you are untouched you need to pick your targets, perhaps a bit more carefully.

---

The Evaporate can be utilized either defensively or offensively - kinda like Reaper&#39;s Chill. But where Chilled targets can be accused and executed, the Evaporated target cannot be accused. So you can effectively hard confirm the presence and use of Evaporate. Then you have to deduce whether or not the Warlock used it defensively or offensively.

---

The Portal Warp is mainly there to allow the Warlock to mess with the pattern of his Meteorite, by swapping the secondary target to another. The secondary target is always conditional on the primary, so if you swap the primary target, the secondary will follow. This is also especially useful if you know or suspect the Master Mind. Since your primary target doesn&#39;t bypass death immunity but your secondary does, this gives you more control over the ability. However you only have 1 charge from the beginning, so you need to be careful, or rely on getting new charges.

Additionally you can use Portal Warp to fake claim Court Wizard and if you don&#39;t do any night actions / hit jailed target / become jailed / become OCC&#39;d, you get the charge back for the next day.

It can be useful to Portal Warp if you suspect an invest class is on to you, and you can also utilize it to swap targets away from fellow neutrals, perhaps to secure voting majority or parity by swapping a Neutral claim with one you suspect is Cultseen - perhaps even getting a kill.

---

The Warlock&#39;s biggest nightmare is Bleed. They don&#39;t have an inherent way to get rid of it and need to rely on an Alchemist or a support class to swap into themselves to save them from the bleed - if the Warlock cannot convince the support to aid them directly. The Warlock can use Evaporate in the end game to avoid getting bled if the Cultseen suspects you, but if they manage to bleed you without a way for you to heal or delay yourself you are in trouble and need to close out the game fast.</description>

            <p>It’s the same night.</p>
<p>The Warlock attack a player, the Meteorite will “attack” an additional target X spaces below that target. The Warlock will only be seen visiting the player he attacks. The Meteorite functions somewhat similar to Psycho King’s attack.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<ol>
<li>King (Dead)</li>
<li>Player A</li>
<li>Player B</li>
<li>Player C (Dead)</li>
<li>Warlock</li>
<li>Player D</li>
<li>Player E</li>
<li>Player F</li>
<li>Player G</li>
</ol>
<p>The Warlock will at the beginning of the day be notified that his meteorite angle is 4 targets. (Aka X = 4)</p>
<p>During the Night the Meteorite ability will specify:<br>
"Attack target player. The Meteorite will also attack a player 4 spaces down.<br>
(Rotates from the lowest living player to the highest living player. Skips dead players, the primary target of Meteorite and you.)</p>
<p>Lets say the Warlock chooses to attack Player B in position 3. The meteorite will then go down the list of living players until it hits the 4th player it doesn’t skip. It skips Player C as they are dead, it skips the Warlock, then it counts 4 spaces down and lands at Player G in position 9.</p>
<ol>
<li>King (Dead)</li>
<li>Player A</li>
<li>Player B - <strong>Primary target</strong>
</li>
<li>Player C (Dead) - <strong>skips</strong>
</li>
<li>Warlock - <strong>skips</strong>
</li>
<li>Player D - <strong>1st count</strong>
</li>
<li>Player E - <strong>2nd count</strong>
</li>
<li>Player F - <strong>3rd count</strong>
</li>
<li>Player G - <strong>4th count - secondary attack</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Warlock attacks Player E, in position 7, the Meteorite will go down to Player G (be at the 2nd count) and rotate up to King - skipping King as he’s dead - and count down the last 2, ending up at Player B in position 3.</p>
<ol>
<li>King (Dead) - <strong>skips</strong>
</li>
<li>Player A - <strong>3rd count</strong>
</li>
<li>Player B - <strong>4th count - secondary attack</strong>
</li>
<li>Player C (Dead)</li>
<li>Warlock</li>
<li>Player D</li>
<li>Player E - <strong>Primary target</strong>
</li>
<li>Player F - <strong>1st count</strong>
</li>
<li>Player G - <strong>2nd count</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Meteorite will highlight the secondary target so The Warlock wont be confused as to who it will hit. It may require a bit of brain work to plan ahead of time, but I figure anyone who plays ToL wants to challenge their brain just ever so slightly.</p>
<p>It should not be as confusing as you make it out to be.</p>

<p>Somewhere in a board meeting idk</p>
<p>Iteration: What if we made the Court Wizard a NK?<br>
Board Meeting MEMEber: Yeah?<br>
Iteration: But only gave him 2 charges of his killing ability…<br>
Board Meeting MEMEber: Keep talking…<br>
Iteration: BUT THEN MADE IT ERADICATE BUT 100x MORE CONFUSING!!!<br>
Board Meeting MEMEber: <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/dancer.png?v=9" title=":dancer:" class="emoji" alt=":dancer:"> <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/man_dancing.png?v=9" title=":man_dancing:" class="emoji" alt=":man_dancing:"> <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/dancer.png?v=9" title=":dancer:" class="emoji" alt=":dancer:"> <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/man_dancing.png?v=9" title=":man_dancing:" class="emoji" alt=":man_dancing:"></p>
<p>im fine with everything about this class, but Meteorite is a bit confusing… Do you attack the same night or next? I don’t have too much quarrels about this class tbh, but idk.</p>
