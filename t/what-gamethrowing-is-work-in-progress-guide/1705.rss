    <description>**_What is Gamethrowing?_**

Due to much confusion in game I have decided to put an ironclad definition of gamethrowing here for all of you to understand what exactly counts as throwing the game and how to avoid it.
Firstly the very definition of gamethrowing is as follows: Actively sabotaging your own team with intent or making a conscious decision to reveal information about your team to somebody that you personally believe to be harmful to your team&#39;s goals. 

What this means that somebody making a mistake or using bad/fabricated information with the intention to benefit their team is not gamethrowing. Sure, it’s irritating but it’s not game throw. However, actions that will directly result in a team mate’s death (e.g claiming sheriff and allowing the sheriff to die in your stead as BD) Can be considered sabotage as you have introduced a situation where other players can investigate you and deem the actual sheriff guilty, unless the player makes a decent attempt at saving the sheriff this is deemed as sabotage. At this point motivation is of no consequence as your strategy directly results in the death of a fellow team member and then will get you killed for lying.  
Another way of gamethrowing many don’t realise is skype cheating (or Discord if that’s your ticket). If on skype whatever you say will influence the others in your call. While sharing information on skype is against the rules of the game you can also inadvertently sabotage your team by talking about events in game that the rest of the players would be privy to talking about it in game. Sharing information or opinions to a select group of people could give the advantage to an enemy team. We shall dub this phenomenon as “Potential gamethrowing” while not deliberate any skype chat that discusses the game could be seen as gamethrowing due to the possibility of the other skype call members. It’s not delibrate but the situation needs to be handled with care to avoid a negative impact on the game and the other players taking part.

This is not to say ALL skyping is Gamethrowing merely discussing in game suspicions and allowing other players insight into your decisions to rally votes against a certain player. Needless to say the direct sharing of information to other players over skype to the benefit of one individual player is both gamethrowing and against the rules.
But as key point when thinking “Is this gamethrowing” Decide to yourself if the player 100 percent has the intent to destroy his own faction or team and if the answer is yes then report them, If it’s possible there could be another explanation consider all the facts and make a rational decision before reporting.

**_What is NOT Gamethrowing_**

Fake claims under the belief it will get an evil executed

Talking in skype/discord casually and discussing things everybody is a part of. E.g (Look what this guy said, Isn’t Teemo cute?)

Sacrificing another member of the unseen for the good of the faction as a whole

Yelling out your role or information with intent to portray the fool role

2 players with an active agreement to fake gamethrow with intent to bamboozle (Evidence would be needed)

Random executes

Physician not healing a king (Could be any faction)

Prince executing for the lols (Could still be evil for all he knows; Random chance is not GT just being a douche)

Being Troll boxed (No Gamethrow if you didn’t write it)

Revealing unseen plans to the psychic when you type your message and press enter before realising he’s talking to you

Telling the priest who the unseen are in dead chat as unseen (Reverse psychology)

**Dev Approved Section:** 

* NOT gamethrowing when making a bad call that seemed like a good call, at that time.
* NOT gamethrowing when unintentional mistakes occur by lack of knowledge, such as for new players still getting used to the game.
* NOT gamethrowing when throwing an ally under the bus to remove suspicion from yourself (this one may be controversial, but I believe if they 100% remove suspicion from you, it can benefit your team [most of] the rest of the game). Even if this fails when it seemed like a good idea, at that time</description>

            <p>What is NOT Gamethrowing</p>
<p>Fake claims under the belief it will get an evil executed .</p>
<p>1- doesn t this lead to chaos in a way considering the max limit of ( for example observer/princess role is only 2 ) and u use a fake claim to get an evil lynched but then the prince loses his executes later cuz of ur observer claim ( being confirmed ) and another observer for example and there can t be 3 cuz of the class limit<br>
2- so giving fake roles as blue dragon is allowed ? by not saying ur actual role , because there needs to be a line to explain this</p>

            <p>Well this topic is all about debunking sore spots for people who always cry gamethrowing. As far as I’m concerned thats strategy and should be seen as something everyone’s able to do to bamboozle the priest. if the strategy takes off it doesn’t matter about actual gamethrowers because it will just be taken as another unseen attempt at confusion.</p>

            <p>My opinion on this is that the intent matters. It is a genuine strategy to out your own members so the priest gets suspicious of everyone you didn’t say. On the other hand it could be a salty run back. Either way it’s not a guaranteed sabotage and for the sake of strategy this action should be allowed unless it’s VERY clear the guy is just being an ass “E.g saying he hates his teammates so much so here they are and then they are actually them”</p>

            <p>Nice thread. Definitely agree but on the last point it depends on the context. What if the cult member is pissed he got killed off and is telling priest who cult are ? I get the reverse psychology part but some times people will genuinely rat out the other members just because they are bitter.</p>

            <p><strong><em>What is Gamethrowing?</em></strong></p>
<p>Due to much confusion in game I have decided to put an ironclad definition of gamethrowing here for all of you to understand what exactly counts as throwing the game and how to avoid it.<br>
Firstly the very definition of gamethrowing is as follows: Actively sabotaging your own team with intent or making a conscious decision to reveal information about your team to somebody that you personally believe to be harmful to your team’s goals.</p>
<p>What this means that somebody making a mistake or using bad/fabricated information with the intention to benefit their team is not gamethrowing. Sure, it’s irritating but it’s not game throw. However, actions that will directly result in a team mate’s death (e.g claiming sheriff and allowing the sheriff to die in your stead as BD) Can be considered sabotage as you have introduced a situation where other players can investigate you and deem the actual sheriff guilty, unless the player makes a decent attempt at saving the sheriff this is deemed as sabotage. At this point motivation is of no consequence as your strategy directly results in the death of a fellow team member and then will get you killed for lying.<br>
Another way of gamethrowing many don’t realise is skype cheating (or Discord if that’s your ticket). If on skype whatever you say will influence the others in your call. While sharing information on skype is against the rules of the game you can also inadvertently sabotage your team by talking about events in game that the rest of the players would be privy to talking about it in game. Sharing information or opinions to a select group of people could give the advantage to an enemy team. We shall dub this phenomenon as “Potential gamethrowing” while not deliberate any skype chat that discusses the game could be seen as gamethrowing due to the possibility of the other skype call members. It’s not delibrate but the situation needs to be handled with care to avoid a negative impact on the game and the other players taking part.</p>
<p>This is not to say ALL skyping is Gamethrowing merely discussing in game suspicions and allowing other players insight into your decisions to rally votes against a certain player. Needless to say the direct sharing of information to other players over skype to the benefit of one individual player is both gamethrowing and against the rules.<br>
But as key point when thinking “Is this gamethrowing” Decide to yourself if the player 100 percent has the intent to destroy his own faction or team and if the answer is yes then report them, If it’s possible there could be another explanation consider all the facts and make a rational decision before reporting.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is NOT Gamethrowing</em></strong></p>
<p>Fake claims under the belief it will get an evil executed</p>
<p>Talking in skype/discord casually and discussing things everybody is a part of. E.g (Look what this guy said, Isn’t Teemo cute?)</p>
<p>Sacrificing another member of the unseen for the good of the faction as a whole</p>
<p>Yelling out your role or information with intent to portray the fool role</p>
<p>2 players with an active agreement to fake gamethrow with intent to bamboozle (Evidence would be needed)</p>
<p>Random executes</p>
<p>Physician not healing a king (Could be any faction)</p>
<p>Prince executing for the lols (Could still be evil for all he knows; Random chance is not GT just being a douche)</p>
<p>Being Troll boxed (No Gamethrow if you didn’t write it)</p>
<p>Revealing unseen plans to the psychic when you type your message and press enter before realising he’s talking to you</p>
<p>Telling the priest who the unseen are in dead chat as unseen (Reverse psychology)</p>
<p><strong>Dev Approved Section:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NOT gamethrowing when making a bad call that seemed like a good call, at that time.</li>
<li>NOT gamethrowing when unintentional mistakes occur by lack of knowledge, such as for new players still getting used to the game.</li>
<li>NOT gamethrowing when throwing an ally under the bus to remove suspicion from yourself (this one may be controversial, but I believe if they 100% remove suspicion from you, it can benefit your team [most of] the rest of the game). Even if this fails when it seemed like a good idea, at that time</li>
</ul>
