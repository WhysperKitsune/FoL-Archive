    <description>Recommended Game Fixes
=
These are my notes I have been making the last few weeks, they are kind of all over the place but I&#39;d like to see what everyone thinks!

#1. Only One Neutral Killer Allowed in Every Game 
-
**(Reaper/ Possessor)**
There is SO much death happening in these games... it all just seems so random and crazy. 
- It makes it a much chaotic and short game for the Evils and BD
- Makes other neutrals win condition far harder with so much extra death going on to themselves or their targets.
- Less time for strategy and &quot;social deduction&quot;.
- The Reaper also has an edge over the Possessor head to head, and makes it &quot;not fair&quot; for Possessor

#2.Voting for the King Should be in the Middle of the Screen
-
This used to be in the game and was super simple/ straight forward to vote for new king.I don&#39;t know why it was changed to the side of the screen and not even given an actual interphase for it besides slightly more grey character bars.
- The button to step forward for king is in the middle... would make sense that voting for king takes place in the middle
- I literally did not even know how to vote for new King untill someone told me that its on the side
- It is not intuitive at all for new players and still every time multiple people abstain/ ask about it.
- Slightly light grey character bars just seems like a cheap UI feature for such a big deal moment in a game.

#3. Labeling Unique Classes in their Class Card with Consistent Markings
-
This is done for Psychic and Hunter by saying that they are a &quot;unique&quot; class. The problem is that it is not said for any other classes. Here are the 3 main fixes for clarity concerns for new and intermediate players.
- Priest is Unique but not marked in any way on class card
- Prince and (Paladin/ Sheriff) are obviously unique and present in every game but are also not stated to be unique or only one of.
- Neutral Class Cards do not have any mention of &quot;Uniqueness&quot; but you can have 2 Mercs/ 2 Fools/ 2 Alch but you can only have 1 Reaper / 1 Possessor... and I&#39;m not 100% sure about Scorned (another reason for markings)

**My solution:**
 is to mark them with a symbol denoting them as unique

#4. Organize the Class Card Menu Better
-
Right now the class cards are organized in Alphabetical Order... which has no strategic or game play oriented structure. There is no point for them to be Alphabetical. They should be organized in a way that makes sense for the game dynamics and better structures the look so it makes sense how the Factions are layed out just by looking at it.
- Blue Dragon Prince/ Paladin/ Sheriff should be separate from other classes by a slight gap or line
- Blue Dragon should be placed opposite from their Unseen counterparts so it is visually obvious what they convert into
- Possibly sort them also by class type after the previous 2 bullets are satisfied
- Mastermind and Assassin should be next to each other posibly separated from other Unseen classes by a slight gap or line.
- Cult Leader should be at the top and separated from the other 4 by a slight gap or line

#5. In Game Start Sound
-
There are many games where I am either tabbed out or on my 2nd screen and dont see the game started.
- Would be nice to have a unique sound happen so that I can run back into the room/ tab over or whatever else to be back and know were starting.

#6. Bindings
-
I am always about playing smooth and efficient. Allowing for optional bindings would let the game feel more smooth and less clicking around for things that you use ALL the time.
Here are some things I&#39;d want a button for to bind
- Class Card: is already bound to [TAB] so thats a perfect example
- Journal
- Death Note
- Private Note
- Tabbing between General Chat and Psychic Chat
- Closing other peoples death journals/ notes

Just a section where you could assign your own personal bindings to those things (at least the journal) would be a HUGE quality of life improvement for me, along with many others. You literally click on the journal SOOO many times per game.

#7. Button to Copy Your Entire Left or Right Journal 
-
Removed:
Ashe had a good point about giving time to make changes
It&#39;s not that hard in the first place
This one I thought about as I was writing this, so after thinking more it shouldn&#39;t be a thing.


#8. Possessor Death Clarification (again)
-
I love that after hopping from body to body the Possessor is now labeled again as the Possessor so that everyone knows if he dies. But... if the Possessor actually dies Night 1... or later on down the line before he has hopped out of his original &quot;possessor body&quot;... then it should say that the Possessor has literally died... so everyone doesnt think hes still floating around.
- The same reason for clarifying his death when he dies later in the game should happen in his first body too. I played a game yesterday where the possessors body got poisoned and he couldnt hop out of it... he died... and once it said a Possessor died... everyone freaked out the whole rest of the game since they thought a Possessor was around. The same also happened when a possessor went afk and died.
- Maybe just a secondary line of text about the possessor literally being dead is all I think would be needed to clear things up


Let me know what yall think, if you have any other ideas to add to mine/ fix mine! Catch ya in the Throne Room!

</aside>
<p>Pay more attention to the game then?<br>
Reaped targets are only alive for 1 extra day, it’s not that hard to keep track of who you reaped. Also there’s no reason to chill a person who doesn’t speak. Chill someone who chats a lot.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not true. Possessor doesn’t occupy when he attacks anymore, therefore to determine who will win with a Possessor VS Reapers you gotta count the Reaper’s souls.<br>
0-1 souls, Possessor wins.<br>
2 sous, Draw.<br>
3+ souls, Reaper wins.</p>

<li>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t want to see this, as games where you get Reaper and Possessor make for a unique experience, one that you don’t get every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreed. Also, which classes appear in every game or are unique can be found on the wiki until a feature like this is implemented. Scorned is unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see no reason why alphabetical order isn’t fine, but organizing them is fine too. I’m good either way with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a start sound, when a lobby fills to 16 it plays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreed, bindings would be useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve heard discussion of a feature like this in another unnamed social deduction game, but I personally came to the conclusion that it would only damage scum’s chances, due to Prince executing if you don’t instant post your journal. The time required to copy + paste allows for small changes to your journal as an evil to match information.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the Possessor’s death is what makes it interesting in my opinion. Possess would be a less powerful ability by far if you knew for sure if it was used or not.</p>

            <h1>Recommended Game Fixes</h1>
<p>These are my notes I have been making the last few weeks, they are kind of all over the place but I’d like to see what everyone thinks!</p>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#1</span>. Only One Neutral Killer Allowed in Every Game</h2>
<p><strong>(Reaper/ Possessor)</strong><br>
There is SO much death happening in these games… it all just seems so random and crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes it a much chaotic and short game for the Evils and BD</li>
<li>Makes other neutrals win condition far harder with so much extra death going on to themselves or their targets.</li>
<li>Less time for strategy and “social deduction”.</li>
<li>The Reaper also has an edge over the Possessor head to head, and makes it “not fair” for Possessor</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#2</span>.Voting for the King Should be in the Middle of the Screen</h2>
<p>This used to be in the game and was super simple/ straight forward to vote for new king.I don’t know why it was changed to the side of the screen and not even given an actual interphase for it besides slightly more grey character bars.</p>
<ul>
<li>The button to step forward for king is in the middle… would make sense that voting for king takes place in the middle</li>
<li>I literally did not even know how to vote for new King untill someone told me that its on the side</li>
<li>It is not intuitive at all for new players and still every time multiple people abstain/ ask about it.</li>
<li>Slightly light grey character bars just seems like a cheap UI feature for such a big deal moment in a game.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#3</span>. Labeling Unique Classes in their Class Card with Consistent Markings</h2>
<p>This is done for Psychic and Hunter by saying that they are a “unique” class. The problem is that it is not said for any other classes. Here are the 3 main fixes for clarity concerns for new and intermediate players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Priest is Unique but not marked in any way on class card</li>
<li>Prince and (Paladin/ Sheriff) are obviously unique and present in every game but are also not stated to be unique or only one of.</li>
<li>Neutral Class Cards do not have any mention of “Uniqueness” but you can have 2 Mercs/ 2 Fools/ 2 Alch but you can only have 1 Reaper / 1 Possessor… and I’m not 100% sure about Scorned (another reason for markings)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My solution:</strong><br>
is to mark them with a symbol denoting them as unique</p>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#4</span>. Organize the Class Card Menu Better</h2>
<p>Right now the class cards are organized in Alphabetical Order… which has no strategic or game play oriented structure. There is no point for them to be Alphabetical. They should be organized in a way that makes sense for the game dynamics and better structures the look so it makes sense how the Factions are layed out just by looking at it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Dragon Prince/ Paladin/ Sheriff should be separate from other classes by a slight gap or line</li>
<li>Blue Dragon should be placed opposite from their Unseen counterparts so it is visually obvious what they convert into</li>
<li>Possibly sort them also by class type after the previous 2 bullets are satisfied</li>
<li>Mastermind and Assassin should be next to each other posibly separated from other Unseen classes by a slight gap or line.</li>
<li>Cult Leader should be at the top and separated from the other 4 by a slight gap or line</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#5</span>. In Game Start Sound</h2>
<p>There are many games where I am either tabbed out or on my 2nd screen and dont see the game started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would be nice to have a unique sound happen so that I can run back into the room/ tab over or whatever else to be back and know were starting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#6</span>. Bindings</h2>
<p>I am always about playing smooth and efficient. Allowing for optional bindings would let the game feel more smooth and less clicking around for things that you use ALL the time.<br>
Here are some things I’d want a button for to bind</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Card: is already bound to [TAB] so thats a perfect example</li>
<li>Journal</li>
<li>Death Note</li>
<li>Private Note</li>
<li>Tabbing between General Chat and Psychic Chat</li>
<li>Closing other peoples death journals/ notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a section where you could assign your own personal bindings to those things (at least the journal) would be a HUGE quality of life improvement for me, along with many others. You literally click on the journal SOOO many times per game.</p>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#7</span>. Button to Copy Your Entire Left or Right Journal</h2>
<p>Removed:<br>
Ashe had a good point about giving time to make changes<br>
It’s not that hard in the first place<br>
This one I thought about as I was writing this, so after thinking more it shouldn’t be a thing.</p>
<h2>
<span class="hashtag">#8</span>. Possessor Death Clarification (again)</h2>
<p>I love that after hopping from body to body the Possessor is now labeled again as the Possessor so that everyone knows if he dies. But… if the Possessor actually dies Night 1… or later on down the line before he has hopped out of his original “possessor body”… then it should say that the Possessor has literally died… so everyone doesnt think hes still floating around.</p>
<ul>
<li>The same reason for clarifying his death when he dies later in the game should happen in his first body too. I played a game yesterday where the possessors body got poisoned and he couldnt hop out of it… he died… and once it said a Possessor died… everyone freaked out the whole rest of the game since they thought a Possessor was around. The same also happened when a possessor went afk and died.</li>
<li>Maybe just a secondary line of text about the possessor literally being dead is all I think would be needed to clear things up</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know what yall think, if you have any other ideas to add to mine/ fix mine! Catch ya in the Throne Room!</p>
