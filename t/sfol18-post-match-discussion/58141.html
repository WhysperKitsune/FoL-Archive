          <p>There were a lot of changes made in SFoL18, and I personally feel that many of them would be really good if implemented into normal FoL, especially since, although the Unseen won, it was a much closer game than pretty much all of the recent FoL games, and the changes that have already passed are unlikely to be enough to change that on their own. So, I’d like to open up the changes I made for SFoL18 to see how everybody feels about bringing the new roles and changes I made over.</p>
<h1>Game Mechanics</h1>
<p>SFoL18 had several mechanical differences compared to FoL proper.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rather than run 96-hour days and 48-hour nights, it ran with 72-hour days and 24-hour nights. This should help evils a little bit by giving the town “only” three days to discuss before lynching, rather than four.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trials were completely nonexistent. Once majority was reached on a player, they immediately flipped. This helps prevent people from feeling safe to do literally nothing until they are on trial, and then claim and get voted down to instead vote up somebody else. One of the downsides to this was that the King’s current iteration of Decide Fate is not possible, so it was changed to achieve a similar effect. The way it ran, the King could instantly end the day by lynching any player with over 33% of the majority. However, this is incredibly strong in the endgame, which may not be desirable if we don’t want the largest factor of the game’s outcome to be which faction is King at the end, so I don’t think I’d keep this version of DF. If trials are removed, it’s probably best that Decide Fate goes too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feedback was much reduced, without ever withholding critical information from the player. If you were redirected, you do not know who you visited instead. If you occupied somebody that was occupy immune, you were not told they were immune. Changes like these prevent the Blue Dragon from racking up stores of free information for no reason at all and will be critical to the health of FoL going forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cult were completely disabled in SFoL18, and will not appear in the class cards below. This was purely due to limited time on my part, as making a ton of Cult Alts was simply not worth my time. Feel free to discuss Cult mechanics with these changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although not implemented in SFoL18, I have merged poison and bleeding effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rolling Classes</h1>
<p>The classlist is rolled from the following template:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>King</strong> (66% Good, 33% Evil)<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Prince</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Sheriff/Paladin</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Physician</strong></font><br>
<font color="purple"><strong>Mastermind</strong></font><strong>/</strong><font color="darkred"><strong>Cult Leader</strong></font><br>
<font color="purple"><strong>Assassin</strong></font><strong>/</strong><font color="darkred"><strong>Acolyte</strong></font><br>
<font color="grey"><strong>Neutral Killer</strong></font><br>
<font color="grey"><strong>Neutral Offensive/Social</strong></font> (Neutral Evil)<br>
<font color="grey"><strong>Neutral Support</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Random Blue Dragon</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Random Blue Dragon</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Random Blue Dragon</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Random Blue Dragon</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Random Blue Dragon</strong></font><br>
<strong>Random</strong> <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font><strong>/</strong><font color="grey"><strong>Neutral Non-Killing</strong></font><br>
<strong>Random</strong> <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font><strong>/</strong><font color="grey"><strong>Neutral Non-Killing</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that games will always have at least one Physician to heal and at least one “main” investigative class, and allows 2-3 Neutral Non-Killing roles in most games. If a max of four seems like a lot, hosts can just limit it to 3 manually.</p>
<p>I personally find it best to roll the classes from top to bottom first, then randomly assign players to each pre-rolled class. When I rolled each slot, I made a list of all the possible roles it could be, and then picked one. For example, the first Random Blue Dragon slot had a list with two of each non-unique Blue Dragon role, except for Sheriff and Physician. Because there was already one of these in the game, they only appeared one time in the list. If that slot were to roll Court Wizard, the next Random Blue Dragon slot would only have one Court Wizard in its list of possible classes. This helps to slightly cut down on repeat classes and increase class variety, without making having two of the same class unlikely.</p>
<h1>The Classes</h1>
<p>SFoL saw most classes changed and quite a few entirely reworked from their current FoL counterparts, as well as a handful of removals, replacements, and additions. The general purpose behind these changes were to both bring FoL more in line with ToL, but also to give the evils more power than they currently have due to their lackluster performance thus far. In addition, all mechanics that punish one or more players for lynching have been removed, including the abilities possessed by Cowardly King and Hunter, as well as the complete removal of Fool and the Mad King.</p>
<p>After the completion of SFoL18, I have made a few edits to the class cards below to fix some issues and make some improvements. Please read through the below classes carefully - I was really busy when I was making all of these changes, and did not have time to keep a proper changelog.</p>

<h1>Further Discussion</h1>
<ul>
<li>I know that the Mercenary was just reworked in FoL - do we also want to adopt those changes here?</li>
<li>I added quite a few Neutral Non-Killing roles, including the Trader, Baron, and Warlock. Are these any good? None of them spawned in SFoL18 and so require further testing.</li>
<li>Following the above two points, since no more Neutrals are convertible in ToL, which I consider a good idea, should we just remove the Broker (converted Trader)?</li>
<li>We need another Blue Dragon class with Royal Blood. Considering the Killer Prince, Investigative Princess, and Offensive Drunk all have it, I think a Support or Social class should be next. If anybody has any good ideas for a class that fits this bill, please let me know!</li>
<li>The upcoming Noble rework is something that was released after I worked on these cards. Should we adopt that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading, and please let me know exactly how you feel about everything in this thread!</p>

<p>Snoop (Night) - Choose a list of classes, with no size restrictions. You will know whether or not your target is one of those classes. - 3 uses</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When I suggested this ability to you I intended for it to be the primary ability with probe being the secondary. However if it is secondary there is a simple change that can be made to make it strong enough to not be a nerfed Probe.</p>
<p>Make it so you choose any number of Players AND classes and find out if any (but not which) of those players are any (but not which) of those classes. For example:</p>
<p>Lets say I am looking for the prince and I have narrowed it down to 1 of 4 people. Right now the fastest way to find him is to probe 3 of them which takes a max of 3 nights to find him with. With snoop being multi target you could snoop 2 of them checking if they are prince and then probe the group that contains him to find the prince in a maximum of 2 nights. In addition you could select ALL players to check if a class is in play at all (Warlock for example)</p>
<p>It would probably also need to not count as a visit. An observer seeing you visit the entire game is harder to explain than him seeing you visit no one.</p>

          <p>King being insanely OP at the end game is kinda BS, but it seems you also recognize that.</p>
<p>I dislike the way you roll the classes reducing multiple of the same classes spawn as that as it is harder for town when they CC each other and makes it more difficult for evils to fake claim, as if someone cc’s them it is very likely one is lying.</p>
<p>I’ll look into the class stuff later but as of now I liked all the mechanic changes apart from those 2 things. I especially like the lack of info.</p>

          <p>Also there is another problem. Right now king in a 2v1 cannot lynch because the 2 votes also makes him unable to force exe the resulting trial. However with no trial the vote instantly kills the person with no trial. Somehow that needs to be changed.</p>

          <p>My suggestion. Head of state rather than being 2 votes instead makes the person he is voting for get hammered at <strong>exactally</strong> half the votes rather than more than half the votes.</p>
<p>I would suggest the same thing for pull rank for the same reason.</p>
<p>Edit: Forget what I said about pull rank. He cannot endgame scum this way and it cannot stack if you make it like that</p>

          <p>Yea. Also solves the decide fate problem as it needs MORE THAN 33% (if it doesn’t then change that too) and in a 2v1 his vote counts as 1 still but just happens to hammer on ties and doesn’t let him decide fate (however he wins a 1v1 or a 2v2)</p>
