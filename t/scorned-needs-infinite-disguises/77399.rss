            <p>This is false.<br>
It is not impossible to win as scorned. There are two strats that both work okay. Either spam frame until you connect and then aggressively disguise, or disguise twice from the start and convince BD that you are an invest. You could also aggessively disguise and then just frame. Not that hard.</p>

</aside>
<p>Scorned doesn’t need to be credible, they just need to see 2 marks go off. They need to be just credible enough that they see 2 marks pop. They disguise once, get a mark. Frame and get that mark, and win. Sure, they are outed as scorned but they don’t need to live after 2 marks.</p>
