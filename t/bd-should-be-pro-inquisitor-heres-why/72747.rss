    <title>BD Should Be Pro-Inquisitor - Here&#39;s Why</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bd-should-be-pro-inquisitor-heres-why/72747</link>
    <description>People oft liken the new Inquisitor to a quasi-neutral killer, and given how frequently he&#39;s being played that way it makes perfect sense.

But today I write this thread to guide people to a newer, more prosperous path for Inquisitors:

__________
**The Nice Inq**

This concept essentially comes down to saving your Ruthless Efficiency uses regardless of whether you find people or not. If you find a heathen, you determine their **exact class**, now that Alch has been sufficiently toned down and nerfed from God status, Inquisitor is the only class in the game that has access to this raw investigative power from N1. Granted, it can only be used on 3 players, but the point still stands.

Say you find an Observer. The tempting thing that most Inquisitors cannot resist is killing the Observer the following night. I pose this question to you: _why would you do that?_

I&#39;m serious.

You&#39;re an Inquisitor. If the Blue Dragon defeat the Neutral Killer and Evils and you have failed to kill the three heathens, the game continues. This means there is **no rush** to kill heathens.

This is the core to this thread, so I will repeat it in allcaps.

**INQUISITOR HAS NO RUSH WHEN IT COMES TO KILLING HEATHENS AS THE GAME DOES NOT END EVEN WITH EVILS/NK DEFEATED UNTIL EITHER THE INQUISITOR OR THE HEATHENS ARE KILLED.**

The alternate method I put to you goes something like this:

1. Find a heathen
2. If they are evil, hold on to the info in the event you are upped or out them if it&#39;s later into the game.
3. If they are Blue Dragon, periodically check them every few days to see if they are converted.
4. If they have been converted, revert to step 2.
5. If they are never converted after the evils/NK are defeated, and/or if they are the last living heathen, kill them.
6. ???
7. PROFIT (extra gold at the end of the game)

_____
**The Flaw**

The current flaw with this approach is that players are currently leagues behind in regards of how to play and approach Inquisitors. Bad, careless play on the part of the Inq is giving him a Neutral-Killer tier reputation, and it can&#39;t be salvaged because even if the Inq plays nice BD don&#39;t give a shit and kill them anyway.

______________________

TL;DR: (read the method list first) BD can serve to benefit greatly from Inq as it stands; and I think it&#39;s about time players started opening their minds to this largely unexplored method of play. **Inquisitor does not have to be a discount neutral killer.**</description>

<p>They’re most likely going to be attacked rather than converted if BD doesn’t do too well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So what are you trying to accomplish with this strategy? Are you trying to make an open claim inquisitor meta a thing?</p>
<p>Because in that case, an inquisitor would pretty much have to play as a BD, start of game you say hey, my targets are an X, a Y and a Z d1 whilst open claiming.</p>
<p>Now, are you going to help BD with their lynches during the day? And leave your targets alive when you find them? By all means.</p>
<p>Now say the unseen just lost their mastermind, the assassin and are upping the last unseen member. How do you feel about that? The game is fairly close to endgame at that stage, realistically this is something you want to delay</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is around n4 in a cult game, cult have 4 members. The NK and the other starting non-NK have both died, and their are 10 players left. Who do you think the cult are going to try and get as their mislynch in lynch or lose? The Prince, the confirmed phys, the confirmed maid, or a neutral that has a win condition cantered around mostly killing confirmed BD? You see, even without any other information, BD can be swayed to vote execute on you, only one BD has to vote exe instead of pardon and you’re done for.</p>
<p>I would probably be more favourable towards this alternative strategy if you had a way of knowing when the heathens are converted instead of checking them every night, you’re going to be a day behind, time is money with this inquisitor.</p>

</aside>
<p>I would argue ‘most of the time’ stretches it a bit; that said, conversions aren’t the only thing you can wait for. They’re most likely going to be attacked rather than converted if BD doesn’t do too well.</p>

</aside>
<p><strong><em>CONVERTIBLE</em></strong> BD are heathen.</p>
<p>This is why patient Inq play can work in symbiosis with BD. They will inevitably get converted in long-term games, thus sniping these people when they do since you can always tell their exact class works.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is completely wrong. BD does not need to kill the Inquisitor. Inquisitor wins with everyone barring select circumstances where the last remaining member of a faction or a neutral is a heathen.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I don’t see why the main factions wincons resolving involve a neutral’s wincon also resolving. Seems a little tipped in Inquis’ favour otherwise, other neutrals do not get this second chance.</p>
<p>Take the old scorned, if the unseen/cult and NK were gone, did it become a “find the scorned or have them exe their target” for the game to end? Similar story here, if anything you should prolong the game so that you can find them and kill them.</p>
<p>Don’t think I’ve seen any inq spawns at all tbh, maybe it’s on hiatus</p>

            <p>If there is 1 heathen alive you can accuse them</p>
<p>If there are 2 heathens alive then if you night kill them there will be 1 the next day</p>
<p>if there are 3 heathens and you accuse one then there will be 2 the next night</p>
<p>If BD cannot stop you from preforming night actions then you can safely accuse with 2 heathens</p>
<p>In otherwords once you know all 3 heathens then you can eliminate them back to back fairly safely</p>
<p>Especially because you can RE non-heathens.</p>

            <p>This is because an inquisitor claim does not actually have any additional utility compared to a BD claim.</p>
<p>Hell claim Alch at the very least. It’s not like anyone can tell the difference</p>

            <p>Kinda mixed on this one. On one hand I see this working BUT I see this working more in games that aren’t turbo, and I think BD should always execute an inquisitor as they are basically a mini NK.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation you only need 1 dead. You accuse one and then kill the other before the next day.</p>
<p>Or better yet you kill all 3 before they can even TRY to accuse you.</p>
<p>Yeah you don’t kill the obs you found D1. But once you have all 3 heathens located you have no reason to weight if only because you can fake claim a different class and use your leverage that way instead.</p>
<p>Why claim Inquisitor and wait to kill when you could claim Sheriff and accuse the Assassin, RE heathen. Accuse heathen.</p>

            <p>And reveal your log? That’s a death sentence for evils that he has found and withheld. Moreover, the single bit of night immunity you get deters evils going for you. 2 nights investment to remove one neutral who could side with you from play is not worth their time.</p>

<p>The only time I would have little-no trust for an outed Inq would be when I’m aware they only have one heathen left. Other than that, there’s little reason for him to lie because of his shaky position in the court, particularly with BD in strong majority. Long game needs to be played.</p>

            <p>And why should BD trust you anyways? You have every reason to lie about their class to eliminate 2 Heathens.</p>
<p>Once you know both heathens you can kill 2 and accuse 1 to win within 2 nights. Which is way safer than hoping nothing goes wrong with this plan. And trust me, there is a lot that can go wrong</p>

            <p>here is the thing. Once you know all 3 heathens it is in your favor to kill them ASAP.</p>
<p>Sure you CAN hold onto the information but for example: A scum heathen is going to kill you if you try this.</p>
<p>So you in theory could wait until end game to kill them. However you have more reason to risk attacking them than you do to wait by default.</p>
<p>This means that BD cannot trust that you will wait even if you claim you will. Meaning you would get executed. Meaning you lose while trying this.</p>
<p>TLDR: Not a valid strat</p>
