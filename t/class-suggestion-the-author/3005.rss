    <title>[Class suggestion] The Author</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-author/3005</link>
    <description>**The Author - Neutral wildcard**

**Passive - Reserved**
Immune to occupy

**Night ability 1 - Self-published** ( Unlimited )
If your target is killed tonight, you will replace their journal with your own. Works on any death that occurs at night, excluding suicide.

**Night ability 2 - &quot;Research&quot;** ( Unlimited / 4 uses? )
Send someone to fetch a person&#39;s Journal tonight. You will recieve their Journal the next day, and once you close it you can&#39;t open it again. 
_(Basically you get a copy of the Target&#39;s Journal from the last night. It won&#39;t update if the target updates his Journal while you&#39;re still reading the copy)_

**Goal**
Successfully replace 2 Journals. Live to the end.

----------
A more chaotic, more neutral version of [the Artist](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-artist/2949/) that could probably contribute more to the game other than being able to draw all the time :slight_smile: 

It&#39;s like Forger in ToS, except neutral and not as sucky. You can side with whoever you wish too, ayy!</description>

            <p>how about:<br>
when you die, all the journal copies you have (not the current journal, the copy), and who they belong to, are released to the public<br>
and, make it so that, you always have the copies available to look at (maybe only at night, because they’re in your room), they just dont update<br>
and also, add a passive thats basically:<br>
Your journal cannot be destroyed/hidden upon your death, for any reason<br>
name it “successful publishing”</p>

</aside>
<p>This would benefit the evils a lot imo. Evils don’t really need journals (except for fake-journal cases, which still don’t need to be published). However, it’d destroy Prince’s and investigative classes’ journals.</p>
<p>The idea in general sounds fun, but I don’t think it could be balanced in Casual gamemode. If there is another more chaotic gamemode with more evils in the future, it could possibly work there.</p>
<p>So <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> for a possible more chaotic gamemode, <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> for Casual gamemode.</p>
