    <description>I have always felt Cult is too similar to unseen. I&#39;m not sure if this will work, but here I go.

&gt; [color=red]Cult Leader (Cult Special)[/color]
&gt;  
&gt;  Passive: Legacy of the Cult: Your successor will inherit all of your uses of initiation.
&gt; 
&gt;  Passive: Power of Mithras: You may use both your abilities at night.
&gt; 
&gt;  Night Ability: Initiation: Attempt to convert someone into the cult. If they can&#39;t be converted, attack them. (No Cool Down). Starts with 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Blood of Mithras: Sacrifice a Cult member to gain two uses of Initiation.

&gt; [color=red]Acolyte (Cult Killing)[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Wrath of Mithras: When you are sacrificed, kill all non Cult visitors
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Blade of Blood: Make someone bleed (identical to Hunter) 2 uses.

Other changes:

Ritualist Will of Mithras would change to this:

&gt; Will of Mithras: If you are sacrificed by the Cult Leader, he will get an extra charge of Initiation

            <p>I know but since kills are the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> method of determining the strength of a class anything that gives more kills is powerful. And the 4 poison kills cannot simply be ignored because they are in addition to the regular kill making it hard to counter play both kills at the same time.</p>

            <p>You can’t base this off the most edge case possible. Almost all the time, Cult/Unseen will get 2 KPN, since most other kills have easy counters, and Revenge probably rarely comes up.</p>

<p>2for1 + Revenge + Nightshade is 4 kills.</p>
<p>2for1 + Convert + Nightshade is a KPN of 5 on that night.</p>

            <p>Nightshade and Rapture count as kills because all of it is under the assumption that all kills actualy succeed. In practice this rarely ever happens but that’s not what I am tracking.</p>

            <p>First of all, Nightshade can’t be counted the same as a kill, due to the 2 nights required for it to work. Usually a Phys/Alchemist cures it. In addition 2 people can’t die from it at the same time. Blade is similar, but it does act faster, but also has half uses.</p>
<p>Blood of Mithras actually having to be used probably does affect the KPN, but multiple Acolytes can be converted, resulting in more kills. Also the Wrath of Mithras passive.</p>

            <p>The 2 KPN total is important you know. If one faction had a higher KPN then that faction would win over the other every time. For example the version you just gave is: 2+2-1/3 (Initiation is the base. Blade is the +2 and Blood of Mithras is the -1/3) compared to the Unseen’s 2+4+1 (Convert and Assassinate are the base. Poison is the +4 and 2for1 is the +1) There is also the possability for the Unseen to get an extra plus 1 by converting a Merc for a total of 2+2+1+1 and a max of 4 kills in 1 night as well as one convert.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It mostly averages out. 2 kills every 2 nights (1 kill per night, just like Unseen) and conversion has same cool down (1 convert per night, just like unseen). Also I have never seen Blood of Mithras used. Usually Cult Leader dies before that is necessary. Seeker has the same function as Marshal/Duchess/Nightwatch, same with Invoker and Servant/Alcoholic, Apostle with Aristocrat, and Ritualist with Sage. Also evil life expectancy is pretty low, and the odds are even lower they won’t die or get converted first. It’s mostly the rhythm that’s different, but only slightly.</p>

            <p>Well you could :<br>
Take down the Bleed to 1 use.<br>
but i would disagree with your idea that the factions are similar.<br>
Differences include:</p>
<p>One kills once per night , always has a use on hand<br>
One kills twice every other night , has to sacrifice</p>
<p>Cult has sacrifice to , becuase all cult is more expendable.</p>
<p>Unseen converts are there to spread deception , Cult ones are there to empower the Cult Leader<br>
etc.etc.</p>
<p>Like i said though. If this change was added, i wouldnt rage at it (like the medic name change exsdee)</p>

            <p>Eh. I can definitely remove Rupture from CL if it’s a problem. It’s definitely not needed, but I think it would differentiate it from unseen. The 2 factions have only minor differences.</p>
