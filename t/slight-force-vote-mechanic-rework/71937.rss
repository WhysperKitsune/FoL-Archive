    <description>Hi there, I&#39;d just like to suggest a small rework to the force vote mechanic that is on the Noble and Possessor right now.


I&#39;d suggest **force voting/mind control be available at daystart** like the reaper&#39;s chill. It is a mechanic I believe is meant to enable classes with this ability to have a distinct end-game advantage that is equal if not better to the kings. Please enable this ability to be used at daystart so that it doesn&#39;t become a vote race similar to the old reaper chill/ vote him before he can chill you situation.


Feedback appreciated

            <p>Or just have the ability not resolve until after the 5 second timer and have it just be buffered</p>

            <p>We can always solve this by allowing voting during the first seconds but not allowing trials to happen till a certain time is reached.</p>
<p>Reaper will then cancel someone’s vote with chill, so it isn’t a race.</p>

            <p>the one problem I see with this, is it raises the confirmability of the noble. IE currently it’s at least possible for the cult or unseen to “force” a teammate to vote to confirm.</p>
