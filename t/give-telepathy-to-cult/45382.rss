    <title>Give Telepathy to Cult</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/give-telepathy-to-cult/45382</link>
    <description>In a Cult game, there&#39;s no way for evils to fake Telepathy (whereas in an Unseen game, The Illusionist has it, so at least there&#39;s a chance the Psychic could be converted.)

I suggest giving Telepathy to the Cult to make it a bit harder for Psychics to claim and to generally let them play tricks.  Yes, a Psychic doesn&#39;t have a hard time proving, but it&#39;d still be nice if a Psychic in a Cult game couldn&#39;t instantly, 100% prove they weren&#39;t converted at the push of a button.

Of course, the obvious first choice would be to give it to The Apostle, which the Psychic converts into.  The problem is that the Apostle lacks a free day ability slot - however, one option might be to combine Cult Pressure and Cult Numbers into one ability; which one occurs would depend on when you push its button (push it before a trial, it has the Cult Pressure effect; push it during a trial, it has the Cult Numbers effect.)

Another option would be to wedge it into another Cult member - not as ideal, but it would at least keep the Psychic from 100% confirming that they&#39;re not converted.  There&#39;s free Day ability slots on almost every other Cult role, so any of them could work.</description>

            <p>Merge Cult Numbers and Cult Pressure to something that works for either one. Or just have one. It would prevent Psychic from proving.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Why not put in Apostle? Already converted from Psychic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <i>would</i> be ideal, but Apostle has two Day abilities already, so there’s no room for another one.  That’s why I suggested combining their two existing Day abilities into one context-sensitive one that can have either effect, depending on whether you push the button before or during a trial.</p>
<p>(This could also be done with Noble and Aristocrat if we ever want to give them an additional Day ability.)</p>
