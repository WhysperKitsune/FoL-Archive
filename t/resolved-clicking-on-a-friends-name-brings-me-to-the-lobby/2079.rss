    <title>[RESOLVED] Clicking on a friends name brings me to the lobby</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-clicking-on-a-friends-name-brings-me-to-the-lobby/2079</link>
    <description>I am unsure on how to even really join any lobby at the moment. I know all I&#39;ve done so far is click a steam friends name, then somehow it invites me into a lobby.  One of my Steam friends has this game too.

Not sure if like putting it in Windowed mode causes some sorta way to hide the join lobby button or what.</description>

            <p>To join a lobby, check out the top right where it says “Matchmaking” (on main menu after logging in). That’ll open a menu in which you can start the Matchmaking process (looking for a lobby). You can select Casual or Aftermath (gamemodes) on the left side, and queue up for playing on the left side.</p>
<p>As this is alpha, playerbase isn’t exactly high and so I’d heavily recommend hopping into the discord server (check out the blue buttom above gamemode selection).</p>
<p>Regarding the thing with your friend’s name… maybe he invited you or you joined his lobby somehow? I have not heard of it, but that sounds plausible.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, here’s the discord link in case something doesn’t work. <a href="http://discord.throneoflies.com/">http://discord.throneoflies.com/</a></p>
