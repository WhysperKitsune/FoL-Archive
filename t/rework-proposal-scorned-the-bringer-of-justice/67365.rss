    <title>[Rework Proposal] Scorned, the Bringer of Justice</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/rework-proposal-scorned-the-bringer-of-justice/67365</link>
    <description>This is an idea I had to make the Scorned more interactive and fun to play with and against, while preserving her flavour and identity.

&gt; # [color = &quot;grey&quot;] The Scorned [/color] :balance_scale: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;grey&quot;] Neutral Investigative (Unique) [/color]**
**Resolve (Passive)** - Immune to death at night, occupation and target changing.
**Blood On Their Hands (Day)** - If one of your targets is executed today, their journals will be wiped and they will appear as an Assassin or Cult Leader (automatic depending on the game type). Must be used before the target is voted up. - 2 uses.
**Purging Spite (Day)** - [Unavailable until the first win condition is forfeit]. You will use the supernatural power of your spite to heal yourself at the end of the night. - 1 use.
**Sense Guilt (Night)** - Visit a player. You will know if they can kill at night. - Infinite uses.
**Specter of Justice (Night)** - You will guard one of your targets, preventing them from death at night. They will also appear unfavourably to investigative abilities used on them that night. - 3 uses.
*Survive to see both of your targets executed during the day. If either or both your targets die at night, you win by surviving until the end of the game.*

***Notes:***
1) Purging Spite follows the same rules as the Physician&#39;s self-heal.
2) Targets will not be informed if they were protected from an attack by Specter of Justice.

This new version of the Scorned is a lot more active and tense than the previous one, with a very similar goal but with more options and strategy. Feedback is welcome!</description>

            <p>The Scorned’s wincon is very fragile and can be hit or miss. You might have a gullible group that just accepts your accusation at face value and your target mounts a poor defence and you straight up win d2 (it’s happened to me) or you can instantly lose one night because both your targets die at night out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And the core of the matter is that Scorned just isn’t fun to play (and neither is Fool, for that matter, but that’s a different topic). Your abilities are simple and straightforward and have little interaction with others, you have very limited decision-making and strategy and you often find that winning or losing is out of your hands.</p>
<p>Every other Neutral class other than Fool and Scorned is interesting to play. They both serve an important purpose and that’s fine, but you can give them something else to make them more fun to play as, and to me, fixing the Scorned involves either an alternate wincon or a full rework. So this is my attempt to fix Scorned with minimal changes to its core identity. If you disagree fundamentally with this, that’s fine, we’ll just agree to disagree.</p>

<p>The entire point of the rework is providing an alternate wincon for when the main one fails.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If that’s your point then forget it. The wincon dictates how someone plays.</p>
<p>If you need to do 2 wincons then you are forced to play in 2 contradictory ways (which is extremely hard to do).</p>
<p>If you need to do only to do 1 of 2 wincons then you would do the easier one to the exclusion if the other (take old Merc as an example. He would often ignore the first contract in favor of his second) thus making it just 1 wincon in practice.</p>

<p>Also your giving a class with full night immunity a survivor wincon?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are currently in the game a significant number of ways to bypass death immunity, particularly for BD. I could always remove Resolve if the first wincon fails, but that would warrant increasing the uses of Purging Spite.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <blockquote>
<p>I mean… you yourself said she can be found out by her Resolve passive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butlers and Drunks will typically leave you alone after you find an Unseen player, so yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the fact that the Defile effect wipes a journal can be a telling effect for BD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having log-less evils is pretty common, so this won’t be a good tell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Observer’s Peek will reveal her immediately, as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as a Princess finding them to be Social/Support instead of Special/Investigative. But again, there’s no reason why an Investigative or an Offensive class would visit someone who just outed an evil, so yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trollbox is almost useless because people quote important statements to ensure they aren’t trollboxed,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on how experienced the Fool/Scorned is at Trollboxing. Just spamming “Sheriff here. Inv 3 - Unseen!” isn’t going to fool anyone. But if you drop misinformation that doesn’t sound out of place at key moments then you can really mess BD up.</p>
<p>I mean, just yesterday in a single game I managed to get a Butler voted up and executed because I tb’d “I barrier’d 6 and got success, so someone tried to convert him?” on him, made a Princess counter-claim a Merc which got her executed by the Prince, and then got a Sheriff OE’d because I tb’d “King, exe 7 tonight to prove you’re good. He’s likely the MM.” on the Prince. So the Trollbox can go from useless to insanely strong depending on who uses it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reaper checks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t really work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possessor passwords are a thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And only used in an extremely small minority of Possessor games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>who voted/didn’t vote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically scumreading 101.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scorned wiping journals can end up being a thing the community works around, with caught evils wiping their journals on purpose to try and make a legit BD look like Scorned, for example,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a few people would notice this. And even then the sheer frequency of evils wiping their journals, many who already do, would make it nigh-impossible to notice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn’t either/or. You can do both. You can pretend to be an investigative class, quietly block a killer and don’t take credit for it. The game has a lot of ways of preventing attacks and some ways to bypass those preventions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day ability slot would be far better reserved for another ability. The synergy it has with the Scorned’s first goal is very weak and it’s counter-intuitive to use it with her second goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not explicitly anti-BD, though. It’s harmful to BD, yes, but the Scorned doesn’t win by seeing BD fall</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t really matter if it’s harmful to BD or outright requires BD to lose. The issue here is if the class just gives negative utility to BD then you can’t claim it as any smart BD would automatically get rid of them as soon as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Alchemist and Inquisitor can straight up kill BDs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they want. Their wincon requires them to stay alive(Alchemists) or kill the Sorcerer(Inquisitor) and they can ignore BD if they wish. For Scorneds, they need to get BD-aligned players to fulfill their wincon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Knight, Prince, Good King, Butler and Hunter can royally screw over BD by killing another BD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would fall under poor play or gamethrowing depending on the circumstances as these classes require BD to win in order for their wincon to be satisfied. Meanwhile the Scorned’s wincon requires them to get 2 BD-aligned class executed in order for them to win.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because a Neutral’s goal/mechanics can harm BD doesn’t make them explicitly anti-BD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes it does.</p>
<p>As I said before “It doesn’t really matter if it’s harmful to BD or outright requires BD to lose. The issue here is if the class just gives negative utility to BD then you can’t claim it as any smart BD would automatically get rid of them as soon as possible.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a better suggestion for an alternate goal? Wanting to see killers dead seems like a natural extension of the character, but I’m open to suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give the Scorned a new target if both original ones die, change the overall goal to see <em>n</em> amount of BD publicly executed instead of one specific target, require them to survive to see BD lose, or what have you. The Scorned doesn’t really need an alternative goal as the current one is fine. If you want an alternate goal, make sure that it harms BD and that the Scorned can accomplish it by themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limiting Defile to 2 to 4 uses (before the target is voted up) would require skillful play. Would that balance it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would work, as this require better timing and making sure your accusations would stick to offset the ability’s strength.</p>

            <p>Yeah the entire point of this was to give the Scorned an additional wincon and additional abilities to have more interactivity, decision-making and strategy. Telling me to separate this into two classes goes directly against the point.</p>
<p>Suggesting an alternate wincon that is more in line with the Scorned’s thematic identity would be better feedback, thanks. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
