</details>
<p><strong>So what will sanity mean?</strong></p>
<p>Well. Certain traps will make you lose some. Being wounded might make you lose some<br>
Each player starts the game with 10 sanity.</p>
<p>If you drop below your roles minimum sanity level there is a 20% of you failing your action per number below you are (IE: If your min level is 5 and you have 3 sanity you have a 40% chance of failing your action). Your score can never be less than 0. If you fail a turn due to insanity, you will have a 50% chance of doing something harmful to your role’s goal. If you have nothing else near you, you may kill yourself if you roll too much ‘bad’ insanity.</p>
<p><strong>Mentality</strong></p>
<p>Each role card has a individual aggression description. They mean the following</p>
<p><em>Psychotic</em> - You may attack other players without reason or warning</p>
<p><em>Ruthless</em> - You may attack other players without warning, providing you have good reason to suspect they oppose your victory condition or mean you harm</p>
<p><em>Justified</em> - You may attack any player you have reason to suspect of being Criminally aligned</p>
<p><em>Self-Preservation</em> - You may attack another player only if you think they mean you harm.</p>
<p><em>Not a Drop</em> - You must avoid violence unless you have no choice. Retreat from a fight if you can</p>

Summary</summary>
<p>Tarred floor</p>
<p>The room is covered in sticky tar. Any action other than turning back will take twice as long to achieve unless the player successfully passes an ‘Overcome an obstacle’ roll.

<p>Riddle Door</p>
<p>The Door allowing you to go ‘Up’ is protected by a Riddle you must answer to proceed through it. This door will be indestructible and cannot be opened with a key. You can give only one answer each turn</p>
<p>Wall</p>
<p>The way up is blocked by a wall which you’ll have to climb to proceed. Walls will prevent traps triggering until you pass it. You will be unable to search a room unless you climbed the wall. Walls can be destroyed by a bomb in the same room. Overcome roll needed = 60%</p>

</details>
<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong><br>
Actions are sent to me via PM, once all actions are sent in, they are resolved, if an action happens in a room that isn’t yours, you won’t be told.<br>
If detained in the Prison, you will be trapped unless another player kills the tycoon. You will be considered dead for any role that cares about that until then.<br>
All roles are unique, except Cop and Guard</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Move to [room]:<br>
You can move to an adjacent room, i.e. above, below, left or right, the exception is the tycoon’s room, which must be accessed from Left or Right 12</p>
<p>Search:<br>
You can around the room you are in. You can search multiple times until you find something.</p>
<p>[action] [name of what you’re interacting with]:<br>
You can interact with people and things</p>
<p>Loot:<br>
You can loot a dead body in the room to take all of their non-role specific items</p>
<p>Inspect:<br>
You can look at a body to identify their role. This will reduce sanity loss from killing them if you had to kill this player to win</p>
<p>Brace:<br>
You can ready a counterattack, if you are attacked that turn, you have a chance to counterattack your attacker. If a ranged attack you will always take a hit first, but if melee you have a chance to land a blow first.</p>
<p>Check for traps:<br>
Depending on your character, you may be more likely to find them than others. Always remember that even if you don’t find any, there could be one AND you still risk setting them off by looking for them. An Intruder player will never start in a room with a trap. The sensitivity of a trap is halved if you discover it during a check unless it’s sensitivity is 100% to begin with</p>
<p>Calming:<br>
Usable only if your sanity has dropped below your acceptable level. 50% chance of restoring a sanity point.</p>
<p>You may also perform any action that you would like.  These are the baseline actions, but as long as it is only one action you may do anything a human could do.</p>
<p>Notes:<br>
The Tycoon is an NPC, not a role<br>
If you leave a room and are attacked in the same turn, the attack will always go through first (aside from a Kidnapper who has a 1/3 to avoid the attack upon leaving)<br>
Everyone must escape through Mid 1 to win, aside from roles that need to kill everyone (who will automatically win upon completion of this objective).<br>
A minimum of 4 security roles will spawn.  Wotm will be used a fair bit in the rand in order to make sure balance is reasonable so that everyone has a fun time.<br>
This game is not perfectly balanced by any means.  Some roles are easier to win with than others.<br>
Talking is not an action and can be done freely<br>
The only way to safely leave the tower is through Mid 1, you cannot leave until I say you can<br>
Once the game begins, you may hint at events in game that you are experiencing in the main thread, but must not leak specifics like if someone attacks you etc.<br>
A few changes have been made from Fortified Tower 2 if you have any questions about these just ask.</p>
