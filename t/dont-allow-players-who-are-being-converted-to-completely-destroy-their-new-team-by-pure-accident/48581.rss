I just lose a game when I was a knight and basicly csed the whole cult, just to be converted to the cult the same night I csed the last cult leader.

I think that having conversion prevent you from taking actions that would be catastrophic to your new side is fair enough (and avoids putting players in slightly awkward situations where they’re going to feel intense pressure to gamethrow.)

A comparable case is that a Princess who gets converted on a night where she uses a Willo will, currently, omit the Mastermind’s visit from the willo report that their target receives

Those are some examples there from a different topic.

But I think it would do some good for both BD (people don&#39;t question OMG what If I get converted let me just subtly gamethrow and do nothing)  and main evil factions don&#39;t get ruined by pure accident.

Knight CS Cult as he gets converted same night (see above): Favored result is Knight is prevented and becomes a Cultist [It&#39;s not explainable to the BD but lategame it won&#39;t hurt. Also, this will prevent Knights from getting shaky and not CSing when they should.] 

Same thing for Hunter&#39;s wolf, etc [not bear]</description>

            <p>We could just make it so conversion also occupies you (although that could lead to some unusual results - and in some cases it would hurt the converted person by preventing an action that they could have used to prove themselves.)</p>

            <p>The problem isn’t you screwing over your new team necessarily as when you’re BD you want to kill the unseen/cult. The problem is when knight CS and kill the CL the same night they are converted. This causes problems as you ruined your team. It’s fine if you’re sheriff/paladin and you say “X is Unseen/Cult” as that’s what you should do as BD. But you destroying your own team seems stupid. Why would you ever do that? I lost a game once because as princess I went on the offensive and got assassin lynched. I then WoW King and MM converted me outing me and my MM as there was as a scout on me. This seems stupid as was I supposed to subtle gamethrow and not WoW? I thought I was going to be killed not converted. This is an issue in my opinion but not a BIG one just one we should probably try to fix.</p>

            <p>If it’s the night before, it’s not exactly destroying your team.</p>
<p>If you CS a Cultist and are confirmed, then you’re going to get converted because you’re confirmed. Different thing.</p>

            <p>I don’t mind that, but there is still always gonna be situations where you screw over your new team, the night before or whatever. That in particular would be okay, but overall this problem can’t be solved.</p>

            <p>Would it break the game if Knights are stopped from CSing a cultist if they’re converted beforehand?</p>

            <p>It’s part of the game. There’s not really much we can do. The game is based on conversion, so there is no solution.</p>
<p>I would like to see something like if you were converted in the last  couple of nights and then lost, you could get a bit more gold, though.</p>
<p>Still, this can’t be solved without reworking the entire game.</p>
