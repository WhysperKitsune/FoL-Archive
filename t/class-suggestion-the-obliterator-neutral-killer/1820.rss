    <description>**OBLITERATOR (NEUTRAL KILLER)**

(Passive) Restriction: If you killed more than one person last night, you cannot kill tonight.
(Passive) Death&#39;s Reward: You are immune to death at night.
(Day) Flee the Scene: If you are investigated by the Princess tonight, you will appear as a non-killer class. Uses: 2
(Night) Obliterate: Kill your target player and anyone who visits them. The Court Wizard&#39;s Ice Ward cannot stop this attack. Uses: Infinite (But 1-Night Cooldown if more than 1 person killed)
(Night) Decimate: Stay home at night, removing anyone who visits you from existence. Their journal and role will not be revealed tomorrow, and they cannot speak while dead and cannot be revived. Uses: 1

Changelog:
5/26/17: Obliterator is created.</description>

            <p>This is a class that: can kill multiple people at night, ignore other role’s ability to stop visits (ice ward), ignore investigators (princess), and can stop killed targets from being revived. No thank you.</p>
