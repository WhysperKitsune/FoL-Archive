<p>Although that might be true,</p>

            <p>He said he was going to mark (as in, write down) his name and kill him every match (i.e. that he runs into him).  Tracking implies some sort of manipulation of the code or data.  Any of us can write down the name of some guy we didn’t like and either avoid their lobby or kill them every time we have a class that can do it and can figure out who they are.  I don’t think there’s anything bannable in that part.  Assuming he said other offensive things before or after that screen, which I absolutely believe the guy probably did, that’s probably where your bannable actions are.  You’re entitled to your opinion as much as anyone, but I absolutely think accusing someone of an actual crime where none was committed also deserves punishment.</p>

            <p>He was reported by others, i just closed my ‘‘end’’ window too fast. Usually i do report in game but in this case i just switch to a new game fast. Thats’s why i posted this.</p>
<p>I guess any mod can look at the chat logs. I used to mod a online poker wesite and i could look at all the conversations. I also think that in general 1 screenshot is not evidence enough because of photoshop and the context. I posted this so mod could reaserch the game. Should be easy finding when our 2 accounts were in the same game.</p>
<p>Thx for your input.</p>

            <p>Mods cannot do anything, it needs a report and if someone else reported him in game it is highly likely he will be banned. 1 screenshot is not sufficient evidence, even if it is pretty damning</p>

            <p>Funny, that, because I originally missed his leteral meaning to start also, since you circled the first part where he says “kill you” and then skipped over the second line of his where he said “on every match”.  Whether intentionally or not, you emphasized your screenshot it such a way that makes it difficult to notice the part where he unequivocally limits it to being in the game.  You can call me dramatic all you want, but accusing people of committing an actual crime is not something that should be taken lightly, and consequences can reach farther than whether you file charges or not.  Cops don’t necessarily NEED someone to file charges, they can file them on their own, too.  I’m sorry if you cannot see a difference between saying someone acts like an ass and saying someone has committed a crime, but the difference does exist.  And sorry, but there’s several ways to privately ask the devs to look into the matter, especially given that the in-game report specifically tags THAT game and makes it much easier for them to find and look it over.  I find that most of the time, if someone brings up someone’s bad behavior in public, it’s because they want the public to jump on the wagon and return the harassment 10 fold.  If you really wanted to do things the right way, you would have.  Death threats are something that should be taken immensely seriously, whether online, over the phone, or in person, and actions like yours make people take them a little less seriously every time it happens.<br>
Edit: It’s no skin off my teeth if you don’t reply. Try just NOT replying next time instead of replying preemptively.</p>

            <p>Yes i chose to post it publicly so it’s mods can see it. I don’t see the problem in that at all.</p>
<p>Crime or not, i dont care. I will not file him.</p>
<p>The way he spoke to me all game made me think only of that and i’m not the only one if you look at the others reactions. I can see the argument for being only in game even if it make no sense in term or fesability</p>
<p>That’s all. Thx for the mods to look at it and if this topic was so trash/witchhunt of me, they would have closed it. I think my complain is sound and i think your arguments are weak and kindof dramatic to be honest.</p>
<p>NB: I see you replying for the last 30min… i will not reply.</p>

            <p>To clarify: You are accusing someone of something that, in most jurisdictions, is a CRIME.   If you want to point out someone behaves like an ass online, no problem.  If you want to accuse someone of Illegal activities, then you’d better provide proof of it.  Don’t accuse people of criminal acts falsely.  And considering you said “Let him spend another $10”, that certainly sounds like wanting a permanent ban.<br>
Further: There’s a report function in game.  You can send screenshots to devs privately, here or in discord.  You chose to publicly post it on a public forum.</p>

            <p>You provide 1 screenshot where he talks about killing you in-game.  There are absolutely ways to figure out who people are in matches if you run into them often enough.  You falsely claim RL death threats, which most of us consider fairly serious, when the person clearly threatens your in game avatar.  You say that’s not all there is to it, but without any evidence, it’s he-said, she-said.  You are sitting here trying to bend the interpretation of what they said as hard as you can to make it look as though he said something that he didn’t in that screenshot, while also giving his in-game name, so yeah, witch-hunting on shaky evidence, with no proof shown.  If he said unkind things about your mother, sorry to hear that, and he could surely do with a day or two off for that.  Claiming he said something he didn’t (at least not in your screenshot) and calling for a permaban is a false report, and also worthy of a ban.  If you have other evidence of his actions, then post it… But don’t sit here and lie and say he threatened your actual well being based on him saying specifically he’d “kill you in every match”</p>

            <p>Finitethrills you make 0 sense.</p>
<p>With my account name he cannot know who i am in game. (Unless you use your account name in game each game and no one does that). Maybe he meant that but after calling for the death or my mother I don’t think so.</p>
<p>The fact that for no reason you call for my ban, saying i started a witchhunt with that obvious screenshot and are pissed is ludacris. Or maybe you are ARUC, that would make sense.</p>
<p>NB: Drewski, yes i was 8, 16 made himself look like scorn day 1 yelling for 10exe. I called him out, he died in the night and was more than pissed.</p>
<p>NB2: Thx Insanity</p>

            <p>Just seeing the one screenshot, it looks to me like he will be writing down your account name so he can kill you in-game.   I’m not sure where the “he wants to hack me and kill me irl” comes from.  In fact, on second glance, he even says “in every match”.  You are crying wolf, here, and that’s bullshit.  Having played games where getting actual RL death threats is not uncommon, and some of them being p2p, meaning they CAN actually track you down , this pisses me off.  Personally, I think you deserve the ban here, since it looks to me like you’re aiming to start a witchhunt.</p>

            <p>I played in this game with you.  I’m guessing you were 8.  I was You Up <span class="hashtag">#10</span>.  16 was angry that you confirmed me and then everyone pardoned, but that doesn’t excuse his attacks on you.  I don’t think this was a rl death threat.  I think he just meant to kill you every game he is in with you.</p>

            <p>He want my in game Real ID, they are hidden in game. He would never know my '‘class’ in game even if we crossed path in a lobby</p>
<p>He’s a kid claiming he will hack to get my real life id from the master game id to kill me.</p>
<p>Still I think this should be a suspension or a ban. Let him spend another 10$</p>
