    <title>[RESOLVED] Could I please get a refund?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-could-i-please-get-a-refund/4433</link>
    <description>**What happened:** I bought the game, but it&#39;s not compatible with my (or any other) computers in my house. It requires 64 bits or something, and I only have 32. I sent an email back in September, asking for a refund, being as I can&#39;t play the game, but I haven&#39;t received a response. 


**What was SUPPOSED to happen:** In a dream world I would have had a compatible computer. But I don&#39;t. :(


**Steps to reproduce this issue:**

1. Bought the game
2. Error
3. Can&#39;t play it

**Steps to fix this issue:**
1. Refund 
2. Happy customer!</description>

            <p>Hey, thank you for responding! I installed it on Steam on August 22nd of this year, maybe a day or two later. Should I try re-installing it?</p>

            <p>The game was made compatible with 32-bit systems a couple months ago. Have you tried installing it on Steam recently?</p>
