    <description>Here is a list of things that social classes might be able to do. This is not full class suggestions just individual Ability ideas. Please reply with your own ideas and thoughts on how to work these into a full class.

Ones currently/previously used:

Talking to a target - Psychic and Prince
Talking to someone random - Noble
Public announcement - Psychic and Noble
Hidden whispers - Psychic, noble, Apostle and Butler
Anonymous whispers - Butler
Reading whispers - noble and apostle
Preventing whispers - Butler
Talking to dead - Priest, Reaper and Psychic
Mason chat - Noble
Preventing votes - Noble and Princess/Duchess
Preventing talking - Assassin, Illusionist, Alchaholic and Reaper
Preventing hearing - Reaper, Illusionist, Alchaholic and Alchemist
Redirecting votes - Noble and Psychic
Gaining additional votes - King and Noble
Provent someone from being voted - King, Fool and Noble
Reading journals - Marchal
Hearing Prince chat - Marchal and Prince
Tampering with Ability&#39;s - Illusionist, Apostle, MM, Ritualist, Scorned and Fool
Removing chat log - Illusionist
Redirecting whispers - Illusionist
Tampering with class reveals - Herbalist
Fake notifications - Herbalist and Acolyte
Forced speach - Scorned and Fool
Lover status - Noble

Ability&#39;s that have yet to be used:

Silencing night chats
Reading Ability results
Erasing journals
Tampering with journal reveals
Class reveals
Forced whispers
Seeing votes early
Hearing evil chat
Invisible votes
False votes (people see someone voting for someone when they aren&#39;t)
Neighborhood chats
False conversions (Unseen/Cult thinks you are converted/evil when you are not)
Fake conversions (You think you are Unseen/Cult when you are not)

Social classes are hard to come up with. This list could help you get started.

Examples on how some of the more controversial ability&#39;s could work in the real game.

False conversions - The starting evil king and the possessor can sort of do this (the possessor not anymore). As the possessor if you possessed an unseen/cult you would meet with them (which was awesome btw but OP for the Possessor)

Fake conversions - In addition to making someone unseen in all but wincon (while telling them that they are just unseen) you could add an effect instead. For example: the unseen are X, Y and Z. If any of them are executed during the day or at night by the prince then you will be instantly converted.  (the target would be told all of this)

Hearing Evil Chat - This should simply not be used ever. It causes too many problems for the game.

Class reveals - The only reason I can see for someone being able to have a full class reveal is a BD class dedicated to lying (I have made a suggestion like this)</description>

            <p>With all of the talk around bringing back the noble (And the priest too I guess but mostly the noble.) I think this list needs more attention.Try and use the things in the ability’s that have not been used list or one’s that are used by classes that don’t anymore.</p>
<p>For example my current noble suggestion uses: Mason chat, Hidden whispers, Additional votes and Reading Whispers (not like maid spy.)</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for the ability suggestions! I recently made a class suggestion called “The Monk” (I’m new to this forum and Im not sure how to link my post, but it should be under recent posts), in it I also used a class reveal that only happens when you are hanged (similar to the hunter’s passive). I think class reveals would be okay in situations like that since people who want to avoid having their class revealed just have to be careful about accusing him.</p>
