This is a class I suggested a while back, But the game has changed so I wanted to see if this class still would be able to fit in the game. 

**Name - The Devil**
**_Faction - Neutral_**
**_Class - killer(NK)_**


**Win condition**: Kill all of the main factions.

**Passive 1 - Pure evil** - Night immune and occu immune

**Passive 2 - Back from Hell** - if you die then you will consume your living minions soul if you have one

**Day Ability 1 - Deep cut** - make a player bleed. The message sent to the player says that they will die in two days but because The Devil gave you a deep cut you will die in one day{2 uses}

**Day Ability 2 - A New Face -** Take a body from Hell allowing you to transform into any role for the night coming up and the next morning. 

_Ex. Picks Butler to become. The next morning he will be able to poison king and that night he will be able to occu someone. If you are checked the night you do this then you will appear as the faction you’ve picked that night_

**Night Ability 1 - Satins left hand** - convert a non unique class into a Neutral Minion. {Unlimited uses} {Max 1 minion at a time} {3 day cool down}

**Night Ability 2 - Depths of Hell** - catch a player on fire this night burning them alive. The fire is so big that the players next to him can smell the smoke of the fire. (Unlimited use)

_Ex. The Devil set 4 on fire. Players 3 and 5 will get a message saying that “you smelled smoke in the air” or “you see a big light coming from the other room”_

**Name - The Minion**
_**Faction - Neutral**_
_**Type - support**_ 

**Win condition:** Have the Devil win at all cost

**Passive 1 - evil runs in the family** - You will know who The Devil is and what he does at night

**Passive 2 - first come, first served** - if you’re the first Minion then you will have 2 “strait to Hell” uses. If not then you will have 1

**Day Ability 1 - call of arms** - join the Devil in his room tonight, allowing you to communicate with each other.{2 uses}

**Day Ability 2 - Slow learner** - make a player bleed, but it will take 3 days for them to bleed to death instead of 2. (The message to the player will say that you have 2 days to live){3uses}

**Night ability 1 - Strait to Hell** - You send the player that The Devil killed tonight strait to Hell. Making it so nobody will know what the players class was and you also steal their log, making it so you can read it when ever you want(Similar to the Nobles snoop Ability)

**Night ability 2 - taking the blame -** when you use this Ability then you will go and murder the player instead of the Devil.(The Devil will know when you do this action){2 uses}</description>
