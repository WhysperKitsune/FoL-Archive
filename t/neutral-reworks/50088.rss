    <description>All Neutral Reworks from the Master Rework of DOOM

NOTE: All Neutrals who complete their goals become convert immune. i.e. Scorned, Merchant, Thief, etc.

Converted Neutrals are purposefully stronger than Blue Dragon converts because Neutrals do not have to fight against the Unseen, but can choose to for a certain duration.

All Unseen share the same win-condition: to beat the Blue Dragon and any threatening Neutrals.

            <p>Well thought we were gonna make Jester a better convert because it’s true, a Fool is worse for BD than Unseen anyways, so there should be something to get from a player who has been spending all game trying to get themselves lynched and now has to try to not get lynched for the good of their new faction.</p>

            <p>Then we could move the passive onto the Jester, the Poor Fellow one, except it’s only for one day</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Give him a passive like the one that’s on Forsaken and Rogue, the one that doesn’t count as the maximum Unseen limit</p>
<p>Wait no nevermind, Poor Fellow should never be on Unseen or Cult classes</p>

            <p>What is your thought process on having Fool convertible? Making fool convertable is probably a nerf for Unseen tbh. I’d way rather have a Fool who can waste 2 days of BD’s time AND a slot for a decent convert AND be able to convert a BD to get one step closer to having majority over them than have a Jester, an incredibly mediochre convert.</p>
<p>Converting a fool is no fun for the fool who has been trying to get lynched all game, and is no fun for the Unseen who would way rather not have converted him and have a failed convert, so at least they can convert someone decent the next night and get rid of another BD via doing so.</p>

            <p>What is the point of the new neutrals you have added? This feels less of a re-work and more of a “hey whoa this would be cool let’s add this”. I don’t really see how the merchant or thief would change the meta in any useful way.</p>

            <p>Neutrals should have to stick to their goals. Only reason Merc is convertable is because it’s technically an “unseen contract”</p>

            <p>Why? Unconvertibles just restrict the number of targets, making it more likely for the Unseen/Cult just fail their conversion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Prince</li>
<li>King</li>
<li>Neutral Killers</li>
<li>People who have won</li>
</ul>

            <p>I personally wouldn’t prefer the Alchemist to be converted, but the thing is that I’m pretty sure Unseen and Cult win rates are quite low, due to not being able to convert Neutrals.</p>
