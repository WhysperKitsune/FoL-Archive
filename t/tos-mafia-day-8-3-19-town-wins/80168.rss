&gt; Your quiet life is rudely disturbed when the town is invaded by bad guys and you decide to use your skills to track every last one of them down!
&gt;
&gt; Every night you can investigate 1 town member to discover their role.
&gt; You will always be able to narrow it down to a few roles related to each other, but you won&#39;t be completely sure.
&gt; You may also discover that a certain character is the Framer. (But beware! If somebody is framed, they could look like anything to you, so be careful.)

&gt; You are a sharp eyed-individual that can recognize people from afar.
&gt; In the past people would pay you to watch over them to make sure that nobody would enter or leave their residence unnoticed.
&gt; However, since the Mafia invasion, you have decided to use your skills to help eliminate the Mafia.
&gt;
&gt; You may watch one person each night.
&gt; You will see who visits that person should someone visit.

&gt; 
&gt; You are this town&#39;s doctor and have kept everybody healthy for years.
&gt; 
&gt; You can visit one person each night. If they are attacked that night, you arrive just in time to save their life.
&gt; If your target is attacked, both you and your target will receive a message saying your target was attacked but healed.
&gt; You also have 1 self-heal, allowing you to instead save yourself if you are attacked.
You can only use the self-heal once, regardless of if you are attacked or not that night, so use it wisely.

&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Protective [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are a trained bodyguard, capable of throwing yourself into harm&#39;s way to save your client.
&gt;
&gt; Each night you can choose one player to protect.
&gt; If your target is attacked, both you and the attacker die instead.
&gt; If you successfully protect someone, you can&#39;t be saved from death.
&gt; Your counterattack ignores night immunity.
&gt; You also have 1 bulletproof vest. If somebody tries to attack you when you wear a bulletproof vest, they will receive a message saying that you were immune.

&gt; # **[Color=00BF00] Marshal [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Protective [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Once a figurehead of the law, you experienced a horrific accident and have vowed not to kill anymore. Instead, you decide to use your presence as a deterrent to these thugs that have rooted themselves in your hometown.
&gt;
&gt; Each night you may choose to follow a player. Your presence scares one malicious person from targeting them.
&gt; You will only be informed if you scare away a role who had killing intentions.
&gt; Should your target be visited by multiple people with malicious intent, only one will flee unless they have been scared by you in a prior night.
&gt; (Mafia Deception &gt; Witch/Escort/Consort &gt; Killing Roles)
&gt; Roles that use charges will still consume them upon being frightened off.

[details=&quot;Killing&quot;]

&gt; # **[Color=00BF00] Vigilante [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Killing [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You believe that the law of this town is useless against the evil-doers in your town and have decided to take matters into your own hands.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you may decide to shoot and kill one town member you believe to be evil.
&gt; However, if the person you shoot turns out to be Town, you will be overcome with grief and vow never to shoot again.
&gt; You only have 3 bullets, allowing you to perform your night action up to 3 times. Make them count.
&gt; 
&gt; You win with the **[Color=00BF00] Town [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill the **[Color=BF0000] Mafia [/Color]**

&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Killing [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;re a war-hardened soldier who is living out his retirement in the small and calm town of Salem.
&gt; But your retirement is short-lived, as people begin dying when the Mafia comes to town.
&gt; Luckily you still have your gun with you and you can use it to go on alert, killing anyone who comes to your house that night.
&gt; 
&gt; Going on alert makes you kill anybody who comes to your house that night, both evil and good, so use this power carefully or you will do more harm than good.
&gt; This can also kill people who are normally night immune, like the Godfather, Serial Killer, and Arsonist.
&gt; You are immune to attacks, douses, stalking, and any other harmful night actions while on alert.
&gt; You can go on alert only 3 times throughout the game.
&gt; You are immune to being roleblocked.
&gt; 
&gt; You win with the **[Color=00BF00] Town [/Color]**

&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Support [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are a powerful psychic who can communicate with the dead.
&gt; The dead cannot comprehend our speech, and we cannot comprehend theirs. That is where you come in - you are the translator in the middle!
&gt; 
&gt; At night, select a dead player, you will open a s√©ance with them allowing you to communicate to them.
&gt; Communication must be done through the moderator.
&gt; The only limit is that you may not explicitly or implicitly talk about other mediums or your identity.
&gt; The dead only have until the end of the Night Phase to answer you back and see all medium messages as a generic &quot;Medium&quot;.
&gt; Dead players being contacted by a Medium are still permitted to private message other dead players as well.
&gt; The dead may choose to outright deny you.
&gt;

&gt; # **[Color=00BF00] Escort [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=00BF00] Town Support [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are this town&#39;s escort, usually providing various pleasures in exchange for money.
&gt; But, now that evil people are overrunning this town, you decide to use your &quot;skills&quot; to help the town.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you can choose one player to visit.
&gt; You will spend the night with your target, who will be too busy to use their role that night, effectively roleblocking them.
&gt; Your target will be informed that they were roleblocked.
&gt; However, if the person you visit turns out to be a Serial Killer, you become the Serial Killer&#39;s target instead of their intended target.
&gt; You are immune to being roleblocked.

&gt; Your job is to move people, no questions asked.
&gt; Not only that but you are very good at it!
&gt; You swap two people during the night in the hopes of saving the lives of your fellow innocent town members.
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you may transport two people.
&gt; The two people will be notified that they were transported.

&gt; # **[Color=BF0000] Godfather [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=BF0000] Mafia Head [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are the lord of crime in this town and have decided that it belongs to the Mafia.
&gt; You try to achieve this by systematically killing off one of the citizens each night.
&gt; 
&gt; You are unkillable at night. If somebody tries to attack you, they will receive a message saying that you were immune.
&gt; As the leader of the Mafia every other member will report to you what happened to them each night
&gt; If you are interrogated by a Sheriff, you will appear to be &quot;Not Suspicious&quot;.
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.

&gt; # **[Color=BF0000] Caporegime [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=BF0000] Mafia Head [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; A trusted and loyal lieutenant to the influential Godfather. Not being a fan of the killing part, you instead prefer to read and book keep the mafia&#39;s earnings sending your goons to perform the will of the Mafia. For operations such as these, you push aside your disgust and instead remind the goons just why you&#39;re in charge around here.
&gt; 
&gt; You may target a member of your team at night, retraining them into another Mafia role of your choosing. The player who is being retrained is roleblocked even through immunity if the retraining succeeds. However, should you be retraining yourself this will be ignored.
&gt; Should this ability succeed then you must wait an additional night until you may retrain again.
&gt; You may not promote players into unique roles, even if they are already a unique role.
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.

[details=&quot;Tactical&quot;]

&gt; # **[Color=BF0000] Mafioso [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=BF0000] Mafia Tactical [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are a goon, following your Godfather&#39;s every command.
&gt; It&#39;s not all bad though, because when a higher placement opens up in the Mafia you&#39;ll be the first to take it.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you may choose 1 member of the Mafia to shadow. You will carry out their job that night on any target you wish.
&gt; You may only do this once per player in the Mafia.
&gt; Shadowing a Mafia Head role only grants you their specific passive(s). Night immunity is not applicable.
&gt; If a member of the Mafia dies you may permanently assume that role if you wish at any time.
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.
&gt; 
&gt; Your allies are [x] the [role], and [x] the [role].

&gt; **[Color=BF0000] Mafia Tactical [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone who knows you doesn&#39;t want anything to do with you, but typically it&#39;s too late by then. Heck, even among the Mafia you are given the cold shoulder. With a smile almost creepily plastered on your face all the time, you have an unhealthy obsession with your job more so than any other member, and that&#39;s just what the Godfather wanted. You are the Blackmailer.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you may visit a single player&#39;s house, you are informed of what roles also visit them.
&gt; Each day you can send three anonymous messages to any player. The player may send a message back if they wish.
&gt; Anonymous messages are limited to 200 characters.
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.

&gt; You were once an escort, giving away services to give your client&#39;s pleasure in exchange for money.
&gt; You hated it, however, and felt used every night.
&gt; Once the mafia came into town, you didn&#39;t hesitate one moment and managed to join them, offering to use your &quot;skills&quot; to distract townsfolk while each and every one of them was murdered.
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you can choose to target one player.
&gt; You&#39;ll distract them that night, roleblocking them.
&gt; Your target will be informed that they were roleblocked.
&gt; However, if the person you visit turns out to be a Serial Killer, you become the Serial Killer&#39;s target instead of their intended target.

&gt; **[Color=BF0000] Mafia Support [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You were a successful investigator in your early days. However, you quickly learned that playing fair doesn&#39;t pay and when the Godfather approached you and asked for you to join them, your choice was easy.
&gt; These days, you work as a Consigliere for the Mafia, figuring out what role every person plays in a town to help them make quick work of the towns they take over.
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you can choose to target one player.
&gt; You&#39;ll investigate them that night, finding out their exact role.

&gt; You were a brilliant Spy in your early days, one of the best in the country. However, on one mission you were captured - by the Godfather.
&gt; To your great surprise, he wanted to help you retire after all your years of service. The deal was simple. Use your talents to collect sensitive information from the townsfolk and he will rule to grant you whatever you want in this silly little town.
&gt; 
&gt; You can choose one player to spy on during the day. You will be informed if this player visits others at night.
&gt; Each night you also can plant a bug on a person. The bug will allow you to see who they visit that night, or if they do at all.
&gt; As well the bug will inform you what feedback they receive at the end of the night.
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.

&gt; You can clean a crime scene, hiding the role of somebody who died that night.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you can choose to clean a player. If that player dies that night, their role won&#39;t be revealed to the town upon death. However, you WILL see what their role is.
&gt; Their last will will also be revealed to you and hidden from the rest of the town.
&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter who kills your target or what side your target is on, the only thing that matters is that they die that night for your skill to work.
&gt; If your target doesn&#39;t die, it will still use up one of your cleanings.
&gt; You can only choose to clean a target 3 times during the entire game.

&gt; You are the Prankster, who once filled his days pranking others with elaborate jokes. One time, you managed to make somebody believe that his entire family was murdered. Geez, the look on his face when you told him he was pranked!
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you can choose to target 1 player.
&gt; Your target&#39;s real night results will be replaced with a false night result of your choosing.
&gt; The effect you choose will not actually be done; For example, an investigator pranked into thinking he was roleblocked will still receive night results with clues as to which role his target was. However, he will not know for sure if he slept peacefully.
&gt; If you are controlled by a witch, you will make your target think they &quot;slept peacefully.&quot;
&gt; You can communicate with your allies for as long as they are alive.
&gt; 
&gt; Your allies are [x] the [role], and [x] the [role].
&gt; 
&gt; You win with the **[Color=BF0000] Mafia [/Color]**
&gt; You win with **[Color=804080] Witches [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill the **[Color=00BF00] Town [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill **[Color=FF8000] Arsonists [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill **[Color=0040FF] Serial Killers [/Color]**

&gt; # **[Color=804080] Witch [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=AAAAAA] Neutral Evil [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You hate these townsfolk. Every last one of them. They act like witches are evil, not realizing the great things your magic can do.
&gt; You&#39;ll show them, you&#39;ll show them all how powerful your magic is! They&#39;ll pay for forcing you to hide like this!
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you can choose somebody to control and somebody who you want your controlled player to use their ability on.
&gt; You won&#39;t be informed of the end result of your controlling or even if the one you controlled had an ability to use at all!
&gt; You&#39;ll have to pay close attention to learn people&#39;s abilities and use them to make the townsfolk suffer.
&gt; Your expertise in magic also taught you defensive spells. You have perfected a magical immunity shield, which shrouds your body.
&gt; It will discharge the instant you are attacked without protection. The shield will only work against gunshots, stabbings, and dousing.
&gt; Once the shield has discharged these attacks will harm you, like any other non-magic user.
&gt; The attacker will only know of your immunity to their attack. The Veteran and Jailor are immune to this shield.
&gt; You are immune to being roleblocked.
&gt; 
&gt; You win with the **[Color=BF0000] Mafia [/Color]**
&gt; You win with **[Color=FF8000] Arsonists [/Color]**

[details=&quot;Neutral Killing&quot;]

&gt; # **[Color=0040FF] Serial Killer [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=AAAAAA] Neutral Killing [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You are nuts! Psychotic! Crazy! Mental! Insane! Over the edge! Uncontrollable! Irrational!
&gt; You were once in an asylum, in solitary confinement for first-degree murder. Recently released, you have emerged with a new look at life: not to kill just anybody, but to kill everybody!
&gt; Your thirst for blood and murder will never be satisfied and although the Godfather approached you, you declined and said that you will kill the Mafia too!
&gt; 
&gt; Every night you may kill one person.
&gt; You are unkillable at night. If somebody tries to attack you, they will receive a message saying that you were immune.
&gt; If someone tries to roleblock you, you will attack them instead of your chosen target.
&gt; You win if it is just you and the Godfather remaining.
&gt; 
&gt; You win with **[Color=804080] Witches [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill the **[Color=BF0000] Mafia [/Color]**
&gt; You must kill the **[Color=00BF00] Town [/Color]**

&gt; # **[Color=FF8000] Arsonist [/Color]**
&gt; **[Color=AAAAAA] Neutral Killing [/Color]**
&gt; 
&gt; You love fire.
&gt; You love the smell of fire, the sight of fire, and nothing makes you feel better than watching houses burn and seeing and hearing those inside panic and die.
&gt; You care for no one but yourself and nothing would make you happier than watching everyone burn.
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you may douse one player or ignite all of your doused targets.
&gt; If you are doused by another Arsonist, you may wait a night to clean the gasoline off of yourself.
&gt; Your method of killing ignores night immunity.
&gt; You cover up your tracks very well and you will appear as &#39;not suspicious&#39; to a Sheriff.
&gt; You are unkillable at night. If somebody tries to attack you, they will receive a message saying that you were immune.
&gt; You win if only you and the Godfather remain.
&gt;

# Gameplay

- There is a Day 1 Lynch.

- Days are 72 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Lynches are majority and plurality. In case of a tie, the lynch will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.

- The Mafia has an optional factional kill each night.

- The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.
