    <title>Class suggestion (Peace Keeper poll)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-peace-keeper-poll/72809</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I want bring back the PK. The PK is a neut class that i made a while ago and people seemed interested in it. Some people even made their own suggestions for PK, as you can see below. I want to see what everyone thinks of this class and if you have any suggestions please write below. If you want to make your own PK suggestion message me or write below again and ill add it to the list.


[details=&quot;PK option 1 (NOBLE1)&quot;]  
**Faction - Neutral** 
**Class - offensive**              

&gt;**Faction - Neutral**
**Class - offensive**

&gt;**Lore**: As this silly war grew, the peace keeper felt sick. After losing his son because of the war he decides to only trust them who are Neutral in the war. Maybe they could help end this… or if all else fails the NK could get rid of them all.

&gt;**Passive 1:**
_**Little hope**_ - on days where no one die, you gain death immunity that night.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2** 
_**Grim Determination**_ (Passive) - You are immune to occupation, redirection and target changing. Suggestion from @ShadowKnight 

&gt;**Day Ability 1:**
_**Privite matters**_ - All whispers to and from you will be hidden from the public. _(3 uses) [same as mystic]_ 
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability 2:**
**_Stolen potions_** - make yourself immune to death tonight. (2 uses)

&gt;**Night ability 1:**
_**Showing your true colors**_ - pick a player, if they are neutral then know which class they are 
_(Unlimited uses)_ 
&gt;
&gt; _Ex. ([Player name] is not neutral) or ([player name] is a **Neutral!** They are a **Sellsword**!_ 

&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2:**
_**Stand Guard**_ - Prevent others from visiting your target. You can not target the same player two nights in a row. Will not notify anyone on protection. _(unlimited uses) [same as merc]_

&gt;**Win condition** -  Find a neutral player and help them achieve their goal. **_(You can only win if you have found them with your night ability first)_** [if you find multiple neutrals with your night ability then helping 1 of them achieve their goal will count as a win towards you]
[/details]



[details=&quot;PK option 2 (ShadowKnight)&quot;]
Below is @ShadowKnight suggestion for PK. I really like the idea so I’m showing his suggestion for it below. Remember this is from @ShadowKnight not from me. 
  
Ashen Communion (Passive) - At the start of every day, you will receive information about the Neutral players in the game.

Grim Determination (Passive) - You are immune to occupation, redirection and target changing.

Peace Offering (Day) - [Unavailable before Day 3]. Choose a Neutral player other than the Neutral Killer. Tonight, they will receive an offer to change their goal to be the same as yours. If they agree, they will gain one use of Emerald Potion. Once a Neutral has accepted the Offering or has refused it twice, you can no longer use it on that player. - Infinite uses.

Gray Veils (Day) - All Neutral players will detect as Blue Dragon tonight. - 2 uses.

Unbreakable Peace (Night) - Visit a player. If they are Neutral, they will be healed and protected from negative effects. If they are not, they will be occupied. - Infinite uses.

Conspire (Night) - [Unavailable before Night 3]. Create a group chat among all Neutral players that share the same goal as you. - 5 uses.

Goal: See all non-neutral factions defeated.

Notes: Ashen Communion reveals the following information:

Start of Day 1: How many neutrals are currently in the game.
Start of Day 2: What neutral classes are currently in the game.
Start of Day 3 onwards: What neutral classes are currently in the game and what number of player corresponds to each.

Edit: Yes, Peace Offering can grant a one-use Emerald Potion to classes like Fool, Scorned and the like. Conspire automatically includes both the Peace Keeper and the Neutral Killer, as their goals are naturally aligned, then adds all neutrals that accepted the Peace Offering 
[/details]

[details=&quot;PK option 3 (ShadowKnight)&quot;]  
*Goal: See a Neutral player you have bonded with achieve their goal.*

So the class abilities are:

**Ashen Communion (Passive) -**  At the start of every day, you will know the identity and class of a Neutral player in the game other than you (the Neutral Killer will always be the last Neutral you will know of).

**Grim Determination (Passive) -**  You are immune to occupation, redirection and target changing.

**Peace Bond (Day)**  - [Unavailable on Day 1] You will bind yourself to a target Neutral player revealed to you by Ashen Communion. While bound to that player, any whispers from them to you or viceversa will be hidden from the public. You may only be bound to one Neutral player at a time.- Infinite uses.

**Gray Veils (Day)**  - All Neutral players will detect as Blue Dragon tonight. - 2 uses.

**Unbreakable Peace (Night)**  - Visit a player. If they are Neutral, they will be healed and protected from negative effects. If they are not, they will be occupied. - Infinite uses.

**Conspire (Night)**  - [Unavailable before Night 2]. Create a group chat between yourself, a player you have bonded with and target Neutral player revealed to you by Ashen Communion. - 5 uses.

You can end up being pro-BD if you stay bonded to a Merc/Inq, you can be anti-BD if you bond with the Sellsword or NK, or you can be true neutral if you bond with Alch/Fool/Scorned.
[/details]

[details=&quot;PK option 4 (Alice)&quot;] 
&gt; you can be true neutral if you bond with Alch/Fool/Scorned.

Fools and Scorneds are by nature anti-BD. If the Fool wins then the court ends up wasting a day to execute him and then one or two more days because of his passive. The only ones that benefit from less executions are evils. The Scorned basically needs to get a member of the Blue Dragon executed for them to win, and which faction benefits from this the most should be obvious.

Anyway, here’s my review on that PK’s iteration.

1. I’d make Ashen Communion a bit more conditional and less specific. Here’s my version of it.

&gt; Ashen Communion (Passive) - At the start of the game, you will know the identity of all non-NK neutral players. If the NK remains the last neutral alive while you have still not won, then their identity will be revealed to you.

The current Ashen Communion is terrible as it has no counterplay against competing neutrals. If there’s an Inquisitor and a Sorcerer on the same game then you just need to survive a few days in and it’ll be guaranteed an instant victory. This also applies to other pro-BD/anti-BD neutrals in general such as the Mercenary vs. the Scorned or whatnot. To prevent this then the class should be hidden and the NK should not be revealed unless they’re the last neutral in the match.

2. Added three nights of night immunity to Grim Determination.

&gt; Grim Determination (Passive) - You are immune to occupation, redirection and target changing. You are immune to death at night until past the third night.

There’s a reason why almost all neutrals have some form of night immunity in their kit. The fact that they’re only one person means that they need some enhanced form of survival against night kills.

3. The bond needs to be made until death and switchable.

&gt; Peace Bond (Day) - [Unavailable on Day 1] You will bind yourself to a target player provided they are not aligned to either major factions. While bound to that player, any whispers from them to you or viceversa will be hidden from the public. You may only be bound to one Neutral player at a time and you will only be unbound on their death.- Infinite uses.

In short, this should prevent the PK from bailing out or switching just the right time as another non-bound neutral would win. This ability has auto-confirmation, but since the PK would fall under scum due to their victory conditions then that shouldn’t matter.

4. This ability is kind of pointless as it is. Observer Peeks are rare and it’s counterproductive to use this if your target’s a Fool, so I’m proposing a different versioned tailored specifically to each Neutral.

&gt; Gray Veils (Day) - Every Neutral gains a bonus depending on their class. - 2 uses.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; * The Fool will gain both have themselves framed and gain night immunity in the coming night.
&gt; * The Scorned will have both their targets framed in the coming night.
&gt; * The Alchemist will be automatically pardoned if they are on trial. Cannot be pardoned twice in a row.
&gt; * The Mercenary and Sellsword will be immune to death in the coming night.
&gt; * The Inquisitor’s investigative abilities will bypass the Sorcerer’s framing in the coming night…
&gt; * The Possessor, the Reaper, and the Sorcerer will have all visits to them prevented in the coming night.

In short, this ability is now several times more useful as faction checks are extremely rare.

5. This ability’s somewhat wonky. On one hand, infinite use healing makes non-immune neutrals a bit strong while healing immune neutrals is a bit useless except for Bleeding/Poison/OE. Plus, there’s no need to randomly occupy players when you can heal you target due to your wincon.

&gt; Unbreakable Peace (Night) - Visit a player. If they are Neutral, they will be healed and protected from negative effects. If your target is immune for this night, then the ability cost is refunded. - 4 uses.

This should balance out different cases where your target has a ton of night immunity such as the Scorned or no night immunity at all such as a Mercenary.

6. Changed to infinite uses.

&gt; Conspire (Night) - [Unavailable before Night 2]. Create a group chat between yourself and a bonded player. - Infinite uses
