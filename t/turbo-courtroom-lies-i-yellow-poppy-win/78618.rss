            <p>i’d say they can get into 3 but they hover more around 1.5-2.5 bc sometimes they do stupid things from their overconfidence but they’re generally on track and know what they’re doing, but probs hover more around 2-2.5 (if they don’t let their emotions control their play)</p>
<p>haven’t seen math in a long while tho</p>

            <p>Dat got redchecked N1 and everyone basically believed it but Alice (who was Prince fakeclaiming Princess) convinced us that Lymphoma was Mastermind, and Lymphoma being himself lowkey gamethrew resulting in his mislynch. We’d come up with a plan where Possessed the Drunk claim would HH Dat while HTM shot him (HTM was Archer), but Possessed was actually Fool so he obviously did not in fact occupy Datbird, and Kape guarded Dat so he survived. Scum, having missed their N1 convert, attempted to convert Alice N2, meaning they were going into D3 with no convert; Eevee the NK had claimed Prince and got jailexe’d N2. Also, we’d massclaimed so Dat was able to kill both TK’s.</p>
<p>Everyone was very suspicious of Alice as Mastermind the next day and she wound up having to out herself, at which point Kape grand trialed her, and since King vote counted for two him + Maxwell + Dat + Possessed the Fool were able to mislynch her; it basically turned into a race of whether town or scum could vote faster.</p>
