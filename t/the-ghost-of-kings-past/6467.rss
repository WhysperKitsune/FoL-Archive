Now the question is,
![image|468x106](upload://llUG4C3StfgIjkmjxtsv9l4vHKQ.png)

Could this mysterious specturious figure be the figure of a king long since passed? Disappointed in what his court, his very kingdom has become? With treachery around every corner, is his goal to set things right..?

Post your ideas on what this may be below! I want to hear YOUR theories!
------------------------

Oh, and in addition- ![image|523x500](upload://iQST3Z5lmiYZBDGUNP2nDKHrwUI.jpg)
These two souls, reaped perhaps? Perhaps the king was reaped and his soul was thus trapped in limbo.. Anyways.. let me know what you think!</description>
