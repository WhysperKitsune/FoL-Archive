    <title>Observer follow incorrect feedback</title>

    <description>#### What happened?

I was an observer in an unseen game with no classes that could change results (no Illusionist, Aristocrat, Scorned) and got incorrect results from following a player.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I should have seen that player 16 visited 10, not 14 which he was swapped away from.

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. Observer [9] follows Physician [16]
2. Physician [16] heals Physician [14]
3. Court Wizard [10] swaps himself and Physician [14]

&gt; Observer [9] results:

&gt; Physician [16] results:
