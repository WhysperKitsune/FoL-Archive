            <p>this setup is super swingy being a 9p with a PR</p>
<p>especially because this PR gets much better when 1 maf has died</p>
<p>the watcher and jailkeep both become better and a cop hitting a maf is just a GG</p>
<p>scum has a super low chance of winning if it’s d2 with 1 scum 5vt and 1 joat left</p>
<p>scum has a really good chance of winning if it’s 2 scum and 5 vt left</p>

<p>I think lynching Arete woulda increased the chances of happening but I dont know… but it would just give wolves another reason to push on me.</p>
<p>I don’t think TBE woulda voted me though. Gorta (who said he believed it was TvS) and orangelit (who townread Arete) may or may not have.</p>
<p>Hydras benefit town more than scum because town has an extra way to read hydras (allows players to read, is the hydra acting like town masons or wolf partners).</p>

            <p>arguably the chance of playing bad is decreased when you have a partner to call you out on bad moves/help others see eye to eye with you</p>
<p>And yeah I completely agree that games should be either entirely hydras or no hydras to avoid lopsided engagements like that, I thought it was all hydras when I agreed to partner with sulit tbh</p>

<p>as one of the non-hydras</p>
<p>I disagree</p>
<p>maybe because we lynched every single non hydra in a row but anyone with a hydra seems to have an a bit of an edge</p>
