    <title>I think its a bug but im not sure</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-think-its-a-bug-but-im-not-sure/8203</link>
    <description>We were 4 players left:
Me, psychic
priest
reaped assasian
reaper

I were trying to use psychic ability and force assasian to accuse reaper and it didn&#39;t work

1) if its because he is reaped, then why can&#39;t we just accuse the reaper if we have majority
2)what does this force accuse even worth if not in those situations?</description>
