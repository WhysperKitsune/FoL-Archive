    <title>Merc is no longer playing the thrones of lies game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/merc-is-no-longer-playing-the-thrones-of-lies-game/59867</link>
    <description>So the merc no longer play the game:

**1.** His contract  can&#39;t tell him what he is, because 2 reasons:
**a.** he can&#39;t know if he is really his merc.
**b.** nobles
 so the merc doesnt know if he is evil/good

**2.** The merc doesn&#39;t even care that much if his contract die anymore,

**Please revert the merc changes.** 
**1.**Make him unable to contract prince as his second contract, 
**2.** make him confirmeable by his target only (and not the whole court who could vote him up and let him force pardon.
**3.** make wishpers between merc and his contract private
 The current merc is not fun to play and the game supposed to be fun.</description>

<p>He would only be confirmed to his target though.  That’s not impossible to fake claim, just harder.  And mercenaries should be confirmed to their target.</p>

            <p>I haven’t had these issues with playing mercenary in the recent patches. If your contract stays silent, that has in almost all cases meant he was scum to me. Signaling that you are his mercenary, helps the evil faction enough in the fact that they won’t attack/convert you and that they can count on your vote for majority. Simultaneously, you know you should probably execute that obvious fool or make suboptimal BD plays if you have a silent contract. If your contract is active, there is no problem according to you.</p>
<p>Throne of Lies is not only finding out other people’s classes. It is also about convincing them that you are a certain class like for instance Mercenary.</p>

            <p>This is really not that different from how neutral king used to work. You also did not choose a side until later in the game. Your contract will eventually pull you in. Letting the Mercenary know the contract’s class makes him 100% confirmable, which he simply does not need. If the contract dies, the mercenary’s alignment is a 100% revealed to everyone and he loses all ways to protect himself at night, so he definitely does care if his contract dies. If his contract dies, he will typically follow very soon after.</p>

            <p>Also, I just wanted to add that “throwing your contract” under the bus is not a good strategy because your contract might say you got converted. So i don’t understand why the changed were done in the first place.</p>

            <p>So the merc no longer play the game:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> His contract  can’t tell him what he is, because 2 reasons:<br>
<strong>a.</strong> he can’t know if he is really his merc.<br>
<strong>b.</strong> nobles<br>
so the merc doesnt know if he is evil/good</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The merc doesn’t even care that much if his contract die anymore,</p>
<p><strong>Please revert the merc changes.</strong><br>
**1.**Make him unable to contract prince as his second contract,<br>
<strong>2.</strong> make him confirmeable by his target only (and not the whole court who could vote him up and let him force pardon.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> make wishpers between merc and his contract private<br>
The current merc is not fun to play and the game supposed to be fun.</p>
