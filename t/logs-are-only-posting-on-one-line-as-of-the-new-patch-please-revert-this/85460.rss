    <title>Logs are only posting on one line as of the new patch - please revert this</title>

    <description>As of the new patch, when you copy/paste logs it pastes only on one line, as opposed to multiple lines. For example, before this patch you could post these logs (below) and they would appear as you see them here
John Smith - Physician 
N1 - Heal 3 | DNR
N2 - Heal 4 | DNR

But with this new patch, logs are posting on only one line. So the above logs would appear as:
John Smith - Physician N1 - Heal 3 | DNR N2 - Heal 4 | DNR

Logs appearing on only one line is extremely annoying, it makes other peoples logs hard to read if they post them in full, likewise, people are less likely to understand logs that you post. 

Please revert log posting to the former example.</description>
