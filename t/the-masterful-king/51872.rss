            <p>while the cult does not need it<br>
the unseen might need it.</p>
<p>this is because the cl can setup for king, and another cult will become king, except if there is not cult leader.<br>

<p>I don’t that it should be able to die from BD classes because all kings can’t die from BD classes, like what are the chances a hunter is gonna try to attack a king? Also i think it should be able to die of butler poison</p>

<p>this one is too op, something like unseen/cult guards would be better imo or just give it 1 use</p>
<p>Edit: btw I liked secret conversation more than luck, also I liked the royal conversion more than the royal party</p>
