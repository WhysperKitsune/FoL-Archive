    <title>Evil King sees MM as Unseen before N4</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/evil-king-sees-mm-as-unseen-before-n4/25244</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I played Evil King. N3 I checked a player and he appeard to be Unseen. We executed him D4 and that was MM.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
&quot;Allies&quot; ability should be equal for all types of Kings, so before N4 MM should appear as BD for all types of Kings.

#### Steps to reproduce:

#### Comments:
First 3 days is a period when Observers often follow King and people ask King to check someone concrete (in last game psy linked me and asked to check 1). If you are Evil King you are forced to sometimes out Unseen if you checked him because othewise you become very suspicious and then are easily executed. You actually can afford sometimes to out Assasin or someone converted because MM can convert again. But you can&#39;t afford to out MM, because it&#39;s too critical for Unseen. That&#39;s why Evil King must see MM as BD in first 3 nights. Because otherwise you can never out any Unseen as Evil King and that makes you autoexecuted at D4-D6. If you out Unseen in D2-D4, he is immediately executed and if it&#39;s MM than everyone also understands that your are Evil King because you see MM as Unseen in first 3 nights.</description>

            <p>I thought this was a feature. It would make more sense to make him come out as unseen rather than bd. I wonder what the interactions are for cults brotherhood ability and duchess’ wisp with the kings allies ability. Maybe make it consistent with what happens with those other abilities.</p>

            <p>I hadn’t realized the scorned was limited to only framing its targets but that makes sense, and it must have been a result of a redirect (I’m quite sure re: the Scorned-&gt;MM part). There is another potential edge case, where both OG MM and Assassin are killed before d4 and so a converted BD scorned target becomes MM, but I doubt that’s what OP ran into.</p>

            <p>That’s correct as something only Drunk or Court Wizard can do.</p>
<p>So maybe the OP haven’t thought of this detail about redirecting the abilities elsewhere, yes I can see that the tornado’ed Scorned is responsible and it’s not a bug.</p>

<p>This is only possible if the Scorned was redirected. Otherwise, the Mastermind is never the Scorned’s target so he can’t be framed.</p>

            <p>Hmm… I feel it should maybe tell the Evil King the MM is the MM, not show them as Blue Dragon.</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played Evil King. N3 I checked a player and he appeard to be Unseen. We executed him D4 and that was MM.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>“Allies” ability should be equal for all types of Kings, so before N4 MM should appear as BD for all types of Kings.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>First 3 days is a period when Observers often follow King and people ask King to check someone concrete (in last game psy linked me and asked to check 1). If you are Evil King you are forced to sometimes out Unseen if you checked him because othewise you become very suspicious and then are easily executed. You actually can afford sometimes to out Assasin or someone converted because MM can convert again. But you can’t afford to out MM, because it’s too critical for Unseen. That’s why Evil King must see MM as BD in first 3 nights. Because otherwise you can never out any Unseen as Evil King and that makes you autoexecuted at D4-D6. If you out Unseen in D2-D4, he is immediately executed and if it’s MM than everyone also understands that your are Evil King because you see MM as Unseen in first 3 nights.</p>
