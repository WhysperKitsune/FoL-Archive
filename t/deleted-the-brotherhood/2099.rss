<blockquote>
<p>Player’s only have allegiance to them self. Thus, game throwing is doing something that you know will cause yourself to lose, not your faction.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is false – <strong>NEUTRAL</strong> players only have allegiance to themselves. Not Blue Dragon, where your allegiance is to your faction. This goes against both your objective and lore. If you are a Noble and caught doing this, you will likely be hit with a banhammer for gamethrowing, so I urge you not to ~</p>
<p>However, if you are <strong>neutral</strong> and want to be converted, go for it – that’s perfectly acceptable.</p>

            <p>there will be no exception<br>
“I choose to join this evil faction” is gamethrowing<br>
it just is<br>
this will NEVER change<br>
gamethrowing has no exceptions<br>
you are either blatantly throwing the game or you are not<br>
there is no grey area<br>
there is no middle ground<br>
leaving the BD for the evil team is GAMETHROWING and it will remain that way for the rest of the game’s life</p>

<p>Actually, if the Nobles are asking/trying to be converted, that is game-throwing, because they’re hurting their factions chances at winning/survival. This was heavily discussed. As long as you’re in Blue Dragon, you must always be Pro-Blue Dragon. You can’t go around being like “Hey, could you convert me?”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Clearly, if the brotherhood is added into the game, this rule would be given an exception. The game is in alpha; thus the rules are open to change.</p>

</aside>
<p>Okay, let me rephrase. Only one of the brotherhoods can be in the game; I do not necessarily think mine is superior, I am merely adding an idea to the mix of ideas that is the forums. It is better to provide people without multiple paths for the game and allow them to show interest in one over the other rather than just have one idea for everything.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, if the Nobles are asking/trying to be converted, that is game-throwing, because they’re hurting their factions chances at winning/survival. This was heavily discussed. As long as you’re in Blue Dragon, you must always be Pro-Blue Dragon. You can’t go around being like “Hey, could you convert me?”</p>

<p>False<br>
Gamethrowing is going against the win condition of your faction<br>
Asking “convert me convert me” in the chat is classed as gamethrowing</p>

<p>explain to me how this isn’t gamethrowing</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you really need an explanation, think of it this way: Player’s only have allegiance to them self. Thus, game throwing is doing something that you know will cause <strong>yourself</strong> to lose, not your faction. For example, it is not game throwing for the nobles to try and get converted, as the cult/unseen is significantly stronger with the nobles, and thus the noble might believe they have increased chances of winning if they attempt to get converted.</p>
