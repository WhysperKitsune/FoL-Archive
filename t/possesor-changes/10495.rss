    <title>Possesor Changes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possesor-changes/10495</link>
    <description>There is an issue with the possessor that is pretty horrific to play .

When you jump body you pretty much die next turn because some guy at dead fm is all salty about losing his body . Then either the psychic or a death night out you and its all over .

so the only way to use this is to 

A )hope physicians and psychic die before you have to jump or physicians have already ressed 
B) don&#39;t use the ability :frowning:

My suggestion to combat this would be to not allow the possessed player to speak when he is dead and the possessor still has his body . ( also disable any disconnect messages)</description>

            <p>That is true, but that’s a risk he choses to take when he jumps, and maybe not fully but at least partially thats a risk every MM and cult leader takes every time they convert someone. To some degree that’s already the case with the possesor now, he’s taking the risk that his victim hasn’t had any private conversations with anyone, and that there’s no physician or psychic still holding their capabilities. The possesor choses who to jump to, he can make some assesment or guess of their capabilities beforehand.</p>
<p>with this adjustment, the persons knowledge works for him, rather than against him. Right now he’s best jumping into someone who seems to have done no communication or help, because every whisper that they did, could be an auto identifyer towards him.</p>

            <p>Then the problem is that the possessor trusts their win to someone else.</p>

            <p>Here’s an interesting side option… what if possesion was a form of conversion. When the possesor jumps, he does not take over the body, but changes them to a possesor.</p>
<p>The origional host still controls his body, the possesor however does not go to the dead chat, but stays as an extra chat tab for the possesed.</p>
<p>This not only eliminates the possesed ratting out to a psychic/death knight, but it simultaniously kills any safe-words/code words or even personality changes.</p>
<p>The possesed person is no longer a dead bitter enemy that knows who the possesor is, and instead is a live ally, with effectively pooled knowledge with the original possessor, who is now a voice in his/her head.</p>

            <p>luxx your solution isn’t really that appealing . It pretty much is that at the moment and its how its played , I never jump unless I am almost guaranteed to go down the next day . As it is its nearly pointless having the ability .</p>

            <p>There was the problem with the Priest. The dead guy would say “Oh Poss is in my Body now, I’m [1-16].” You are immune at night, Death Night can’t get you. Psychic once dead cannot be useful.</p>
