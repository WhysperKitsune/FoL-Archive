    <description>Let&#39;s assume 15 players.
King, 8 Blue Dragon, 2 deadly neutrals, 2 other Neutrals, 2 Black Rose.
Day 2:King, 4 Blue Dragon, 2 deadly Neutrals,2 other Neutrals, 3 Black Rose.(Worst case)(Nightshade)
Terrible idea.
King, 8 Blue Dragon, 1 deadly Neutral, 2 other Neutrals, 3 Black Rose(1 already converted role)
Day2:King, 5 Blue Dragon, 1 deadly Neutral, 2 other Neutrals, 3 Black Rose(Worst case)(Nightshade)
Also terrible.
King, 10 Blue Dragon, 1 deadly Neutral, 1 other Neutral, 2 Black Rose.
Day2:King, 6 Blue Dragon, 1 deadly Neutral, 1 other Neutral, 3 Black Rose(Worst case)( Nightshade spent)
Now assume that King is Black Rose. Blue Dragon is dead even then.
How to balance **this**?
King, 11 Blue Dragon, 1 other Neutral, 2 Black Rose.
Day2: King, 8 Blue Dragon, 2 other Neutral, 3 Black Rose(Worst case of enemy sucess. Nightshade spent) Assuming King as evil, that is already 8v6, so this might be the only remotely balanced 15 player situation. 
Conclusion: There really need to be more than 15 players if you want deadly Neutrals to spawn.</description>

            <p>16-player Mafia is the future. Why ToL has chosen 15 I really don’t know.</p>
<p>Plus that way it’s 15 plus the King.</p>

            <p>OFC. But that doesn’t mean that alpha should start with things that are extremely likely NOT balanced.<br>
It should start with a framework that has a good chance to be balanced.<br>
It is extremely obvious that there is something problematic here. Even if you go for the average, you’ll see that a Killing neutral is just not balancable with 15 players. And to see that, you don’t need to play it if it is that obvious.</p>
