    <title>Patch v2.6.1 - Class fixes (oh, so many)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/patch-v2-6-1-class-fixes-oh-so-many/81687</link>
    <description>## v2.6.0-Specific Fixes (Regression)

* Fixed Scout/Imprison/Blood of Mithras that become un-cancelable. This was partially a general fix, so others may have also been fixed.
* Butler&#39;s *Poisoned Wine* abil now works vs starting King.
* Fixed *Eradicate* abil icon that was too bright at the bottom-right, hiding the # of charges.
* Tweaked some other icons to be darker at the bottom-right.
* Fixed the visual text bug that was showing `You healed {Target1PName} last night.`

## Live Fixes
* Fixed the ability spam exploits for 0-target abilities.
* Fixed *Debauchery* and *Strings of Mithras* redirect abils from showing 0 feedback when an active ability **with 0 target panels** (like *Bear Companion*) is used.
* Fixed *Spectator Mode* for private rooms.
* Fixed some healing DNR&lt;&gt;CNH feedback, such as Heal on a 2nd-night *Reaped* target that was showing DNR instead of CNH.
* Inquisitor should no longer win when dead before all the Heathen&#39;s.
* *Matchmake* abil should no longer initially target herself when also a Heathen.
* Fixed all forms of *Safeguard* that was randomly causing temporary death immunity @ night to NOT sync (so the ability wouldn&#39;t do anything).
* Fixed *Suicide* abil inconsistencies.
* Dying during the day will now properly show the death status icon (skull) and remove other status icons.
* Fixed dev/backer/tutorial post-execution sfx for body landing (x3).
* Transferring deaths via *Distort Reality* abil will now remove the &quot;delayed death&quot; status icon.
* Tutorial &quot;Lacerate&quot; abil will now show the correct # of charges.

___________

## [color=lime]v2.6.1a[/color]

* Fixed missing icons for *Prying Servants* , *Spike Traps* , *Rewind* and *Follow* abils.
* ~~*Matchmake* abil&#39;s initial target now has a better anti-King check.~~ (Didn&#39;t seem to be what was causing the issue. I&#39;ll have a new hotfix soon)

## Dev Notes

This is a big game with over 50 classes and roughly 150 abilities - even with the help of local testing (I test with 3 computers) and test realm (avg 8 players over 1~2 hours per session), new bugs are inevitable since we cannot possibly test all scenarios (and building unit testers would occupy me for months since the code isn&#39;t optimized for testers). 

That said, sometimes bugs simply cannot be found until pushed live due to a lack of data from `150!` combos (that&#39;s `100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000` potential combos). 

Bare with me~ seeing a new bug will *never* mean we introduced more than we fixed.
