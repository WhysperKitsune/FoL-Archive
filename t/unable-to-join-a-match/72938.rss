    <title>Unable to join a match</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/unable-to-join-a-match/72938</link>
    <description>What happened: The &#39;reconnect&#39; button replaces the play button. When pressed, sends player to an endless loading screen.

What was SUPPOSED to happen: The menu screen works as normal. When a game ends, the reconnect button disabled.

Steps to reproduce this issue: [Unknown and unconfirmed]

How it happened:

1. Joined a public match
2. Game took longer than normal to start
3. Game started to rapidly rotate (far faster than normal) while stacking player models on top of each other [chat did not work either]
4. At the beginning of the first night, the normal room was instead a changed perspective of the normal night, with a grayer tone. 
5. Game proceeded to continue part 3 until I left the game. 
6. Attempting to join another game led to what is written down in the &#39;what happened&#39; section.

Letting this be known, this is a **game-breaking** bug.</description>
