<p>“Why did you want me to meet you here?” asked Amelia, as she stared at the flickering flame of her candle.</p>
<p>Jgoes glanced down the hallway. “Come inside,” they said, beckoning her inside.</p>
<p>Amelia followed them into their room. Inside stood her friend, her hood pulled back for the time being. “Hello, Amelia,” she said, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>“Um, hi,” said Amelia. “Why am I … here.”</p>
<p>Jgoes sat down on their bed, folding their hands in their lap and bowing their head. “Amelia, we – I – need your help,” they said.</p>
<p>Amelia looked back and forth between the two of them. “What’s happening?”</p>
<p>Amelia’s friend bit her lip. “Jgoes here needs to get out of the castle, and there aren’t very many people we can conceivably ask for help,” she said. “To be clear, they’re not – they’re not involved with any of the conspiracies, but --”</p>
<p>“But I helped pass messages containing ‘rebellious sentiments’ between the castle and the rest of the kingdom,” said Jgoes, “and the laws don’t make a distinction between committing treason by killing the King and committing treason by letting people speak their mind.”</p>
<p>Amelia frowned. “What do you need me to do?” she asked. “I – Jgoes you know I care about you – but I’m not going to kill someone --”</p>
<p>Amelia’s friend shook her head. “There are enough deaths in this castle without your intervention,” she said. “Besides, I wouldn’t ask you to bear that on your conscience.” She paused. “Just – if you can distract people for long enough that Jgoes can get past the guards, that’s all we need.”</p>
<p>Amelia looked at Jgoes. “Do you think I’m ready?” she asked. “To – to be the only scribe in the throne room?”</p>
<p>Jgoes nodded. “I knew this might happen,” they said. “I tried to make sure you were ready. I can’t promise you I succeeded, but – I did my best.” They paused. “And – if you do decide you want to help liberate the kingdom, a lot of what I taught you doubles as a way to help you pass messages.”</p>
<p>Amelia closed her eyes. “I’ll do it,” she whispered quietly.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Amelia counted her breaths as she waited for the right moment. Sharing a hallway with two corpses had sounded easier when she had discussed it, hours before. She looked down at the bodies, one a young man who days earlier had stood before the throne room to accuse Braixen of treason, the other a middle-aged mead-seller. Neither of them were nobility, neither of them the sort of person that the Mastermind had declared her enemy the previous evening. She remembered noting down the way the young man had carried himself as he had delivered his accusation, and asking the mead-seller for directions on her second day working in the castle.</p>
<p>The candle she was holding burned past the mark she had carefully scratched in it. She paused for a moment, taking a deep breath. Once she did this, there was no chance she could go back.</p>
<p>“Help!” she screamed. “Someone please help! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa–”</p>
<p>She heard footsteps running down the hallway, and a guard appeared. “What’s wro-- <em>oh</em>,” said the guard. “–I’ll go get some of the others.”</p>
<p>Amelia breathed a sigh of relief as the guard turned back around the corner. This would buy Jgoes time to escape.</p>
<p>…And time for the Unseen to recruit more subjects to their conspiracy, she tried not to remind herself.</p>

          <p>My original thought process last night: "Ok so there’s still gonna be new assassin, and I think it was Marshal due to MM taking Tavernkeeper. If the NK isn’t Dry or Chloe, then the obvious play they’ll make is killing Marshal. Yea, healing convert is bad but I can’t let NK frame me.</p>
<p>Afterthought: No, let me just let NK kill Marshal since he is probably the convert. Plus, Marshal is likely to hit one of me or Datbird tonight since he’ll get a free kill and he won’t incriminate by hitting Italy.</p>
<p>Welp. My original thought was correct, but Marshal isn’t convert. 2 kills means we do have convert too.</p>
