<blockquote>
<p>Just like Marshal, I spent a shit ton of time reading through Vulgard’s ISO to come to this conclusion. I really <em>want</em> Vulgard to be town… but my gut is telling me he was converted night one. I noticed a shift in tone with how it interacted with <em>me</em> . It almost seemed super buddy-buddy, like he was trying to make me happy so I would vote and read alongside him. After the Braix lynch, I no longer think this is locktown. He and Marshal have completely opposite viewpoints and I agree much more with Marshal, and think that Marshal is more likely the townie of the two. It’s <em>possible</em> that they are W/W but they would have to be playing out of their minds to be pushing eachother this much, and almost lynching eachother. I just don’t see it. I also dislike how much he mentions his wolf-meta and how he isn’t within it. I find this odd - because he’s usually so proud of his ability to swap playstyles on a whim - so can he <em>really</em> have a wolfmeta? The only reason this is a scum <em>lean</em> and not scum <em>read</em> is because I’m almost scared to say I completely scumread him, for reasons I can’t quite put into words. He’s a good player and I want him to be a townleader, not scum, but that’s unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually get this read and I think it’s valid overall, so I’m just gonna go through it real quick.</p>
<p>Not sure how I interacted with you in a different way. Maybe because I read you as a solid villager and I needed help to fight my wolfreads, so I tried to get you engaged because you were actually playing. That’s pretty much what I felt I needed to do, because I didn’t have enough support in the thread. I needed villagers to help me vote out the wolves. I still do.</p>
<p>The fact me and Marshal have opposite viewpoints meaning we’re V/V… I would honestly like to understand why you townread Marshal. I’ve already explained how he TMId the top 2 wagons day 2 as V/V in my opinion, and he has also said some statements which showcased a wolfy perspective in my opinion. You can probably find that in my ISO somewhere. I just don’t think his perspective is a villagery one. Despite V reading Braixen, he <em>loudly</em> defended him, but didn’t <em>actually</em> defend him (didn’t push me, his wolfread, over him). I felt like that was incredibly performative and never a villagery thing to do.</p>
<p>I’m mentioning being outside of my wolfrange because I thought it was quite obvious. I have never once fabricated a super deep read as a wolf, because I just can’t do it. Might not be the best argument for why I’m a villager, but it’s something nobody’s been able to counter and as such I’ve been recurrently using it. I’m just not a wolf here. Wolf!me would probably be panicking right now under all of the pressure. In LotR I cracked <em>hard</em> when the thread turned against me. Here I’m basically screaming back at the screamers, which most likely isn’t helping my position if I’m wolfing. In fact, I would be <em>more</em> motivated to be reasonable as a wolf here, because if I don’t manage to sway the thread about my alignment, me and my team might be toast. My POV is that I’m right and I’m being shouted down by the wolves. And unfortunately, I haven’t been able to change my mind overnight. I did think about it, and I reached the same conclusions as before, mostly.</p>
<p>I’m not proud of my ability to swap playstyles on a whim. It’s not something I’m proud of. Frankly, I hate it. I hate the fact I’m not able to develop a distinct playstyle that <em>works</em>, is perfectly functional regardless of my alignment, leads to me being townread and lynching people of the opposite alignment. I just don’t have that right now. I flip between different tones and styles of play because I’m looking for the perfect one, still unable to find it. It’s like a perpetual “adventure” which I’m slowly, but surely, hating more and more. This part of my response most likely doesn’t really help you figure out my alignment, because I think it’s completely NAI, but it’s true. I will reiterate postgame that this paragraph is all true, and my greatest frustration with FM as of right now. The game isn’t at fault. It’s me.</p>
<p>Anyway, to the last part.</p>
<p>…There is no last part, just a statement that you would love to see me as a villager here. And I get that. In fact, I think it’s a villagery PoV here, because you’re evaluating me instead of treating me as a lock lynch. And I realize that I haven’t exactly done the same thing to Poss/Marshal. But that’s because I did it throughout day 2, I looked at their EoDs and whatnot. I think Marshal pretty much outed himself as wolf by selfvoting when he could, from his point of view, save a villager. He wasn’t even angry about the Grand Trial on a villager, just a little frustraed, which didn’t seem right. As for Possessed… I mostly wolfread him by association with Marshal, which is probably a mistake. But that’s also why I want to lynch Marshal first. I really don’t think he’s been playing like a villager. I just don’t see it. Maybe I’m tunneled, I don’t know. But I’ve seen some really damning stuff and a wolfy perspective, which I’ve already explained. Didn’t see a villagery one. Or at least, not enough of it.</p>
<p>Should I go on?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and your read on EVO flipped itself on the head</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s because his day 2 was significantly better in comparison to his day 1. On day 1, he was reserved and didn’t have a presence in the thread. It didn’t look like he was trying to evaluate, his posts were mostly cautious and surrounded by uncertainty. I thought these were the signs of a wolf trying, and failing, to fit in.</p>
<p>But day 2, he started doing more. He started developing reads and trying to solve, and he used Venn diagrams to do it. I might be making a mistake by reading this thing as villagery, but I’ve never seen something like this come from a wolf – exclusively from villagers. Villagers are far more likely to have strange ways of reading people, but ways that still make sense from their perspectives, and which can be understood as real thoughts somebody would have. In short, they may be strange, but they are not fake.</p>
<p>And for that reason – because EVO has seemed genuine to me, and because I don’t think he’s thinking like a wolf – I flipped my read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who was converted Day 2 Vulgard</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know yet. Frankly, I would rather lynch a member of the original pack now, because it could help us figure out who was converted (association). The problem is that we’re in a position where we have to kill several wolves at once, and if Marshal isn’t a wolf, then my reasons for wolfreading Possessed largely disappear, and I’m completely stuck read-wise. It’s really not a great situation for me to be in, and that probably translates to my in-thread aggression. I want to do something and push a wolf because we <em>have to</em>, and I’m getting shouted down every time I attempt it, with bad reasons (fmpov) justifying wolfreads on me. So I think it makes sense I would try to be louder than the screamers. Even if it wasn’t the best reaction. I didn’t think that being calm and rational would help change the narrative whatsoever. My top wolfread is the highest poster in the game by far. What better to do than to outshout them?</p>

Maybe because I read you as a solid villager and I needed help to fight my wolfreads, so I tried to get you engaged because you were actually playing.

<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Town</strong></font><br>
This is town. It took me a while to figure it out - in fact, i spent nearly three hours ISOing Marshal only. First of all, if he weren’t town, he would be Mastermind (with Tavernkeeper abilities) or convert. Now, Mastermind does not make sense from my perspective because he started the defense of Braix very early, before Braix even claimed (I can provide evidence for this if need be), and the attempt to get Wazza to bleed seemed incredibly genuine. He also immediately asked Possessed what ability he used, which adds up with the swap. The other possibility is that Marshal is convert. I don’t think this possibility is likely for the same reasons listed above, as well as the fact that he <em>claimed Warlock at the end of d1.</em> Any scum who converts a last-second neut claim would have to have the fuckin biggest brain ever. His tone hasn’t shifted much from d1, minus when he was defending himself from Vulgard, which… IMO his tone became <em>more</em> towny.</p>

<p>I wish I could trust this - however, I know you to be a <em>very</em> strong player, who can change his style on a whim. Hell, you tried to claim Merc as Cult Leader last time. And after that, I townlocked you as Prince when you were Warden - and you were playing extremely towny there. If you were to get scum in this game, I see you as trying a new strategy - as that’s your signature. (Which honestly, is pretty damn impressive if I say so myself - but thats beside the fact)</p>

<p>Fair point that EVO would probably try to kill katze here. But a lot of people, not just katze, were wolfreading EVO. He didn’t have to choose katze, so it’s not damning.</p>

</aside>
<p>And back to Marshal.</p>
<p>So basically, when it comes to wolfreads, katze is suspicious of EVO (briefly), Possessed (flip-flopping), Wazza, and Marshal (also flip-flopping but apparently concluding wolf toward the end).</p>
<p>So even if Possessed is telling the truth, there’s no reason for me to change my reads based on analysis of the katze kill. My top wolfreads would still have ample motivation to kill her.</p>
