    <title>Here is few ideas for the game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/here-is-few-ideas-for-the-game/72764</link>
    <description>Greetings people, so i just wanna share some of my ideas for the game

- **First** is about the skin, did you already though about some class skin ? Like a court-wizard skin with big white beard ? Or a hunter skin with a little bear or wolf near the character ? You can do cool skins class. Actual skins are _okaaay_ i guess ? They&#39;re match with the style of the game (medieval) but personnaly im not very hyped about them actually :thinking: There is no direct link (or match ? idk how to say that) with the game it self, so yeah my idea : skin class
The only problem that might affect all of us (and particularly the new players) is that can be confusing to see like a court-wizard skin guy claiming knight :thinking: 
Oh and also, maybe the start king can have a special king skin  ? 

- Alright my **second** idea is about....THE DEATH NOTE again haha, so i noticed some of my suggestion are now into the game (even if you had probably already thought about my suggestion before i talk about) so yeah thats pretty cool ! So here&#39;s my idea : 

Insert some of the death note who appear in the actual game in the court, here&#39;s what im talking about :

![tol%20dn%203|690x388](upload://qN1RZDF2SpYxYXa6AKruU3iExQW.jpeg)
[/details]
 So in the red square they will be deathnote of the game, i think its pretty cool, the only con is if there is a very edgy/racist death note they maybe appear in court...

- I have **another thing** to suggest, when im poss and i want to draw a death note, the abilites mask the paint tool (days and nights) :

[/details]

Other ideas :
- Death note saves/death note import (looks kinda hard to dev imo) 
- Sometimes a temporary Fun/Chaotic game mode, im sure you already think about it 
- A REAL mini-game when you&#39;re dead, predict who&#39;s gonna be killed or exed can be more fun, idk how but im sure you can do something better ! 
- Different court style, i know like when its winter the court is different but it can be cool to have like 2-3 different court all the time
- Different death note style, like a wood deathnote, or a papyrus death note, even toilet paper death note...:sweat_smile:
- Vocals emote, like on trials you can say &quot;Pardon&quot; or &quot;Exe&quot; one time, something like that (can be a mess, so maybe one time the entire game ?)

And thats all, i know i ask a lot but thats just suggestions/ideas for you to working on it, if you dont like some ideas please tell me, if you like it well im glad ! I dont ask the dev to work on these right now, in fact i dont ask them to work on it at all, if you like and want to work on its up to you but yeah, i&#39;ll be very happy to see some of my suggest in game :smile:

Wish you a good day guys ! (and sorry for english mistake i could have maked writing this post)</description>
