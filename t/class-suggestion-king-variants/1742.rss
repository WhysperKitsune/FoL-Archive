    <title>[Class Suggestion] King Variants</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-king-variants/1742</link>
    <description>## NOTE: This is all a WIP and will ask that if you think there is a better alternative to a name or ability to one of my King Variants, let me know below! This is also purely an idea I&#39;m toying with and mostly for fun. I made this because it&#39;s interesting to see what could happen too. Who knows? Maybe Xblade will take interest in something like this in the future of Throne of Lies! Enjoy!

            <p>I don’t think this is needed.</p>
<p>Too much work for the art department.</p>
<p>And also for those who has to code the new class and remember is Priest King better than Prince King, but that’s beside my point.</p>

            <p>Problem: Some of these will make the King able to confirm his faction<br>
Also BD/US/Cult/Neutral Kings should be Good/Evil/Fanatical/Cowardly kings imo</p>
