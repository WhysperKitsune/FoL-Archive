    <title>Princess Flirt Buff</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/princess-flirt-buff/44460</link>
    <description>To me, flirt as Princess is vague too the point of not being useful. Will-O-Wisp is a good investigative ability, but vaguely knowing what my target could be doesn&#39;t help. Usually evils claim something in the same category or related category anyways. I would suggest a small buff:

Princess (Blue Dragon Investigative)

Passive: Royal Blood

Night Ability: Flirt: Determine your target&#39;s class type.

Will-O-Wisp: You and your target will see who visited you last night.

Note: I would keep Special/Investigative Category</description>

<p>Maybe because they are bad players?<br>
Alot of MM players don’t claim sheriff/princess because thats almost like claiming MM those days. I prefer to claim physician/CW.<br>
The real princess can find the MM with a flirt day1-3, while sheriffs can’t.</p>
<p>Tip: when u find a special/invest you can say on chat: “prince jail me please”.<br>
then the prince can jail the special/invest the following day, and exe if no valid claim.</p>

<p>Hence why it works. People do it more often than you think. And I can’t remember the last time the ToS Investigator outed someone either. The use of the Princess is to help with PoE by narrowing down suspects. Plus she makes a good fake claim.</p>

            <p>I have never seen a Princess out someone. I do see the problem with lack of claim space, but I hate playing it since it feels like a useless ability. Drunk and Butler are easily claimable as Alcoholic, Servant and Invoker. Each converted class has its fake claim built in to it. Unseen claim their original class, usually Cult do the same. Even if they don’t, they claim something their new class’s abilities can do, such as converted Psychic claiming Noble.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of NK claim space, but I don’t know what to do about that.</p>
<p>Also, most people don’t falsely claim Hunter (except Poacher)</p>

<p>I mean to be fair. Butler and Drunk are not fake claimable.</p>

<p>This buff is not small in the slightest. The Princess can already catch meny fake claims such as Killers claiming support and MM/CL claiming hunter ect.</p>
<p>Basically it would make her OP when she is fairly balenced right now. Hell she can even find some converted people such as enforcer or herbalist. Remember that every killer type is neciccaraly not a cult member.</p>
