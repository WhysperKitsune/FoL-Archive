    <title>SFM: Enemy Within 2 - UNATCO and Rogue Agent Victory</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sfm-enemy-within-2-unatco-and-rogue-agent-victory/73895</link>
    <description># [color=green]Welcome to Deus Ex Forum Mafia game[/color] [color=red]Enemy[/color] [color=grey]Within[/color] [color=steelblue]2[/color]

[Color=steelblue][i]Seven months ago after UNATCO Headquarters fell in Liberty Island near New York City by the hands of secret organization calls themselves The Illuminati. National Secessionist Forces (Also known as NSF) have claimed to be the attackers of the UNATCO Headquarters to give in demands to let the shipments reach the lower class, however this is fallen on deaf ears and there is no traces about this so called secret organization. UNATCO have managed to able locate one of but many NSF hideouts in Manhattan Downtown met with heavy resistance due to major hardware that NSF have accquired from shipment raiding where UNATCO is failing to keep the upper class happy and are now demanding to drive NSF out of New York State.[/i][/color]

[Color=steelblue][i]Two months ago, cities across the state have seen skirmishes between NSF and UNATCO but it appears the winning side is none other than UNATCO thanks to their agents specialized in various acts of infiltration and assassinations towards the command structure of National Secessionist Forces but for some reason NSF seems to be replacing more than UNATCO will hope to eliminate the officers and that is not the end of it. More and more UNATCO Agents are disappearing despite the huge success of driving NSF out of New York State.[/i][/color]

[Color=steelblue][i]it&#39;s time we shall finish the job.[/i][/color]

## [color=steelblue]Special mechanics[/color] (This game is unbalanced and bastard, you have been warned)

1 This game allow no logs posted on reveals when you are dead
2. NSF and Illuminati are allowed to kill their own members
3. Class cap of UNATCO classes are 3
4. The game ends with 1 faction remaining, Rogue Agent does not count as faction.
5. Your role abilities are limited to use. Only UNATCO CHIEF can replenish all your uses.
6. UNATCO Chief and all NSF roles are not guaranteed faction-wise so they can be rolled as Illuminati too.
7. Illuminati faction cap is 3
8. Rogue Agent can choose their kill ability and their second passive permamently.
9.  Illuminati will flip in green or red according to their roles until they flip in blue when they all died or Rogue Agent dies.
10. There is feedback in this game however some abilities will not let you show feedback

# [color=red]New game mechanics[/color]

1 Your role reveal can be erased by Rogue Agent or Hitman
2. Introducing UNATCO Guard, UNATCO Enforcer, UNATCO Agent, NSF Bomber and NSF Hitman, UNATCO Janitor is removed
3. Rogue Agent, UNATCO Chief, UNATCO Specialist, NSF Leader, NSF Goon, Illuminati Trooper, Illuminati Professor, Illuminati Leader and Illuminati Goon gets overhauled
4. UNATCO Trooper does not commit suicide when killing Illuminati player that have UNATCO class.
5. Reminder that if player tries to use ability and Enforcer is trying to defuse the bomb - it will still go off and explode
6. Illuminati faction only get to know names of their members
7. Illuminati player(s) on NSF will only talk in NSF chat
8. There is one bastard mechanic that is waiting to be discovered...good for you to find out about this by now.

            <p>Okay I know this ended 3 days ago but I have some thoughts about this.</p>
<p>Add more day abilities, the lack of day abilities kinda screwed the game up a bit.<br>
Nerf Rogue Agent.<br>
Buff Scum, maybe giving better day abilities.</p>

            <p>How do you expect a town win if the Neutral Killer wasn’t designed to side with whomever? It was literally 8 to 8 day 1 with 1 town killer and 1 town cop spawn and 2 KPN and a bastard mechanic granting the last Illuminati his own factional kill.</p>
<p>It’s not like you guys put in that much effort to have the “NK” side with you.</p>
<p>Just going to post this in public chat too.</p>
<p>If NK would be a “true NK”, you’d probably need to add like 4 or 6 more town.</p>
