    <title>Pretender JOAT [Neutral Investigative]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/pretender-joat-neutral-investigative/80133</link>
    <description>To make a good neutral pretender I wanted to make a class that **if** you were to claim d1 you will most likely get lynched, someone who neither cult/unseen and BD can trust, instead of being asked to swap king&#39;s vote and confirmed (unless EK, were you get lynched for not swapping). And Similar to how alch is just a better phys, pretender is just a better more confirm able princess, which is something I want to change.

But I don&#39;t want to make another killer neutral, inq/NK are enough, and making a killer class with an extra gimmick has beginning to get a bit overdone (may be hard to make BD trust someone who can&#39;t kill but wahay) . Also Pretender&#39;s aims are a bit weird, the class isn&#39;t about confirm ability, it&#39;s about killing royal blood, which doesn&#39;t really help Pretender in the long run, 1 killing a BD makes you untrustworthy, and 2 you gain no knowledge through Blood Test that is necessarily useful for Pretender.

            <p>Facade could be used to gain confirm ability, for example you pretend to be drunk, and say you made 7 target 1, then you could have them executed and you confirmed, also you can use stolen coronets to use abilities to make you look confirm able, in addition, princess garment could be use to find your enemies while also using an ability at night.</p>
