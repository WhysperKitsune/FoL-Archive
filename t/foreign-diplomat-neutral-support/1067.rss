    <description>Foreign Diplomat (Neutral Support) 

Passive Ability - Diplomatic Immunity
The diplomat cannot be put on trial for treason. If he receives enough votes to be put on trail his role is revealed and the trial is halted.  This ability is removed upon using Swear Fealty. 

Day Ability 1: Swear Fealty - 1 use
The Foreign diplomat can swear fealty to a faction. They will then share in the goals and ambitions of said faction. They cannot speak with their new faction at night, and there is no notification that they chose a faction. They gain new abilities based on the faction chosen.

(Blue Dragon) Day Ability 2: Foreign Aid - 2 uses
Foreign Aid allows the diplomat to grant an extra use of a night ability to any player.

(Black Rose) Day Ability 2: Political Pressure - 2 uses
Political Pressure allows the diplomat to force another player to vote the same as the diplomat for the rest of the day.

(Cult) Day Ability 2: Sow Discord - infinite uses
Sow Discord allows the diplomat to make a players votes for trial to not appear for others, and their votes for guity and innocent will show as the opposite to other players. (their votes will still be counted as what they picked, just show differently) 

Night Ability 1: Influence - Passive
The Diplomat can talk with the king at night. They Diplomats name will not be revealed, hey will just show as Diplomat.

Lore:
A Diplomat from a far away nation, here to establish relations with Castle Adiart.

Comments:
The Foreign Diplomat is a neutral role that cannot win while they remain neutral, their objective is to chose a faction and win with them. They are immune to conversion. 

The Foreign Diplomat can be played two different ways, you can wait and chose the faction you think will win at the last second, or you can choose right away and gain a beneficial ability. Don&#39;t be afraid to chose, and don&#39;t forget to use your influence to help or hurt the king. 

Once you use your new day abilities, smart players will know which faction you&#39;ve decided, so make sure that no-one knows your identity before you use them, or vise versa you could use that as a method to prove yourself in the eyes of your chosen faction.

Let me know if you guys have any ideas to add, and what you think.</description>

            <p>It’s about risk vs reward, if you’ve revealed that your diplomat, then obviously don’t use an ability that gives away your intentions.  If it was too easy to hide it wouldn’t  feel rewarding when you trick people.</p>

            <p>While I agree that they will realise there is a diplomat, they wont know who it is. It’s the same as the fool, as soon as the fool makes someone speak, everybody knows there is a fool, but they don’t know who it is.</p>

            <p>Sow Discord is trash. People can realize your role VERY quickly.</p>
<p>I suggest you change it to:<br>
One of them:<br>
-Roleblock<br>
-Find a role/find a faction of selected player<br>
-Control a player’s actions</p>
