    <title>[BUG] Scout catches Evil King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-scout-catches-evil-king/66046</link>
    <description>#### What happened? 
In an Unseen Game, there were two sheriffs, each with their scout on each other. The EK for whatever reason decided to guard one of them. The scout then goes off and says that the sheriff was visited by the unseen.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Now, some may argue that because the King is Unseen this should clearly count towards the scout triggering. I disagree because King&#39;s Guard doesn&#39;t count as a visit and thus shouldn&#39;t be included.

#### Steps to reproduce: Have a sheriff tell a Evil King who he is scouting, have Evil King guard that person. Scout will trigger.</description>
