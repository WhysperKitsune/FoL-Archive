    <title>Some ideas for changes to most classes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/some-ideas-for-changes-to-most-classes/40771</link>
    <description>Princess - Add day ability - “good looking” - prevent anyone from voting you for the rest of the day-
 [3 uses] - Duchase also gets this ability 

Drunk - Remove night ability “Happy hour” - Add new day ability “one more wont hurt” give a player another sip of liquor, This makes them to drunk to vote and also switches certain words around. If the ploayer effected by this try’s to say any class Hunter,Obs,CL, etc... it will appeare as a random class instead. It also make the player to drunk to vote- 3 uses 

Butler - Add day ability “drugged”(could use better name) - When you drug a player in the morning then that night you will be able to control the player. 

- You will not be allowed to use you other night abilities that night
- The player will be notified when this happened 
- Example -  the butler drugs player 5(the assassin),that night the butler controls who the assassin kill or can can choose not to do anything that night occupying the player 
- (3 uses)
- this is also given to the servant 

Noble - i personally think the Noble is in a fairly decent place. Many others provided suggestions saying that snoop is too strong, I disagree 

King - there is many suggestions to make King better. I personally agree with @orangeandblack5 idea of the King

CW - Add day ability “shut tight” - Player effected by this ability will not be able to talk for the rest of the day - (3 uses) - People are saying that tornado has to be changed but having that ability and using it correctly can be very powerfull when used right, my suggestion is to have people alerted when they are effected by this ability. - This ability also is given to the sage 

Paladin - Gian day ability “Angels  guidance” - Make it so the cult cannot convert tonight and the following night - 1 use - this might be too powerful so a counter change could be to get rid of “Smite” - if you disagree with this then an alternative is to have the paladin be bled immune, although I don’t think this would do much.

Physicians - I’ve been thinking a lot about this one, either to have reanimate go back to bringing the person back to life as his class or to allow DK to be talking to the living like he used to. Physician is not a bad class but a boring one to play as. Maybe to discover how people died like he used to have as a night ability but make it a day abily...? Help me out on this one.

Mercenary - Make it so the mercenary can give out a contract in the first 3 days meaning he does NOT spawn with a target - He can not get a new contract - if the merc doesn’t find a new target at the beginning of day 4 then he will tak his own life

Cult - I don’t know the exact abilities or names for this but i was thinking that the cult should have an extra class for each type

Social - Apostle and another
Offensive - invoked and another
Support - Ritualist and another
Investigative - seeker and another

If you get converted then you will either be one or the other. Say paladin gets converted then he will be a seeker or an another cult class

NK’s - the Nks are in a weird spot. Right now the possessor is dominating in my past experiences but that’s just because he has a good defensive deceiving capability{as in his jump}

Reaper/sorcerer - one ability that I recommend is given to one of these two classes as an ability that allows them to become any BD player for a day, let me explain. Say the reaper uses this ability to become a butler the next day. Then when it becomes the next day the reaper is allowed to do everything a butler can do for that day and night. He can poison the King by day and occupy someone at night, he will also appear as BD that night if investigated 

Inquisitor - only the CL is found as a magic user, not the entire cult. Other magic users remain the same

These are just some ideas i had for the game. I really do enjoy this game and i hope new content comes soon. Tell me your thoughts below</description>

<p>No to the first one. Phys needs to be fakeable. The second one would be good if it’s limited use.</p>
