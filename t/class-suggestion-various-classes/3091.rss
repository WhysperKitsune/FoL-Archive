            <p>I will say however that custodian has a knight’s guard ability with he added effect of making them occupy immune, and has investigative capabilities. Seems much better than knight - cold steel is rarely used</p>

            <p>Introducing a ToS-like Investigator would single-handedly change the meta of the game. I enjoy being able to claim multiple classes in FoL and not feel restricted to staying within investigation results. Just the mere existence of an Investigator class would alter how people play, regardless or not if it actually spawned in the game. This is similar to the Spy in ToS, and why it got nerfed into the ground.</p>
<p>I think the Patron hurts BD more than it helps them. Whispering is more of a BD activity since scum have night chat already. BD also has more Royal Blood members at the beginning of the game. On the other hand, Bribery is insanely powerful as it is half of a King’s Decide Fate, but can be used twice. The design of this ability on a BD member is odd – the only time you would be effectively using this is when scum have majority and they don’t realize you are a Patron, or <em>you know that somebody is BD 100% and nobody else realizes it.</em> Without investigation abilities, you’re confined to scum reading alone which makes this ability seem weird to me.</p>
<p>I like the other classes for the most part. Do you agree that the Custodian should be Occupy immune like the Butler as well? It’s a little weak on its own.</p>

<p>in unseen games, you can find the assassin; in cult games, you can find the cult leader via sacrifices</p>

<p>I originally didn’t want to post these three anyway cause I knew nobody would like them. The only reason I posted them was to see if there was any interest for people.</p>
<p>But people shouldn’t be so quick to shoot down something like an Investigator, or something similar. It wouldn’t have to do the same thing with the same results but it’d be interesting to see how it’d work with conversions in play.</p>

            <p>As much as I hate to do so, I agree with norm</p>
<p>I dislike the ToS Investigator with a passion, it reduces claimspace and is generally an arse to deal with</p>
<p>The best part of ToL is the fact that claimspace is so open and this would reduce that</p>
<p>Plus we already have Princess to do stuff like this</p>
