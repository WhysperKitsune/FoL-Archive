    <title>Physician Exhume bugs if converted the same night</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physician-exhume-bugs-if-converted-the-same-night/71060</link>
    <description>When I exhumed a dead butler, a glitch occurred. I was both prevented and converted that night, and this led to the exhume result of &quot;killed by possessor&quot; being repeatedly spammed, rather than just receiving it once.

based on my experience earlier in the game, i can assume this should not have happened

<p>Just a guess though.</p>
<p>Can’t be sure.</p>

            <p>Something tells me that that Observer may have been killed by a Possessor. Not sure why though. Gut feeling?</p>
