## What would this mean for ToL? What is Throne&#39;o&#39;ween?

Well, I&#39;m glad you asked- basically it&#39;s ToL&#39;s version of Halloween, or All Hallows Eve. During which time Castle Adiart is decorated with pumpkins and jackolanterns, and all that kind of stuff. 

Decorated? Why would a kingdom back then be decorated? Well, actually- did you know jackolanterns were used to ward off evil spirits? *looks towards the ToL cemetery*. Because during Halloween (Throne&#39;o&#39;ween), darkness was at it&#39;s greatest power. The ghosts would rise, and haunt. and so the townsfolk put jackolanterns around the kingdom and it stopped. Bye ghosts :) stay in the cemetery where you belong ;) 

It would also, in my opinion just be cool to have these sorts of events once in a while. Keeping the community involved and active. Perhaps this would be a great time, for maybe 2 days, the day before and the day of Halloween to do a 2x GP boost or something of that sort, to bring everyone online and together. Heck, I was even thinking of something kind of cool but it might be impossible to do, maybe a Halloween outfit that would be sold for a limited time in the store, like a seasonal outfit. Only purchasable during Halloween-time, but not just this year- next year and so on, seasonal. The outfit I was thinking would have a jackolantern as the head and a viney-sort of body, hey! We need more cool armor! We have these awesome weapons, but somewhat bland outfits :(  and this shouldn&#39;t just be limited to Halloween! Maybe during like Christmas time Santa outfits, and maybe elf outfits could be sold seasonally too! :D but yeah, what do you think- Halloween in ToL? Any ways you can think of to make this a better suggestion? Let me know below in the comments section, thanks for your time reading this, and as always- stay frosty my friends.

and yes, this may be hard to implement this year on such short notice, but maybe it would be something cool for next year. :unknown:</description>

            <p>Next year definitely, or something in the future before that with the same concept and mind [Christmas, easter - you know what I mean <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Right now I donâ€™t think they have the time, and I donâ€™t think its something they should focus a lot on, something you did mention which I like a lot is that they on christmas, easter, halloween and so on - make a little event where people get rewards for playing. Just a thought :))</p>
