    <title>Home and End on logs should go to the beginning/end of a line</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/home-and-end-on-logs-should-go-to-the-beginning-end-of-a-line/55655</link>
    <description>Currently when you press the &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;End&quot; keys while on your logs, you will go to the beginning or end of your logs (respectively). This is not the correct function and instead should only go to the beginning or end or a line. CTRL+Home or CTRL+End should do the intended function of going to the beginning or end of the logs.

If this functionality is corrected, Shift+Home or Shift+End would be used to just highlight a single line instead of to the beginning or end of your logs. It&#39;s just an extra shortcut for keybinding-saavy people to post or navigate their logs quicker.</description>
