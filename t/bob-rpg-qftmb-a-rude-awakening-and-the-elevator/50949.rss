    <title>Bob RPG | QftMB. A Rude Awakening and The Elevator</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bob-rpg-qftmb-a-rude-awakening-and-the-elevator/50949</link>
    <description>## **inspired by Everyone is John**

Bob RPG is a turn based RPG Forum Game that seems extremely extremely normal...
(Bob is a gender neutral name in this world). (this sort of is a test to see how well a D&amp;D like turn based rpg would work in a deceit based game and as a forum game.)

The game consists of 7 heroes all named Bob who all have different powers and abilities trying to get through a set of obstacles to reach Princess Bob. but one Bob is not who he seems, he is actively working against the team to sabotage their goal. The other Bobs do not know who this traitor is or any of the other Bob&#39;s stats.

They will fight four headed dragons and jump over pits infested with snakes. To attempt to save this one princess.

### If you want to host this game?
Give each Bob 4 battle abilities, Max HP, start them all on level 1 and Defense. 

Randomise these abilities from a specific pool of abilities relating to the class that is being played there.

Randomly choose a traitor, he/she will have a tiny bit more health than usual and monsters will be a little bit less likely to attack said traitor.

Be creative with your ideas.

## Rules:
1. Do not work against your goal. Only the traitor must tamper with the others.
2. Only use a move once, you can run around the battlefield and stuff. You can move again once the enemy you are fighting has moved.
3. Play well in your position no matter what.
4. Do not RDM (Random Death Match) for absolutely no point. Sure you can RDM if there is just the traitor and one Bob left but just don&#39;t randomly kill people without proof.
5. No screenshots of DMs &quot;proving you&#39;re not the traitor.&quot; Inspect Element exists everybody
6. No whispering/metagaming. All talk about this game must be done here

## The Story
Uncle Bob tells his 7 nephews/nieces about a princess Bob that has been locked away in a big tower. There is a fuckton of money and treasure located in this castle ~~(oh and a hot grill. no polys pls)~~

One actually truly hates his/her other siblings and is looking to kill them while on the journey just to later date a royal so he/she can get the money out of their royal bank account and buy himself/herself a giant gold statue of Bob Ross. 

As they leave the little stone hut in the village of Finglabob. They get closer to the tower of Bob to save the princess

### To Join
To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want. Also write which Bob you want to play as.

### So who wins?

Innocent wincons: 
Kill all traitors.
Save the princess with at least 3 of you alive. (4 players including traitor)

Traitor wincons:
Only 2 innocents and you are there to save the princess.
Have a majority over the innocents.


Players:
Warrior Bob - Stranglebob
~~Mage Bob - Bob110~~
Rogue Bob - Inbobity
Cleric Bob - Damabob
Ranger Bob - Hippobobtus
~~Monk Bob - Bobphoma~~
Bob with no Pants On - CaptainBobs

Local Idiot Bob who screams random stuff in the game and is not helpful or something like that - Marlbobxion
Marl wins either way because Marl is not allied with anyone.

Not Decided:
