&gt;**[color=grey]Blue Dragon Unique Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Mole (Passive) -** Will see the votes when a new King is elected. *You will keep this passive even if your class changes.*
&gt;
&gt;**Stake Out (Day) -** During the night, you will be able to hear the messages of the Cult or Unseen. Alerts the Cult/Unseen of your presence at the beginning of the night. *(1 use)*
&gt; 
&gt;**Bug (Night) -** Send a scout to a chosen player. At the beginning of each night, the scout alerts you if the target used a day ability. Regains uses upon scouted deaths of scouted targets. *(2 Uses)* 
&gt;**Seizure -**  All Non-BD players will not receive feedback for abilities on the chosen target. You will receive their non-conversion based feedback instead. *(Infinite uses)* 
&gt; 
&gt;*Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

For **Seizure**, players affected by it will be given the notification of being &#39;prevented&#39;.

Seizure will also not redirect feedback for abilities such as Brotherhood to the spy, for balance sake.

----

&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=indigo]Double-Agent[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Unseen Unique Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Expert Espionage (Passive) -** Your votes for king count as triple the normal value.
&gt;
&gt;**Plant Evidence (Day) -** Frame a player. They will appear as suspicious to investigative classes during the night. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Cronies (Night) -** Send a crony to the chosen player. At the beginning of each night, the crony tells you what day ability the target used. Regains uses upon the targeted player dying. *(2 uses)*
&gt;**Forge (Night) -** Rewrite the chosen player&#39;s logs. If they die, their Logs are replaced with your rewritten ones. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

The changes implemented between this draft and the last were to mainly prevent easily confirmations of the class, while keeping the soul of it intact. Seeing as the class has an ability to effectively negate information between evil faction members

</aside>
<p>Only really confirms Alch and Scorned, which already can be confirmed fairly easily. Fairly fringe uses.</p>
<p>It also forces player cooperation, similar to Gossip. Although the Spy could find the neut randomly, it is about as likely as finding it with Gossip.</p>

<p>That’s only if it catches 3rd unseen doing something on someone, and not all unseen converts even have abilities that this can catch (enforcer, poacher w/ spikes).</p>
