            <p>Merc is strong enough as is. It can whisper it’s contract and leaves feedback anyway.</p>

            <p>So Sellsword cant hear the unseen chat, just their contract? Or would they get both? Seems like a possible problem.</p>

            <p>True. Perhaps Sellsword would retain their contract chat so that they are none the wiser?</p>

            <p>I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>I see no reason why the Merc can’t have night chat with her Contract.</p>

            <p>Seems like a good idea to me, other classes with allegiance to each other can chat so I feel it’s fair to the merc.</p>
