    <description>Hey folx. I&#39;m one of those Good Samaritan players who reports people for ToS violations every time I see it, so the mods know who&#39;s doing what. That being said, while consistently reporting violations since purchasing the game ~6m ago, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve made literally one ounce of impact on the toxicity content in the community. It has even recently increased dramatically (since the last patch prior to today&#39;s; I have no idea if it&#39;s related or coincidental).

Cancer is gonna eventually permeate every pubg gaming setting, it&#39;s just the way of the world, but today I saw a new low: pedophilia spam. Like whooooaaa bois. Granted I can&#39;t make it through a single game this week without reading some seriously disturbing shit, and it is what it is and generally I report the stuff that needs reporting and carry on. But: toxic meme culture can absolutely go too far. Pedo spam is not just not okay; stuff like that gets people imprisoned. And more than that, I just don&#39;t wanna read that sick shit

So this is a plea to the players first and the mods second to step up our game on the Reports, the suspensions, the bans, and the wrist-slaps, both from mods and from our fellow players (e.g. &quot;Dude that&#39;s really not okay. Please stop bro&quot;).

Please consider devoting some resources to improving the Report function so that it lightens the work load on man hours and increases its effectiveness (in allowing us to improve our community by identifying and removing toxic elements)

And if you&#39;re already opening a reply box to tell me to toughen up and get over it, I&#39;mma ask you to please redirect those salty keystrokes into a suggestion re: what WE can do as players to help fix it. For real, what could we be doing?

I love this game, for srs. Just not lovin cancerous community lately. Plz send halp. :frowning:</description>

            <p>as Xblade mentioned, I guess they’re still working on the algorithms for Minority Report level functionality <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
I don’t disagree with you, <strong>but!</strong> In the meantime, there’s not really any way to disprove someone who says “Oh, sorry, I thought they were Fool”<br>
If loopholes were intrinsically unethical, they wouldn’t be a legitimate aspect of law… which is neither relevant nor – again – academically arguable.<br>
But now that I’ve seen evidence that we as the player-base are actually helping by continuing to report, I don’t feel the need to be so aggressively cavalier in defending a positive play experience.<br>
Hopefully some others might feel similarly.<br>
Thx again</p>

<p>From all the people reporting it saying they are deeply disheartened by seeing the term used in a really negative fashion.</p>
<p>There are tons of terms that that are made to be used decently, then ended up using it to really hurt people. In-game, there’s no reason to even use that term in-game, both the politically correct and incorrect ways: it’s either off-topic or hurtful.</p>

<hr>
<p>Everything you see is done by coding bots, detection algorithms, real human reporting, code to DISPLAY the reports and gather all the data, +add an incredible amount of filters. We also have guides and mods review cases and mods can even take action. Guides will likely be able to take limited actions soon. We also have extra people working on in-game moderation. While Boslof codes in-game and balance, this is the project I’ve been taking on solo (for the coding aspect). The guides/mods help a crazy ton, and the players themselves for actually reporting.</p>
<p>We’re very human and we do have very limited resources, yet we are still (and have been) prioritizing moderation. All these report tools have taken ages to make. We also recently coded Steam bans inside so that it’ll even reflect on your profile if permabanned as additional encouragement to stop being douchey enough to get a permaban.</p>
<p>We’ve been fighting trolls like crazy, but we can’t <em>Minority Report</em> all of them (although we’re working on systems that can try to predict based on your history. See those secret stats above that reveal how many times you’ve reported others or been reported, games played, etc?).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We bust our butts with moderation and you can even get a live stream of in-game bans WITH the attached reason for ban (usually NSFW, care) and have taken a huge hit on reviews for “revenge reviews” after a ban, and even still continue moderation. If you want proof things are happening, jump to Discord’s <span class="hashtag">#justice</span> channel. <strong>If you want the perfect match with almost guaranteed 0 toxicity, group with people in Discord</strong>.</p>

<p>(PS, please un-censor that. It is not innately a slur, and the censorship is super offensive to people who identify as such. Like censoring the word Mexican. Like… c’mon you guys &gt;.&lt; )</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the YouTube comment section?<br>
Autism is commonly used as an insult, a way to say “this person is stupid and different and a problem to the society.”</p>
<p>Also autism isn’t something you identify as, it’s an actual condition. You get diagnosed with it, or you Don’t have it. You can’t identify as autistic unless you have the condition??</p>

            <p>Clap for the inside scoop!</p>
<p>Fr that’s sweet and awesome (truly), it just doesn’t invoke any sympathy from me.<br>
I don’t jive with the “worship our devs, f*ck our fellows” mentality. If yer gonna take on this kind of project, know what yer gettin yerself into or go the way of all the other games that faded to death of obscurity. It’s not really a personal matter.</p>
<p>Point being: If it’s a matter of man hours,  <strong>allow</strong> player volunteers to help with game monitoring and cancer mitigation (I can go find the thread begging the Devs for this option). There’s a solution waiting on-deck for that. So, that explanation is irrational – or the Devs are.</p>
<p>Which means it means it’s either not the man hours and there’s a different resource issue,<br>
Their priorities are beyond fukt,<br>
Or they just don’t care about this issue.</p>

            <p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>352 hours played, 1 modification to Report function (adding a set <strong>and limited</strong> list of reasons for report).</p>
<p>From a logic and liability standpoint, I do not comprehend why it’s not a matter of more concern that players promote pedophilia on their servers, or tell each other to commit suicide… and yet the word “autism” is censored for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>(PS, please un-censor that. It is <strong>not</strong> innately a slur, and the censorship is super offensive to people who identify as such. Like censoring the word Mexican. Like… c’mon you guys &gt;.&lt; )</p>
<p>It’s utterly disheartening, but this burgeoning toxic iteration of the community is absolutely repellent, as opposed to the wonderfully funny supportive community here I first encountered. I have the sads for ToL. I hope it recovers from the brink of death by Poison, but it seems the Healers are AFK.</p>

            <p>I’m just gonna say. I’ve seen absolutely no changes in the way the report system works in the time I’ve played this game. (Around 300 hours)</p>
<p>BUT. Sheriff has been buffed, nerfed, buffed again, nerfed again. I’ve seen king changed dozens of times. Noble has been removed and added again. I don’t really see many people complaining about Sheriff, King OR Noble. We usually just like one variant or the other.</p>
<p>What I DO see though, is CONSTANT posting here on the forums and in game about the massive bulk of cancerous and toxic players in the game. So please… Instead of changing Sheriff, Court Wizard, King or Noble again, can we PLEASE have some sort of update to the report system so it’s a bit more reactive? I feel like I’m just reporting people for no reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, if you snipe a troll, you’ll BOTH get in trouble. Don’t forget there are other people in the game beside you + the troll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So would you rather have me sit here while this “Troll” tells me to hang myself IRL, or is a prince constantly jailing and harassing me for no reason as a BD, or someone talking about pedophilia? SOMETHING needs to be done with this game, or people will be leaving in droves due to the small cancerous tumor that is growing.</p>

            <p>I hear that. But Fool class sort of builds in a caveat. If a player is being an obnoxious twat, I can say with honesty, “I thought he was Fool”</p>
<p>And as much as I would like to unilaterally agree without that caveat – there still doesn’t exist a functional alternative for escaping shit we don’t wanna read on our monitors. I am all ears as far as other ways to handle it - but if I have to choose between my emotional well being and someone else’s… well, I ain’t no martyr, and I’m unwilling to eat constant shit just to play the game. What options does that leave? Uninstall or get over it? I guess I’ll take my chances with the Fool sniping.</p>
<p>(+ It’s also difficult to continue being dedicated to a Report system that hasn’t provided any visible or material improvements in my gameplay experience. Toxic player elements continue to steadily increase, and we have not been offered any alternative methods to escape other players’ toxicity. In this way, I don’t feel it’s entirely fair for Devs to ask us to just keep /reporting – it’s all we <strong>CAN</strong> do after all – and have faith it’s making a difference. On a personal level, it actually is not making any difference at all.)</p>

            <p>Ya, but this is definitely not real life o.o</p>
<p>So here’s an example – Fool and Scorned:</p>
<p>Can’t verify the claims immediately, they’re a pain in the ass, and they should be sniped as per the intended game mechanics. So what if I <strong>think</strong> someone is doing a Fool play? I absolutely should snipe them. If someone is just being a straight up toxic fool (as opposed to Fool) then it really isn’t my misplay (or a misplay at all) if they lead me to believe that’s what they are.</p>

            <p>Until there’s an option in game for escaping harassment real-time, sniping is the only option you leave us, Devs. Please offer us another.</p>
<p>Edit: + Please explain how sniping a toxic PoS is something that would get me in trouble. If a person is trolling to the point of detrimenting gameplay for other players, that would be considered throwing, yes? So how is removing that element from the game (in lieu of a functional system that would do it for me) an offense?</p>

            <p>I’m tempted tonight to just play to report.<br>
Late gmt is so toxic I can’t record anymore at that time.<br>
May even make a montage of the toxic.<br>
It’s a shame we can’t watch live games rather than playing and report these arses.<br>
Or kick them mid game off of server to warn/ban them.</p>

            <p>We review all reports manually, yep – and often by even more than one person. We’ll know. We also store report history, so we find the troll reporters fast and THEY get punished.</p>
<p><strong>However, if you snipe a troll, you’ll BOTH get in trouble.</strong> Don’t forget there are other people in the game beside you + the troll.</p>

            <p>Clearly bussing is a hot topic, but that’s just a tiny occasional slice of the shit pie. As I see it, if the person you’re bussing doesn’t know you’re about to do it, that’s a no-no. If they do… well, that’s between you two.</p>
<p>But as per the OT: I guess as lame as it sounds, I’m asking y’all as other players to snipe throwers and trolls real-time in games. Let’s please make it an organized effort/meme/meta to kill off toxicfuks/meme accusers/trolls n1-2??</p>
<p>When you get a player in game who’s just throwing around and meme accusing and giving bad info, its either a basic 2iq Fool play, or a legit thrower. Either one can cause a loss for BD, which is why Fool has the win conditions it does – we are <strong>intended</strong> to exe that shit.</p>
