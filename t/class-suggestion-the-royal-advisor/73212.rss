<p>This ability doesn’t help this class at achieving their goal. It does not give the king extra survivability.</p>
<p>I’d change this to an ability like Knight guard but limited uses and can only target King</p>

</aside>
<p>Make this either you or the king. Making choices have inherent risk (especially for neuts) is extremely important.</p>
<p>This ability does too much for too little.</p>

            <p>I like the aspects of this class, except that he is omniscient to whether the king is evil or not when he guards someone else.</p>
