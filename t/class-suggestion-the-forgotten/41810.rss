            <p>This seems really weak. It takes 2 nights to take effect, and unseen could kill them in that time. I think the game is cluttered enough with occupy immune classes, which are everywhere. The voting powers are cool. Exert Presence seems weak, since you are giving BD info. Mind Collapse is weird, since you just need a good memory to counter it. The Snoop element of it works I think, but probably needs some other property to make it worth it,</p>

            <p>I was maybe thinking of giving it 2 extra lives. Unlike the Reaper which can replenish it… However the old fashioned Death Immunity might be added.</p>

            <p>Aight so it doesn’t clear Secret notes but gives you a copy of that players Logs. Also you’ll be able to hear Marked players Whispers. This way they’ll be able to reliably claim Noble.</p>

            <p>The point of secret notes is to be the in game equivalent of having an actual notepad that no one in game could possibly get to. Your suggestion ruins that.</p>

            <p>The point of removing the Secret notes is so that players cannot store their logs in there. However I would like to further discuss as maybe a countermeasure to Mind Collapse.</p>

<p>Umm… No. The whole point of secret notes is that they mean you don’t need an out of game notepad for things like these. If they are not tamperproof then no one will use it.</p>
