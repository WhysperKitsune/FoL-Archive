**Name - Peace Keeper** 
**_Faction - Neutral_**
**_Class - offensive_**  

Lore: As this silly war grew, the peace keeper felt sick. After losing his son because of the war he decides to only trust them who are Neutral in the war. Maybe they could help end this... or if all else fails the NK could get rid of them all. 

**Passive 1:** 
_**Little hope**_ - on days where no one die, you gain death immunity that night. 

**Passive 2:**
**_Failure_** - if all neutrals die then you will die the next day. If every Neutral is dead except the NK, then you will know who the NK is 

**Day Ability 1:**
**_Special connections_** - send your personal mercenary to guard someone. You can guard yourself. They will be alerted that they were guarded by a mercenary. (Unlimited uses)(2 day cool down)

**Day Ability 2:**
**_Hidden dungeon -_** chat with a player of your choice tonight. Separate tab. ( does not work on prince target and can be interrupted by mystic link (unlimited uses)

**Night ability 1:**
**_Showing your true colors_** - pick 3 people and you will know how many are neutral out of the 3. If there is not enough people then you can&#39;t use this ability. (unlimited uses)

_Ex. You pick 4,6,9_
_Message says_
_(&quot;2 out of 3 of your targets are neutral&quot;) or_
_(&quot;No targets are neutral)_

**Night ability 2:**
_Peace treaty -_ declare no trials the next day 
(2 uses)

**Win condition** - you win if there is another Neutral alive with you at the end of the game(includes NK, if NK is last Neutral alive)

Notes: this is a class that can really help both sides. BD might want to keep him alive for protection but also might need to kill him if he is defending the NK</description>
