[u]&lt;big&gt;Rolelist&lt;/big&gt;[/u]


[color=green]1 Cop
9 Citizens[/color]

[color=red]3 Mafiosos[/color]


[u]&lt;big&gt;Mechanics&lt;/big&gt;[/u]

Cops start the game with a N0 check (start the game knowing one other player chosen at random is town.)
Days are 72 hours, nights are 24 hours. Mafia have daychat.
Majority lynch is not in play, and instead is permanently deadline lynch.

[u]&lt;big&gt;Rolecards&lt;/big&gt;[/u]

&gt; # [color=green]Cop[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;re the detective in this sorry town, and it&#39;s your job to crack the case and solve the murders....
&gt; 
&gt; Each night you may check a player, learning if they are Town or Mafia;.
&gt; [player] is known to you to be Town from the start of the game.
&gt; 
&gt; You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated.

&gt; # [color=green]Citizen[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;re just an ordinary citizen trying to avoid being killed by the Mafia.
&gt; 
&gt; You have no special abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated.

&gt; # [color=red]Mafioso[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;re a brutal criminal who&#39;s trying to kill off all the ordinary citizens to take over this neighbourhood.
&gt; 
&gt; You may communicate with your allies at all times, and you know who each other ar.e
&gt; Each night you and your allies may vote on a single player to kill. This will go through no matter what.
&gt; 
&gt; You win when the Mafia&#39;s numbers are equal to the Town&#39;s.
