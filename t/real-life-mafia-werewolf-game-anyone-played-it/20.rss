    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/real-life-mafia-werewolf-game-anyone-played-it/20</link>
    <description>This is one of those games that I personally always wanted to play, but never could gather enough people to do it. Anyone ever play this -- the original &quot;real life&quot; mafia/werewolf party game?</description>

            <p>Played werewolf once on a school camping trip. The voting rules, gameplay, and role list were all BS because this was our first time playing it and the host presumedly only discovered this game before camp started. The good thing is, I learned about mafia and Town of Salem through this experience.</p>

            <p>I’ve definitely played real life Mafia/Werewolf before.  We used to do it often at summer retreats in high school.  The most recent time I played was at PAX Prime 2015, where the game devs and the coaches they invited to show off the game all gathered together after a night of drinks and played.  Accusations thrown everywhere, people lynching left and right.  It was great fun!</p>

            <p>True, but the more players the are in my opinion, the better that the campaigns are as there are times where there are big battles and you have barely chance of winning.</p>
<p>Also, the good days of being shockwaved by a gnome, only needing to roll three successful rolls to revive yourself. Good news for me, I got the rolls, bad news for everyone else, they all died and then I was left alone with a werebear against werewolf fight. Believe it or not, still won, all by myself.</p>
<p>(I was the werewolf)</p>

            <p>I play Werewolf at school with friends at recess or after school. We usually only have time to play one game, but we have fun.</p>

            <p>I have never played any real life Mafia/Werewolf game, but my favourite game is Town of Salem (despite some big flaws in the design). The concept is really cool, it’s not quite like any other type of game.</p>
<p>Also, this is off-topic, but I just found this game through a TOS forums post and joined these forums yesterday, and so far, this game seems really cool. I can’t wait to see more.</p>

            <p>I recall playing murder game that relies on lightning matches/drawing straws with only one killer in circle of +5 people, everyone can stay awake except they will die when the killer ‘blinked’ directly yet discreetly when others are not watching, pointing out the murder during the ‘discussion’ stage.</p>
<p>I miss summer camp days.</p>
<p>ALSO, yes I own a copy of The Werewolves of Millers Hollow / Wolven van Wakkerdam by 999 games, a dutch tabletop game producer, unfortunately I didn’t manage to hold group with my work-co’s for long.</p>
