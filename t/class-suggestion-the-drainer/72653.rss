&lt;big&gt;[color=red]**The Drainer**[/color]&lt;/big&gt;

**Neutral Killer**

**Blood Shield(Passive)** - Immune to death, anyone who tried to occ, redirect or prevent you when you attacking will get attacked instead of your target (Prince Jail is an exception, if you was occ, redirect or prevent by more than 2 player, you will attack a random of them)

**Perfect Drain(Passive)** - Your kill will show up as Assassin/CL to Exhume result.

**Life Brainwash(Day)** - Brainwash a player, make them become the next The Drainer. You cannot perform any action tonight. If the brainwash succeed then you will die appear as a class of your choice. The next The Drainer will gain a charge of Blood Road. Unlimited Use. Cannot use until D4. (Cannot brainwash Prince, Hunter, Poacher, MM, CL.)

**Blood Road(Day)** - Will be guaranteed to visit the target tonight. You wont attack anyone who tried to prevent/occ/redirect you tonight. 2 Use. Can use D1.

**Blood Drain(Night)** - Attack a player, killing them. Unlimited Use.

**Blood Storm(Night)** - Attack a player, will be guaranteed to kill them. You will also attack everyone who tried to occ, redirect or prevent you (Prince Jail is an exception, the second attack is a normal attack). 2 Use. Cannot use N1.

*You must eliminate player in the main faction and any Neutral that seek to your harm.*

            <p>If you didn’t know, you can make the class name bigger like this:</p>
<p><code># [color=red]The Drainer[/color]</code></p>
<p>Which will print:</p>
<h1><font color="red">The Drainer</font></h1>
