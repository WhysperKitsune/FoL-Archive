            <p>I like the idea of poison similar to Butler’s poison, due to not knowing if you’re going to be killed, but I’d say let Immobilize be used on the same target since it opens more opportunities when using it continually, such as preventing Butlers to keep your abilities in the late game. I assume that Immobilize bypasses through most, if not all, occupy immunities, so it can be very useful in the late game kill hustle. That’s all I have to say.</p>
