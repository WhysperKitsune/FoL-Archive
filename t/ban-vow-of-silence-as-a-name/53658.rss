    <title>BAN Vow of Silence as a Name?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/ban-vow-of-silence-as-a-name/53658</link>
    <description>Hello TOLers !
I think everyone at this point, at least in one of our games,  has seen this name being used : Vow of Silence. If you guys didn&#39;t see it or don&#39;t know the meaning behind it, it was inspired by the popular twitch streamer MOONMOON, who likes to put &quot;Vow of&quot;  and then something else as a meme. Now while all this is hilarious and playful and I know it means no harm, the specific name &quot;Vow of Silence&quot; has been causing major issues and problems in the game. Players with this name will not do anything at all, and while I understand many players of Throne of Lies like to role play for the fun of it, the name itself has gotten out of hand to  the point where players will simply afk, sit there and probably even leave the game , even if they have an important class. The major downside of this name is that factions like Unseen or Cult who only have 2 members at the start game have already been reduced to one member as people with &quot;Vow of Silence&quot; will simply refuse to do anything just to fulfill their goal for the meme. I myself have seen this name causing other players to get angry and type death threats to the memer, as a response to their role-playing having gone too far. 

My solution to this problem therefore, would be to ban the name &quot;Vow of Silence&quot; from being entered.Now I know that it won&#39;t stop other players from finding other creative ways to meme or find a loophole, but in my opinion, by banning this specific name, it will stop a lot of troublemakers who potentially ruin the game for other people 

That being said, I am open to debate on whether this name should be banned by the developers, as I know that being silent or not typing is not gamethrowing or breaking any sort of rules, but it has become quite a nuisance to deal with. Feedback and suggestions are also greatly appreciated as to how to deal with this! Thank you and have a great day!</description>

            <p>while I get it, there’s so many variants of it, dozens of things with “mute” in the name. Laryngitis etc… Usually as a player I usually can work around these types of players with <em>hands a chalkboard and chalk</em> They usually co-operate with that.</p>
