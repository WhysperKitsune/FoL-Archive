    <title>[Class Suggestion]: Queen (Unique) (Special)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-queen-unique-special/3764</link>
    <description>The impact of this class would probably be to high to be actually implemented, but I&#39;ll throw it in for the funsies.

Faction: Blue Dragon

Passive: Royal Blood
Passive: Knows the alignment of the king.
Passive: Night Immunity for the first 3 nights.
Passive: Mute: Cannot talk or whisper. Both during the night and day. She neither can talk to the prince or psychic too.

Day Abilities:
**Ability 1**: Good Ear: Passive: Can read all whispers.
**Ability 2**: Passive: If executed for treason the blue dragon loses the game. Alchemist, mercenarys and neutral killers, cult/unseen win the game. Fool and Scorned only if they accomplished their goal by that point.

Night Abilities:
**Ability 1**: Spy (1 Use): Can read the cult/unseen chat anonymously. She will not see their names only what they say. They will not know she use this ability.
**Ability 2**: Whisper (Unlimited uses): Can inform someone that someone else is suspicous. In chat this appears like:
&quot;Dayton Edwards (11) is suspicious.&quot; to the receiving person. The king cannot be marked as suspicious.


Notes:
- Trollbox works on her like on anyone else.
- She&#39;s optional meaning she doesn&#39;t has to appear in every game. She probably should be rare.
- This role would make afkers still have an impact since people may believe they&#39;re the queen.
- She can be converted to an evil queen.
- The evil queen can talk normally and will appear in cult/unseen room.
- The evil queen can be executed for treason without any special implifications.

Strategy and implifications on the game:
- Her testament will be her greatest asset. She can out the king and reveal additional information about other people as well. The longer she&#39;s alive, the more information she&#39;ll gather.
- Blue Dragon would have to be very careful who they execute especially early in the game.
- Cult/Unseen have to be very careful who they kill during the night after the 3rd night because they don&#39;t want the queens testament to be revealed.
- Multiple people from both factions could stay silent at the start of the game to make others believe they&#39;re the queen.
- Trollbox could make someone look to not be the queen.
- She can occuse people to be suspicous, but the target will not know how certain this information is.
- If the king is evil he want&#39;s the queen to stay alive at all cost. So he&#39;ll likely use guards on her.
- The prince could probably kill her early on and gain some information but he&#39;ll lose his ability to execute.
- The queen would be a good target to convert as she could become the new king and since she can read whispers she may know good targets to kill.</description>

<p>Passive: Knows the alignment of the king.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Good point with the room for two passives. I guess she knows the alignment of the king doesn’t need to be a passive since it’s just a start “bonus”. She techincally doesn’t need to have royal blood for her role to work but it just wouldn’t make sense otherwise.</p>
<p>Or you could get rid of the night ability 1 and move the night immunity to the night abilities.</p>
<p>Anyway my goal for this class was to have a queen that is similar to chess the central figure that you’ll have to play around and that can be used by either side to their advantage. Like I said, I don’t expect this to be implemented I just loved the concept and wanted to share that with you.</p>

            <p>Well The class cards have room for two passives, I suggest nixing where she knows the King’s alignment as that would be a bit OP. I think Mute should be relaxed so she can speak like 5 times a day.</p>

            <p>It at max has 2 passives. I do agree a separate gamemode centered around a Queen would be cool!</p>

            <p>I don’t think it promotes afk. It just negates some of the negative impact afkers have on the game.</p>
<p>No BD would not loose if she’s converted. I’ve added that in the notes.</p>

            <p>This would be good for a seperate mode.</p>
<p>Mode could be called “God Save the Queen”. There would have to be some changes though, using it to promote AFK as potential strategy is not in the spirit of ToL, where not talking loses games.</p>
<p>Also, would BD still lose if Queen is converted? You need to be more specific on these stats.</p>
