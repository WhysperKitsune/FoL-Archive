    <title>Phys Exhume charges spent too quickly</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/phys-exhume-charges-spent-too-quickly/79614</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was Phys and decided to Exhume. However, I changed my mind same day, and deselected my target and then chose another. I used up all three charges by this.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was expecting my first charge to be refunded, ie. not spent, and only one charge in total to be spent.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Exhume something, deselect it, exhume something else. All in the same day.

#### Comments:
None. Hope the above is sufficient information to go on.</description>
