    <title>Stated time of ban has expired, but I&#39;m still banned</title>

    <description>&gt; [color=red]*For better/faster support, try Discord: https://discord.gg/tol[/color]

What happened:

I was banned exactly 1 year ago today.  I used to be pretty flagrant in my offenses and take full responsibility.  After a year of not playing I just want to get back in and play the game again.  I&#39;m fully rehabilitated and ready to be an upstanding member of the game.  Apologies for my earlier transgressions.  It said my ban was up TODAY: 8/9/19, but it seems to be that I&#39;m still banned.

What was SUPPOSED to happen:

My 1 year ban would be up after the stated time.

Thanks in advance for your time.</description>

<p>Our old system was not very sophisticated: It seems you received a “permaban” that was being displayed as a 1-year on the 8th disciplinary action received. Any suspension above 30 days is permanent.</p>
