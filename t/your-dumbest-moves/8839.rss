My stupidest moment of brain blank was 

I once got jailed night 1 and being an evil I chucked out that I was sheriff as my cover .

            <p>I do love this game for stuff like this . flip side to your plan is that if you are too special to claim to the court . makes you a big target<br>
like when people name all the bd they visit but leave  the Prince as bd confidential …</p>

            <p>You can give log information in private. It’s better to whisper the king that you’re the priest and they need to leave you alone, rather than announcing you’re priest immediately to everybody.</p>
<p>Give it a few seconds and if king isn’t responding then tell everybody.</p>
<p>Good way to find an evil king as well.</p>

            <p>Yea I don’t really see the alternative. If you don’t give enough info from log you are getting executed because most likely you are evil in that case.</p>

            <p>My dumbest thing was my 1st game possessor and I tried to make someone attack the king but I ended up making the king attack instead. On night one. Where everyone has their observers on the king. I died the next morning within 10 seconds.</p>

            <p>Oh goodness</p>
<p>This isn’t actually me, but still</p>
<p>I’ve seen some people do some really dumb things in my time with ToS and ToL, but the Prince I had just a few days ago takes the cake</p>
<p>So this guy jails me and asks for my claim and Journal, which I provided. He lets me live and all is good.</p>
<p>The next night, he jails me again and asks what I did the previous night. When I tell him I didn’t do anything, he executes me.</p>

            <p>Influx of new people makes it hard to tell. People so readily out themselves when they start playing this game.</p>
<p>If I’m a bad guy and we have 1, 5 and 10 on our team, if I see 7 whisper the wing and then 5 gets executed?.</p>
<p>7 is as good as dead.</p>
<p>People also spit out their entire logs when they’re on the stand drives me crazy too. Have had lots of BD members get themselves killed this way.</p>
<p>“OMG I’M PALADIN DON’T DO THIS / N1 - 2 - NS / N2 - 3 NS / N3 - 5 - UNSEEN!”</p>
<p>Welp. Even if they don’t execute you now you’re a dead man. And now we know to kill 2 and 3, thanks.</p>

            <p>I now completely refuse to believe turn 1 peaks and sheriff investigates.<br>
If the guy followes it up with ‘exe me next turn if I am wrong .’ it makes me determined to get the accuser exed first</p>

            <p>Every time a scorned accuses somebody d2 and I fall for it. I never feel more stupid than those moments.</p>
<p>Which reminds me I was priest yesterday. Psychic linked me N1 with king. I tell them my role etc etc. d2 scorned says I’m suspicious and everybody executes me. I was even pleading yo king, psychic, say something!  They so blindly were accusing me that king and psychic didn’t even realize i was the guy they talked to last night. Everybody was so surprised when I turned out to be priest…</p>
