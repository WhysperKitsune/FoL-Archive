    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-possessor-the-scorned-shortly/68765</link>
    <description>&quot;The Possessor is a master at using Voodoo Magic and Deception who lurks around The Court trying to find the killer of his master. He was just a normal man until he decided to get some training to protect his kingdom which he lived in, but not normal training. He appealed to The Court Wizard. The Court Wizard refused to train a peasant like him. The now Possessor got mad and when a shady fellow offered him training he accepted without thinking twice. He was a good master : careful , patient , alert and vigilant. The Master taught him all he could. One day , he would teach him how to jump from body to body and another day , he would teach him how to control people without being close to them. One day , he arrived at the training only to find his master and one of the King&#39;s executioners next to him. The Executioner took his master into a dungeon and let him starve to death. But little did the Possessor know , his master jumped into The Executioner&#39;s body , which became The Scorned holding a grudge against The Court and Blue Dragon. Being considered a traitor , The now Possessor got exiled. But just in type , he got rid of his old body and jumped into a new one. The new body was a member of The Court. He arrived as soon as possible to a Court meeting where The King let his fellow subjects know about the Corruption in the Court. Everyone looked at each other in silence. Some members cried , some got mad but some stared at each other. The Possessor seized this opportunity to get revenge on The Court and grinned.&quot;</description>

            <p>Good job.<br>
Writing two classes in the same lore is pretty tough, but you did really well.</p>
