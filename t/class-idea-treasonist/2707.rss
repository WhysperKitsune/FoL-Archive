close to none. Because of this knowledge your blood boiled with hatred and jealousy. In other words you want to see him be killed.

How this character wins:
The character&#39;s target will always be the king. It does not matter what faction the king belongs to, you just have to get the king executed.
If your target dies, you will have to wait until another king is chosen.

<ul>
<li>I designed the character with the intention of appealing to evils, this character is meant to disrupt/cause chaos to BD.</li>
<li>I’m going to rework the ability to show how it helps the class</li>
</ul>
<p>Also thank you, for your contribution. Every little bit helps</p>

            <p>In all honesty im new to reviewing classes but I gotta review this one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Its a neutral that appeals to evils</li>
<li>1 Night ability isnt fun, seeing as though it does nothing</li>
<li>The Night ability has nothing to do with its goal.</li>
<li>Too similar to scorned in win conditions</li>
</ol>
