    <description>**The Hypnotist (Neutral Killer) - Kill all Non-Neutral players to win**  

**Passive (Royal deceit):** 
Can pretend to be royal blood and stand up as a royal. (Will become Pyscho King)

**Passive (Mistress Of Immunities):**

**Day Ability (Supreme Hypnosis):**
Use magic to Bypass Death and Target Changing immunities (Gain a use everytime you kill someone) (Starts with 0 uses)

            <p>The Inquisitor thing is considered a problem with the game by meny (I think it is a more fundimental problem rather than an execution problem as does RHCube but whatever) as it’s kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And the HH thing technically doesn’t work on Reaper (However CW empower does) and is rare anyways.</p>

            <p>Technically - and I know I’m being pretentious here - Sorcerer can get yolo’d by Inquisitor on N1.  There’s also N1 yolo happy hours which make all neutrals vulnerable to defeat N1.</p>

<p>It isn’t an even footing though, current mechanics there is currently NO class that can lose N1 from a single attack and doesn’t have at least a skill of some kind to give the option for immunity etc…</p>
<p>(Do note a huge difference between dying, and losing. If you die N1 as any BD, unseen, cult, your side carries on without you). Merc and Sellsword win if the right faction does. Alc has stoneskin, fool has hide, scorned is immune.</p>

            <p>It should not inform them that a Hypnotist controls them. This makes no sense “lore” wise and is only adding more confirmability that it is a Hypnotist game. His royal blood will be useless if people are aware of this. He won’t be able to reliably claim drunk or noble and people will look for a princess claim then.</p>

            <p>Well perhaps the ability can force them to die, but at the same time give you the results of the night and previous nights. If I was a hypnotist and I was a neutral killer, I’d want to know the information of my enemies.<br>
It should tell them that they were forced to speak too. It’s just to make it a bit less like possessor attacking.</p>

<p><strong>night ability (Controlled Murder):</strong><br>
Force a character to Kim themselves (they would’ve been told this). Does not count a visit.</p>

            <p>Would turn it into a neutral and not nk if it didn’t have the psycho king. But, if the night ability is tweaked a bit so it isn’t similar to the possessor attack, then it would be a better class.</p>

            <p>You know bypassing death immune with every kill is broken right ? And he doesn’t have any chance to live endgame due to he is not immune to poison/bleed or death immune.</p>

            <ol>
<li>I see what your saying and im going to edit it to make it a bit more different from it.</li>
<li>I disagree it helps you find people that are immune to target changing so your not blindlessly using the day ability. Which is precious.</li>
<li>night immunity?</li>
</ol>

            <p><strong>The Hypnotist (Neutral Killer) - Kill all Non-Neutral players to win</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive (Royal deceit):</strong><br>
Can pretend to be royal blood and stand up as a royal. (Will become Pyscho King)</p>
<p><strong>Passive (Mistress Of Immunities):</strong><br>
Immune to everything (Death, conversion, Occupation and Target Changing)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability (Supreme Hypnosis):</strong><br>
Use magic to Bypass Death and Target Changing immunities (Gain a use everytime you kill someone) (Starts with 0 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Controlled Murder):</strong><br>
Hypnotise a player to kill another player. The player hypnotized will be told they have been hypnotized (Unlimited Uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Persuasive Conversation):</strong><br>
Find out if a certain player has any immunities (4 uses)</p>
<p>And that’s my Class suggestion, Hope you like it as it’s my first one I would love any sort of feedback that I could get on how to improve this class. If there is anything i need to make clearer let me know</p>
