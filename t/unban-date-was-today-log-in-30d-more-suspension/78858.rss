            <p>Ban evasion extends the suspension by 30d since it sorta defeats the purpose of moderation - it’s essentially a slap in the face.</p>
<p>That’s like breaking out of jail, getting caught, then wondering why sentence was extended.</p>

            <p>I mean, I am still confused since it was originally a 24h ban than got extended to 30d and now its +30d more unless I just keep getting suspended for longer and longer. It seems a little harsh considering this is the first ban I have had… because I was tabbed out while in jail (My Bad))</p>
<p>But if that’s just the way it is then I guess I’ll keep waiting</p>

            <p>There was a ban between those two from another alt of yours that once again triggered the ban evasion system. As you can see your “first” ban says <code>Ban Evasion + Ban Evasion [...]</code> while your “second” one says <code>Ban Evasion + Ban Evasion + Ban Evasion + Ban Evasion [...]</code>.</p>
