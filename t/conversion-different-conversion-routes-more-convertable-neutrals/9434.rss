    <title>Conversion:Different conversion routes, more convertable neutrals</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/conversion-different-conversion-routes-more-convertable-neutrals/9434</link>
    <description>We currently have the following neutrals:
Reaper(should stay immune, NK)
Possessor(same as above, NK)
Mercenary(already fully convertible)

Alchemist

Fool
Scorned

Here is my suggestion:
Fool and Scorned are immune to conversion if they complete their goal.
As long as the did not, they can be converted into the Cult, **but not into the Unseen**
As a compensation for converting neutrals, they would keep their Trollbox day ability upon conversion(like Royal Blood, which is kept upon conversion).
Alchemist would be convertible for both, because the acceptance of an alch working for BD can be horrible for Unseen(3xNight immune+2 kills/unlimited heals); all examples I can recollect so far were horribly onesided for BD. Alchemist, as a compensation for converting a neutral, would keep Coagulate and Stoneskin Potion on them.

Its Unseen class would be:
**Poison Brewer (Unseen Killing)**

**Passive**:Coagulate

**Day Ability 1**: Stoneskin Potion(No change)
**Day Ability 2**: Harvest Nightshade(1 use) Give the assassin one more usage of Nightshade, at the end of the day.

**Night Ability 1**:Poisoned medicine(unlimited uses):Heal someone. This also heals bleeding. If they are healed, they will die of a silent poison two nights later. That poison can only be detected and healed the following night.
**Night Ability 2**:Suspicious Potion(unlimited uses): You will poison someone with a dubious, potent poison, killing them next night by poison. Any guard(Knight, Guards of the King, Mercenary) kill you without being killed themselves, and prevent poisoning. Any other visitor will see you.</description>

            <p>Something needs to change. The number of convert immune players in each game makes for very boring games.</p>

            <p>The two night abilities are not without risk. The poisoned medicine will only work on someone who actually gets attacked or is bleeding, extending their life, but also killing them. It can be used offensively, or defensively(bleeding Assassin, or Mastermind)<br>
The second night ability does kill. However, it is not only highly visible, no, if the person is guarded then you die without compensation; making it a high-risk move. Additionally, it does alert everyone that the Alch has been converted!</p>

            <p>In this case I think that that has a lot of potential</p>
<p>I don’t think it should be unlimited use (oh God), but I like the idea if you continue to keep it to one use or so.</p>
<p>Your two suggested night abilities basically seem to make it a second Unseen killing role though, I’d tone that back a bit.  I might even make Harvest Nightshade a two-use night ability and get rid of both of these killing things, adding something else that’s unlimited-use back in as a new second night ability.</p>

            <p>Is that opinion serious or not? Is that sarcasm or not? I am not sure.<br>
Besides, it’s one-use.</p>
