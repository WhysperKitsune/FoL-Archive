    <description> #### What happened?![Bug%20Screenshot%201|690x388](upload://yOL3e0L8bswj3ZAYALderJA8tNR.jpeg)![Bug%20Screenshot%202|690x388](upload://fd0TYpzJGdfnYwvWcWbOF0YQ85j.jpeg) 
Essentially, actions processed multiple times and as mm, due to the fact that I was on my third night without converts, I was able to gain one normal convert then a second pseudo-assassin who couldn&#39;t do anything but day actions.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Night actions only happen once.
#### Steps to reproduce:
I have no clue.
#### Comments: 
Made the game pretty broken when gained majority a turn earlier. Super funny. Bug was not restricted to me, everyone in the game had their actions process more than once. 14 becomes the pseudo-assassin</description>
