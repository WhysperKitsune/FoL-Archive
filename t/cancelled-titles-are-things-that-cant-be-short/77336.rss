# Reward:

The MVP&#39;s of the last game in a specific category will be featured on this thread. They will also carry the title of &quot;Reigning Champion&quot;. Being in two categories at once as MVP will give the player the chance for a custom title upon requesting one of the moderators. This will last as long as their claim to two MVP categories lasts. Each game refreshes the ranks. 

----

# Regulations:

After each game, a 24 hour long private voting phase will be held by the hosts to determine the MVP for each category: Town, Scum and Improved.

- All players and up to two hosts will vote. 
- Host votes count double and break ties.
- Anyone who does not vote automatically loses two points for all categories they do not vote for. You cannot vote for yourself. 
- Any mention of the MVP system while the game goes on will disqualify you from giving or receiving a vote to prevent it tainting the gameplay. The host will announce this in whatever chat it was said. This does not include non interactive dead chat.
- Top scum is available for any player that does not have the town win condition
- Having different win conditions due to for example conversion can make you eligible for both Top Scum and Top Town, but you can only win one. 
- Modkilled or replaced players do not participate in the MVP system. 

----

# Disclaimer:

This is on a trial basis and this system may be abolished for whatever reason at any time, if it does not have the intended effect. Strategic voting, collusion or an unhealthily competitive atmosphere would be such cases for that. We have enough criticism already. It is meant to encourage and celebrate accomplishments, so let us show support and strive to get those :crown: (or the much superior :tophat: )!</description>

            <p>I find evil boring because I play mafia more for the game solving aspect more than the lies and deception part. I’d much rather scum hunt and feel the thrill of catching scum than trying to trick others to thinking I’m town.</p>

            <p>Or motivation to play better as town ^^ I was only two times evil, and both times pretty decent, and no times neutral. I wonder why others are considering evil classes as boring, for me it’s the other way around.</p>

            <p>I mean yeah, but SOMETHING needs to be done and this is a step in the right direction. I like the idea of more permanent incentives than a temporary title and temporary leaderboard, but anything that can get wolves motivated to play instead of open claiming knights and not making posts is a plus here.</p>

            <p>I don’t think a post-game title to the best wolf helps though</p>
<p>Either it causes infighting or one player is just so much better at being scum that the others try as little or even less because “they’re just going to get Scum MVP anyways”</p>

            <p>I mean…motivation to actually give a fuck when you roll scum and “wolf incentive” could definitely go a long way to improving wolf players. As it stands, most wolves don’t enjoy playing wolf and as such They ruin the game by not caring to play properly.</p>

            <p>You and litten had an initially negative response and Ici has been neutral.</p>
<p>I’ll chalk that up to resistance to change.</p>
<p>A lot of endgames that I see talk about blame and “you should have done this”, which has its own place and uses, but I would like to see more positively reinforcing feedback as opposed to negative and this is a way for that to happen. If it doesn’t work out as intended, read,</p>

<p>I’m questioning who this is directed at</p>
<p>But something tells me it’s not at the people pushing a system that has had <em>no</em> positive reception, by their own admission.</p>
<p>The problems with turning any team-based, social experience into a direct competition are blatant and numerous. The same problems crop up in every tournament, yet we still insist on crowning an “official” MVP.</p>
<p>It hasn’t ever really worked, it won’t now. The confusing part here is that it’s apparently not an attempt to recognize good players, but instead to “spread positivity”.</p>
<p>If you hadn’t noticed, it’s very hard to point out logical problems that will arise from an entirely illogical plan.</p>
<p>You aren’t going to get much to work with when you’re seriously asking for the problems people have with hearing blue and smelling green.</p>

            <p>This is just a more formal organized positive paper plates. Original paper plates can be had just the same still.</p>
<p>Really it’s just an optional system that can help. If you see a way that it hurts, mention that, but I have seen no such arguments.</p>
<p>Also all responses to this thread so far were neutral or initially negative. Food for thought.</p>

            <p>If we’re gonna go there, you and I both know I’m one of the more likely people to get a third title from this <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/roll_eyes.png?v=9" title=":roll_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":roll_eyes:"></p>
<p>That aside, still not a fan. Don’t really see a way this promotes <em>positivity</em>. If you wanted that, celebrate the person who was the friendliest via paper plates or crack down on negativity more harshly (or both). This literally doesn’t even touch on the “problem” that it supposedly exists to help fix (and honestly I’m not sure I remember negativity being widespread at all).</p>

            <p>If that’s your preferred way of doing things, you are completely free to do so. This system is completely voluntary. MVP’s will be announced in the game thread where they were won anyways, but here a record stays, so effectively it will still be discussed in the game thread. We could use some more positivity in my opinion and this is way to guide towards that. If it doesn’t work, we abolish it. Simple as that.</p>
