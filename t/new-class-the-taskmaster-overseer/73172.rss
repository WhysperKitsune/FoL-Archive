    <title>[New Class] The Taskmaster / Overseer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-class-the-taskmaster-overseer/73172</link>
    <description>**Faction:** *Blue Dragon/Unseen*

**Class Type:** *Offensive*

**Passives:**
**Dutiful** : Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. You will keep this passive even if your class changes.  
**Week of 100 hours**:You cannot target the same player two nights in a row with **GET TO WORK!**. If you do, the targeted player will have a heart attack and die. (Does not bypass death immunity, can be healed)

**Day abilities:**

**Duplicate efforts** (3 uses): Remove the player-cooldown of **GET TO WORK!**.

**Night abilities** :

**GET TO WORK!** (infinite uses): Chose a player, that player will visit his target no matter what happens. The next night they will be exhausted, preventing them from visiting their target.

**Intermission** (2 uses): All visits on you affect the chosen player instead. 


Unseen converted has the exact same skills, like Alcoholic.
There is no notification to **GET TO WORK!**, the targeted player will visit his target, even if it is jailed. If a player doesnt try to visit anyone, **GET TO WORK!** has no effect, neither does using it twice on them with **Duplicate efforts**.

Point of the class? Imagine a big guy/girl with a bigger whip shouting at the Physician/Sheriff/Assassin &quot;GET TO WORK!&quot;

Edit1: Reworded some stuff, should be a lot clearer now.</description>

</aside>
<p>I understand but this isn’t <strong>Mercenary</strong>. This is a new class that doesn’t earn anything from their abilities , thus I suggest adding it to the description.</p>

<p>You only make sure that your target VISITS, he can visit someone thats being healed/knighted, so its not frenzy, you can kill someone in jail, or ignore a butler occ, but thats it, it just prevents preventions. Also if you use it twice, Assassin dies and you become Assassin.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Misunderstanding here. I meant that if you use <strong>Duplicate Efforts</strong> 3 times in a row and there are no healers/knights in the game , you could secure 3 kills AND you give KPN to the Unseen which is not good.</p>

<p>GET TO WORK! is just the CW empower on Supports but for everyone, and even tho imo its op as fuck, we need this kind of skill</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This does more damage to the BD than you think.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
Butler occupies X.<br>
You use Get To Work on X.<br>
Butler whispers the king that X was successfully occupied.<br>
X whispers the king to say what they did last night.<br>
There are 2 outcomes :<br>
<em>1)</em> The Butler is gonna get executed and they will be suspicious of X. If X is BD and they get jailed + exe’d , that’s your fault for killing 2 BD.<br>
<em>2)</em> X is gonna get executed and they will be suspicious of The Butler. The Butler will die because of <em>you</em>.</p>

</aside>
<p>And last of all , to add a little twist to your ability : I would suggest making it 1 use , silent and vice-versa.</p>

</aside>
<p>So basically it is guaranteed visit with potential  kill power, albeit delayed. That’s fair and mostly balanced (it should not bypass immunity)</p>
<p>What I do see as necessary is cutting down this wall of text.</p>
<hr>
<p>Intermission, on the other hand, should be changed to be less confirmable. In its current form, it confirms you off of two potential visits (yourself and target).</p>
<p>I’d find a way to change it to “all visits on you affect the target chosen”</p>
