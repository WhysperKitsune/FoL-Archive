    <description>**Possessor**

Number 1
Put logs in private logs

This prevents the Jumped Possessor from getting any info and &quot;fake claiming&quot; the class they possessed into. this means possessor would have to quickly fake logs or have to jump again, basically making the only advantage of possess is the fact you inherit a different body.

Number 2
Poss Password

Poss password has not been recently used for whatever reason and idk why, what&#39;s a mastermind/apostle going to do with your possessor password, anyway very simple possessor doesn&#39;t say password this means they are evil, easily caught, and  if there is a mystic it&#39;s even easier, the only problem is the one who you said to your password to dies. 

**Solution**
&gt; I think their should be a rework were the possessor is able to look at the private logs of possessed opponents so they can&#39;t simply hide their logs, there should also be a way were the possessor can see all previous messages of the possessed target, allowing poss passwords to be redundant</description>

            <p>Win rate is overall strength. It may not be EVERYTHING but it is what determines if a faction/neutral needs buffs or nerfs. Sidegrades of course have different motivations as by definition they aren’t supposed to change the winrate</p>

<p>The second part I don’t disagree with, full chat log of the possessed including whispers I’m entirely fine with… private notes however I’m not. The whole point of private notes, is to eliminate the need for using out of game tools. In town of salem almost any experienced players had notepad or something open to put notes on and copy them into game without them being in the will when they die. Out of game tools gave experienced players an advantage over newbies and there’s no way to prevent that.</p>
<p>If private notes no longer are perfectly secure, then you just bring that back… you give an unfair advantage to people with faster computers, easier skills of flipping between devices etc… Bottom line you can’t stop people from having a perfectly secure place to put notes on… so the dev’s gave us one to ensure those who have it aren’t at an advantage.</p>

<p>that one comes with a pretty huge cost to BD, Yeah logs are huge for self proving, but they are also kind of made to be a reference for others to use after the person dies as well, that’s kind of their primary value.</p>
