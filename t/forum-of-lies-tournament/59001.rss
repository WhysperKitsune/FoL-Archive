# The Forum of Lies Tournament


Welcome one and all to a tournament which is like the game  Throne of Lies, but with a catch. This tournament is played on the forums instead with similar classes, with additional classes that are not in game. 

The roles:

16 players will have a chance to participate for one of two keys that I have. Players who sign up will then be playing in this forum in order to gain points through faction wins, as well as points for completing certain tasks. You will have access to a Discord Server once you have signed up on Google Forms. It will be a first come, first served basis. This tournament is open to everyone, those who occasionally look at game suggestions while making them themselves, or those who fancy a bit of a change. After the first 16 players who sign up, another five will be selected as backups if a player needs to replace out or any other circumstances. 

As well as being a player, you can be a spectator to the game. You may think this may not be fun, but this contest is for you as well. You will be placed into the same channel as the players, but once each game begins, you will be unable to speak to them as they will be locked out. You will have a chance to look at the game as it progresses, as well as seeing announcements with vote counts, flips, and in case of player replacement. You will also be competing against one another, and the spectator that wins the most points in their challenge, will receive a third key reserved to them. 

The setup:

Players will be playing three games. Two will be classic Forum of Lies, where one game will be Unseen, and another will be Cult. Whichever one comes first, is unknown. We would suggest to remove some of the abilities which you may remember from the game, and read the Class Cards which will have different abilities, as well as classes. The first game will mention some of the few things different between the game and the Forum Game, so bear that in mind. The third game to be played is known as a Special Forum of Lies game. This game mode can use any approved game modes, but we have selected that the game mode for the tournament will be the Return of the Blue Dragon, where this time, the Blue Dragon is the informed minority (this is a term used to describe the team that knows each other, while the majority faction do not). During these three games, points will be awarded to the winning classes/factions, while additional points (as said before) can be earned from completing certain criteria as a particular class. Between each game, the players will be able to see their ranking after each game. The two players with the most points after three games will be receiving a key each. Spectators however, will not have their scoreboards revealed publicly after each game, until all three games have been completed. 

Rules: 

These will be made before each game, and for every game as a reminder. However, since this is a forum event, this means you will be following forum rules as well as the in game rules.

Forum rules (as a reminder as you should have read them first but also changed slightly to fit within this event):

1. Swearing is permitted. However, keep it classy – don’t overdo it and no targeting people. No racial slurs, discriminatory slurs, etc.
2. No bullying, stalking, being overly creepy (esp. sexualizing), or harassing. 
3. We’re LGBT friendly – allow people to be themselves.
4. Respect everyone, but esp. the Game Hosts/Fol Team. Don’t openly argue with with staff . They have the final say!
5. Don’t share accounts and don’t create multiple accounts. (You will be banned if this is discovered)
6. No posting NSFW content. (You will be removed as a player/backup if you are one and banned for the rest of the tournament)
7. No Gamethrowing
8. No backseat modding. If there is an issue, report it to a game host. In emergencies, @Fol Team (as they happen to be moderators to the site as well), but only after @Hosts and we either a) are not online for a good while, or b) we are unable to help with the current issue (but we will try and message the team first)

If you cannot abide by them, you will be banned from the server, and you will be removed from the tournament.

Social Media: 

If you wish to follow the Tournament with live vote counts, flips, start times, the follow @nutt_alexander and @TolPug on Twitter. 

As well as this, in the sign up sheets, we have included an option for interviews with frequent players (as well as potentially the creator of Forum of Lies, the FoL team, and the Game Hosts). Some of the interviews if possible (and wanted) can be done over the interview VC, so even when the tournament concludes, please stay around for a while, because we may have some interviews from the winners, and closing thoughts between the two hosts. 

Remember everybody. This is some fun on the forums, so enjoy yourself, and we wish you the very best of luck to the tournament. Sign ups will end on 25th April at 10pm BST (British Standard Time)

Important questions asked during signups: 

[quote=&quot;Hippolytus, post:7, topic:59001, full:true&quot;]
How long would each day and night be if you play it on the forums? Is it 90 seconds like normal ToL?
[/quote]
No, the game will be standard forum game days, meaning 96 hour days and 48 hours nights.</description>
