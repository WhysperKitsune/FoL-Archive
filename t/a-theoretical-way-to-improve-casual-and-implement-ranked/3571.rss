    <description>Many people may resist some of those changes, but this post is ment to be direct and improved upon. If you got any suggestions please write them down below :wink:

**Casual Improvements**
This may sound like &quot;Throne of Lies is going to become like Town of Salem!&quot; But hear me out. There will be 2 casual gamemodes: Informed and Uninformed (Thanks @Simon for the suggestion!).  I want to implement a role list for the Informed as that will be the casual game mode with the role list, and it will have the following classes:
1 Prince
2 Investigative Classes
2 Social Classes
3 Support Classes
1 Offensive Class
2 Random Blue Dragon (To spice it up)
1 Master Mind
1 Assassin
1 King
2 Neutrals (To spice it up)

This role is random enough that you cant really guarantee some role unless they confirm themselves, while not too much easier then Ranked. By having a role list, we give players a chance to learn and master roles, while making it fairly balanced in terms of difficulty. 

As for the Uninformed gamemode, it will be as it is right now: A casual gamemode with no role list. This will probably be for the Nostalgic or people improving their skill. 

**Ranked Implementation**
Now for this, we will leave the role list behind to make this gamemode as Casual is right now, all any. We will still have a guaranteed Prince however, as the Prince is one of the if not the strongest Blue Dragon classes in the game. Players will have 10 placement matches to get their rank. Here&#39;s what I think the Ranked scoring system should be:
5 for a BD win
7 for an Unseen win
8 for a Cult win
9 for a King win
10 for a neutral win
2 for a loss (Only in placements, I recommend a - 5)
0 for a leave. (Only in placements, I recommend a - 10 for leave) . Here&#39;s my reasoning behind this point system. Blue Dragon wins most of the time, so they get a low score. Evils are much harder to win, and it&#39;s very difficult to win as Cult, so Cult gains 3 more points for winning, however Unseen only get 2 extra points. I see King die a lot in game, so a King win (King spawn win) will be 9 points. Lastly, neutrals are very hard to win at as well, some more then others. However, they deserve the win either way, giving them 5 more points as they are technically not a faction and mostly work on their own.

**Why such low points**
This has to do more with psychology then balancing. You are more likely to think that higher numbers are a lot better then smaller numbers. This is mostly correct, but when it comes to things like HP or ELO, people can overestimate themselves and end up losing due to their over confidence. This game is a fair game, and it should be that for all aspects of the game, ecen psychology wise. Now to the ranks!

**Ranked Ranks**
0 ELO - Unranked (For obvious reasons)
1 ELO - Beggar
25 ELO - Peasant
50 ELO - Thief
75 ELO - Blacksmith
100 ELO - Overseer (Highest possible rank after Ranked placements) 
125 ELO - Priest
150 ELO - Merchant
175 ELO - Squire
200 ELO - Knight
225 ELO - Spellcaster
250 ELO - Monk
275 ELO - Land Lord
300 ELO - King Advisor
325 ELO - Military General
350 ELO - Prince
375 ELO - King
400 ELO - Living Legend.

This may seem like a grind, but remember you only need 5 BD minimum to rank up. This will take time for people to rank up to Living Legend, but so does every new Ranked System. (60 consecutive BD wins to get to Living Legend by the way)</description>

            <p>You get my point, they aren’t an enemy unless they are Sellsword, as they only guard their target or kill their target’s accusator at night, which I don’t see many Merc use as they can be called out br Observer for example. Almost every merc just wants to live until the rest of the game in peace</p>

            <p>Again, you are punishing people and convertees for something out of their control, and now you also include random chance. Sure, it might be easier to win but Ranked isn’t ment to be easy, it’s ment to br competitive and test your skill.</p>

            <p>I see… I don’t know… It over complicates things a bit and the max you can get as bd is 6, but that’s only the max. Honestly the enemy thing probably only works well for Neutrals</p>
