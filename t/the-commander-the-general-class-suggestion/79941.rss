    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;]The Commander[/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Killer [/color]**
&gt; Passive: Demotion - If you Kill a Blue Dragon member then both of your night abilities will be disabled for the rest of the game. 
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Challenge - If target player attacks someone tonight they will be redirected to you (1 use)
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: Single Combat - If target player visits you then become immune to death and conversion tonight and attack them (Unlimited)
&gt; Night Ability 2: Command - If your first target visits anyone other than your second target attack them. Unusable until Night 3 (3 uses)

&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;] The General [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Killer [/color]**
&gt; Passive: Steadfast - Immune to occupation and redirection 
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Taunt - Target Player will be redirected to you tonight. (2 uses)
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: Oversee - If the Assassin is unable to kill their target for any reason or did not select a target you will attack target player. If the Assassin was redirected then only you will attack. (Unlimited)
&gt; Night Ability 2: Revitalize - You will be immune to death tonight and appear as a member of the Blue Dragon. (3 uses)

Note: I am aware that the Generals Passive can out him. I have attempted to balance with that fact in mind.</description>

</aside>
<p>To use this Ability properly you also target the player with Single Combat thus making you immune to the attack (unless it bypasses death immunity).</p>
<p>Think of it like a 1 shot old drunk debauch that has a bit more counterplay through occupation/redirection but also Kills you outright.</p>

            <p>But by getting yourself killed, you’re redirecting them <em>away</em> from another target, who is probably also BD (and also realistically people would basically always use it in conjunction with the first night ability)</p>

<p>I think this should probably make you immune to attacks and conversion from that player, rather than in full generality</p>
