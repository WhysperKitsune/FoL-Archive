    <title>[Class Suggestions] Prosecutor and Barrister</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestions-prosecutor-and-barrister/56380</link>
    <description>So this is my first time trying this out, so hopefully this doesn&#39;t turn out horrible.

Prosecutor 
Special 

Passives:
Hearsay!  - You and the Barrister can have first say during all trials, your name will be highlighted as Prosecutor.
_(You would be given a certain time limit to deliver your evidence / opinions)_
Personal Contacts – Immune to death at night.

Day Ability:
Blackmail – Force someone to vote another of your choosing. (2)

Night Ability:
Search Party – Occupy someone and all who decide to visit. (2)

**Goal:**
Execute more candidates on trial than the Barrister has saved on trial.

Defendant 
Special 

Passives:
Hearsay! – You and the prosecutor can have first say during all trials, your name will be highlighted as Barrister.
_(You would be given a certain time limit to deliver your evidence / opinions)_
Personal Contacts – Immune to death and occupation at night.

Day Ability:
Blackmail – Silence someone during trial. (3)
Night Ability: 
Interrogation – Check someone’s alignment. (Infinite)

**Goal:**  
Save more candidates on trial than the prosecutor has executed on trial.

You may have noticed that the defendant is at a slight advantage over the prosecutor, being occupy immune and having more use&#39;s of their ability.
My thinking was that you would never vote someone just to take them back down again so the defendant would need some advantages over the prosecutor.
(unless it was a reaper check I suppose) 

I based this off @psychoneirik and @Marcus_Doodalee roles and comment Thinking how awesome it would be to have 2 people in chat showing evidence, asking for confirmation for logs and such,
not to mention it would be filling the special column which seems to only be reserved for king right now.

If you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to say.</description>

            <p>My idea was, Why would you put someone on trial with no information? The prosecutor could always mention the candidates will (or lack of), the options the barrister received if they investigated them or the lack of deaths say someone decided to occupy them, say the prosecutor for instance</p>

            <p>Nitpick here, but Defendant means the person accused in a criminal or civil trial. A better class name would be Barrister.</p>
