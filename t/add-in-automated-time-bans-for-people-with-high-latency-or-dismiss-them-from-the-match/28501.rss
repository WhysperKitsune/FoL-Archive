    <title>Add in automated time bans for people with high latency or dismiss them from the match</title>

    <description>Just played a game where someone disconnected &amp; reconnected for almost the entire match, extending the otherwise normal 90 second days to 3x that duration or more. Not trying to be mean or anything here, but people with connection problems like that only take the fun out of the game for everyone else. The client literally freezes everything when someone is reconnecting forbidding the player from doing anything.

It will be 2018 soon, I believe most people should have good internet by now or at least a connection that can handle playing a small 16 player online match that Throne of Lies offers.

The bans don&#39;t have to be huge. Maybe 30 minutes ~ hour at most. Whichever, it should not be okay for people to indefinitely stall a match, intentional or not.</description>

            <p>I think they do that to give people a chance to ‘catch up’ while downloading data but that would work too.</p>
