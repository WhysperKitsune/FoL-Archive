            <p>So we’re giving you two options because we didn’t want people posting their classes on threads because we want your entries to be 100% yours.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your original DM entry cannot be altered anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can make an entirely new Class but do not post it.</p>
