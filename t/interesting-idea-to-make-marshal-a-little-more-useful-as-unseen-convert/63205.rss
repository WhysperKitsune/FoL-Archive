    <title>Interesting Idea to make Marshal a little more useful as Unseen convert</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/interesting-idea-to-make-marshal-a-little-more-useful-as-unseen-convert/63205</link>
    <description>The Marshal&#39;s current Investigative abilities run a little too similar to the Mastermind&#39;s.  Why not change the Marshal&#39;s abilities, probably Snoop, but Probe would be better, and give him the ability to change what people look like tomorrow if they are executed in court.  Call it Slander or something else so its not too similar to the Scorned&#39;s nightly ability Frame.  This way people won&#39;t just shout and point out that, &quot;That sheriff hasn&#39;t found anything in X days.&quot;  It could only frame characters who could be converted, so no Evil Prince or Evil Alchs/Kings, and would only last the following day in court, but wouldn&#39;t actually make them look unseen if they were investigated by say the Sheriff.  This would give the Marshal the ability to actually lie about what they were doing, which the way I see it is the primary theme the devs are going for with the evil factions.  Just an interesting thought I had after watching/playing the game for a bit.  Would also have the potential to slow down whether or not you automatically take the sheriff at his word, since he could just as easily be a lying Marshal who has Slandered someone.

Interesting addendum, all possible Slanders the Marshal could perform would likely have logs that their evil counterparts would lie about having.  A Sage would lie about MBing, A Servant would lie about Partying, a Alcoholics and Drunks practically have the same abilities, Poacher&#39;s would lie about Bearing and possibly even Wolfing, Duchess would lie about Wisping and can already basically Flirt with Bat Eyelashes, Aristocrats and Nobles are just like Drunks/Alcoholics and have the same abilities, Enforcer&#39;s would lie about guarding people.</description>

            <p>Also none of us are defending Snoop. Personally I think it would be better on Duchess (a class who needs much more work than Marshal)</p>

            <p>In other words. Step 1: get converted to marshal. Step 2: Find all the converts you will likely want in the near future. Step 3: Sucide accuse. Step 4: Convert them.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because a converted classes Ability’s are baised on exact class and not class type. Knowing if you are converting an Occupier VS a Royal VS a death framer is very important and isn’t specified by Foresight (all of those classes convert to offensive). While Support is always useful for anti-protection it’s important to know if you are getting Mind Warp and a bad fake claim or Intreage and a good one.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Alright I guess this is the opinion, but I find that most Unseen converts should be able to effectively claim their former class.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact that it is possible you will claim, to either King, Prince, or Mystic, or you will out someone using your abilities. Like a Knight CSing someone and them not dying, or a Drunk DBing someone and be attacked, or a Sheriff investigating and finding Unseen.</p>
<p>Specifically for the Sheriff, it is highly likely you will out yourself in the current meta by D2 as your Investigates are highly useful to the court, and can be funneled through King relatively safely even if you only find NS.  Meaning you out yourself early.</p>
<p><strong>Once outed you can’t change your class</strong>, and as previously stated Sheriffs are incredibly likely to claim and claim early and willfully because even NS info is useful to the court.<br>
I’ll mention the only successful BD class claim change I’ve seen be successful is the Hunter/Prince gambit, which is silly but might work.</p>
<p>Now a Marshal has 2 paths before them, suicide accusation, or say nothing and be put up for uselessness by roughly D5.  Neither of those are very appealing, and the only thing the Marshal offers Unseen is a 1-1 trade, and class discovery</p>
<p>This is relatively weak compared to say Frenzy, Snare Trap, Dark Wisp, The Aristocrats entire package which does what the Mashal does far better and faster and manipulates votes in your favor, Immunites removal/Occupation in Alchoholics, Falsified Healing/Dead Changing in Phys, Mind Warping combined with Private conversations with potential evil Neuts for Illusionist, and Occupation for the Servant.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the above strat, suicide accusation, is not reserved solely for the Marshal, it can equally work for an Alchoholic or a Duchess. So the Marshal’s abilities are weak in general, and their strat isn’t even unique to their class. That leaves class investigation, which is only useful for finding the Prince and Hunter, any other BD will require little to no forethought for attacking, as people may be guarding Prince potentially, and everyone accept Hunter lack the ability to harm you if you attack them.</p>
<p>Why do you care if you discover a Phys vs a Butler or a Princess vs a Drunk.  What does it matter, you have to eliminate them all anyways as Unseen what particular class you target will be superfluous to what your MM and Assassin need to do, save admittedly for Prince and Hunter.</p>
<p>In addition, why do you need logs if all you care about is what class the character is if they’re BD, or if they are Neut.  You won’t care what kind of Neut they are, and they won’t write that in their log anyways, so Snoop is useless for that, until maybe that weird Sellsword strat comes out.  And you don’t need to know what a Prince/Hunter/Phys/Butler/Princess/Sherif has done only who they are, which Probe already does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you can get rid of NKs</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Which can only come from poor logs that an NK would have, as a Sheriff won’t be able to realize an NK is present, based solely on his abilities Surveilance, Scout, and Investigate.</p>
<p>However the Marshal in this situation was pretending to be a Sheriff, and so can’t directly come out in court and state what they found in his logs.  In fact, I don’t think any BD has that ability, so he can never use the logs he’s discovered as evidence during court.  You would out yourself as the Marshal and be summarily exe’d.</p>
