    <title>Observer unable to see themselves attack someone else (No Apostle/Illusionist)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/observer-unable-to-see-themselves-attack-someone-else-no-apostle-illusionist/33015</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

So I was playing Alchemist in a cult/possessor game and on the first night I was attacked (I stoneskined) + psychic talked to me. The observer said they watched me and said I had no visitors that night and i know that psychics don&#39;t show up as visits, but my attacker also didn&#39;t show up.

Possessor claimed they used that observer to attack me night 1, so why didn&#39;t it show up for that observer that they visited me then?

#### Comments:

There was no Apostle on the 1st night as to when it happened (was a conversion mid game on a psychic).</description>

            <p>Actually, I’ve saw myself get possessed to kill a Princess as Observer.</p>
<p>The devs must have changed something in the recent patch/it is a bug.</p>

            <p>Obs don’t see themselves visit. Otherwise follow would always show themselves. It’s probably because of that.</p>
