    <title>Angel Dayless TURBO [CANNED, gonna run a new turbo]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/angel-dayless-turbo-canned-gonna-run-a-new-turbo/85365</link>
    <description>## Welcome

### Rules
You must follow the https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244
Please, for your local pigeon, follow the https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926

### Gameplay
Days will be 0 seconds long. Who needs days?
Nights will be 10 minutes long, or shorter if everyone wishes such.
Actions are done in their respective places (if not specified, it will be done in a DM with me)

### Roles
&gt; # [color=&quot;green&quot;]Town Neighbor/izer[/color]
&gt; You share a neighborhood with all other Neighbor/izers. Each night, everyone in the neighborhood may come to a consensus on who else gets to be a Neighbor/izer of their respective alignment. They gain that card immediately upon agreement.
&gt; 
&gt; A gun is given to one random person with this card. Only they know that they have a gun. Once they die, the gun is moved to another person with this card. Once everyone with this card dies, any vanilla Town in the neighborhood is given the gun. They can use this gun to shoot anyone else in the neighborhood. This can cause their target to flip as either &quot;died&quot; or &quot;shot&quot; (if an Angel dies from the shot due to the compulsive bodyguarding, it will always show as &quot;died&quot;), by choice of the gunbearer.
&gt; 
&gt; You win if the neighborhood has no Mafia in it.

&gt; # [color=&quot;green&quot;]Vanilla Town[/color]
&gt; You cannot do anything until you receive the Town Neighbor/izer card.
&gt; 
&gt; You win if the neighborhood has no Mafia in it.

&gt; # [color=&quot;red&quot;]Mafia Neighbor/izer[/color]
&gt; You share a neighborhood with all other Neighbor/izers. Each night, everyone in the neighborhood may come to a consensus on who else gets to be a Neighbor/izer of their respective alignment.
&gt; 
&gt; You share a night chat with your teammate. Each night, you may come to a consensus on who to kill. You may pick *anyone*.
&gt; 
&gt; You win if the neighborhood has no Town in it.

&gt; # [color=&quot;red&quot;]Mafia Goon[/color]
&gt; You are not in the neighborhood until you are given the Mafia Neighbor/izer card, but you share a night chat with your teammate. Each night, you may come to a consensus on who to kill. You may pick *anyone*.
&gt; 
&gt; You win if the neighborhood has no Town in it.

&gt; # Angel
&gt; You are not in the neighborhood until you are given the Angel Neighbor/izer card (just pretend it exists).
&gt; 
&gt; You are randomly assigned to protect one random person. You have a night chat with that person. If your contract is to die, you will die instead.
&gt; 
&gt; You win if your contract survives to the end of the game.

            <p>I mean… you can just not add people to the neighborhood. That way you only lose if there is more Mafia than Town in the neighborhood at the start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only that, it’s also insanely townsided.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I… disagree.</p>
<p>Tho it heavily depends on amount of people in hood to begin with.</p>
<p>Main issue is that adding to hood is ~rand to begin with.<br>
And some people will most likely just do nothing for the whole game.</p>

            <p>Nah, they are actual outs.</p>
<p>I think noone really wants to play a game where some people cannot even talk at all.</p>
<p>I mean… 0 minutes long day and a lot of people not being in hood to begin with.<br>
Also only hood can decide who is added to hood.<br>
And only hood can have guns.</p>
<p>Means anyone with vanilla role is not able to do anything. Not even talk.</p>

            <h2>Welcome</h2>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>You must follow the <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244" class="inline-onebox">Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules - Please Read First</a><br>
Please, for your local pigeon, follow the <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926" class="inline-onebox">Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules</a></p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Days will be 0 seconds long. Who needs days?<br>
Nights will be 10 minutes long, or shorter if everyone wishes such.<br>
Actions are done in their respective places (if not specified, it will be done in a DM with me)</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="green">Town Neighbor/izer</font></h1>
<p>You share a neighborhood with all other Neighbor/izers. Each night, everyone in the neighborhood may come to a consensus on who else gets to be a Neighbor/izer of their respective alignment. They gain that card immediately upon agreement.</p>
<p>A gun is given to one random person with this card. Only they know that they have a gun. Once they die, the gun is moved to another person with this card. Once everyone with this card dies, any vanilla Town in the neighborhood is given the gun. They can use this gun to shoot anyone else in the neighborhood. This can cause their target to flip as either “died” or “shot” (if an Angel dies from the shot due to the compulsive bodyguarding, it will always show as “died”), by choice of the gunbearer.</p>
<p>You win if the neighborhood has no Mafia in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="green">Vanilla Town</font></h1>
<p>You cannot do anything until you receive the Town Neighbor/izer card.</p>
<p>You win if the neighborhood has no Mafia in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="red">Mafia Neighbor/izer</font></h1>
<p>You share a neighborhood with all other Neighbor/izers. Each night, everyone in the neighborhood may come to a consensus on who else gets to be a Neighbor/izer of their respective alignment.</p>
<p>You share a night chat with your teammate. Each night, you may come to a consensus on who to kill. You may pick <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>You win if the neighborhood has no Town in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="red">Mafia Goon</font></h1>
<p>You are not in the neighborhood until you are given the Mafia Neighbor/izer card, but you share a night chat with your teammate. Each night, you may come to a consensus on who to kill. You may pick <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>You win if the neighborhood has no Town in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1>Angel</h1>
<p>You are not in the neighborhood until you are given the Angel Neighbor/izer card (just pretend it exists).</p>
<p>You are randomly assigned to protect one random person. You have a night chat with that person. If your contract is to die, you will die instead.</p>
<p>You win if your contract survives to the end of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>To Join</h3>
<p>To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like “I want to join” or “/join” or “/in” or “sign me up, coach” or whatever you want</p>
