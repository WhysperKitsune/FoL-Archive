    <title>[Classes] Minor Butler Rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/classes-minor-butler-rework/40952</link>
    <description>With the new update, the King has been put in a different place. Now, he can take action by himself. The only direct hardcounter to an Evil or Neut King BD has, is the Butler, but I think we all agree that he is extremely underpowered when comparing to the Drunk. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Drunk is well balanced. But I think the Butler needs something more.

Dutiful: (same)

Serve Wine: (same)

Concentrated Wine: (N) (2)
Throw a party. Everyone who visits you will be occupied tonight. Bypasses occupy immunity, and takes priority over Drunk/Alcoholic&#39;s Happy Hour.

Nightshade Wine: (D) (1)
Poison the King. Usable starting from Day 3.

Drugged Wine: (D) (3) (Experimental)
