            <p>I don’t like the show or the fandom (I don’t know much of the fandom but I can’t like it if it is based on a show I dislike)</p>

            <p>The Rick &amp; Morty fandom isn’t shit. All fandoms are shit.</p>
<p>Rather, they contain elements that are shit, and some ‘take over’ the spotlight. When you see someone lipsyching while cosplaying Rick and/or Morty - that’s an attention seeker who is grabbing onto a show they can use for click bait. When you see a dude in a McDonald’s <em>literally shouting “reeee”</em>, that’s someone acting up for a viral YouTube video. (And - who here fell for it?) They aren’t “the fandom”, they’re exploiting “the fandom”.</p>
<p>Rick &amp; Morty enjoyed a cult following. Then it got popular - basically this year. Now people are grabbing on, and people (like some here) are going to flip their hair and go: “Tsk. Sheeple.”</p>
<p>It’ll happen again and again for every popular piece of media that attains that level of recognition.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><em>adjusts non-prescription glasses</em></p>
<p>Rick &amp; Morty has maintained a constant over-arching theme making fun of bad television and movie tropes. “Pickle Rick” is, by design, a nonsensical and idiotic meme from its very inception. (See also: “Poochie” from the Simpsons.) The fact that people have been triggered by it shows just how well the creators have manipulated internet culture.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t understand “Pickle Rick” is intended to be a stale and annoying meme must similarly think “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub” is a totally organic catch phrase.</p>
<p>By rejecting a meme that was intended to be rejected, people do not show they are unique, different, or particularly intelligent. They show that they actually do not understand Rick &amp; Morty, which is in and of itself quite a delicious bit of irony. Ah-ha. Ah-ha ha ha. Mmm.</p>
<p><em>sips straight vodka from a mug labelled “World’s Smartest Dad”</em></p>
<p><em>has no children</em></p>
<p><em>isn’t sure how sex works</em></p>

            <p>Nah, you’re blind because you don’t realise Pickle Rick is more stale than the bread I left outside 5 years ago.</p>

<p>Well should’ve expected you to not get it, after all. If you like this “meme” your IQ is too low to understand shit that isn’t richard and mortimer.</p>
