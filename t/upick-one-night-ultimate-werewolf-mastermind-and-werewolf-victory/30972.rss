    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/upick-one-night-ultimate-werewolf-mastermind-and-werewolf-victory/30972</link>
    <description>##Welcome

###Rules

###Gameplay
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it
The game will work in phases
There will be a phase for the Werewolves who will wake up collectively and see eachother (they do not do their powers here unless stated otherwise)
After that there will be a phase for all roles where they do an action
I will post the possible actions for each role on a need to know basis to all players

###Executions
To accuse someone DM &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot; to me.

When everyone is accusing someone or time runs up the person with the most votes is killed. In a tie both are killed. You may vote not to kill and if 5 people do so then no one is killed.

Once someone is killed the game will end

You cannot change your vote once you have DMed me.

###After The Night
You will be NOT told what happened to you

###To Join
To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want

###Upick Rules
Everyone will DM 2 roll names to be. One will be marked werewolf and one will be marked villager. I will pick one to use from every player for a total of 6 names. I will then make them all into a full role. This will take some time.

There will be a hard limit of 4 WW&#39;s at once. That means that there will be no more (but possibly less) than 1 role that can join or be converted to the WW team.

There will be a Neutral role will be designed by me and is called the Mastermind.

If a WW dies then all WW&#39;s lose and all Villager&#39;s win. If ALL WW&#39;s survive then all WW&#39;s win and all Villager&#39;s lose. If the Mastermind is killed then everyone but the Mastermind Win&#39;s and the Mastermind loses. If the Mastermind survives then he wins, this does not negate anyone else&#39;s win.
