    <description>So I&#39;ve played a few games as the new Mercenary and on the whole I like the direction it&#39;s going. I love that Merc has finally been freed from the shackles of being some discount BD sidekick. Managing resources and earning your money is also quite thematic to the class. 

There&#39;s a lot of room here to refine Merc to be fairer to the player, since wins are a little tough to get right now.

Here are my suggestions for tweaks:

**- Grant Mercenary brilders at the start of the game.**
This seems like the quickest fix that can be applied. Right now you&#39;ll be lucky to achieve a successful block every night, and you&#39;re at risk of being attacked so you might perish before you even get a chance to earn enough brilders to protect yourself. 3 or 4 seems a relatively fair starting point.

**- Give Merc a high risk means of generating brilders quickly**
Outlined in my previous point, generating brilders can sometimes feel sluggish and RNG dependent. My proposal to combat this is as follows:

New Day Ability - **Stock Up**: Pay 2 brilders to upgrade Stand Guard to &#39;Rebound&#39;. Each player hit by Rebound will generate 3 brilders.

Night Ability - **Rebound**: Prevent and kill everyone visiting your target.

Bringing back Merc&#39;s rebound gives the player means of being more disruptive in order to reach 8 brilders quickly (at the risk of BD executing them if caught) or as a means of generating last minute brilders lategame when there are less chances to miss a rebound. It also fits the Merc thematic of doing small end protection jobs, and then using the funds earned to pull off bigger and more dangerous jobs.

            <p>the problem with contracts is that if they’re on anyone from the main factions then the game just swings massively in that faction’s favor</p>
<p>it’s not a matter of opinion, it’s objectively unbalanced</p>

            <p>In addition to that I think he should have ways of losing Brilders that are not by choice. For example death and occupy attempts could both remove a Brilders. That way he can’t just AFK once he gets the 8-10 he needs</p>
