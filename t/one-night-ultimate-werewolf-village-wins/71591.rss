&lt;big&gt; _A game of Forum Mafia squeezed into a 3 day period._
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

# Rules

1. Be respectful to all players in the game. 
2. By signing up to this game you agree to be fully active. If I  see you being inactive I will note it down for future games I host. Since there will only be one phase in this game you MUST be active.
3. NEVER communicate about the game outisde of the game. If someone does, screenshot it and send it to me. This is **cheating** and will be seen as such.
4. Do not angleshoot or attempt to use information gathered outside of the game to gain an advantage in the game. Using someone&#39;s meta is perfectly fine, however.
5. Have fun!

# Mechanics

There are two phases: The Night and The Day.
The Night will last for 24 hours. The Day will last for 48 hours.
During the Night, the thread will be closed and nobody can post. All players may send me their **Night Action** during this phase. After this phase, roles may be secretly swapped, so you may not even know who YOU are!
During the day, the thread will be open and players must attempt to figure out what happened during the Night. All players may vote during the day at any time. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the day will die.
- If a [color=green]**Villager**[/color] dies, the [color=darkred]**Werewolves**[/color] will win. 
- If a [color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color] dies, the [color=green]**Villagers**[/color] will win.
- If a [color=red]**Minion**[/color] dies, the [color=darkred]**Werewolves**[/color] will win. 
- If a [color=gold]**Tanner**[/color] dies, the [color=gold]**Tanner**[/color] will win. (no, I am not putting a jester-yer-like in a game of mine ever again. Enjoy this while you can.)

Lynching nobody is an option. 
- If nobody dies during the day and there are [color=darkred]**Werewolves**[/color] alive, the [color=darkred]**Werewolves**[/color] will win.
- If nobody dies during the day and there are no [color=darkred]**Werewolves**[/color] alive, the  [color=green]**Villagers**[/color] will win.

# Roles

This is a game for 10 players, however 13 roles will be used. Out of these 13 roles, 10 will be given to the players and 3 will be &quot;in the center&quot; as Center Cards 1-3.

[color=green]**Seer**[/color]
[color=green]**Robber**[/color]
[color=green]**Troublemaker**[/color]
[color=green]**Drunk**[/color]
[color=green]**Hunter**[/color]
[color=green]**Mason**[/color]
[color=green]**Mason**[/color]
[color=green]**Insomniac**[/color]
[color=green]**Doppelganger**[/color]

[color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color]
[color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color]

[color=red]**Minion**[/color]

[color=gold]**Tanner**[/color]


Their rolecards are below:

# Rolecards

[details=&quot;Villagers&quot;]

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Seer**[/color], alligned with the Village. 
&gt; 
&gt; At night, you may perform one of the following actions:
&gt; - Peek at another player&#39;s card, learning what it was at the start of the game.
&gt; - Peek at two of the three center cards, learning what they were at the start of the game.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Robber**[/color], alligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; At night, you may swap your role with another player and then look at your new role.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Troublemaker**[/color], alligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; At night, you may swap the cards of two players other than yourself without looking at them.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Drunk**[/color], aligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; At night, you must swap your card with a card from the center without looking at any card, meaning you NEVER know your role.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Hunter**[/color], aligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; Should you have the majority of votes at the end of the day you will shoot the person who you are voting 
 before you die. This will decide which side wins the game.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Mason**[/color], alligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; You start the game knowing which other players started the game with the Mason card. This includes any Doppelgangers that become Masons.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Insomniac**[/color], aligned with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; You will peek at your own card at the end of the night, learning your true identity.

&gt; You are a [color=green]**Doppelganger**[/color], alinged with the Village.
&gt; 
&gt; During the night, you MUST immediately peek a player&#39;s card. You will immediately become that player&#39;s role and win with that player&#39;s team.
&gt; 
&gt; You may perform any night actions appropriate to that role. As such, you must send your first pick in as soon as possible so I can send you the appropriate information.
[/details]

----


[details=&quot;Werewolves&quot;]

&gt; You are a [color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color], aligned with the Werewolves.
&gt; 
&gt; You will learn which players started with the [color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color] card including the Doppelganger at the end of the Night.
&gt; If there are no others with the [color=darkred]**Werewolf**[/color] card, you may peek at a card from the center. Please always submit an an action for this just in case.


&gt; You are a [color=red]**Minion**[/color], aligned with the Werewolves.
&gt; 
&gt; You know which players started the game Werewolf-alligned including the Doppelganger at the end of the night.
&gt; Note that as you aren&#39;t a Werewolf you do NOT need to survive for the Werewolf team to win. 
&gt;
&gt; If there are no Werewolves in the game at any point you will be considered a Werewolf for win condition purposes.

[/details]

----


[details=&quot;Neutral&quot;]

&gt; You are a [color=gold]**Tanner**[/color], alligned with yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; You hate your life and want to die. If you die by any means during the day, you will win and everyone else will lose.
