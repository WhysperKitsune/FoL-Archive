**Goal**

The world has fallen into ruin. Disease, greed and a lack of good memes mean most struggle to survive - except those super rich few. At the heart of this cesspool of despair is a tower. This tower has 12 floors, the floors each have 3 rooms
You are all there for reasons, most of you are there to kill the Tycoon - one of these Elite scumbags.
The Tycoon sits in the middle room of the top floor. There is also a private jail... For his less pleasant visitors to spend some quality time in.

[/details]

**So what will sanity mean?**

Well. Certain traps will make you lose some. Being wounded might make you lose some
Each player starts the game with 10 sanity.

If you drop below your roles minimum sanity level there is a 20% of you failing your action per number below you are (IE: If your min level is 5 and you have 3 sanity you have a 40% chance of failing your action). Your score can never be less than 0. If you fail a turn due to insanity, you will have a 50% chance of doing something harmful to your role&#39;s goal. If you have nothing else near you, you may kill yourself if you roll too much &#39;bad&#39; insanity. 

**Mentality**

Each role card has a individual aggression description. They mean the following

*Psychotic* - You may attack other players without reason or warning

*Ruthless* - You may attack other players without warning, providing you have good reason to suspect they oppose your victory condition or mean you harm

*Justified* - You may attack any player you have reason to suspect of being Criminally aligned

*Self-Preservation* - You may attack another player only if you think they mean you harm.

*Not a Drop* - You must avoid violence unless you have no choice. Retreat from a fight if you can

[u]Obstacles[/u]

[u]Riddle Door[/u]

The Door allowing you to go &#39;Up&#39; is protected by a Riddle you must answer to proceed through it. This door will be indestructible and cannot be opened with a key. You can give only one answer each turn

[u]Wall[/u]

The way up is blocked by a wall which you&#39;ll have to climb to proceed. Walls will prevent traps triggering until you pass it. You will be unable to search a room unless you climbed the wall. Walls can be destroyed by a bomb in the same room. Overcome roll needed = 60%

[/details]

[u]Mechanics:[/u]
Actions are sent to me via PM, once all actions are sent in, they are resolved, if an action happens in a room that isn&#39;t yours, you won&#39;t be told.
If detained in the Prison, you will be trapped unless another player kills the tycoon. You will be considered dead for any role that cares about that until then.
All roles are unique, except Cop and Guard

[u]Actions:[/u]

Move to [room]:
You can move to an adjacent room, i.e. above, below, left or right, the exception is the tycoon&#39;s room, which must be accessed from Left or Right 12

Search:
You can around the room you are in. You can search multiple times until you find something.

[action] [name of what you&#39;re interacting with]:
You can interact with people and things

Loot:
You can loot a dead body in the room to take all of their non-role specific items

Inspect:
You can look at a body to identify their role. This will reduce sanity loss from killing them if you had to kill this player to win

Brace:
You can ready a counterattack, if you are attacked that turn, you have a chance to counterattack your attacker. If a ranged attack you will always take a hit first, but if melee you have a chance to land a blow first.

Check for traps:
Depending on your character, you may be more likely to find them than others. Always remember that even if you don&#39;t find any, there could be one AND you still risk setting them off by looking for them. An Intruder player will never start in a room with a trap. The sensitivity of a trap is halved if you discover it during a check unless it&#39;s sensitivity is 100% to begin with

Calming:
Usable only if your sanity has dropped below your acceptable level. 50% chance of restoring a sanity point.

[u]Notes:[/u]
The Tycoon is an NPC, not a role
The roles are most likely not balanced, they will be revealed after the game has ended
Talking is not an action and can be done freely
The only way to safely leave the tower is through Mid 1, you cannot leave until I say you can
Once the game begins, you may hint at events in game that you are experiencing, but must not leak specifics like if someone attacks you etc.

            <p>You never wished ill will to anyone. Right…</p>
<p>Except telling me that killing PKR is act of mercy and I should do it? Outing his role, status and plans?</p>
<p>Also, which part is in your opinion my fault?</p>
<p>Not knowing about rule which wasn’t even writen in OP?<br>
Twice for that.</p>
<p>And 2nd time you didn’t even explain to me that this rule exists, you just denied my action and modkilled me.<br>
I don’t see it as my fault.</p>
<p>If I don’t know about rule which makes my action invalid, then how it’s my fault for sending invalid action?<br>
Cause from my PoV you modkilled me using rule which didn’t even exist, not telling me about my actions being invalid beforehead.</p>
<p>So if you think it’s my fault that you didn’t put all rules into OP… then good job, I guess.</p>

            <p>I didn’t. You certainly mean Cfm…</p>
<p>I said that you would have rejected your own action had you been hosting to.</p>
<p>I never wished ill will on anyone in the game - maybe you should reflect on what you did and think whether you caused your own problems.</p>

            <p>So where is all the talking about that I didn’t accept your actions before (And explaining how does it affect current game)?</p>
<p>Where is admiting that you was outing peoples roles / wincons / current status / plans?</p>
<p>Where is you saying that you didn’t explain to me why my action is invalid?</p>
<p>Yeah. Thanks Mole.<br>
Tiny case?</p>
<p>You shouldn’t try to take a revenge and now saying it’s my fault.</p>

            <p>You may have a tini tiny case about maybe deserving more time. You had time to answer a minor post… But not a pm? I find that doubtful. And do you think you deserve the benefit of the doubt when you abuse someone who just wants everyone to have fun? The only reason you hadn’t already been modkilled was because I didn’t want to disadvantage Marshal</p>

            <p>Host ignoring your actions to modkill you for inactivity, forcing me to appeal to mod team, mod team deciding that he shouldn’t of killed me, but Mole deciding that whatever, keep eevee dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had soooooo much fun.<br>
Fair hosting 100% of time.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a> If you loved my strats so much as you write in your summary, why the fuck did you want to keep me dead? Cause you didn’t.</p>
<p>Truth is you wanted revenge for anime fm, when I refused to accept action post-deadline.</p>
<p>GOOD JOB, YOU DID IT. You made me want to never play your games again.<br>
But you got your revenge. Good job.</p>
