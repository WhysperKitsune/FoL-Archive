    <title>1.0.10c Reaper/King win conditions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/1-0-10c-reaper-king-win-conditions/17485</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Was in a game as  Reaper vs BD King, Reaped CL and just executed Knight. Had two souls to bypass immunity and lost to BD.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I as reaper should have won since it is basically 1v1 and have 2 souls to bypass any immunity and win during the night.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Play as or vs a reaper with a King left, stay as 1v1 king / reaper see outcome.
#### Comments:
Please do no tell me that is intended, since i was going to lose if I reaped the king, due to having 1 cult player and 1 bd knight that we going to vote me during the day or kill me during the night, since it was going to be known that am reaper.</description>

            <p>I’m with <a class="mention" href="/u/bbiaglla">@bbiaglla</a> on this one. Auto-ending games should really not be happening with every single game. Even if the computer thinks the win is clear, human error still finds a way to fuck things up and lose the game, which makes for more memorable and harrowing moments in the game.</p>

            <p>The only way it should auto-end is if neither side can kill each other.</p>

            <p>It’s a bullshit mechanic and excuse. They need to fix it. I honestly hate all auto resolve. Let the game fucking play out.</p>

            <p>Just saw a Reaper with 2 souls going into night with lone king and Reaper lost.</p>
<p>Seriously can we just remove the whole autoresolve for Reaper at this point?  Sucks to see the hardest win in the game get robbed because no one is willing to fix it.  If reaper has 2 souls HE WINS EVERYTIME, but no, the game makes him lose even though the <em>only</em> loss condition is he <em>dies of a heart attack</em> before clicking empower on his reap and clicking on the king.</p>

            <p>Yeah Reaper/King interaction has always been wonky.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the same thing in previous patches where going into a night a Reaper with souls lost to a lone King… even though he would have Empowered Reaped the King that night and won.</p>
