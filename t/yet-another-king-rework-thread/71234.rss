    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/yet-another-king-rework-thread/71234</link>
    <description>**EDIT::** I don&#39;t like this idea anymore, since having to choose between Royal Finger or Decide Fate adds a high level of strategy to current King.  So nevermind lol.

I love the new King without Order Execute.  The differences between Good and Evil King seem to have been cleverly implemented as well.  However, I am of the opinion that further changes could be made to emphasize the concept of King as a political leader.  I very much like the Gladiator ability from Mafia, so I replaced Royal Finger with it and made King&#39;s double-accuse a passive.  

&gt; # [color=gray]The King[/color]
&gt; **[color=gray]Special[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Majesty (Passive)** - Your accusations of treason count as two.  You are immune to death at night once.
&gt;
&gt;**Loyalty (Passive)** - _(Starting Good King only)_ If you are executed, nobody can be accused of treason for one day (two days, if you are executed before Day 4). 
&gt;
&gt;**Royal Finger (Day)** - Only you or the person you accuse may be accused of treason today. - 1 use
&gt;
&gt;**Decide Fate (Day)** -  Decide whether to execute or pardon the player on the stand. - 1 use
&gt;
&gt;**Designate Heir (Night)** - Permanently grant or remove royal blood. - 1 use</description>

            <p>The king should prolly be a social class instead as this and not special. It only feels like social tbh</p>

            <p>As Cult King I once lied about CW claiming Hunter.  Of course that made the CW rightly call me evil, so I called him a fool and told the knight to cs him.  When the Knight called him death immune yet he flipped CW, it caused a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the distraction and confusion was worth me guarding the CW in the end, but it sure was funny and we did win.</p>
<p>But again I am not sure if framing people in this way is worth the risk, ultimately.  I just want to keep my options open.</p>

            <p>I like the heir ability… however, reworks are getting a bit tiring and a lot of people are getting angry about constantly relearning the game.</p>
<p>So, while I like heir, I hope the don’t implement any changes and focus on new things.</p>

            <p><strong>EDIT::</strong> I don’t like this idea anymore, since having to choose between Royal Finger or Decide Fate adds a high level of strategy to current King.  So nevermind lol.</p>
<p>I love the new King without Order Execute.  The differences between Good and Evil King seem to have been cleverly implemented as well.  However, I am of the opinion that further changes could be made to emphasize the concept of King as a political leader.  I very much like the Gladiator ability from Mafia, so I replaced Royal Finger with it and made King’s double-accuse a passive.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="gray">The King</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray">Special</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Majesty (Passive)</strong> - Your accusations of treason count as two.  You are immune to death at night once.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty (Passive)</strong> - <em>(Starting Good King only)</em> If you are executed, nobody can be accused of treason for one day (two days, if you are executed before Day 4).</p>
<p><strong>Royal Finger (Day)</strong> - Only you or the person you accuse may be accused of treason today. - 1 use</p>
<p><strong>Decide Fate (Day)</strong> -  Decide whether to execute or pardon the player on the stand. - 1 use</p>
<p><strong>Designate Heir (Night)</strong> - Permanently grant or remove royal blood. - 1 use</p>
</blockquote>
