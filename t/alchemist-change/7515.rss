    <description>Ok look this isn&#39;t really THAT big of a buff,But it puts more impact on most killers when killing alch.
Here&#39;s my idea,Give alchs a passive that ake alch immune to nightshade poison and when alch is killed they will kill their target and remove their soul(One time).(This means they are reaped for killing you)So if prince kills you he dies and cannot be revived by a priest.This would mean that killing an alch requires you to lynch during the day.
But tbh alchs dont really need a change in some peoples eyes bc they have a high enough win rate.(28% win rate according to Tryphon)
Its just triggering when a prince decides to kill you bc he says your neut,we lose nothing and then dies bc he didn&#39;t jail the assassin.This would change this situation entirely bc he would lose ALOT for bd a prince and a chance to revive the prince both gone bc he exed the alch.
And if assassin attacks you maybe make it so unseen cant convert anymore.
But maybe this makes alch to strong and not hard to play as honestly like these buffs might make so alch just auto wins like old scorned.
New idea-What if when the alchemist is exed by prince it tells the unseen/cult/NK who the prince is and that you show up as a class you pick while in jail.This would make it so that when prince exes you you expose him,he doesn&#39;t know that,and he can be killed easily.</description>

            <p>Yeah I get what you mean. Besides executing an alch still hurts in the fact they can’t exe anybody else that day. And the fool needs to be a unique character. 2 fools in a game is absolutely awful. Even 1 fool and 1 scorned- 2 troll boxes and a lot of confusing info. Really a good fun game would have 1 fool/scorned in it, 1 neutral killer, and 1 or 2 other of merc/alch.</p>

            <p>BD should not be punished for killing non-BD. Fool is bad enough.</p>

            <p>Yeah if you’re not a confirmed alchemist they might think you’re reaper possessor priest prince etc. like a real threat. I could see them using nightshade on those. But not a confirmed alch. But that’s just my opinion other people might have different strategies. In general though I’m more worried about the paranoid BD. I’d rather have an ability like the hunter has that makes BD scared to exe an alch. Or maybe make a different class that has a night ability to make a player immune to nightshade/emerald potions for the duration of the game, with 2 charges. BD knowing they can make 2 allies immune to EP would make alch less of a threat to them. Or just in general making alchemists unable to vote would make them less of a threat to BD which would slow down the executions. Just from a confirmed alch perspective I’m always much more worried about BD thinking I’m a threat. But if you’ve personally had more trouble with unseen than BD then I understand your point for sure.</p>

            <p>If alchemist gets a buff or change at all, I’m not sure being nightshade immune would be what it needs. Smart assassins would probably not waste their 1 nightshade on a potential late game ally. Alchemist problems are usually associated with trigger happy BD imo.</p>

            <p>I semi agree. Maybe stoneskin potion could make alchemist night immune and cure poisoning maybe?</p>

            <p>Sure i agree with you like i said alchs have a 28% win rate which is high enough though the poison immunity buff would help it in a small way that wouldn’t change the class that drastically.</p>
