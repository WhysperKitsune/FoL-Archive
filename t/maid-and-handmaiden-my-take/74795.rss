Target a dead person tonight, you will learn three names of players that may have killed him tonight. (2 uses, can not check the same person twice.)

Or

You will learn the feedback of a dead player. You can not learn the feedback if they were NK or unseen/Cult (infinite uses)

Frame two players. If they are compatible you will learn the classes if they are BD (infinite uses)
