    <title>[Rework Suggestion] The Sorcerer and The Inquisitor</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rework-suggestion-the-sorcerer-and-the-inquisitor/52999</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a Sorcerer and Inquisitor rework that attempts to make the Sorcerer and Inquisitor each other&#39;s worst enemy, and forces the BD to rely on the Inquisitor to deal with the Sorcerer and to a lesser degree make the Unseen/Cult rely on the Sorcerer to deal with the Inquisitor.
&gt; ## [color=magenta]The Sorcerer[/color]
&gt; **[color=gray]Neutral Killer[/color]**
**Mage Armour (Passive)** - Immune to death at night, occupation, target changing, poison and bleeding.  Does not apply to attacks from **[color=orangered]The Inquisitor[/color]**.
**Awareness (Passive)** - You will not attack targets that are death immune, guarded by The Knight, or are an Unseen/Cult member. Additionally, your visits are hidden at night.
**Magic Cloak (Day)** - You appear as a class type of your choice and a member of the Blue Dragon to investigations tonight. - 2 uses
**Magic Missile (Night)** - Fire a magic missile at a player, killing them. Bypasses **[color=orangered]The Inquisitor[/color]**&#39;s night immunity. - Infinite uses
**Circle of Death (Night)** - The target player **and** anyone visiting them will die. - 3 uses, killing **[color=orangered]The Inquisitor[/color]** activates this ability
_Survive to see the Blue Dragon lose._


&gt; ## [color=orangered]The Inquisitor[/color]
&gt; **[color=gray]Neutral Investigative[/color]**
**Holy Blessing (Passive)** - Immune to death, once. Does not apply to attacks from **[color=magenta]The Sorcerer[/color]**.
**Nobody Expects The Spanish Inqusition (Passive)** - Your visits will be hidden from others at night.
**Consecration (Day)** - The target player is immune to attacks **[color=magenta]The Sorcerer[/color]** makes against them tonight. You can&#39;t target yourself. - 2 uses
**Find Magic (Night)** - Check if a player is a magic user. The Paladin, Court Wizard, Psychic and their converted forms are all magic users. - Infinite uses
**Ruthless Efficiency (Night)** - Attack a target player. Bypasses **[color=magenta]The Sorcerer[/color]**&#39;s night immunity. - 3 uses
_Survive to see The Sorcerer die. (Commits suicide when goal is complete)_</description>

            <p>well I can say I get the point of this rework, the idea behind it is currently the the sorc’s abilities are amazingly strong at completely negating the inq’s ability to find or kill him, and completely vulnerable to everything that the BD would use to catch any other NK. I see the point of this rework is to make the sorcerer nearly impossible to catch without the Inqs help…</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, any CW/Psychic that is converted to the cult still is, but otherwise the cult aren’t. This is to prevent the BD having too many reasons to prevent the Inquisitor from reaching their win condition, and to make Find Magic more accurate to counterbalance the Sorcerer being better able to disguise themselves as BD.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t like this, it makes it harder for the BD to find the sorcerer. The day ability before was good. Observer is totally useless to find the sorc with visits are not shown and cannot find the sorc’s faction when they use the day ability.</p>

            <p>I like everything here except  that the inquisitor commits suicide when his goal is complete. Why? Because if he has a merc then he is gonna make his merc’s win a lot harder or even lose but I mean you could make inquisitor impossible to have a merc</p>
