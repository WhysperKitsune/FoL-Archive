          <p>TL;DR - I’ve designed a sequel to my original DR game and I want some feedback on some features.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#1</span> Misexecutions</h1>
<p>If a player is voted as the blackened without committing a murder, they will still be executed regardless. The point here is to make sure that players fight harder against accusations here as in the original game people didn’t really care much about being voted the Blackened, especially the earlier stages. So now in order to raise the stakes of a trial, you will die at the end regardless if you killed or not.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#2</span> Wincon Revamp and Additional Roles.</h1>
<p>Rather than the wincon taking over a passive, players with a different wincon will instead be given it as an <em>Identity Passive</em>. Identity Passives, marked with an <strong>(<font color="CYAN">I</font></strong>), are for players who have roles different than normal participants. If you don’t have an Identity Passive, then you’re just a normal participant.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#3</span> The Future Foundation Agent</h1>
<p>At the start of the game, one of the sixteen players will have their role as the <font color="steblue"><strong>Agent of the Future Foundation</strong></font>. They have higher stats than average, have a passive that gives them files regarding the game at the start of each chapter which can help find evils and whatnot, while at the same time having restrictions regarding killing potential. However it is not recommended to claim this role as it will put a bullseye on your back for the Mastermind.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#4</span> Traitors</h1>
<p>At the start of the game, one or two of the sixteen players will have their role as a <font color="black"><strong>Traitor</strong></font>. Instead of a normal wincon they will have wincons that are dictated by the Mastermind and work as a means to further their agenda. In addition, the Mastermind knows the Traitors’ identities and may anonymously talk with them. Effectively, the Traitors work as a means for the Mastermind to further their own wincon.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#5</span> Wildcards</h1>
<p>At the start of the game, two or three of the sixteen players will have their role as a <font color="red"><strong>Wildcard</strong></font>. Wildcards have significantly stronger actions and may begin with items, however their wincon is two-tiered. First they must accomplish their WC wincon, and then they will be allowed to win as a regular participant. Their WC wincon usually is about causing chaos and discord while at the same time allowing them to win as a surviving participant.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#6</span> AP/MP Revamp</h1>
<p>AP/MP will both be merged into one, and movement will only cost 1 MP regardless of the distance traveled, in addition actions should be submitted in the following format in order to help me keep up with stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>/search boxes (42/60)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the player previously having 43 MP of a maximum of 60.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#7</span> Mastermind Revamp</h1>
<p>The Mastermind still cannot kill, but if they are murdered or executed they do not lose and they can still keep on playing the game from beyond the shadows, imagine a <span class="spoiler">Junko/Mukuro</span> scenario. This is basically done to stop people from trying to end the game early on.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#8</span> ??? Rooms</h1>
<p>I’m adding 16 locked rooms in the map. They are all called “Room <span class="hashtag">#N</span>” with the N being 1 through 16. What are they will be you to find out.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#9</span> Nerfing Lore</h1>
<p>tl;dr - I’m giving less green checks based on lore in order to prevent the MM from being <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/joy_cat.png!v=9" title=":joy_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":joy_cat:">   <strong>bOxEdIn</strong> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/joy_cat.png!v=9" title=":joy_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":joy_cat:"></p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#10</span> Ultimate Actions</h1>
<p>Each player will have an Ultimate Action, which will be denoted by a (<strong><font color="goldenrod">U</font></strong>) in their rolecard. These are very strong actions that can only be used once per game.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#11</span> Doubled Blackened Cases</h1>
<p>There are some characters with the potential to also have a second simultaneous player to become the Blackened with them. For the sake of clarity before the trial begins it will be announced that two Blackeneds need to be found. If the wrong pair is mis-executed, a random player in the two will die. If one of the pair did commit the murder, they will be the execution and the other one will walk free. The only time the mistrial counter doesn’t rise is if both Blackeneds are caught.</p>
<h1>Feature <span class="hashtag">#12</span> Reworked Stat System and Formula Transparency</h1>
<p>This is something I want to add, but forgot. So the new formulas will be.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Melee Attack Kill Chance- 50%+(Attacker STR-Defender STR)/2+Weapon ATK-Defender LUK/8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projectile Attack Kill Chance- 50%+(Attacker AGI-Defender AGI)/2+Weapon ATK-Defender LUK/8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poison Attack Kill Chance- 100% unless an antidote is found. Time To Kill = (Initial Time)*(1+Victim’s CON/50)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrocution, Drowning, and Burn Kill Chance- 100%-(Victim’s CON/2+Victim’s LUK/5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Searching will always net results regardless of AGI/INT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum AP = 40+CON/4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote Weight = 80+INT/2</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The weighted vote thing is supposed to be a buff towards high INT characters as the Search nerf felt like it leaves them a bit too underpowered. Basically a high INT character’s vote counts slightly more than a low INT character’s vote in class trials. Votes will also be anonymous now and will only show at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>Stat hardcaps at 100 for starting, 150 for after-bonuses.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, one of the sixteen players will have their role as the <strong>Agent of the Future Foundation</strong> . They have higher stats than average, have a passive that gives them files regarding the game at the start of each chapter which can help find evils and whatnot, while at the same time having restrictions regarding killing potential. However it is not recommended to claim this role as it will put a bullseye on your back for the Mastermind.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, two or three of the sixteen players will have their role as a <strong>Wildcard</strong> . Wildcards have significantly stronger actions and may begin with items, however their wincon is two-tiered. First they must accomplish their WC wincon, and then they will be allowed to win as a regular participant. Their WC wincon usually is about causing chaos and discord while at the same time allowing them to win as a surviving participant. WC also cannot claim WC as otherwise they will be vanillized.</p>

</aside>
<p>Okay, my only suggestion is that this isn’t for the start of the game, but instead roles should be designed around this. Otherwise it wouldn’t exactly make sense.</p>

<p>If a player is voted as the blackened without committing a murder, they will still be executed regardless. The point here is to make sure that players fight harder against accusations here as in the original game people didn’t really care much about being voted the Blackened, especially the earlier stages. So now in order to raise the stakes of a trial, you will die at the end regardless if you killed or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is something that on another forum has been tried and tested and I think it could work well here considering what the response other players had. Only issue is if people choose to vote to eliminate a threat such as Italy after I tricked the Serial Killer mode. Some form of protection therefore has to be considered for different roles.</p>

<p>Rather than the wincon taking over a passive, players with a different wincon will instead be given it as an <em>Identity Passive</em> . Identity Passives, marked with an <strong>(I</strong> ), are for players who have roles different than normal participants. If you don’t have an Identity Passive, then you’re just a normal participant.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><em>Yes</em>, I like the idea of this because then basically those with an alt wincon still get the normal amount of actual abilities. I feel like Marshal had a very balanced rolecard despite it taking up 1 ability before so consideration needs to be towards the power of the other abilities of the alt wincon players.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, one of the sixteen players will have their role as the <strong>Agent of the Future Foundation</strong> . They have higher stats than average, have a passive that gives them files regarding the game at the start of each chapter which can help find evils and whatnot, while at the same time having restrictions regarding killing potential. However it is not recommended to claim this role as it will put a bullseye on your back for the Mastermind.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, honestly, have no real things to comment on this one except it sounds awesome as heck. It provides another layer of mystery and for the players who are not masterminds or the traitor, it encourages them to seek out this person which will mean that passive play is not the best. Also, said non traitors or mastermind will need to also cover them.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, one or two of the sixteen players will have their role as a <strong>Traitor</strong> . Instead of a normal wincon they will have wincons that are dictated by the Mastermind and work as a means to further their agenda. In addition, the Mastermind knows the Traitors’ identities and may anonymously talk with them. Effectively, the Traitors work as a means for the Mastermind to further their own wincon.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This sounds intriguing. Do you have any idea what sort of things the Mastermind might do as their wincons? Based on the sound of things the Mastermind would get to dictate their wincon so I think this is something which should be addressed. Could be too hard on the Traitors in this case or too easy.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, two or three of the sixteen players will have their role as a <strong>Wildcard</strong> . Wildcards have significantly stronger actions and may begin with items, however their wincon is two-tiered. First they must accomplish their WC wincon, and then they will be allowed to win as a regular participant. Their WC wincon usually is about causing chaos and discord while at the same time allowing them to win as a surviving participant. WC also cannot claim WC as otherwise they will be vanillized.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The last bit is somewhat of an issue I think unless the Vanillizing is private knowledge. As then the wildcard could just claim and then have the pity points of “Well, now you can see I am not a threat and I am on your side”. Implementation for this would be tricky but I love the idea because wildcards are good fun.</p>
