    <title>[Suggestion] Death Knight selection rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-death-knight-selection-rework/37868</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I was once more picking a DK who turned out to be afk.

So I was thinking we should just let the dead figure out who should be DK between them. 
When the ability is used all dead BD player could be candidates to a DK vote. Similar to the one existing for king.
It adds a bit of fun to the day for dead guys. And it removes the afk factor from the equation. 
If no DK is elected, the phys would get his ability back.

On a side note, a QOL change would be to see who is the physician who rezed. So at least you have a tiny bit of info late game to go on as DK.</description>

            <p>Alternatively, there should be a loud, distinctive sound when you get revived, so players who are AFK could potentially hear the alert.</p>

            <p>Personally I would say a good way to do it, would be to make the phys chose up to 3 targets.</p>
<p>During the start of discussion phase, the first target gets a pop up “a physician has requested to revive you, do you wish to return to the living?” and the first guy has 20 seconds to say yes or no, at the end of the 20 seconds it automatically treats it as a no, giving guy 2 20 seconds to answer the same question, if that fails 20 seconds to the last one.</p>
<p>More or less accomplishes the same thing</p>
