    <description>Hope your 2019 has been awesome ~ some news:
- Ellie/Armae have mutually made the decision to step down due to internal disagreements between us. Thank you, Ellie, for all of your contributions to the game since 2016. Under extreme pressure, she still delivered numerous additions to the game, forged an almost-perfect balance, and proactively molded the game to its current state today.

- ^ While this may leave balance to slow down as we catch up (I&#39;ll likely form a balance panel later with transparent decisions), this shouldn&#39;t affect bug fixes, stability, and quality of life updates. As always, bug fixes and stability come before all. 

- After heavy consideration, there has been some restructuring of the Guide+ roles after some new information came to light. We appreciate everything contributed in the past and your credit will remain. We believe this change will bring about a closer and stronger community ~ 

- We may have a new armor coming up ( I&#39;ll tease it later in Discord @ https://discord.gg/tol ), so this will be my first test since Ellie usually does the armors ~ we have a guest 3D artist, this time! Let me know how you like the armor, when it comes out. Wish me luck! ☘ 

- I&#39;ll have a new patch out soon(TM) with all the recent changes mentioned in v2.1.1a -- just need some transition time and we&#39;ll be back in business!</description>

            <p>While the entire situation was unfortunate for all sides, what’s done is done. We all lost friends during this process. However, there are discussions of peace. Our team is trained to act defensively only, so if peace is offered, let’s take the chance.</p>
<p>I’m going to lock this thread, as I believe the topic has run its course. Please don’t open a new thread regarding this topic to ensure peace is actually achieved, which is something we all mutually benefit from.</p>

            <p>i have pretty much all the evidence but it’s immature to completely damn the mod team’s actions. I think about half of the controversial bans were justified.</p>
<p>it’s simply the vocal response which I personally dislike, so I’m just going to get out of here for now.</p>
<p>Still think ToL is a great game and you guys are cool on the whole <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Considering you are not in the tol discord iirc i would check your evidence again.<br>
I hate that this drama has split the community as much as anyone, but there are rules, and rules were broken. Why don’t we resolve to move forward together as best we can. Those who disagree and dislike the game and/or mod team always have the choice to move on.<br>
I’ve lost friends due to this drama as well. Hopefully things can be resolved later; i support the game and still love the community, and i hope many of you do so as well</p>

<p>Just wanted to point out that I’m not really part of any group, I’m just looking for answers and really didn’t expect all this, to be honest. Hell, I wasn’t even back in the community until yesterday and found it all happening.</p>

<p>It’s almost 3am here, lol, I did not expect all this like I said. Though regardless of what opinion I have from the answers, I can’t fault you on answering Try, and like I said earlier also, I respect you for trying.</p>
<p>I’m off to bed.</p>

            <p>I forgave the now mod for what happened, and even though her feelings were hurt. She hurt a lot people first. She hurt me as well by breaking my trust, and I truly trusted her completely before it happened. I know you are reading this and I want you to know it still hurts what happened, but I still don’t hate you or dislike you for it and you will always be completely and totally forgiven for what happened.</p>

            <p>In addition, when you found out about 'the person who is now a moderator", you decided to send her a leaked screenshot from mod chat to make her “change sides” due to something being said against her in there, which you also knew would definitely make her sad. When it didn’t work you banned her from your server.</p>

            <p>I want to thank you for keeping this in a public thread and allowing us to discuss this, even if things got a bit heavy every now and then. I hope all of this is somehow resolved, eventually.</p>

            <p>You and Ellie literally rejoined after all the drama intentionally to get banned and I got proof of that as well.</p>

<p>Guides were asked to spy on a server I own that was originally an official Guide+ server, but got repurposed after I left the team.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That was in the heat of the moment and was one of the mistakes Xblade did make in this. Even if guides were personally targeting him and shouldn’t be guides at that point, they should never have been asked to do that. There was an announcement towards guides today apologizing for this mistake.</p>

<p>Lots of us considered this an injustice and got genuinely upset. Insults were thrown, while also retellings of evenets that has happened.</p>

</aside>
<p>Insults were thrown before all this started and there were retelling of events that did not happen as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people got demoted due to screenshots being taken out of context, or for voicing their opinion in what they thought was a safe area.<br>
The latest demotions seems to have happened just by associating with the chat.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Disrespecting someone is not about a server. If you don’t respect someone, you don’t respect him anywhere. The argument “it was my personal server” is not valid. If your boss saw you disrespecting them on twitter/facebook or any social media they would fire you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the people who shared the screenshots from this server, and got a lot of her friends demoted or banned, is now a moderator.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because as you said injustice had to be shown. People have been spreading a lot of lies, disrespect and hate in there.</p>
<p>P.S.: Using an alt is really not ideal, you’re banned for a reason, you got the rest of your group posting/liking every post already.<br>
P.S.2: I do have screenshots of Ellie at least saying she joined to get banned and make Xblade look bad, feel free to dm me if you really want to see them, even though I know <em>you</em> know that already.</p>
<p>(Edit: said “you” instead of “them”)</p>
