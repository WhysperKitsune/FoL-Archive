    <title>Important words in chat</title>

    <description>I think these words should come out as a different color in chat. 

Poisened, bleeding, immune, heal

There are so many times you try to tell everybody  that you are poisened or bleeding and so many people are talking that it goes unnoticed. Then you die and the alch or phys says &quot;I didn&#39;t see he said he needed healed&quot;. I think certain words should pop out in chat as a different color than the rest of chat. So when you say &quot;I&#39;m bleeding&quot; &quot;somebody heal me&quot; &quot;this player is occupy, night, attack, etc immune&quot; and other info that is important, it will stand out when 16 people are talking and won&#39;t go unnoticed as much. I&#39;m sure there are other words that are important and need highlighted in chat too. 

Example &quot;hey guys I&#39;m bleeding, need healed&quot; 

The word bleeding would be red, healed would be light blue, and the other words would all be the standard yellow/gold font.</description>

            <p>Haha yeah I get that. and I suppose I could resort to that. But you’d be surprised exactly how oblivious people can be. And if I have to spam caps to survive so be it. Figured throwing out the font suggestion wouldn’t hurt though. It didn’t seem too difficult to throw in chat filters so I thought maybe this idea would be an easy an effective change.</p>

            <p>Anything important I tend to just basically yell.</p>
<p>I AM POISONED PLEASE HEAL</p>
<p>People seem to take notice a lot more than just “poisoned” or “bleeding help please”.<br>
I dunno why, I guess it’s the shouty caps thing.</p>
