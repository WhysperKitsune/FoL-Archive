    <description>**Marshal: Neutral Offensive**
**Goal:** Make no Social Neutral classes or Killer Neutral classes win the game

**Passives:**

**Retired Blue Dragon:** ICON: A white dragon
This class cant be converted and always will be not suspicious for Blue Dragon investigative classes, observer cant investigate his visits

**You Can Not Fool me:** ICON: The DRAW Icon with a Red X crossing
If during court the Scorned/Fool Uses Trollbox, you will know that message was not a real one.

**Day Abilities:** 

**Sights** ICON: Sheriff Scout but with white leafs
Use your good old Scout to check somebody, if he kills or frames a player, you will know it. Infinite uses.

**Night abilities:**

**Expert persecution:** ICON: A lamp with white light
Check a Player, if he is Neutral, you will occupy him. Bypasses Occupy immunity. Infinite uses

**Last Resource:** ICON: Rebound without blood
Target a Player, if He is Neutral, you will end their missery. Bypasses Night Immunity if the target is not a Killer. 2 Uses.


**Strategy:**

Fool and Scorned are your main enemies, find them fast and kill them before they accomplish their goals!

You cant kill the Neutral Killer, but you can find out their targets and out them in the court. get him before he ends you.

Blue Dragon will always want you on their team, so claiming Marshal will not be bad for you.

Remember, you dont need to kill Alchemists or Mercenaries in order to win, You only need Social and Killer neutrals!


**Class Explanation:**

The Marshal is a retired member of the Blue Dragon. He only wants one thing: Peace on the court. And he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal.

Maybe he is not a young man anymore, but he is still an expert, and he still knows how to do his job.

**Important Notes/Answer to &quot;What if&quot; Questions**

Marshal cant kill neutral killers and NK is not the only who can actually kill. Also Scout can check somebody who killed but it was possessed so Marshal can be fooled.</description>

            <p>I like the idea but is the game really ready for another neutral that actively hurts neutrals? The theme behind it is cool though.</p>

            <p>I’d probably use some different names for the abilities to differentiate between the Sheriff versions. Other than that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Expert Investigation:<br>
Check a Player, if he is Neutral, you will occupy him. Bypasses Occupy and redirection immunity. Infinite uses</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since it doesn’t redirect anything there’s no need to bypass redirection immunity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last Resource:<br>
Target a Player, if He is Neutral, you will end their missery. Does not work on Killer classes who are Immune. 2 Uses.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s somewhat unnecessary to say that the ability doesn’t work on immune targets.</p>
<p>Those things aside, I’d say that while the class is an interesting idea, the classes it targets could do without another person attempting to hunt them down.</p>
