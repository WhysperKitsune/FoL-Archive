    <description>You should be able to spectate friends. 

Although there are concerns that spectators may out the roles to their friends overall make spectators have the same viewing ability as dead people where they cannot out the roles of players because let’s say you are waiting for your friend(s) to finish his or her / their game that person wants to watch their friend rather than just waiting at the home screen and watching their friend(s) label say “In-Game”

            <p>Personally I think unlimited spectating should be allowed, drop in on any game any time, get a big ol list of games running, pop in wherever you feel like.</p>
<p>With one huge inclusion, spectators do not see any non universal information. No class lists, no class of their friend, no whispers beyond “X is whispering to Y”. Realtime there’s no necessary need to see hidden information period.</p>
<p>I’d love to be able to pop in on a day when my brain isn’t quite focused enough to risk rolling prince, king or MM by joining a game, but sit back and scumread.</p>
<p>second feature I would loove, an option to save replays of games and share em with friends and the replays of completed games can show all the dead/night actions etc… was the last game you played hilarious enough for keepsake rewatch it and share it.</p>
<p>Curriosity of when X changed, wondering if he played you from day 2, or was converted at the last second… replay.</p>
