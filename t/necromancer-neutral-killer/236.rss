    <description>Night Ability 1: Dig up grave - Dig up grave of the dead player and turn him into skeleton (You waste whole night digging up grave)
Night Ability 2: Send skeleton to kill someone (After killing Skelton is destroyed)

Lore - Necromancer... strange man with black robe who have no life on his face who want to see everyone dead

Comments - You can use only one of Night Abilities in one night and you can create one skleton on the time
If you dont use your skeleton in 2 nights in row he will perish</description>
