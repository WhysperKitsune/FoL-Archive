    <description># The Paranoid (Neutral Killer)

**Steel Door (Passive)** - You are overly protective of your room and have made sure that no Killers can get to you. Immune to death at night.

**Solid Mind (Passive)** - If you are Occupied, you will be immune to it the next night but the Occupier will not be told.

**Schizophrenic (Day Special)** - If you’ve killed somebody using Paranoia, your mind will start playing tricks on you. Your next attack will kill anybody else visiting your target. If you are jailed, you will kill the Prince if you are not executed.

**Panic Attack (Night)** - Attack your target in a fit of panic. If they are an Investigative, you will destroy their journal. - Infinite uses

**Paranoia (Night)** - You will stay in your room tonight and over-think all possibilities and will kill any visitors. - 2 uses

Goal: Generic NK win condition

            <p>I like it. The half-occupy immunity is weird, though.</p>

            <p>Unlike Werewolf and Serial Killer, you have option to use Schizophrenic or not. Surprise visits from Prince is one that Paranoid need to be prepared when getting imprisoned will put the killer of the list being suspect, for little while.</p>

            <p>This feels a bit like werewolf. Personally I like it! (My first sentence was not implying that your idea isn’t original, just that it seemed to have a similar purpose)</p>
