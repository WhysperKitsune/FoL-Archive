**Introduction**
It is important as a member of the Blue Dragon to keep up good logs. Good logs can help out the Blue Dragon substantially. This post is for people that are part of the Blue Dragon and don’t know how to begin/write a proper journal. And yes, I see a lot of people struggling to write proper journals. 

Here is one example of a bad journal.
![image|598x416](upload://dcI6CNjtztVdgOOyNwWqDSNqAj7.jpg)

It is important to always write an action and then a reaction. For example when I’m playing the Butler. I say I serve wine (action) to someone on Night 1 (N1) and then that they were occupied or were immune to my occupation (reaction). 

New players
For new players it is the easiest to use the “Default Layout” This is a button below your journal.

![image|605x413](upload://nx4IQvDluNKSvSwwl3O8b8Ehr3R.jpg)

This will give you a Default Layout of what your journal should look like. 
On the left page it will put the nights in a row from top to bottom N1 to N16. Almost no game reaches N16. I always half the amount of nights to N8. So you have more space to write and your logs look a little better. 

On the right page it will give you the numbers 1 to 16. These are the players in the game. Most games start with 16 people in the game. I mostly write Claims above this and when someone died I remove that person from the list. Like this I get more space to write more information about people that are dead. You should use this page to write who you are suspicious of. And what people claim their role/class is in the game. 

Some classes also have day abilities. I write D1 for day 1, D2 for day 2 etcetera. It might be important to write day abilities down in your logbook as well. 

Example of how to use the Default Layout Journal:

A lot of people use abbreviations. 
This Wiki page will show you all abbreviations used ingame and in the journals.

**Blue Dragon Actions and reactions**
This is a small tutorial on what actions you can write down as a member of the Blue Dragon. And what reactions you can expect. Try to write down as much as possible in as less words as possible, so that people still understand what you mean. 2 types of reactions will come up a lot. Prevention and occupation. I won’t be writing these down because they are fairly obvious. It&#39;s also important to write down if your target was changed or if someone tried to change your target. If there&#39;s a court wizard, this is a way to verify that.
