    <title>Sending messages immediately at start of day</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sending-messages-immediately-at-start-of-day/33223</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m sure most of you know that you can type a message before the night phase ends, and then spam enter as the day starts to send it very quickly.

I was just Reaper and someone debauched me and I attacked them (they immune), so they knew I was a killer. There is no way I can chill them faster than they can send a message saying I attacked them.

I think the chat box should be disabled any time you aren&#39;t able to send messages.</description>

            <p>Disabling the chat box would be extremely irritating and would generally make the interface clunkier.</p>
<p>If you want to have a chance to chill people, then the suggestion you should be making is for day ability interfaces to be enabled a few seconds before the ability to send messages goes online at the start of a new day.</p>

            <p>Edited main post with suggestion.</p>
<p>I think the chat box should be disabled any time you aren’t able to send messages.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to be able to type unless you can actually send the message.</p>
<p>This lets reaper have time to chill and makes things slightly more interesting by preventing instant accusations at the start of the day.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, people could still copy/paste messages instantly.</p>
