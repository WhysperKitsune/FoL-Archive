    <description>#### What happened?
Almost always when I report someone, gives error &quot;player not found&quot;

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
To get the green icon saying the report was received

#### Steps to reproduce:
End game, select a player using the &quot;report scroll icon&quot;
Write what they did in the dialog.
Click report button from the dialog.
Scroll icon button gets a red cross
Mouseover says &quot;Player not found&quot;
