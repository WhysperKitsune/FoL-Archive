    <title>Confirming BD is far too easy in general</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/confirming-bd-is-far-too-easy-in-general/1335</link>
    <description>Almost every single BD role is able to essentially confirm their existance extremely easily. Many converted roles (and all Cult roles) do not have the ability to fake a good claim. This poses a large risk to the game&#39;s health, especially in Cult games.

Close attention must be paid going forward to this issue, especially pertaining to future roles. Conversion may be a factor in this game, but claimspace still NEEDS to exist - and both evil factions suffer massively with this, Cultists being unable to accurately fake their former role and Blackrose members being unable to continue conversions after the Mastermind dies.

I&#39;m sure that myself and many others will suggest ways to avoid these issues going forward, but I wanted to call attention to this in a very quick and broad sense sooner rather than later.</description>

            <p>Fakeclaiming as BD has thankfully gotten a lot easier since the feedback messages became more general and vague.</p>
<p>Does anyone think BD can auto-confirm too easily?</p>

            <p>Did you note the fact that this was four months ago? The devs took note of how easy it was to confirm most BD roles and made changes until that was no longer the case.</p>

            <p>Knight, Herbalist and Court Wizard are all impossible to confirm easily.</p>
<p>Princess and priest can be faked as well.</p>
<p>Butler and drunk are claimable by some roles</p>
<p>Sheriff and Paladin make great last min claims.</p>
<p>I’m probably forgetting something but the point is that there is some claimspace</p>
