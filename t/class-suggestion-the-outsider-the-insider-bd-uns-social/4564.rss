    <description>&gt;## [color=steblue]The Outsider[/color]
&gt;[color=steblue]**Blue Dragon Social**[/color]
**Shady (Passive)** - Anyone who investigates you to determine faction will think you are the opposite of their faction. (Unseen/Cult for BD, BD for Unseen/Cult)
**Outside (Passive)** - Since you don&#39;t live in the castle, you are immune to visitation at night if you don&#39;t perform any night actions.
**Vengeful (Day)** - If a target player is a vote away from being put on stand, you can send a &quot;bonus&quot; (meaning you can also normal vote) anonymous vote against them. Everyone will receive the message &quot;An Outsider/Insider used an extra vote on x.&quot; - 2 uses.
**Defensive (Day, Special)** - 25% of the votes to majority against you on any day are unknowingly negated. (This effectively means to be voted up, you need 75% + 1 votes) The people who vote you will think their vote went through, and you will know that they attempted to vote you and failed, but nobody else will see any of the votes.
**Break In (Night)** - Break into someone&#39;s room tonight. They will either be inside or missing. A player will be missing if they visited someone else that night or were the Prince and had someone jailed. Otherwise, they will be inside. If they are inside, they will know who you are and that you are the Outsider. - Infinite uses.
*Defeat the Unseen and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

            <p>Hard to vote, and assists in voting. Can “confirm” themselves with Break In, or stay back and prevent their death.</p>
