    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-mimic/2833</link>
    <description>&gt;The Mimic
Neutral wildcard
**Passive: Enduring** 
Immune to death once
**Night ability: Copy**
Kill your target and become their class if the attack is successful.  They can&#39;t be revived by priest. You can even become a unique class in this way.

Goal: Become a new class and win as that class.

Additional notes: you don&#39;t keep the one time death immunity open switching.</description>

            <p>i thought that copy would be saved until late game, when, as neutral, he could insert himself with unseen, or bd, or another neutral</p>

            <p>Whenever I think about new classes I ask myself, “What about this class would make me want to play it/ what is unique gameplay wise?”<br>
So for this class, lets say I jump into the body of a Butler… what is different/ unique to that game than if I had started off as a Butler? You would have the ability to chose who to jump into… but in the big picture that doesnt affect anyone else, just kills the person in that body and now a new player is playing that class.<br>
My 2 cents towards the class would be maybe have him be a neutral killer that can take on the identity of different Blue Dragons and have some sneaky way of killing people.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>The Mimic<br>
Neutral wildcard<br>
<strong>Passive: Enduring</strong><br>
Immune to death once<br>
<strong>Night ability: Copy</strong><br>
Kill your target and become their class if the attack is successful.  They can’t be revived by priest. You can even become a unique class in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goal: Become a new class and win as that class.</p>
<p>Additional notes: you don’t keep the one time death immunity open switching.</p>
