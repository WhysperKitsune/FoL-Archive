    <title>Decision regarding the use of the word “lynch”</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/decision-regarding-the-use-of-the-word-lynch/82226</link>
    <description>After seeing countless discussions on other forums regarding the use of the word &quot;lynch&quot; in Forum Mafia, we have decided it&#39;s best to make a public announcement on this topic.

All Moderators and Hosts will be replacing the word &quot;lynch&quot; with an alternative, and we strongly suggest that other players do the same. Our reasoning for this is that the word &quot;lynch&quot; has racial connotations that (understandably) make some players uncomfortable, and we want our community to be as welcoming as possible.

*We will **NOT** be punishing players for continuing the use of this word in the context of Forum Mafia.*

Our recommended replacements are:
* Cuddle
* Execute (shortened = exe)
* Eliminate (shortened = elim)
* Kill
* Exile
* Banish

Some community favorites are:
* Jettison
* Yeet
* Cuddle

Moderators favorite:
* Cuddle

We ask that you take this into consideration while playing on our forums, and be understanding of the decision we have made. Replacement words can be suggested below. Go bonkers - but stay within the [Global Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244)!

Cordially, 
i42 forum Moderation Team</description>

            <p>Plus from as hosting side, all they ask for hosts is to not include it in op or class cards, which I or another member of the review team will be asking for from now on. Its a simple process and will be checked for anyway. And simple when you say someone died, you use execution or any other flavor of your choice. If you dont the mods will change it anyway. Even less work for ya.  Like all this change is trying to do is make the community more open, sure u may not agree with all the reasons behind the change, but for most of ya you dont have to change at all. If your a host, you have to use the find and replace tool and boom its over. They arent even asking to change mylo or lylo as those are terms dedicated to mafia. Sure if someone asks what they mean prob say mis exe you lose. Even if it doesnt acronym right. Even then if ya dont its not punished. Like this change is simply trying to be a more open and allow as many people to enjoy the game as much as possible.</p>

            <p>Honestly?</p>
<p>I don’t really care if you think it’s needless change.<br>
And tbh I didn’t think it is racially charged before this drama anyway… Sure, this is only american stuff.</p>
<p>But my job is to make community as welcoming for everyone as possible.<br>
If some people can have problems with it, my job is to eliminate it.</p>
<p>So no, the decision is final.</p>

            <p>Ok, last thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Does lynch have a racial context in fm? No.</p>
<p>Should we resist anyone saying it does and tell them to stop being so silly? Yes</p>
<p>Would it be a little tone deaf to persist in the current social climate? Probably, yes.</p>
<p>Does the change materially affect the game? No</p>
<p>So what should we do in conclusion? Sigh, roll our eyes and make a change.</p>

            <p>So I’m not judging intrisecally the word because that’s an exercise in futility<br>

            <p>i mean there are obviously people who are too easily offended, and there are obviously some people who actually do seek to be offended by things, but I think the idea that there’s a shadowy cabal of people trying to be offended by everything is ridiculous</p>
<p>and before you ask there’s a difference between that and being an outrage merchant</p>
