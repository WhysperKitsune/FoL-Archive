    <description>Corrupted (Neutral Killer or Offensive)

Passive: Corrupted Skin: Immune to death at night. Corrupt anybody who visits you.

Passive: Corrupted Essence: Immune to corruption

Goal: Survive

Notes: You are not notified if you are corrupted. You will die the next night, and anybody you visit will also corrupt anybody you visit. I had an odd idea of a passively harmful person who needed to survive. Not sure how if it would hold up, but the idea fascinates me.</description>

            <p>But isn’t that also the perfect evil claim if no one will visit you? People will get that possibility. Also you could executed, even if you are, because of the “Neuts Out” philosophy.</p>
