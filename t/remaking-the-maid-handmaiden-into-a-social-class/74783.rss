    <description>[color=blue]**Maid Blue Dragon Social**[/color]
**Day Ability:**
Nosy Servants (3 use):
Discover at the end of night if a player visited another player at least once, can be used on dead players. 

Peephole (3 use):
You will be notified if your Matchmake targets have the same class type.

**Night Abilties:**
Matchmake (inf use):
Check if 2 players have the same class type. If they do they will additionaly see anonymous results of the other player tonight. The Prince and framed players don&#39;t match with anyone. Will not see attacks, conversions or tailors.
(For example if you match a Princess with a Sheriff, the Princess will see &quot;someone is not suspicious&quot;, while the Sheriff will see &quot;someone is Killer/Offensive&quot;)

Feather Duster (2 use):
Make target player permanently immune to being framed or mindwarped. 
(Meaning, any checks on Target will always show their correct results.)

[color=purple]**Handmaiden Unseen Social**[/color], converted from Maid

**Night Abilities:**
Analyze (inf use):
Check if 2 players have the same class type. If they are you will see the results of their night actions. (Cannot target Unseen)

Spring Cleaning (1 use):
If target player dies tonight you will clear his logs making them appear as if they were default.</description>

            <p>Yeah I mean being caught by a Maid is just better than being caught by a Sheriff.</p>
<p>A Sheriff leaves you with no way to claim out of it</p>
<p>A maid has multiple points of failure</p>

            <p>I think maid could work better as an investigative, maybe matchmake could act as a parity cop, and maybe she could have an ability that lets her see if a living player visited a dead player on the night they died.</p>

</aside>
<p>Matchmake now gives basic “You tried hooking up targets” unless you use Peephole; then you get “Targets match/ aren’t compatible”</p>
<p>But why?<br>
Short answer: without it, it would be OP.</p>
<p>Longer answer:<br>
Well if matchmake gave results each night, the problem would be that it would lock killers into killer claims, make CL and MM unable to claim anything as well as confirm someone (if compared 2 killers) as the NK/Assassin if the other target claims they didn’t get any results.</p>
