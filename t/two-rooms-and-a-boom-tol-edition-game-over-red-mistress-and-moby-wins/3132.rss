    <description># Two Rooms and A Boom: ToL edition!

### **Rules**:
1. You may not privately communicate with people not in your room, and all communications must go through me in some way. Other than that, anything goes! I will however announce who is communicating with who in your server.
2. Please don&#39;t be a jerkface.
3. Always play to your **eventual** win. This is important, as intentionally changing teams can be allowed with more complicated roles.
4. Have fun!

# The Game:

The game is based around two main teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.
On the Red Team, there is a Bomber, on the Blue Team there is a President.
All players will be split into two rooms,which will be represented  by Discord Servers.
Every round a number of players will be chosen to be sent to the other room.

At the end of the game, the Blue Team wins if the President and Bomber are in separate rooms, while the Red Team win if they are in the same room.

However, in this particular game both teams will have an additional win condition: The President must card share with the Doctor by the end of the game to cure their illness, and the Bomber must card share with the Engineer to arm the bomb.

In additon, there are roles which are on neither team, they are on Grey Team. Details will be given below.

## Electing a GLORIOUS LEADER

At the start of the game, a random player in either room will be chosen as OUR GLORIOUS LEADER for that room.

At any time, a player may attempt to Usurp a leader, by doing **/nominate [new leader]**. Should the majority of other players in the room do **/approve**, the leader will be replaced.

At any time, a Leader may give their leadership away to another player.

At the end of each round, the Leader must have chosen players to send to the other room, or else RNG will pick.

## Color/Card sharing.

During each round, players may do **/card share [Player]** or **/color share [player**.  If the other player **/accepts**, both will show each other either their full rolecard or just the team they are on.

You may also **/card reveal [player]** or **/color reveal [player]** to simply reveal your card to them.

Finally, you may **/public card reveal** or **/public color reveal** to reveal your card/color to absoloutely everyone else in the room.

## The Roles

President - *see above*
Bomber - *see above*
Doctor - Must meet with Pres by the end of the game for Blue Team to win.
Engineer - Must meet with Bomber by the end of the game for  Red Team to win.
Spy - Your card appears to be the opposite color when  doing a Color Share.
Blue Team/Red Team - Essentially a Citizen with no real abilities, but can still make a difference!
Ahab/Moby - You win if the other one gets blown up by the Bomber at the end of the game, but you don&#39;t.
Wife/Misteress - You win if you are in the same room as the President at the end of the game but the other one isn&#39;t.
