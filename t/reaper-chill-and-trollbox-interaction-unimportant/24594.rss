    <title>Reaper chill and trollbox interaction [unimportant]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/reaper-chill-and-trollbox-interaction-unimportant/24594</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was King and was chilled during the day. This functioned as normal, being unable to read any living chat. Later that day I was trollboxed, and I could read the message when normally you can&#39;t read messages that you&#39;ve been forced via trollbox to say.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
My trollboxed message should have been hidden.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Trollbox a target that is chilled. They will see the message.

#### Comments:
This is almost never going to matter, but it still seems a bit strange.</description>

            <p>It only stops people from talking, not stopping from using day ability. So unless Boslof decide that Icy Touch/Chill also freezes people to use day abilities then that might work.</p>

            <p>Sounds within the letter of the power to me. Keep in mind Chilled people can talk (and thus create messages). They just can’t talk in live day chat–they talk in dead chat instead. So, you create a message, which would normally just be shown to dead chat only, and it’s shown to all players, dead or alive, just like it says.</p>
<p>Plus, I think it’s good game balancing to have a counter for any offensive maneuver.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don’t chill psychics.</p>

            <p>I got a simular situation as the Reaper. We were with 4 left (5, but with one of them reaped)</p>
<p>I chilled the psychic and I wanted to hang him. (And attempt to reap the King the upcomnig night to win with just two people remaining.</p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong><br>
I Chilled the Psychic and he was being voted up, as suddenly the Psychic message appeared:</p>
<p><em>I’m chilled btw…</em></p>
<p><strong>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</strong><br>
I’m not sure, but just checking… Should Psychic be able to do this while chilled?</p>
<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong><br>
Chill a Psychic, Psychic to send out a message telepathically.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>
Also a rare occurance, and I actually liked it, as it was a nice way to deny me a potential victory as Reaper. (Psychic was pardoned and I was hung)</p>
