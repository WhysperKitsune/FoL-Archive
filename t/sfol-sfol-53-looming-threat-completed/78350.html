          <h1>Welcome to SFoL - Looming Threat!</h1>
<p>Host by Alice</p>
<p><strong>After ridding Castle Adiart of the Unseen and Cult factions and recovering from the losses they faced in the conflict, including the death of their own King, the <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font> have discovered a new and more dangerous threat to them that must be addressed immediately or else they face certain perdition</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Looming Threat, a SFoL I’m working on recently and decided to see if anyone here is interested in. The idea here is simple, the uninformed majority, as in the <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font> in this case, works exactly the same as how you’d normally see one in a FoL, the only differences being that <font color="steblue"><strong>the Prince</strong></font>  has been slightly tweaked in order to increase the skill level of the class while making it more counterable to evils, and rather than <font color="steblue"><strong>the Sheriff</strong></font>  or <font color="steblue"><strong>the Paladin</strong></font>, a guaranteed and unique hard-counter called <font color="steblue"><strong>the Justicar</strong></font>  will roll.</p>
<p>Additionally, the setup will be semi-closed and while everyone will be familiar with the <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font> classes that will roll in the match, only the members of the evil faction will know what their own classes entails, and in fact, until <font color="steblue"><strong>the Justicar</strong></font> outs themselves or a member of the faction flips then not even the faction’s name will be known to members of the <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font>. Many of the mechanics of the evil faction will also be unique pertaining to them and the only public knowledge will be the addition of <strong>Omega Actions</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from the difference in evil factions, there will not be a King crowned immediately once the game starts. The first day instead will last exactly 48 hours and there will be a public election for the first King that will not take any Royal Blood-like passives into account. And as mentioned before, <font color="steblue"><strong>the Prince</strong></font> has been reworked and it will now crown into a more powerful version of the King rather than an ordinary Good King</p>
<p>Here is the class card of <font color="steblue"><strong>the Prince</strong></font>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Reworked Prince Class Card</summary>
<blockquote>
<h1>
<font color="steblue">The Prince</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crossed_swords.png!v=9" title=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" alt=":crossed_swords:"> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h1>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon Killer</strong></font><br>
<strong>Unstoppable (Passive)</strong>  - You cannot be occupied at night, even by means that bypass occupy immunity. You are also immune to target changing.<br>
<strong>Direct Descendant (Passive)</strong>  - Votes to become king count as three for you and if you become a King then you will become a Righteous King rather than a Good King and retain both your Imprison day action, and your Execute night action. In addition, all protective effects on you fail if you ever claim or soft your true class.<br>
<strong>Imprison (Day)</strong>  - Choose a player to jail at night occupying the target (Bypasses occupy immunity) and preventing visits to them. You both will be able to send each other a single 1000 character message through the host. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Execute (Night)</strong>  - Kill the player you have jailed (Bypasses night immunity and healing). If the executed is a member of the Blue Dragon, you will not be able to execute for the rest of the game. - 3 uses<br>
<strong>Mercy (Night)</strong>  - Heal the player you have jailed. - 2 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat the unknown threat looming in Castle Adiart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>In addition, there will be a new King aligned with the <font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon</strong></font> that will be crowned if <font color="steblue"><strong>the Prince</strong></font> steps up, <font color="steblue"><strong>the Righteous King</strong></font>.</p>
<details>

Righteous King Class Card</summary>

<h1>
<font color="steblue">The Righteous King</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crossed_swords.png!v=9" title=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" alt=":crossed_swords:">
</h1>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Blue Dragon Special</font></strong><br>
<strong>Pass the Torch (Passive)</strong>  - If you die, a vote to determine the next king will be held at start of the next day. If you are lynched, all members of the Blue Dragon will lose their Royal Blood passive.<br>
<strong>Blue Dragon’s Crown (Passive)</strong>  - Your vote counts as two if there are more than 5 players alive except during Grand Trial. Immune to occupation and redirection, and in addition you may use both your day abilities on the same day and both your night abilities on the same night. Your abilities do not count as visits.  In addition, all protective effects on you fail if you ever claim or soft your true class.<br>
<strong>Grand Trial (Day)</strong>  - Instantly put a player on trial for treason lasting up to 24 hours possibly extending day. They may provide a defense within 12 hours, and then the players alive may either vote to execute or pardon. If a majority of players vote to execute, the day will end and the player on trial will be lynched. Otherwise, the day will continue as normal. - 1 use<br>
<strong>Imprison (Day)</strong>  - Choose a player to jail at night occupying the target (Bypasses occupy immunity) and preventing visits to them. You both will be able to send each other a single 1000 character message through the host. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Guard! (Night)</strong>  - Choose a player. They will be immune to death tonight. - 3 uses <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crown.png!v=9" title=":crown:" class="emoji" alt=":crown:"><br>
<strong>Execute (Night)</strong>  - Kill the player you have jailed (Bypasses night immunity and healing). If the executed is a member of the Blue Dragon, you will not be able to execute for the rest of the game. - 3 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat the unknown threat looming in Castle Adiart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Finally  <font color="steblue"><strong>the Justicar</strong></font> will serve as the faction hard-counter in this match. This role doubles not only as an alignment cop with a n0 on <font color="steblue"><strong>the Prince</strong></font>, but also as a mechanics cop that will begin the match knowing much of the mechanics surrounding the evil faction, along with a messaging action that will allow them to leak this information without the fear of them outing themselves.</p>

Censored Justicar Class Card</summary>

<strong>Judgment (Night)</strong>  - Informs you whether your target is a member of ███████ or not.<br>
<strong>Forsaken Records (Night)</strong>  - Select a ███████ or ███████ that is used in an Omega Action which you’ve learned of from using Eldritch Learning, and you will learn how many players have been ███████ with it already or are at a ███████ for it. - Infinite uses.<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat ███████.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Finally, each member of the evil faction will have their own unique <strong>Omega Action</strong>, these are very powerful and detailed actions that can completely reshaped the game if used correctly.</p>
