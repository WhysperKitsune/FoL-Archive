    <description>## Welcome

[Follow the Global Forum Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515)

### Gameplay
**By ‘DeathNote’ I mean the ANIME, not gamemode.**
Days will be 20 minutes long.
Nights will be 5 minutes long, or shorter if everyone submits their actions.
Actions are done by messaging me.
**Whoever has the DeathNote will be known as *Kira.* Kira can kill anyone, bypassing immunity, by writing down their *True Name.***
**To gain the DeathNote, you have to kill a player carrying it. You can also give yours away anonymously.**

### Executions
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
Executions end the day.

### After The Night
You will be told what happened to you
&gt;**Night:**
You slept peacefully
You were shot and killed.
You were shot but you survived.
You died of a heart attack!
You shot [x] and they died.
You shot [x] but they survived.

### To Join
To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want

### Rolelist:

1. PoisonedSquid - Heart Attack
2. DirectorHail - Alive
3. Soulshade - Shot

            <p>And it wasn’t about killing Hail at last day.</p>
<p>Day before.</p>
<p>If they killed Soul, they would have all death notes and win.<br>
If they killed You, we would outvote you on who gets death notes and there wouldn’t be a coin toss.</p>

<p>So yeah. There is your explanation why coin toss, despite easier wincon (and you voting together with scum) AND Sulit just afking instead of day vigging…</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have right to be mad at this game.</p>

<p>That’s the point.<br>
You got a win through coin toss only due to having easier wincon.</p>

<p>That’s why I said you had easier wincon.</p>
<p>Cause Kira was voting with you to keep theirs ability to kill.</p>

            <p>If we went with Director’s wincon, nothing would have changed. Heck, it was a 50/50 chance at that point</p>

            <p>Like let’s be honest.</p>
<p>You won cause Soul had to vote dispose on all death notes to keep his ability to kill.</p>
<p>After Yagami died, if those were kept by Sulit,  he would have most death notes and Soul would lose his nightkill.</p>
<p>So Kira’s had to vote with police.</p>
<p>So yes, police’s wincon was easier than SPK.<br>
And they still won only cause inactivity and coin toss.</p>
<p>FFS this is annoying.</p>
