    <title>Buff Mental Blur</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/buff-mental-blur/67205</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating too much when I say that everyone agrees Mental Blur is worse than useless.  All it does is tell you the Mystic has been converted and erase your chat history.  This is useless because hardly anyone ever _needs_ to read chat history from previous days.  In fact sometimes I wonder if people are reading the chat from the current day. :stuck_out_tongue:

I propose that Mental Blur instead prevent the victim from both reading any chat at all the current day, and from chatting themselves.  They would be basically chilled but also be unable to read chat.  

I think this would be an ability worth the risk of confirming (to your victim, at least) that the Mystic has been converted.

If this is somehow cruel and unusual punishment, let the victim still read chat from past days so they have something to do.  Like practice their scumreading :yum:</description>

            <p>I think they would need to not be able to vote/emote cuz if a player got mental blured it would be like</p>
<p>X has voted Y<br>
X has unvoted Y<br>
X has voted Y<br>
X has unvoted Y</p>
<p>it would kinda be obvious</p>
