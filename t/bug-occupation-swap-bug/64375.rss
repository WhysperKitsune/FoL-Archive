    <title>[BUG] Occupation + Swap bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-occupation-swap-bug/64375</link>
    <description>#### Was playing alchemist. I visited the target with heal and was swapped to myself. At the same time I was prevented from using ability. At the same time I was immune to occupation. All this was all at once night one.
#### I had to be just occupied. I think?

#### Steps to reproduce: We need a CW, Alch, Butler (and Merc/sellsword I think)? Alch visits CW that swaped himself with an alch. Butler occupies Alch and Merc/Sellsword guards an Alch.

            <p>This seems like the Butler and Drunk interaction, though I think this is more likely to be Sellsword considering the order.</p>
<p>Upon being occupied, you cannot be Debbed.</p>
<p>First thing that happened: CW swapped your target to yourself<br>
Second: Sellsword occupied you.<br>
Third: Drunk tried to deb you</p>
<p>This should not be a bug I think.<br>
(Unless ofc; the game did not have any invokers/drunks)</p>

            <p>I have thought about this as well but that was night one. Next night I was debbed and it was successfull. Finaly, night 3 I was immune as well, but a message about immunity has appeared AFTER someone tried to occupy me.</p>

            <p>I think you were redirected to yourself then occupied then redirected one last time giving you immunity to occupation/target change/jail</p>
