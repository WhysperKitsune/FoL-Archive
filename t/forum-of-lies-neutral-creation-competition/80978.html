Archon Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Effectively a Neutral Evil class with the focus on flip tampering. The purpose of the Archon is to serve as a disinformation-spreader in the same vein as the Scorned that can help cast doubts on logs and flips, especially as they would already known a player’s class due to their day action so they would have a fair amount of information to create realistic logs. In addition, Decree of the Archon serves as a pressure point against Blue Dragon members as it can potentially kill the Prince if they are wagoned.</p>

Chancellor Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Has design inspiration coming from part of the Pretender and part of the Mercenary and the theme is pretty much based of the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">evil scheming chancellor</a> trope. The playstyle here pretty much involves the Chancellor becoming a trusted towncore member, getting their Protege trusted, using their space in the towncore to kill the King, and then installing the Protege as a new King. To do this they will have a 3-shot day action that will allow them to send a message privately to the Unseen or the Cult chat, which in turn allows groupscum and the Chancellor to mutually help each other in getting the work done</p>
<p>While this isn’t a true Neutral Evil class per-se as they can win with the Blue Dragon, their wincon pretty much involves in converting a BD member into a Spiteful King, so their existence in general is very negative EV to the Blue Dragon.</p>

Crone Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The Crone and the Maiden were inspired by psychoneirik’s Attorney, Accused, and Prosecutor classes, except with a few modifications that I made. To start, rather than making an unique neutral I made the accused player be a random player that can be anyone except either neuts or the Prince. The main issue with the Accused is that since they were a neut then there was pretty much no reason to bother with the entire trial shenanigas as they couldn’t convert, nor kill, nor be required to be executed for the BD wincon. So in order to give the two classes a more impactful existence, the accused will be a random player, which means they can be the MM, the NK, a random BD, or whatsoever.</p>
<p>In addition, both the Crone and the Maiden can tamper and prevent the accused from being mechanically confirmed as the Maiden can tailor and ninja the mark with the Innocence Potion while the Crone can stop them from acting via Drowsiness potion, making the game fully rely on their arguments for reads instead of mechanics.</p>
<p>In all both the Crone and the Maiden are supposed to open-claim, however their entire wincon relies on their target being executed or surviving, which in turn is required to interact with the game so there shouldn’t be any issues regarding what the ToL Alchemist or ToL Mercenary faces where a player can simply open-claim and not bother interacting with other for the remainder of the match.</p>
<p>The thematic inspiration behind these two characters are the lover/mark and the Maiden being star-crossed lovers, with the jealous Crone wanting to split these two apart.</p>

Crusader Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, a Neutral Benign role who’s purpose is to prevent the game from snowballing too hard towards either side. This role has the same idea behind the ToS Amnesiac, however the fact that its alignment will automatically be decided by the first execution will make it more of a comeback mechanic than a kingmaker.</p>
<p>While its pro-BD wincon and skill set make it a bit too pro-BD and open-claiming viable, the catch is that this would only be possible after a d2 mislynch, which would mean that BD getting an advantage here isn’t of much balancing concerns. The kit here is somewhat JOAT-y being that they have a heal/tailor, but the KP should be enough to make it a useful Unseen/Cult role as well.</p>
<p>Thematically I based the Crusader off the typical wandering warrior/ronin archetype, which fits in well as he is a warrior searching for a mission and whatnot.</p>

Demonologist Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire design of the Demonologist was to make a pro-NK class that at the same time did not require having the NK win as their sole wincon, otherwise it’d make it too difficult for it to be achievable. While guessing the NK’s identity is enough for a win, the safest path to victory here is to make sure the NK wins alongside you.</p>
<p>Despite being investigative, the Demonologist is inherently an anti-BD class as it tailors the Neutral Killer while at the same time increasing the NK’s potential KP via the Damned passive and his safest goal involves helping the NK win, so while openclaiming is possible as they can still win with the BD, it’s extremely advised against due to the sheer amount of negative utility it brings to BD.</p>
<p>Thematically I based the Demonologist over a scholar that studies demons creatures such as the Possessor, the Reaper, the Demon(duh), and the Mind Flayer, which fits in with its wincon here.</p>

Druid Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a an attempt at creating a Inq-like Neutral Chaos class that discouraged relying on mechanics in general. The Druid wins by repeatedly occupying BD-aligned classes and turning their lost actions and passives into Wisps for them to collect for their victory. The main playstyle of the Druid is to hunt for softs and predict what BD-aligned players will do in order to steal their passives and day actions.</p>
<p>The purpose of making the Druids’ action work on only BD-aligned players is to prevent making it an option to open-claim as otherwise it would have the same issues ToS’ Pirate has where it they can open-claim if they only target non-town players.</p>
<p>Thematically I based the Druid of… a Druid, it fits in with ToL’s theme, so why not?</p>

Fiddler Notes</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fiddler was created as one of my two takes on the Fool. The main issue two issues that made the Fool a problematic class was that it was a class that was extremely easy to win and that Blue Dragon was penalized for lynch a non-BD player. Here the wincon is changed to a more difficult one where you are required to get yourself into hot water and then get out as you acquire a significantly large enough wagon on you. In addition if the Fiddler is executed then the day does not end and an additional lynch is possible and the players who voted on the execution are rewarded</p>
<p>Again, this also fixes a lot of the issues regarding the Fool. It’s harder to win as the Fiddler and if they do get executed then BD gets a lot of bonuses from their first passive. Openclaiming as the Fiddler is suicide as BD can easily get rid of you without wasting any resources and then getting rewarded for it.</p>
<p>The Fiddler is based on insanity akin to the saying of how Nero fiddled while Rome burned. In short, only a madman would actually try to get themselves almost executed.</p>
