    <title>[Mechanics Feedback] Shorten execution animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mechanics-feedback-shorten-execution-animations/76296</link>
    <description>Execution animations are 100% dead time. Not useful for anything. Even if you make the claim that they are useful, the animation times should be made uniform because in that case bowl of nails has an in game impact which would be weird.

Please shorten kill animations across the board (and consider making them uniform in length). Matches are already longer than they need to be.</description>
