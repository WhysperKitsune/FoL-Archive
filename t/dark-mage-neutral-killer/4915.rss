    <description>I must really like making NK classes.

Dark Mage - Neutral Killer

Passive 1 (Protective Ward): Night and Occupy immune

Passive 2 (Aura Wield): You will appear as a knight to invest ability&#39;s on nights that you don&#39;t kill

Day ability 1 (Jinx): Your target will die immediately if you are executed today. They will be notified. (4 uses. Works like the hunters retribution)

Day ability 2 (Empower): Spike will kill the target as well (2 uses)

Night ability (Spike): Kill everyone that visits your target. Pierces night immunity (unlimited)

Note: Jinx is useful because you can hold neutrals hostage if you think they might betray you. It can even delay some BD from trying to kill you because they don&#39;t want to die and might have other priority&#39;s.</description>
