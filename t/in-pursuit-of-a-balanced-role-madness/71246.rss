    <title>In Pursuit of a Balanced Role Madness</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/in-pursuit-of-a-balanced-role-madness/71246</link>
    <description>Hey all, this thread is all about discussing to make balanced game-modes 20+, have people roll citizens and still enjoy themselves as much as if they were a PR.

I&#39;ll post some discussion from AA FM pre-game lobby for context to this thread:

[quote=&quot;Icibalus, post:336, topic:68437&quot;]
Rolemadness games aren’t that good at all. They’re actually far too swingy to be done as often as we do them
also lolaceticmillers lolinformedmillers

you know it’s considered acceptable and non-bastard on most sites to have uninformed millers, right? same thing with cop sanities
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Icibalus, post:342, topic:68437, full:true&quot;]
people on this forum completely oversell how fun having a power role is
believe it or not, it’s not worth making the game swingy and unbalanced for what it is
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Icibalus, post:348, topic:68437, full:true&quot;]
right but what you’re forgetting is that ITAs ***are*** worth making the game swingy and unbalanced for
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Icibalus, post:357, topic:68437, full:true&quot;]
anyway I’d argue that the problem with including power roles for next to no reason for FUN reasons is that you’re going to have to make some of the prs shitty and effectively cits once you get past 20p which is dishonest to everyone

I’ve never really made a rolemadness game where I’ve felt that every role had to be a PR and couldn’t have just been fine as a Citizen
