    <description>Not sure where this should go, so I&#39;m putting it here.

&gt; **[color=green]Necktoucher (Neutral Creepy)[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Touch someone&#39;s neck. They will be incredibly disturbed.
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 2: Necrotoucher: Take a dead mans neck and start touching it.
&gt; 
&gt; *Someone touched your neck. You feel profoundly disturbed.*
&gt; 
&gt; Goal: Creep everybody out.

Feel free to comment any other joke classes.</description>

            <p>I think we recently saw a RL class like this person, but done in whispers instead of abilities. He was suspended for being creepy D: technically he won his objective.</p>
