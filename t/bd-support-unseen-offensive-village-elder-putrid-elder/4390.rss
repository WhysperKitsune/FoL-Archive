**Lore:**
You are a Village Elder called to the kings presence to hear his decision (hopefully a something that benefits the village)

Comments:
The Village Elder was not intended to be very powerful early game,as if you execute someone earlier, it is more likely you will execute a innocent which will cause the group you gathered to turn on you,But is instead intended to cripple a evil faction when needed most (ex:Executing the MasterMind when Unseen have majority) Oh,And nothing is set in stone, this is just a concept


**Putrid Elder** (Unseen Offensive) - Converted to from Village Elder

**Day Ability 1:**
**Night Signal** (single Use)
Call peasants from the village (Nobody will be alerted until the next day Message will be identical to the Village Elders,Peasants will be summoned immediately)
**Day Ability 2 (Optional):**
**Manipulated Swarm (2 uses)**
Peasants will swarm a player of you&#39;re choice,silencing them while they shoo away the peasants (Player will be alerted to this)
**Night Ability 1:**
**Convincing Presence (2 uses)**
Force a player to target someone else at random (excluding unseen and who they were going to visit,Player will not be alerted to this, does not work on killing or occupy immune classes)
**Night Ability 2 (Optional)**
**Manipulated Defense (0 uses,Use Night signal to gain 4 uses)**
Send peasants to a player to &quot;defend them&quot; from attacks killing anyone who visits (excluding immune classes,Tells the player they were attacked last night and now bleeding when actually not bleeding)
**Lore:**
You are a corrupt Elder of the Village,You keep most of the resources to yourself and use deception and Scare Tactics to make sure the peasants follow you&#39;re command.

Comments:The Putrid Elder is intended to be a pain in the thigh and rely on similar Classes to blend in (example sending peasants to the MasterMind to kill players who visit the MasterMind or sending them to to someone who they think will be visited by other Blue Dragon or Neutrals so the peasants attack them,or their day ability night signal so as to try and pretend there is a Village Elder)
Nothing is set in stone,If they actually wish to include these two classes,They can tweak,Nerf,or buff the classes as they desire
