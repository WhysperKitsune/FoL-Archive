</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Was never implying it wasn’t. I was saying that the term “social deduction” which you used in that context, to many people means litterally the oposite. Their are indeed many forms of deduction in this game. Logic, tracking abilities are all indeed forms of deduction, and yes very much core mechanics to the game. I was just pointing out that they are alternatives to “social” deduction, rather than a part of it.</p>
<p>at least in my view there’s basically 2 main distinct forms of deduction in the game.</p>
<p>Social deductions – IE reading the player<br>
Did he vote for X, is anyone being too quiet, too loud.</p>
<p>Logical deductions - Well, 10 minutes ago bob claimed physician, and now our 2nd phys just died. Therefore bob isn’t a physician.</p>
<p>Then abilities are generally speaking hybirds there. Sometimes it is just luck… though usually competent players are using some social deductions to prioritize what order to use their abilities on whom.</p>

            <p>My philosophy with these things are that any piece of information you can receive should have the capability of either being flase or missleading.</p>
<p>Ex: Unseen check could be framed<br>
Non-occ immune could be Mastermind<br>
OCC Immune could be CW<br>
Dead prince could be Possessor<br>
That living person could be reaped<br>
That king could be evil<br>
The person visiting the guy that died last night could be sheriff and it’s a coincidence.</p>

            <p>I respectfully disagree as this game is a fast-paced Mafia clone. The game is the same, you deduce who is evil based on how they act, how they talk, and how they respond. The abilities are there to add some spice.</p>
<p>You should not have to rely on the abilities.</p>

<p>Most players spend half the game in a private room not talking to anyone else, and the other half of the game in short bursts of communication with everyone.  ToL is not designed to focus on what you are talking about.  Using abilities and comparing notes is the deduction I am referring to.</p>

            <p>What notification do you get if you try to occupy a person protected by magic barrier?  That they were immune?  Or that you were prevented?</p>
<p>I don’t like facelift and I don’t like magic barrier if it reports immune instead of prevented.  I think these changes just muddy social deduction.  I’ve already had a game where a butler was hanged because 1 butler had died and possessor used facelift to disguise as butler.  I also had a game where a butler was hung for claiming a psychic was occ immune, and later the CW said he barriered the psychic.</p>
<p>Players can lie and lie, but death should (even allowing for rare exception of defile) tell the truth and we should be able to reasonably rely on death.  And we should (even allowing for mindwarp or frame) to rely on the results of our night abilities.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Princess - you probably lose<br>
Magic users - give 3 days of all magic users for the 3 days the “sorc” was alive, then guess mostly non-magic users, hope you don’t happen to include a psychic or CW.<br>
Claimed in jail - Of course I lied, what kind of an idiot would claim a neutral role in jail<br>
Unseen/cult attacks you twice - unless they get majority, they don’t really have high credibility with the BD, also pretty uncommon for them to burn 2 kills on the same target after it fails<br>
poisoned/bleeding - welp that kind of forces a new jump. drop the old body as inquisitor and move on to a new identity.<br>
Neuts out - yeah that is what people will need to learn to do to that for exactly this reason.</p>

            <p>Mmm, I honestly believe intelligent players will <em>“test”</em> the Inquisitor claim to see if it checks out before taking it for granted. To do that, they can simply try occupying them with Butler/Drunk or have a Princess flirt with them.</p>
<p>if it’s really that big of a problem for most though, just make it so Possessor can’t Face Lift to Inquisitor/Sorcerer/Reaper.</p>

            <p>I think poss buff might be a bit too much. Now to win as poss:<br>
-Step 1: Make sure psychics are dead.<br>
-Step 2: Jump and make your body appear as sorcerer.<br>
-Step 3: Claim that you were inquisitor and that you won already</p>

<p>I’m looking foward to seeing the psychic trolling, on both fronts. By that I mean, assasain dies… tells psychic he was (whatever his fake logbook said). claims he was jumped into and his real body is (picks a random probable BD)</p>
<p>And of course the oposite. drop the old body as sorc, and claim inquisitor. Hope nobody trusts the appearing sorc’s claim.</p>
<p>The biggest idea to me, is when you are evil, troll the psychic, keep claiming a good role and that you were possesed. and if you are possesor, drop your old husks as evil roles (so that a psychic doubts them).</p>

            <p>Ah yeah, I &lt;3 most of the CW changes. The only one I’m iffy about is Tornado not effecting occupation immune players but we’ll see how it works.</p>
<p>It is very good to see Magic Barrier back, though! That ability was so underestimated the last time CW had it, but keeping that on any outed BD Investigator is just so powerful. ^^</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The devs are taking Possessor in an interesting direction, too. Not only can we now jump to multiple people (and edit their logs) but we can also edit their class now as well with Face Lift. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"> I can see this being used in really devious ways to fan suspicion on others while keeping it off of the Possessor itself.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 1 Observer already dead, but you believe there may be another in game for whatever reason. You jump to a Physician’s body, rewrite their logs to that of an Observer’s, Face Lift -&gt; Jump again… and now there are two <em>confirmed</em> Observer’s dead, with one person possibly alive claiming it…  The trial for that day could be spent on that third Observer claim or maybe if you’re really lucky the Prince will execute them the following night. =o</p>
<p>I definitely can not wait to try out the new Possessor.</p>

<p>Would someone mind explaining what exactly counts as a negative effect? Does it block a hunter wolf for example since it isnt a direct attack? Will it block stuff as a possessor forcing you to attack someone else or an Illusionist trying to mindwarp you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still haven’t played with Sorceror or Inquisitor but I’m seeing some very valid cases against this change and for a bit of a rework</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Personally I have no negative views on this change. I honestly like the idea of sorc having a chance to find allies if he’s going to have them. But I think he needs to be stronger against BD/king investigatives, and weaker against inquisitor as it is.</p>
<p>Were I to write these from scratch I’d probably do</p>
<p>Return magic dust to old form, (frame one person 3 uses). Make sorc appear BD to king and make his kills unfollowable with observer. Knight guards and hunter just canceling out the attack rather than killing either.</p>
<p>The not killing unseen/cult IMO I don’t really have a problem with it. In my loss history with sorc so far, my deaths have been</p>
<ol>
<li>Died to knight</li>
<li>Caught by king</li>
<li>walked into bear (2x)</li>
<li>Listed as immune in assasains journal (cant’ really blame him, he probably assumed it was a possesor, and I did unknowingly kill the first convert, and him back to back)</li>
<li>Poisoned by assasain 15 seconds after claiming phys to prince. (thus taking away any sane option of asking for a heal)</li>
</ol>
<p>so, in 6 losses as sorc… the only thing that HASN’T posed the least bit of a threat to me so far… is the damn role that is supposed to be it’s bane. I haven’t been killed by, or seen one of them actually pose a real threat to any live sorcerer. Nor can I really understand how it’s supposed to be with magic dust the way it is.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>sorcerer and inquisitor needs to be changed dramatically. Inquisitor is BD who really can’t be counter claimed, sorcerer is evil faction who finds their allies later.</p>
<p>My suggestion is make sorcerer like an alch: just wants to survive, has ability to kill (probably inquisitor).</p>
<p>Inquisitor would remain pretty much the same, but sorcerer would become an alch that is always immune to death except when it is inquisitor killing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New passive Armored - You will survive the first attacker you block with Sacrifice/Protection.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is a step in the right direction, I agree, but I feel that maybe it should be similar to the Inquisitor’s passive; having one chance of immunity before dying. A Knight should be able to fend off his own attackers.</p>

Tornado now limited to 3 uses.<br>
Tornado will no longer change the targets of occupy immune players.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like most of the Court Wizard change except for one bit. I still feel that Tornado should be able to change the targets of occupy immune players, because this isn’t changing the Butler or something, this is changing the target.</p>

<p>Puppet Strings now allows the Possessor to see whispers to and from the controlled player the next day. Will no longer be able to control the King.</p>

</aside>
<p>However, I feel that seeing whispers is a bit OP for the possessor to have. It’s my opinion though.</p>

<p>Perception now prevents you from attacking Cult or Unseen members.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t doing this basically make the Sorcerer a fourth/fifth  member of the Unseen/Cult? It would be a bit overpowered, unless the win rate for the Sorcerer is the lowest among the three Neutral Killers.</p>

<p>It was funny as an Unseen to see a Sheriff get killed by a Hunter’s Retribution because the Scorned framed the Hunter, but it was definitely not fun when you were the Sheriff. This is a nice change.</p>
