    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/have-you-thought-af-any-rules-for-the-game-yet/69</link>
    <description>i know for a fact there will people who use skype and game throw toll and so on. what will and will not be punished and what will. what will be the punishment. i think it should be ban for like half a day next time a day next time a week and so on but its your choice.

i want to know sooner of how you will enforce them because i dont want this 2 become a second town of salem where no one get banned no matter what they do.

btw i dont think you should perma untill you have no more options cause you have to pay for the game latter on</description>

<p>Haha if everything is stable (<strong>we hope so!!</strong>) you just may see us on <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> maybe we can code in something special to add to our journal so when we die, you’ll see at the very bottom “Imperium42 Staff” <strong>so you know you just killed a dev!</strong></p>
<p>While on the topic, here is a sneak peak of the journal - we split it up into sections to make it easier to write per-day. There will be a cool “book/journal” type UI instead of plain glass - that’s just temporar:</p>

<p>Here is a GIF (ignore the ugly PLACEHOLDER UI and OLD character models - we completely revamped them):</p>
<p>In fact… feel honored because I believe this is one of the ONLY gameplay animations we’ve ever released to the public! <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>We know for a fact this will happen too <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> gah, an unfortunate fact.</p>
<p>That said, not everyone on Skype will gamethrow – but for those suspected of gamethrowing, they can be reported. After reported, we’d like to have a system similar to how League of Legends posts it for players to review. However, this is quite complex, so may take a while to implement.</p>
<p>For now, what I’m thinking is, if a person has 3 strikes on their account (3 people reported), an email will be sent to an admin to investigate. <strong>Your idea of progressive punishments is great</strong>. I don’t think we’ll perma-ban people unless it’s more serious beyond using Skype, but there definitely will be punishments. We have no idea why ToS doesn’t deal with them (laziness, perhaps) – we’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>To be transparent, reporting probably won’t be in alpha,</strong> but perhaps beta or release while we’re working on more-core features (friends list [uncapped], matchmaking, etc). Let’s get you guys some features first <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
