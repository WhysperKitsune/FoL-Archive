    <title>Assassin day Ability {rework} Blinding Dagger</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassin-day-ability-rework-blinding-dagger/54163</link>
    <description>I posted this idea for a joke class https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-tormental/35925/16

But I think that the assassin should get this day Ability to replace distract:

&quot;Blinding Dagger&quot; - blind a player for 10 seconds. They can not see anything that is said in the chat and they are not able to see or put up any votes (4 uses) 

Note: he is still able to chat but can&#39;t see anything he says for the ten second period. 

_Will you be able to see what everyone says after the 10 second blinding effect?_ 
- no, it works like a minor mystic mind warp. But you can see the votes after the effect wears off

 Tell me what you think.</description>
