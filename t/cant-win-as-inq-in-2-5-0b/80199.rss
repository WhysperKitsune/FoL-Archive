    <title>Can&#39;t win as inq in 2.5.0b</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cant-win-as-inq-in-2-5-0b/80199</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I played inq and had all my targets dead: 2 physicians and drunk. 1 of phys died as Assasin cause he was converted. After last target died I had message that I won and could leave the game (but I decided to stay in game). After that I was executed by court, After the game ended it said that I actually lost...

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Game was supposed to tell me that I had won and not lost after game ended.

#### Steps to reproduce:

#### Comments:
Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t make screenshots right after the game cause I didn&#39;t expect this to happen. In old patches this had never happened to me.</description>

            <p>Just wanted to note that I’ve seen Inquisitors win this patch in my own games. So whatever problem happened here is not consistent.</p>
