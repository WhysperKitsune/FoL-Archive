    <description>So a lot of you guys want me to do a face reveal, despite the fact I did it years ago. However, I&#39;ve always been too Unseen to do that.

*extended pause so you can laugh at the joke*

Hello, internet, welcome to GAME THEORY!
Now, Throne Of Lies is a game that came out recently, based on Game of Thrones, and that got me thinking.
In the game, nobody knows who anyone else is despite the fact the Prince is ver *distinctive* in their appearnce wink wink wink.

--

In addiiton, people can walk into the Reaper&#39;s room and not notice the THRONE OF FREAKING SKULLS!
Seriously, what&#39;s up with that?

Well **I** have an explanation.
Throne Of Lies... takes place in the same universe as Undertale!
After all, as we all know Sans is secretly Ness and as such could have used the lesser known psycbic ability PK GAMEBALANCE!

Don&#39;t believe me? Well there&#39;s more!

In the game of throne of lies people can choose to either execute or pardon players. This means that in ToL you can do a pacifist or genocide run, JUST LIKE UNDERTALE.

**But hey... that&#39;s just a theory... A GAME THEORY!!! Thanks for watching**
