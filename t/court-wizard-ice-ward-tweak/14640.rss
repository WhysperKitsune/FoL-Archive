    <title>Court Wizard Ice Ward Tweak</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-ice-ward-tweak/14640</link>
    <description>Hey, I am new to these forums, and this is my first post. I am not a huge fan of the new Ice Ward update but I have a suggestion for a teak for it. Not sure if this is the right spot for it, but here we go:
I think that Ice Ward should be able to be used as many times on as many people as you want, but not more than twice per person in a row. This would mean that CWs will be able to do things N1, as they know that a potential Ice Ward on a Prince or King won&#39;t be wasted. I had a game where I tried explaining the &quot;N1: Nothing&quot; to the Jailor, and when I said something about twice per person, he thought I was pretending to be an old CW and killed me. Sure, I could have explained better, but I think f my suggestion was implemented it would be better.
What are your thoughts?
Thanks in advance!</description>
