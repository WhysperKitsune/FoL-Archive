[color=red]All changes are effective immediately.[/color]
## The List of In-Game Rules (_Refer to In-Game edition whenever possible_)
----------

&gt; This is an extension of our [Global Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244), which is an extension of our [Official Terms of Service](https://www.ThroneOfLies.com/legal). Rules in-game also apply to the extended community &lt;&gt; and the other way around. Disciplinary action in 1 area may also be mirrored in others.

&gt; Also note [Steam&#39;s Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) as well as [Steam&#39;s Code of Conduct](http://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct) that also stacks with our own.

&gt;These rules are just a mirror of the in-game rules section. If this post differs from the ingame section in any way, the ingame section takes preference and will be considered the &quot;correct&quot; version, no matter the difference.

------------

1. Swearing is fine, but don&#39;t overdo it &amp; don&#39;t target people.

2. No bullying/harassment/hate/racism. Including against staff.

3. No spamming, including overdone CAPS LOCK and off-topic.

4. Concurrent multi-accounting is prohibited.

5. No posting links, other than links to your own youtube/twitch channels which can be posted in logs and post-game chat.

6. Do not imitate or impersonate Imperium42 staff or volunteers.

7. No spoilers to recent (&lt;2 weeks) movies, events, games, etc.

8. All rules apply both in-game and within official communities.

9. No gamethrowing, like intentionally going against your goal.

10. No drawing nudity or &quot;&gt;PG-13&quot; obscenities in Deathnotes

11. No cheating (or pretending to cheat), such as exchanging [u]private[/u] info by &quot;metagaming&quot; with 3rd-parties like voice chat.
([u]Voice chat is fine[/u] as long as you&#39;re only sharing [u]public[/u] info)

12. Don&#39;t leave games early (including Neutrals) [u]while alive&lt;/i&gt;.

13. Do not go AFK for extended periods of time while in a match.

14. No stream sniping/watching &quot;same match&quot; streams in-game.

15. Don&#39;t ask/hint to be converted for any reason, even if bait/joking.

16. Do not bus/start a vote against your fellow Unseen/Cult allies without first discussing it with them.

17. You can roleplay with a name, but you still have to communicate with other players (on-topic).

18. You may only speak English in [u]public[/u] games in a USA region. 

* For emergencies, seek out a **@moderator** [in Discord](https://discord.gg/tol).

**[Warned? Banned? &quot;I didn&#39;t do it?&quot; Look Here]**
http://throneofli.es/banfaq

---------

&gt; **[Details on Rule 1, &quot;discussing bussing&quot;]**

## **Okay** to do:

### First case:

&gt;-- Night 4 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;Alright&quot;
-- Day 5 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;I&#39;m the Drunk, he&#39;s lying!&quot;
(the court proceeds to execute the Invoker, gaining the Cult Leader trust)

### Second case:

&gt;-- Night 4 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.&quot;
(the Invoker is afk and does not respond)
-- Day 5 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.&quot;
(the court proceeds to execute the Invoker, gaining the Cult Leader trust)

### Third case

&gt;-- Night 4 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;Wtf no, if you do i&#39;m gamethrowing&quot;
-- Day 5 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;Screw you, 7 is the CL, get them next&quot;
(Both the Invoker and CL are executed by the court)

The third case will result in the Invoker getting punished for gamethrowing (if reported).
The CL&#39;s play is fair and conform with the rules.

## **Not** okay to do:

&gt;-- Night 4 -- 
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Who do we try to convert this night? How about 8?&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;I think 8 is a good choice, let&#39;s try that.&quot;
-- Day 5 --
Cult Leader (7): &quot;Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night!&quot;
Invoker (12): &quot;Wtf what are you doing?!&quot;

## Gamethrowing?

To clarify gamethrowing, it&#39;s TL;DR &quot;going against your objective&quot;. An example of this is making a decision that would 99%+ chance hinder your allies (such as staying silent on the stand as BD when on trial, using King vote abilities on 100% confirmed Prince&#39;s, etc).

Almost every suspension for gamethrowing will be AFTER a warning to clarify (since gamethrowing can be quite broad). After a warning, there&#39;s no excuse~

## Is it *racism*?
&gt; * Been warned/suspended before for this offense?
&gt; * More than one person was offended by your comment?

**It&#39;s probably going to be classified as racism.** Being subtle about it still classifies it the same. If you&#39;re the race you&#39;re making fun of IRL, we don&#39;t know that - so it doesn&#39;t apply, here. If you&#39;re joking/meme&#39;ing, we also don&#39;t know that (and it&#39;s not the right place to do so, anyway). 

Racism rule breaking is final word - no appeals.

## Hate and toxicity 

Some examples (but not limited to) include racism, sexism, anti-LGBT speech, mentions/roleplaying of school shootings/shooters, antisemitism (yes, it&#39;s hate if you call someone a &quot;Jew&quot; where the context is clearly *intended* to be derogatory)...

Just common sense, mates, if you wouldn&#39;t say it to your teacher it&#39;s probably not allowed. 

## Is it *targeted harassment*?

&gt; * “f**k, I died!! Gahhh”

No - he’s yelling “at the sky”. We  **allow**  swearing that is non-targeted (and  *the sky*  cannot report ;D).

&gt; * f**k YOU!!

Yep - it’s targeted harassment. Why? It’s  **targeted** ! You’re making 1 person trying to feel bad. You’re not being vague, general, or yelling at the sky: You’re yelling at a particular person. This will get you suspended!

&gt; * REPORT 13 FOR GAMETHROWING!

While 13 may or may not get in trouble for gamethrowing, *you* may also get in trouble for targeted harassment! If 13 ends up being inno, it may be *just* you that gets in trouble.  **Baiting**  can often be just as bad as any other form of toxicity, itself. *Subtle* targeted harassment is still targeted harassment.

## Exemptions

There are no exemptions.

&gt; But I played xxxx hours! And I&#39;m a streamer! And I referred 100 friends!

Veterans, advocates and streamers are **not** exempt from the rules and are not given any special treatment. You&#39;ll find many clips on Google showing streamers receiving disciplinary action just like anyone else. If anything, veterans and streamers *should know better* :stuck_out_tongue: 

________________

## Appeals
Appeals are only handled in Discord (https://discord.gg/tol) - and *privately*:
1. **If you are community-banned from Discord, you have lost your right to appeal.**
2. DM any Judge+ online and wait a few mins in between each DM before moving to the next. Spamming every Judge+ will likely result in being ignored, as these are volunteer community members and not staff.
3. Please be respectful - we have no obligation to unban as suspensions are already thoroughly reviewed before a suspension is issued.
4. Do not attempt to appeal more than once per suspension: If 1 Judge+ declines the appeal, please respect it without an attempt to appeal to someone else (we&#39;ll know).
5. Do not attempt to appeal someone else&#39;s case for them; if they are banned, see #1 ^
6. Attempting to appeal publicly or to cause a scene will result in an auto-decline.

________________

## Final Notes

&quot;Technically&quot;, &quot;I was joking&quot;, appeals for *someone else,* or &quot;It&#39;s not mentioned in the *Code of Conduct*&quot; appeals will *not* be accepted, outlined in the [terms of service](https://www.throneoflies.com/legal/index.html):

Just because an explicit example wasn&#39;t listed in x or y doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not in the *terms of service* - this guide, for example, is just a short guideline of how the ToS can be interpreted.</description>

            <p>Added some examples of what is/isn’t targeted harassment</p>
<h2>Is it <em>targeted harassment</em>?</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“f**k, I died!! Gahhh”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No - he’s yelling “at the sky”. We  <strong>allow</strong>  swearing that is non-targeted (and  <em>the sky</em>  cannot report ;D).</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>f**k YOU!!</li>

<p>Yep - it’s targeted harassment. Why? It’s  <strong>targeted</strong> ! You’re making 1 person trying to feel bad. You’re not being vague, general, or yelling at the sky: You’re yelling at a particular person. This will get you suspended!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>REPORT 13 FOR GAMETHROWING!</li>
</ul>

<p>While 13 may or may not get in trouble for gamethrowing, <em>you</em> may also get in trouble for targeted harassment! If 13 ends up being inno, it may be <em>just</em> you that gets in trouble.  <strong>Baiting</strong>  can often be just as bad as any other form of toxicity, itself. <em>Subtle</em> targeted harassment is still targeted harassment.</p>

<p>12 - Added “including neutrals” to leaving rules.</p>
<p>For clarification regarding gamethrowing (<span class="hashtag">#9</span>) in the example situation that an Alchemist chooses to side with BD or no one at all, as long as they are still trying to win, that’s not going against their objective – that’s just a perk of being neutral.</p>

<hr>
<p>Only speak English in public games. If you’re playing a private game with 16 people who all speak a non-english language then it is your decision, but you must speak English in public games until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>[Details on Rule 1, “discussing bussing”]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<strong>Okay</strong> to do:</h2>
<h3>First case:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>– Night 4 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.”<br>
Invoker (12): “Alright”<br>
– Day 5 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.”<br>
Invoker (12): “I’m the Drunk, he’s lying!”<br>
(the court proceeds to execute the Invoker, gaining the Cult Leader trust)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Second case:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>– Night 4 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.”<br>
(the Invoker is afk and does not respond)<br>
– Day 5 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.”<br>
(the court proceeds to execute the Invoker, gaining the Cult Leader trust)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Third case</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>– Night 4 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Hey Invoker I need to bus you tomorrow to gain trust as Paladin claim.”<br>
Invoker (12): “Wtf no, if you do i’m gamethrowing”<br>
– Day 5 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night.”<br>
Invoker (12): “Screw you, 7 is the CL, get them next”<br>
(Both the Invoker and CL are executed by the court)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third case will result in the Invoker getting punished for gamethrowing (if reported).<br>
The CL’s play is fair and conform with the rules.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Not</strong> okay to do:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>– Night 4 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Who do we try to convert this night? How about 8?”<br>
Invoker (12): “I think 8 is a good choice, let’s try that.”<br>
– Day 5 –<br>
Cult Leader (7): “Guys, 12 is Cult I checked them last night!”<br>
Invoker (12): “Wtf what are you doing?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Gamethrowing?</h2>
<p>To clarify gamethrowing, it’s TL;DR “going against your objective”. An example of this is making a decision that would 99%+ chance hinder your allies (such as staying silent on the stand as BD when on trial, using King vote abilities on 100% confirmed Prince’s, etc).</p>
<p>Almost every suspension for gamethrowing will be AFTER a warning to clarify (since gamethrowing can be quite broad). After a warning, there’s no excuse~</p>
<h2>Is it <em>racism</em>?</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Been warned/suspended before for this offense?</li>
<li>More than one person was offended by your comment?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s probably going to be classified as racism.</strong> Being subtle about it still classifies it the same. If you’re the race you’re making fun of IRL, we don’t know that - so it doesn’t apply, here. If you’re joking/meme’ing, we also don’t know that (and it’s not the right place to do so, anyway).</p>
<p>Racism rule breaking is final word - no appeals.</p>
<h2>Hate and toxicity</h2>
<p>Some examples (but not limited to) include racism, sexism, anti-LGBT speech, mentions/roleplaying of school shootings/shooters, antisemitism (yes, it’s hate if you call someone a “Jew” where the context is clearly <em>intended</em> to be derogatory)…</p>
<p>Just common sense, mates, if you wouldn’t say it to your teacher it’s probably not allowed.</p>
<h2>Is it <em>targeted harassment</em>?</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“f**k, I died!! Gahhh”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No - he’s yelling “at the sky”. We  <strong>allow</strong>  swearing that is non-targeted (and  <em>the sky</em>  cannot report ;D).</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>f**k YOU!!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep - it’s targeted harassment. Why? It’s  <strong>targeted</strong> ! You’re making 1 person trying to feel bad. You’re not being vague, general, or yelling at the sky: You’re yelling at a particular person. This will get you suspended!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>REPORT 13 FOR GAMETHROWING!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While 13 may or may not get in trouble for gamethrowing, <em>you</em> may also get in trouble for targeted harassment! If 13 ends up being inno, it may be <em>just</em> you that gets in trouble.  <strong>Baiting</strong>  can often be just as bad as any other form of toxicity, itself. <em>Subtle</em> targeted harassment is still targeted harassment.</p>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>
<p>There are no exemptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I played xxxx hours! And I’m a streamer! And I referred 100 friends!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veterans, advocates and streamers are <strong>not</strong> exempt from the rules and are not given any special treatment. You’ll find many clips on Google showing streamers receiving disciplinary action just like anyone else. If anything, veterans and streamers <em>should know better</em> <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>Appeals are only handled in Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a>) - and <em>privately</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If you are community-banned from Discord, you have lost your right to appeal.</strong></li>
<li>DM any Judge+ online and wait a few mins in between each DM before moving to the next. Spamming every Judge+ will likely result in being ignored, as these are volunteer community members and not staff.</li>
<li>Please be respectful - we have no obligation to unban as suspensions are already thoroughly reviewed before a suspension is issued.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to appeal more than once per suspension: If 1 Judge+ declines the appeal, please respect it without an attempt to appeal to someone else (we’ll know).</li>
<li>Do not attempt to appeal someone else’s case for them; if they are banned, see <span class="hashtag">#1</span> ^</li>
<li>Attempting to appeal publicly or to cause a scene will result in an auto-decline.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>“Technically”, “I was joking”, appeals for <em>someone else,</em> or “It’s not mentioned in the <em>Code of Conduct</em>” appeals will <em>not</em> be accepted, outlined in the <a href="https://www.throneoflies.com/legal/index.html">terms of service</a>:</p>
<p>Just because an explicit example wasn’t listed in x or y doesn’t mean it’s not in the <em>terms of service</em> - this guide, for example, is just a short guideline of how the ToS can be interpreted.</p>
