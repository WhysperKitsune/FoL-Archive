    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Accepting Community Submissions -- READ FIRST!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-accepting-community-submissions-read-first/468</link>
    <description>We are now accepting lore submissions. While we finish coding Alpha, we&#39;ll let the lore build up -- as soon as Alpha is done coded, the devs will take a look over all the submissions. The best ones will likely be used within the game, on our [Wikia](https://tol.wikia.com), and will give you credit. We will also grant you the &quot;Loremaster&quot; role on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rFAXXQB) if chosen. We may do more later, such as in-game titles.

## [color=red]Rules (If you break them, we won&#39;t look at your lore):[/color]
1. You must first [read our existing lore](https://tol.wikia.com/Lore) and use our same _style_. **This is very important.** We&#39;ll know if you didn&#39;t read it :P
2. You must not edit the public Wikia with your own lore if not yet approved by a dev.
3. Try to use lore that creates a connection with other lore.
4. If you write lore about gods/deities, only write lore about **existing** deities/gods ([Corax](https://tol.wikia.com/Corax) + [Mithras](https://tol.wikia.com/Mithras)). Sure, we may introduce more later, **but not for a long time.** Don&#39;t forget that Corax/Mithras has nothing to do with the Black Rose, although you may introduce hints of a vague connection
5. Post in #classes-roles with the subject starting with **[Lore Suggestion]**. Better yet, use our template:
