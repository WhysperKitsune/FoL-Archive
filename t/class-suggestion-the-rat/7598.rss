    <description>We don&#39;t have a Neutral Investigative role yet. So here is an idea for one

Class Name: Rat

Neutral Investigative role

Their day ability is like the Maid Spy.

Their night ability is infinite Snoop in people&#39;s will or infinite checking faction ability. 

This new class idea might be too good but at the same time. The Neutral wants to live. He can provide information to BD or to the evils. He also doesn&#39;t know if the Will is fake or not, that is why he can instead check their faction. But this means they do not know their potential class. This will provide more strategy when playing this role. This role can be easily proven but he has no passives. It will be difficult surviving with this role though. But we do need more variety in the Neutrals. Adding a Neutral Investigative will be quite interesting.

The information you provide will be the undoing of others, but you will be a target

The Goal is to survive.

This Class can be tweak for balancing if need be. If you do not accept this idea, at least I planted an idea.</description>
