    <title>New Sheriff scout bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-sheriff-scout-bug/64097</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
This happened two times in one game, confirmed by two different Sheriffs. Our BD person was visited by Unseen according to Sheriff&#39;s scout in the night that person was jailed. I played Prince so I know for sure who was jailed and two different Sheriffs claimed that the person I jailed was visited by Unseen. That happened at N3 and N4.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Jailed person can&#39;t be visited so Sheriff&#39;s scout should never tell that jailed person is visited.

#### Steps to reproduce:

#### Comments:
This bug costed us the game cause I executed Sheriff thinking he was Scorned or evil.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Scout will no longer tell you if a player was converted, and will instead tell you if the Unseen visited targeted player.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>tell you if unseen visited, not targeted or attempted to visit.  If the visit was prevented, it should not trigger scout.</p>
