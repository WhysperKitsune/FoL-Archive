    <title>New Class: Musician</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-class-musician/17652</link>
    <description>**BLUE DRAGON VERSION**
I was thinking that there could be a new unique Blue Dragon class called the musician. The musician would be a support  who has 3 abilities. Each of these abilities are different songs that he can play at night and each one can only be used a limited amount of times, say 3 (or whatever feels reasonable) . The first song ability would be called Song of Worship. Song of Worship can refill an ability charge (if applicable) when played to another player. The next song would be called Song of Awareness. This ability would take a day to cast (so the night you use it would not be applied until the next night. It makes a person occupy immune for the rest of the game. This ability would probably have a limit of about 2 uses per game. The last song ability is called Song of the Dragon. This song alerts 2 or 1 random Blue dragon players (if there are any left) that there is a musician on their team. It also gives those two random blue dragons the number of the musician. This is great for late game when there are a few people left and you need to find out who you can trust. This ability is strong and can only be used once. The musician would also have a passive called duty calls which makes them occupy immune. To win as the musician, the Blue Dragon must win. 

**UNSEEN VERSION**
The converted unseen Musician is called the Minstrel. The unseen version will only have two abilities. The first one is Song of Distraction which occupies a player preventing them from taking any action that night (probably unlimited uses). The second would be Song of Deduction. This ability discovers what class a certain player is (two uses). Obviously to win the Unseen would have to win. 

(I also had an idea for a day ability for the unseen version called Song of Distraction. This ability would prevent the prince from jailing anyone the next night (1 or 2 uses). Let me know what you think of this.)

Well that is what I came up with hope you guys like it and consider it for the game.If you want I can attempt to draw a character portrait. Let me know what you think of it and if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks for making this great game.</description>

            <p>Tell you what I like that a lot. People do not seem to like the missing round table meeting ability as it would bore the other player. I will try to think of another replacement ability if that was does not appeal to the devs…</p>

            <p>If I am perfectly honest - this feels a little weak to me as suggested. Making someone miss an entire day’s worth of round table chatter might sound great, until you consider players randomly using it without cause, forcing genuine BD to miss entire days worth of convos/accusations at a time. That will piss people off. The last ability that alerts BDs to a musician’s presence also feels a little weak, as one might presume it would ultimately be easy to confirm via the first two abilities.</p>
<p>However - a musician sounds like an interesting support role… I don’t think this idea should be trashed, only that it maybe should be rethought.</p>
<p>Here’s my proposal: what if we gave the musician a little “cooldown” between songs? Say you have some powerful defensive songs - make 2 targets immune to nightshade/bleeding, etc, etc. - but whenever you want to trigger one of your other songs, you must “prepare” for a full day before you can play it. This would force the musician to strategize their best moves each day/night, as to transition from one song to another will cost them a day of inactivity. They’d need some powerful songs if we went this route, but in a perfect world, the day long cooldown between songs would help to balance it out.</p>
<p>There’s many other ways one could spin a musician class… I think this is a great idea for a class and would love any number of ideas on how they could be handled.</p>

            <p>I think that the class is a good idea. I think that there should probably be less uses on the 1st song. For the second song, it would be boring for the player to not be able to do anything. So perhaps they could use their night ability again. Seems like a good idea to add to the game!</p>
