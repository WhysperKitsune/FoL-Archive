    <title>The day 1 to night 1 bug is back</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-day-1-to-night-1-bug-is-back/29669</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
You know how back in the day you couldn&#39;t open your journal during day 1 or it would freeze and not go to night 1? That just happened to me last game except I opened my deathnote during day 1. I was assassin and getting excited about it too. My name that game was Blue Lizard if that helps you guys find the game. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
It should have gone from day 1 to night 1

#### Steps to reproduce:
Nothing yet but I&#39;ll open up my deathnote next game I am able to during day 1 and try to replicate it.

            <p>It’s cool I had to leave the game. Report me!</p>
<p>Nah but I’m in a pally game now and tried to replicate it and it went to N1 just fine. Isolated incident I guess.</p>
