    <description>&gt; **The Magician**
&gt; **Tough Crowd:** You are always seen as Evil to investigative classes. Upon reaching your win condition, commit suicide and guarantee  all attacks succeed the following night.
&gt; **Disappearing act:** You can quickly escape your attacker using your own magic which causes you to disappear from the scene. Death immunity. *(One time)*
&gt; ***[Day abilities]***
&gt; **Impersonation:** Select a class from a limited list. Cause *Illusion* to become a fake version of the chosen class&#39; core ability. (∞)
&gt; ***[Night abilities]***
&gt; **Illusion:** Trick target player into receiving fake feedback from the class chosen from *Impersonation*. (∞)
&gt; ***[Win Condition]***
&gt; By the end of the game, be placed up on stand and then pardoned 2 times.

            <p>The target will receive normal redirect feedback (“you were redirected to x”) and they will receive feedback based off of who you fake redirected to. For example, if you illusioned a phys, it will tell them that they were redirected from 7 to 4 and 4 was dnr, when in reality the phys is still targeting 7. So if 7 was attacked and healed, that phys healed them, but the phys doesn’t know that.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I wanted to give details on interactions:<br>
Fake knight: Does nothing<br>
Fake hunter: Fake occupies if they visit who you want them to?<br>
Fake butler/servant/invoker: Fake occupies (They will not receive feedback for their ability)<br>
Fake drunk/SS/alcoholic: Fake redirect (Target will receive feedback as if they targeted the 2nd person)<br>
Fake physician/chronomancer/alchemist/herbalist: Additionally does a fake attack<br>
Fake CW: Will also fake occupy<br>
Fake Sage/ritualist: Fake redirects if someone targets one of your targets.<br>
Fake mystic/noble/aristocrat/illusionist/apostle/investigative: Does nothing<br>
Fake non-convert evil: Does nothing<br>
Mercenary: Fake occs all visitors<br>
Everything else: Does nothing<br>
Is this correct?</p>
