            <p>mithras was a persian god, the romans took him and sort of melded him with sol invicitus (the unconquered son). the cult was around the same time as early christianity, it was popular with soldiers. they went into dark caves, they had initiation trials, they (maybe) ritually killed bulls, they ritually had dinner, etc.</p>
<p>it wasnt like a death/blood cult as it is in tis game.</p>
