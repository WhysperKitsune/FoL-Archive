    <title>Detailed Roleplay, Anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/detailed-roleplay-anyone/53685</link>
    <description>So so so

I have a roleplay in mind, but due to several things, I want to run it detailed style. Not one liner.

### What is the difference between them?

Well, one liner is the style often used here. It mostly consist of dialogs and italic sentences to show actions.
&gt;Henry: I hate you!
&gt;*He swings his sword at Kelly.*

&gt;*Kelly dodges.*
&gt;Kelly: Like I don&#39;t!
&gt;*She runs away.*

Hm... Detailed style doesn&#39;t use italic and rely more heavily on description than dialogs. I sometimes use it to a degree in Nexus Hub, but only to a degree since the pace often disrupt the one liner flow.

&gt;His eyes were bloodshot. Henry no longer care about patience. The burning house behind him was the last straw. He couldn&#39;t bear it anymore.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I hate you!&quot; He screamed. His sword was out of its sheath, making its way to Kelly&#39;s neck.

&gt;It happened again. Over and over, he stopped her and ruined her plan. She stared back at the bloodshot eyes without a trace of fear. With a trained move, she took a step backward and dodged the attempt for her life.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Like I don&#39;t!&quot; Her words were dipped in poison. Kelly made her run to the woods, away from her foiled plan.

So what the perks of both styles?

One liner offer a quick and action lived pace, which moves the story quickly and makes battles more interesting.

Detailed, on the other hand, offer more immersion of the story, deeper emotional development for the characters, and an attention to details one liner can&#39;t offer.

So...

            <p>But GMT+8 OnO</p>
<p>A rushed attempt but could do better.<br>
<em>The robed lady brings out a vial of green liquid, its contents swirling automatically inside, as if it was alive. A smile appeared on her face, and her mouth opened; a loud cackling heard all over the room. In a forward motion, the vial strikes the ground, the green contents evaporated into smoke…</em></p>
<p><em>Loud cracking and tearing of clothing can be heard. As the smoke dissapated, the main characters could only stare in horror, as they face a monstrosity thought found only in legends. A werewolf.</em></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Most paragraphs are more long winded and have long delay between each post in all rps I know of, so I guess I just want to try it here?</p>
<p>My timezone is not really good, so usually I can get a few actions in and peeps wait for a long time for the next actions.</p>
<p>But since paragraph takes longer to write, it feels better</p>
