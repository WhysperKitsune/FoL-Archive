    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Mercenary, The First Contract</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-mercenary-the-first-contract/32767</link>
    <description>**Lore Subject:** The Mercenary
**Lore:** The Mercenary has always been a warrior. Since she has no known purpose, her sole job was to fight battles and wars. But the time of war was over, she wanted something else to do, sitting back and being a bystander left an empty hole in her. She wanted to do something, to have a purpose. Touring The Castle, she found death is everywhere, and there&#39;s no one to protect those who seek protection. So she made a contract, a contract to the people who need protection. This gave her a purpose, a sense of accomplishment. Her sole purpose now is to protect her contractor, and remove anyone standing in his way. That is her only purpose, so what is she if she fails protecting them?

**Comments:** I&#39;m not sure if this is long, bad, or both. But I hope it&#39;s alright. This was my first attempt at a Lore. I made sure to give the reason as to why she commits suicide after 2 contracts, and why she is so desperate for guarding someone. How she got those scars, why she&#39;s loyal, adding depth to the class.</description>
