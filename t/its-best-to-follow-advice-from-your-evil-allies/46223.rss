    <title>It&#39;s best to follow advice from your evil allies</title>

    <description>Not sure what others think, but in my experience I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best to follow advice from your evil allies even if you think you have a better idea.  This might be for several reasons:

- If they are confident enough to suggest you do something different from what you were planning to do, they probably have a good reason to be so confident

- Team members following the same mediocre plan is more effective than different members following plans that, assuming each individual were their own team, would be better plans</description>
