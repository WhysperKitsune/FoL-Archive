    <title>Weird question on claim</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/weird-question-on-claim/77659</link>
    <description>So last game I was Poss - I possessed a chrono claim, but when possessing him I find out hes princess. His logs are all chrono logs. There were 2 other chrono claims so he was kinda sus. He wasnt killed (obviously since I possessed him), but would this be throwing if he had died to court with that claim?

It was really fricking weird</description>

            <p>So what happened there is that Possessor doesn’t bypass tailoring effects (effects that make someone appear NS when they are evil). The Chrono you possessed was actually a Timesnatcher who had used Dark Dimension, which because of code recycling causes the Chrono to appear as a Princess.</p>
