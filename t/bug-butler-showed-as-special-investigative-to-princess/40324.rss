    <title>[BUG] Butler Showed as Special/Investigative to Princess</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-butler-showed-as-special-investigative-to-princess/40324</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
As Princess, N1, flirted with #3, who was the Butler, who showed up as Special/Invesitgative. I was then immediately converted to Unseen. I passed my info the next night to Psychic, and #3 was killed, revealing him to be the Butler. When the Psychic died his log revealed that I had said #3 was Special/Invesitgative, and since Butler is not one of those, I was executed.
