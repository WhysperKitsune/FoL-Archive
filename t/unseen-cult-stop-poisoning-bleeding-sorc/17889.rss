    <description>Sorc game.  I&#39;m claimed alch and pretty well established.  Inq is outted.

Unseen poison me.  As a claimed Alch.

So... if I WAS alch.  I&#39;m IMMUNE TO THAT.  If I&#39;m not...  YOU JUST KILLED YOUR STRONGEST ALLY.

This has happened... like 3 times now.  I&#39;ve played sorc like maybe 5 times ever.

Don&#39;t try to poison/bleed Alchs... ever.  If you know there is a Sorc never ever, ever do it.

It says &quot;NK&quot; but they&#39;re your damned ally.  Kill the Inquistor, not the &#39;Alchs&#39; or random crap.
If you attacked Inq the turn he was claimed, the sorc will probably follow it up and he&#39;ll die.

Edit: Also they&#39;re occ immune, if you can&#39;t occ them and you&#39;re scum, don&#39;t say anything.  Worse case scenario they&#39;re like a Scorned or Fool.</description>

            <p>I’ve seen that happen like once.  And then the Sorc lost anyway because they literally had no logs and claimed CW.<br>
Usually Inq just says they’re Inq and then they get off the stand and do their thing.  Evil just ignores them completely and they end up winning.</p>
<p>I think most people miss that the Night Immunity got changed on them and don’t bother to try to kill them.</p>

            <p>Sorc can almost always determine a few BD.</p>
<p>I’d rather have a Sorc on the field than a random cult member as cult.  Most cult classes don’t do much and the Sorc can kill people, even protected people, quite easily.</p>
<p>As Unseen I could see it a bit more, but even then,  Sorc can’t get the MM and they’re an extra assassin that’s going to likely target BD investigators and Prince.</p>
<p>I have literally never seen a Sorc win.  Or even come close.  The few times I was doing well, I’ve been poisoned/bled by my allies while having a air-tight Alch claim.  Then evil loses in about 2 turns.</p>

            <p>I have seen two inqs pre nerf aid cult. I was bd for one. He was throwing me off by claiming not magic for cult on people. Lol.</p>
<p>Also being alive let you get lucky and kill me or one of my cult and keep them in the game or kill you as the NK who doesn’t know who my evil are and can get two or even three of them killed and throw our game away.  I choose NK every time to die. Now if sorc could see who unseen and cult are now we are talking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>worst case scenario they are possessor</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When there is a <em>declared Inquisitor</em>, he’s either said possessor or there is a Sorc.  He should be the target.</p>
<p>If there is a Sorc, you shouldn’t be bleeding Alch claims.  Hell… you shouldn’t be bleeding Alch claims anyway because <em>they’re freaking immune to it.</em>  Kill them if you want, but bleed/poison?  That’s just silly.  Bleed/poison the Inquisitor claim if anything.</p>
<p>And sure, a Sorc might accidentally hit you, but odds are they wont.  Wasting time killing someone on your side is silly.  The Inquisitor is always going to help BD after the Sorc is dead.  I have never not see them do so.  Kill him first.</p>

<p>The best strategy is to weave yourself as a target in between nights.</p>
