            <p>For the mastermind idea, here’s a way that could be added:<br>
Remove in the shadows<br>
Change foresight to a day ability with 2 or 3 uses.  Also change it so it determines your target’s exact class.<br>
Finally, give mastermind a night ability that allows them to choose a class, and they will appear to be that class to investigatives that night.  It would have two uses</p>

            <p>I agree that princess is weak, but it’s hard to buff it.  You could make flirt determine the exact class type, but that would give mastermind a harder time, unless you made in the shadows also affect flirt.  Will-o-wisp could be reworked, but it shouldn’t be too powerful</p>

            <p>Royal Blood gives princess confirmability and in some endgame situations the power to gain king status over others. The king is more powerful as the game goes on, so you can’t just dismiss this as negligible. Evil king also occurs 35% of the time and butler poisonings or BD king dying because of guarding Prince happen plenty.</p>
<p>How many MM’s do you actually see get far by claiming Sheriff/Princess? Sheriff is already guaranteed and if we think of the situation where it is conditional on the Princess having flirted the MM, the MM claiming princess would at the very least already be the second Princess claim. This means that the MM will always be at the least the second claim. I am not sure about the role distribution, but that means you are outed 50/50 if there just happens to be a third sheriff/princess claim. You would best believe that the investigative roles are on special scrutiny to come up with results or face execution instead as well. A princess flirting a MM limits his claimspace always, whereas a sheriff check only is useful after n4 and even detrimental before it. A sheriff’s results are also affected more by Fool and Scorned, because the results change 100%, whereas “killer/offensive” can be correct in the case of a Scorned and still it is less of a death sentence, especially when trying to narrow down MM suspects.</p>
<p>It is most definitely not a misplay to claim other roles as MM. I have most success claiming physician actually, as you do not need to come up with results and you can backtrack to alchemist if someone discovers your death immunity. Random killings like knight CS, alch bomb, NK’s deathnote spite outing you happen about as frequently as a princess check.</p>
<p>NK’s frequently claim other roles than Knight and for good reason. Something like Support/social also clears the one checked from being MM/NK, the main evils in the game, barring possessor. The Sheriff can only find one of the main evils after n4. I think Princess Is vastly underrated, because it is harder to play and harder to use the results successfully, as opposed to the quite black and white result of “Unseen!” on the Sheriff.</p>

            <p>Because I do think Princess is way weaker than Sheriff.</p>
<p>Royal Blood is nice, sure. But it requires the king to die. In the current meta game, King being dead any time early is not likely unless there is a reaper or the king is obviously evil. This means the Royal Blood passive can almost be seen as useless.</p>
<p>Princess can find MM before n4, however this will need to be a misplay by the MM. Most MMs will claim Princess or Sheriff specifically because of Princess checks. If the MM claims Knight or Phys, yes you’re correct, but that’s not a common occurrence. And even then that requires the princess checking the MM and the MM making a claim. If only one of these occur, it doesn’t even matter. Also, finding the MM before n4 doesn’t matter unless you chain jail/HH him until d4 since they just get a new one.</p>
<p>Princess is definitely better at figuring out neutrals, but that’s about her best bet. And even then, if an NK claims Knight, the flirt becomes useless. And without a reliable faction check, she isn’t can’t even know if they’re neutral or not.</p>
<p>I definitely think the new Wisp is rather weak, but old wisp was far too confirmable. New wisp has some combo potential with flirting a killer/offensive class and then wisping them.</p>
