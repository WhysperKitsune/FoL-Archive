    <title>[Class Suggestion] Baron and Duke</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-baron-and-duke/35454</link>
    <description>This was concerning the a rework of the King I made in a feedback and suggestion thread. 

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/the-kings-allies-they-gotta-go/34445

And this was also inspired by the fact at which I noticed that there is a Royal in every class type except for Support. Well, this is it!

The whole point of the Baron is to be there so that he can take over for the King in case he is needed. Same goes for the Duke, but the Duke is for the Unseen. (Also matches the Duchess at last)

The Baron

Blue Dragon Support

_**Passives**_

**Royal Blood:** 
(Everyone should know what this is)

**Entitlement:** 
If you become the next King, you will keep your abilities alongside the abilities of succeeding Kings. (Not Starting King)

_**Abilities**_

**Royal Loan:** (4) (Day)
Choose another player. Any limited night ability they use tonight will not lose a charge when used.

Not included for both Baron and Duke: 
Prince&#39;s Execute if Prince killed Blue Dragon
Physician&#39;s Reanimate
Assassin&#39;s 2 for 1


**Kinship:** (2) (Night)
Choose any player and give them the Royal Blood passive if they do not have it. If that class already has two passives, they may not inherit Royal Blood.

Classes that Kinship will not work on (because they all have two passives):
- Mastermind
- Hunter
- Mercenary
- Fool
- Inquisitor
- Sorcerer
- Possessor

The Duke

Unseen Support

_**Passives**_

**Royal Blood:**
(Everyone should know what this is)

**Entitlement:** 
If you become the next King, you will keep your abilities when you become King alongside a succeeding King&#39;s abilities. Does not include Coup. 

_**Abilities**_

**Kinship:** (1) (Night) 
Choose any player and give them the Royal Blood passive if they do not have it. If that class already has two passives, they may not inherit Royal Blood.

**Coup:** (1) (Night) 
Choose a player. Any non-killer class targeting the King tonight will be redirected to that player. Bypasses occupy immunity. (Not part of Entitlement passive when you become the King)

(Classes not redirected: Neutral Killers, Assassin, Knight)
(Not redirected but can&#39;t target King anyways: Hunter, Prince, etc.)

**Royal Loan:** (4) (Day)
Choose another player. Any limited night ability they use tonight will not lose a charge when used.

<p>It’s okay that Kinship replaces the unuseable Allies ability. However, Royal Loan should not be maintained, seeing that king already has two day abilities which are very important to be taken out.</p>

</aside>
<p>So… as a king, why would you give someone Royal Blood? I mean, I can understand it being used as a last resort but…<br>
Also, he can do two night actions in the game and then he is rendered useless at night? Doesn’t he have any unlimited uses ability or is that a work in progress?<br>
I mean Kinship is a cool ability and could turn quite a few tables, nothing against it, just feel like he could use a second night ability with unlimited uses.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why does the unseen counterpart have fewer uses of Royal Loan? It should be the same.</p>
<p>Also, I’d make False Heir and Kinship the same ability. No need to make it weaker on the BD side. I’d maintain the name Kinship and the False Heir description.</p>
<p>Other than that, seems good to me!</p>

            <p>Kinship and False Heir don’t show, I wanted to make these classes something less confirmable and say that a person is now Royal Blood.</p>
<p>And yes, I should add that Prince’s Execution and Physician’s Reanimate are not included in Royal Loan.</p>
<p>However I’ll say this, Butlers, Drunks, Hunter, and Prince can’t even target the King so they can’t be redirected with Coup. This is meant to thwart Physicians, Alchemists, Observers, who could be on the King.</p>

            <p>Then what if he keeps his own abilities when ascending to thw throne alongside the King’s abilities? Like Guards and Decide Fate. That way, the starting King’s abilities will only ever be the starting King’s. But there’s more incentive to put Baron/Duke on the throne than other Royals.</p>

            <p>The Baron seems too OP to get a confirmed Bd King. Here is an example of what you say D1:</p>
<p>D1: I’m baron, CW barrier me, Paladin smite me and Sheriff scout me to get a confirmed bd King on D4. Protect me also.</p>
<p>It needs something to prevent this from being too easy.</p>

            <p>This was concerning the a rework of the King I made in a feedback and suggestion thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/the-kings-allies-they-gotta-go/34445" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/the-kings-allies-they-gotta-go/34445</a></p>
<p>And this was also inspired by the fact at which I noticed that there is a Royal in every class type except for Support. Well, this is it!</p>
<p>The whole point of the Baron is to be there so that he can take over for the King in case he is needed. Same goes for the Duke, but the Duke is for the Unseen. (Also matches the Duchess at last)</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The Baron</p>
<p>Blue Dragon Support</p>
<p><em><strong>Passives</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Royal Blood:</strong><br>
(Everyone should know what this is)</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement:</strong><br>
If you become the next King, you will keep your abilities alongside the abilities of succeeding Kings. (Not Starting King)</p>
<p><em><strong>Abilities</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Royal Loan:</strong> (4) (Day)<br>
Choose another player. Any limited night ability they use tonight will not lose a charge when used.</p>
<p>Not included for both Baron and Duke:<br>
Prince’s Execute if Prince killed Blue Dragon<br>
Physician’s Reanimate<br>
Assassin’s 2 for 1</p>
<p><strong>Kinship:</strong> (2) (Night)<br>
Choose any player and give them the Royal Blood passive if they do not have it. If that class already has two passives, they may not inherit Royal Blood.</p>
<p>Classes that Kinship will not work on (because they all have two passives):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastermind</li>
<li>Hunter</li>
<li>Mercenary</li>
<li>Fool</li>
<li>Inquisitor</li>
<li>Sorcerer</li>
<li>Possessor</li>
</ul>

(Everyone should know what this is)</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement:</strong><br>
If you become the next King, you will keep your abilities when you become King alongside a succeeding King’s abilities. Does not include Coup.</p>

<p><strong>Coup:</strong> (1) (Night)<br>
Choose a player. Any non-killer class targeting the King tonight will be redirected to that player. Bypasses occupy immunity. (Not part of Entitlement passive when you become the King)</p>
<p>(Classes not redirected: Neutral Killers, Assassin, Knight)<br>
(Not redirected but can’t target King anyways: Hunter, Prince, etc.)</p>
