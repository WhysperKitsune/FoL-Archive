    <description># Catgirl Bomb Nightless - Burnt Tail
![image|217x231, 75%](upload://em152y4jXPPSCEV18tKCbl9b19c.png)

**And its &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;sinners&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; hosts @Italy and @Amelia**
&lt;small&gt;(and alt modded by @katze)&lt;/small&gt;

# The Rules:

1. Obey the [Global Forum Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) and the [Forum of Mafia Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926)
2. Do not, under any circumstance, reveal your true identity or publicly speculate on the identity of a player.
3. Do not claim your flavor in the thread.

# The Setup:

**[color=green]9 Vanilla Town[/color]**
**[color=red]3 Mafia Goons[/color]**


[details=&quot;Example Town Classcard&quot;]
&gt; # [color=green]Town Catgirl[/color]
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;**[color=green]Vanilla Town[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;After defeating the doggirls, you have finally established yourself as the superior domesticated animalistic humans.
But now, they&#39;ve finally moved to take their revenge, and they&#39;ve planted bombs to back theirselves up, too!
Fortunately, you&#39;ve all devised a great plan to defeat them. Planting even more bombs!
At any point during the day, you may choose to kill the player seated in front of you by submitting **/detonate** in thread. You must wait 24 hours before doing this again.
&gt;
&gt;*You win when you defeat the doggirls.*
[/details]

[details=&quot;Example Mafia Classcard&quot;]
&gt; # [color=red]Mafia Doggirl[/color]
&gt;
&gt;![image|553x500, 50%](upload://gwNSFEGJYYjWeFBpGBNQreZTiIw.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;**[color=red]Mafia Goon[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;Ever since your defeat at the hands of those pesky catgirls, you&#39;ve been planning your revenge, and now you&#39;ve finally discovered a way.
Explosives!
At any point during the day, you may choose to kill the player seated in front of you by submitting **/detonate** in thread. You must wait 24 hours before doing this again.
&gt;
&gt;*You win when you reach parity with the catgirls.*
[/details]

# The Gameplay:

Days are 48 hours.

Eliminations are both plurality and majority. Voting yourself and no elimination are not a valid vote.

The game is anonymous. That means that every player will be on an alternate account. (and yes we&#39;re going to dress them up as catgirls)

Each player has a bomb, armed and ready to explode.

Everyone will be given a detonator to the person directly in front of them, publicly.

Any player may type **/detonate** and ping a host to kill the player in front of them.

Any player who detonates the person in front of them will be given the detonator that person held, and cannot detonate again for another 24 hours.

During pregame, the mafia may choose what detonators they want. They can take up to two mafia detonators, and if they do not pick, it will be left up to chance.

The game is nightless, meaning that there is no factional kill, and the day will immediately start after an elimination, or if the time runs out.

**If parity is reached, the game is immediately over.**

**Votes are not reset or locked in LyLo, nor are bombs disabled.**

            <p>Read a little bit of this - was considering joining but I wasn’t fan of the lunch mechanic.</p>
<p>Props to the town for pulling off a strong victory. Was pretty impressed with orangeandblack, the way he checkmated Aelin in the endgame there was enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>Rough beats to Aelin for not only rolling scum consecutive times but getting stuck with lackluster teammates. Been there, it happens. Still put in a solid performance.</p>

<p>This wasn’t an opinion</p>
<p>The 3 of you that chose “ark” are objectively wrong</p>
<p>It’s sad I know I prefer it too but unfortunately it’s arch so get dunked on for being wrong lol</p>
<p>Second if you wanna play a cool game inspired by not only Short Fuse but also Popcorn Mafia then go check out this cool game and join it so it can start before Thunal’s champs qualifier does</p>
