    <description>In theory and most often you want to use tornado with someone on your team and someone who isn&#39;t. If you now someone isn&#39;t on your team then you just lynch them.</description>

            <p>Tornado is a great BD spell. But it is one with a potential downside.<br>
People tend to remember the downside much better than the upside. (Confirmation bias)</p>
<p>I basically agree with all the points <a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a> is making here.</p>
<p>It is the same if you have a deck with cards, and you don’t know the order they are in. Putting the bottom card on top will do nothing with your expected outcome. (basic statistics)</p>
<p>A good CW will alter these base odds only in his favour. Because he has some knowledge about the situation. Because if he Tornadoes himself early on (100% BD) he might replace himself with someone not BD. (which, in almost all cases, is the idea)</p>

<p>Plus there is the fact that you are more likely to swap a Prince out of harm rather than into it. The Unseen and Cult are try their best to figure out who the Prince is and to kill him. The odds of them attacking the prince on any given night is higher than anyone else. The randomness from CW can reduce those odds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reread my argument. I was comparing it to the other offensive classes in terms of how they interact with investigators. Personally I would just make him offensive because that’s really what he is now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Those classes don’t create chaos though.</p>
<p>If a Drunk targets you early: you know who the drunk is.<br>
If a Butler occupies you early: you know there is a butler.</p>
<p>There is a 0% chance that a drunk targeting you will cause you to target yourself.</p>
<p>Also you seem to think that every time a king or someone asks for a check it’s public knowledge.  Hell, I’ve seen plenty of Kings screwed over by CW antics… like checking the same target multiple times because the CW randomly swapped them twice.  King checks 5, comes up BD.  Next turn they try to check 8, but CW swaps them to 5 or someone else they’ve already checked.</p>
<p>Observers become nearly useless.  Add a Drunks on top of it and you can waste entire days where investigators can’t do anything.</p>
<p>The net gain:  literally nothing.  Absolutely nothing is gained from it.  It’s not risk vs reward or anything, it’s just random.  You might swap an assassin target to the possessor or a fool.  <em>But it’s equally likely you’ll swap a fool kill to the Prince.</em>  Drunks and Butlers are just nullifying people <em>and also learning things.</em>  Hey, 5 was occupy immune.  Was that because of someone else doing something or is he the Possessor?  Swapping 5 with 8 tells everyone… nothing at all.  Except that maybe someone was targeting one of them, which is basically pointless information if one of them dies you know he died and that the target was 8, not 5.  Which tells you, again, nothing.  Because you don’t know anything about either person except for the one that’s now dead, which isn’t useful.</p>
<p>Edit: All that said, I like the CW, but early on there isn’t much use to tornado other than maybe one early to prove your role if called on it.  I’d rather they had an extra ward or two so they don’t feel inclined to blind swap everyone every night.</p>

<p>Sage with tornado can be useful because you can easily kill outed Princes by moving the Prince somewhere else and then get the assassin to kill the person who was swapped with the prince</p>

            <p>Let’s just stop trying to compare it with investigators. Tornado’s entire purpose is for it to swap two targets and hopefully ensure either the safety of a BD or the demise of an enemy. Once again, without information, you can not do that effectively.</p>
<p>As it is now, Court Wizard is best played abstaining the first few nights. Yet the current expectations of players is for them to do something every night rather than nothing.</p>
<p>Simply give them a new ability for night time to go with the already existing Tornado. Limit Tornado to 4 uses, and we should hopefully have a CW that doesn’t give everyone else on the Blue Dragon faction a massive headache while still being useful.</p>
<p>Not really sure why you choose to ignore all of the complaints that ability is receiving. They are legitimate.</p>

            <p>My counter argument is that early game before you have that information is when everyone is acting randomly anyways so there isn’t anything you can really mess up. If a sheriff check 5 N1 rather than 6 then no one cares. He will just note the change and move on. Same for obs except now he knows that you the CW was one of the visitors which is helpful to him.</p>
<p>most of the other complaints are things that apply to the Drunk too. For example messing with follow up checks. The only difference is that you are more likely to know who the suspect is than who the invest is unless it is king who is occ immune anyways so it doesn’t matter (occ immunes are immune to retargeting abilitys like deb or tornado).</p>
<p>Mid to late game is where we already agree that it is very useful. Just think of the CW as an offencive type and you will get what I mean. After all the only thing worse than your follow up peek being replaced with a result that isn’t what you needed is having it replaced with no result at all like the butler does. And like the butler and drunk that swaping gives you information. Like what I have said twice now if something happens to one of the people you swapped then the other person isn’t the one that did it.</p>

            <p>And what I’m saying is that CW is mostly useful when they know who is who, which is mid to late game. Early game they don’t have that information.</p>
<p>CW suffers the same exact problems of misuse as Transporter in ToS. There, it’s honestly best to abstain from doing anything until you know who to swap and with who.</p>
<p>What I suggested keeps CW useful and also makes it less of a hinderance to every other BD class in the game trying to do their own part at night. <strong><span class="hashtag">#yolonado</span> out.</strong></p>

            <p>You realize that 75% of early investigations are linear even if it is an observer. If you are CW and someone is requesting that the king investigates someone than don’t be an idiot and swap the person. Or you could tell the king what you are doing and swap him anyway but now with the added benefit of potentially keeping an ally safe that night.</p>
<p>I know that the CW CAN screw things up but usually he doesn’t. You just notice it more when he does.</p>

            <p>You’re thinking of linear investigators like Sheriff, only. Further, if King asks them to investigate someone and they get redirected it isn’t very helpful.</p>
<p>That aside, investigators like Observer who follow people and try to get an idea of who is who are greatly hindered by early CW yolonado.</p>
<p>A good example is my Observer game from this morning where I noticed 12 visited 5 N1, and 5 didn’t die. I was curious if they were an investigator or MM, so N2 I decided to Peek 5 to see if they were converted. I instead got redirected to 3 who was Blue Dragon and Psychic. Not helpful at all and a waste of my Peek. (BTW, 5 was converted and 12 did turn out to be MM. I could’ve caught that N2 but… <strong><span class="hashtag">#yolonado</span></strong>)</p>
<p>In any case, early investigations &gt; early luck with Tornado any day. There’s no harm at all in encouraging it be used wisely rather than randomly.</p>

            <p>and, there’s basically a 99% chance they will have results. it’s just quite possibly on someone they weren’t intending to investigate.</p>
<p>All that being said, I would still be in favor of a CW rework</p>
<p>infinate ability the old infinate use magic ward, and 2x uses of tornado.</p>
<p>Unfortunately magic ward was so bitched about as useless that it’s unlikely to make a comeback. As in short if an ability doesn’t self prove and do something earth shattering, the community is going to bitch, call the class useless until it gets replaced with something much more visible. Just like what happened to the CW that started this to begin with.</p>

            <p>I don’t think you get what I mean. If it’s early game then the Investigative classes don’t know much more than you do and it’s incredibly rare that you would swap them with themselves. It doesn’t mess with those early random investigations because they still know who they invesrigated. Mid game where invests start to have leads is where you start to figure out who the Investigators are and can simply whisper them that X suspect will not be swapped or that you will swap him with Y player. And late game where 2 or 3 evils are known but BD is low on votes is where you can save the game by getting the unseen/cult to kill themselves.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure what the downsides of yolo swaping are. You don’t increase the chances of someone (other than evils which is good anyways) being attacked and Investigators still get accurate results and they know who’s results they are looking at too.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, let’s say 5 says something that a sheriff thinks is sort of suspect.  So the sheriff tries to check that person, only they get swapped to… the guy they already checked.  Or someone that wasn’t suspect at all.  Or themselves.</p>
<p>Worse, let’s say an Observer uses Peek on them… and instead Peeks a known Merc or themselves.  Now they’ve lost an ability down the drain and the BD got nothing for it.</p>
<p>The upside is… basically nothing.  At best you’re randomly making a random thing happen to someone else randomly.  At worst, you’re subverting the efforts of all the investigative classes and protecting scum and NKs by keeping people off them.</p>
<p>You can’t even really do it to yourself, since it just means some other random schmuck that was going to die or investigated hits you instead.  It’s just chaos at a point where you need to start sorting out who is who and what is going on.  It makes telling what happened more confusing.  The observer was following 4, only he got swapped to 6, 4 died, now he needs to sort out those messages.  Add a drunk in there for good measure.  He goes to the court with his accusation and… is wrong because things got so muddled.  They execute a BD.  Next day they execute him or, worse, the Prince does.  Scum and NK get 2 days of freedom and you’re down 2 people because a CW randomly clicked someone because they were bored.</p>
<p>Then you get the CW that chain swaps a dude.  Who ends up being an assassin or MM or something.  You would’ve figured that out 2 days ago but he got bored and decided he was going to “protect” the guy whispering the king or the like.</p>
<p>Early game CW is almost never an asset.  They throw random chaos on top of the random chaos that is the early game.  You can’t get your bearings or plan what you’re doing because anything you try to do might go out the window.  The odds of the ability screwing over the BD is incredibly high.  The odds of it hurting the NK/scum is basically nothing.  You diverted the assassin from 7 to 10, well… 10 is dead and statistically probably a BD so it works for him.</p>
<p>Once you actually <em>know</em> something, the ability can be amazing.  Swapping a confirmed sheriff with like an Alch means he’ll probably never die or be converted, nor will the Alch.  You can set up walls that make people nigh-untouchable until they spend time tracking you down and killing you, and then if you know they’re on to you, you can ward them out and waste more time.</p>
<p>But before that point… it’s just chaos in a chaotic system where the team you’re on needs to establish order and you’re making that more difficult for them most of the time.</p>

<p>That is 100% <strong>false</strong>. Simply put, if someone goes to investigate someone they suspect and they are swapped with an innocent, obviously their results aren’t what they were looking for because they investigated a different person than they intended. That aside, I believe bbiaglla’s went over how seldom it is for yolonado to be useful.</p>
<p>It’s an ability that mostly shines mid~late game, when the Court Wizard knows who to swap with who. It would be better for it to have limited uses so the CW is encouraged to use it intelligently.</p>
