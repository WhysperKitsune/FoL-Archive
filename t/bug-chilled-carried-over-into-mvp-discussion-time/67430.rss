    <title>[BUG] Chilled carried over into MVP discussion time</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-chilled-carried-over-into-mvp-discussion-time/67430</link>
    <description>#### On the last day, I was chilled by reaper.  Reaper put up on trial and executed, ending the game.  During the time for discussing/voting MVP, I could see chat (including dead chat) but could not talk.  I could vote on MVPs.  I could talk again in post-game screen.

#### I should have been able to chat with other players once reaper was executed

#### Steps to reproduce: With reaper the last scum, have reaper chill player.  Then execute reaper.

#### Comments: This is clearly a top priority!!!!</description>
