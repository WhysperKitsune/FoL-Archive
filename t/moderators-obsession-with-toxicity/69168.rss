    <title>Moderators Obsession with &quot;Toxicity&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/moderators-obsession-with-toxicity/69168</link>
    <description>It&#39;s honestly very concerning given the most recent Discord news post that devs in this game are going to start spending most of their time looking over cleaning out &quot;toxicity.&quot;  Throne of Lies is a great game and I&#39;d hate to see it choked out by something as subjective as what someone defines &#39;toxicity&#39; as.  I&#39;m sure there will be varying degrees here, but a more concise interpretation of what defines bad behavior would be helpful, &#39;hate speech&#39; &#39;toxicity&#39; and other bland terms are basically a blank check for mods.

Blizzard has spent the latter half of Overwatch&#39;s life trying to &#39;oust toxicity&#39; instead of letting the player base flourish naturally, it has only bounced back in their face and created a less engaged as well as watered down community.  I&#39;d hate to see Throne of Lies meet the same fate.  There are still class, balancing, and technical issues with this game that require far more attention than words on a screen that &#39;offend&#39; people - placing high priority on something so abstract and inconsequential is a game killer.  I sincerely hope that whatever focus on &#39;toxicity&#39; (horrifically vague industry buzzword) is used with discretion and isn&#39;t an attempt to try and shape the games culture and audience to what the dev thinks it should be.

If I could make one recommendation and one recommendation only:

Create a very aggressive chat filter that filters out whatever the mods deem &#39;toxic&#39;, and then give the player the ability to turn that filter off.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find very quickly that most players will turn that chat filter OFF.</description>

            <p>I already explained that all we’re doing is streamlining how we handle reports.</p>
<p>Nothing else is changing.</p>
<p>Our moderation policies are extremely transparent. You can look at who we ban and why in the justice channel on Discord. We don’t just ban people every time they offend someone, and we never will. We’d end up with just one person playing the game if we did.</p>
<p>Actions like continuously harassing someone has no place in the game. Nobody likes to be on the receiving in of stuff like that, and if it happens constantly they will likely stop playing the game.</p>
<p>Allowing people to just be toxic and harass people with no risk of punishment just results in no one having fun.</p>
<p>We want people to be able to have fun playing our game. We work hard trying to make classes as fun to play as possible, but that isn’t the only thing that impacts how much fun people have.</p>
<p>If someone can’t play the game without having racial slurs thrown at them every game, then they won’t want to continue to play.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Kids are already banging, snorting coke, and watching violent movies by 13 lol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That does not justify it or make it fine in any way. Your deathnote, as an example, is a direct violation of the rules. The game states that it’s PG-13 and what you have posted is clearly <em>inappropriate</em>.</p>
<p>You are so persistent with saying that the developers are trying to “witch hunt” you or to target you, yet what are you expecting? No one is attacking you here, rather proving that you, yourself have expressed toxic behavior before. It doesn’t matter if you say that the “discord laughed about it” and everyone “liked it”. It does not justify what you have done and now you are trying to shift focus from it for no reason.</p>
<p>I really fail to see what you are trying to prove here. On the original topic of this thread - the filters could be implemented but they will be easily bypassed, which will just result in more censoring for the sake of censoring. It will not work.</p>

            <p>Kids are already banging, snorting coke, and watching violent movies by 13 lol, I think the picture will be fine.  Ah yes, of course, “it’s a stupid argument”.  Let’s just focus on me personally then now shall we?  It’s kind of sad, the first few posts in here had some pretty decent points then the moment a dev came in he managed to turn the focus all onto myself.  I guess when you have an issue with a message you should attack the messenger right?  I’m out for now, have a nice 4th.</p>

            <p>They’re old and I already served my time for them - I don’t disagree with the bans or that what was said was out of line.  Again, that’s not what I’m discussing and never was.  My concern is that when devs/mods start throwing around terms like “abolishing toxicity” it’s extremely vague and lets them judge others how they see fit.  For example, Boslof gave a great example of what I think should result in a temporary ban (except for the deathnote, I think that was funny and so did the server) - but hopefully it stops there.  If someone is calling for genocide it should result in a ban, but I have a very sneaking suspicion that offenses MUCH lighter than that are going to start being labelled as “toxic” just because the devs say so - things like casual shittalking (in a game that almost begs for it.)</p>
<p>I just don’t want to see a robotic ToL world where people solely discuss what’s going on in investigations, the game is almost all talking and sometimes that results in a bit of banter and fun that I’d hate to see go away in the name of something as undefinable as “toxicity”</p>

            <p>It clearly has everything to do with this topic. You want to be able to act like an asshole without any consequences.</p>

            <p>Then I think you’d be even more eager to discuss your position instead of finding in-game chats and attacking how I play - which really has nothing to do with what the entire topic was about until you started posting.</p>

            <p>All we’re doing with the report system is streamlining it, so that reports can be handled in a more timely manner.</p>
<p>Behaviour that is clearly just meant to harass someone or offend them has never had a place in our game. It adds nothing to the game and just ruins the fun of others.</p>
<p>Just because you have fun acting like a 13 year old edgelord, doesn’t give you the right to ruin everyone else’s fun.</p>

            <p>That’s fair, and I agree.  I never once said I wasn’t out of line saying things like that.  But I still stand by my initial post and what this topic was created to discuss.  The mod obviously got butthurt and did all he could personally without addressing my argument.</p>

            <p>It’s a game. No one wants to see that ingame.</p>
<p>I think this thread should be closed tbh</p>
