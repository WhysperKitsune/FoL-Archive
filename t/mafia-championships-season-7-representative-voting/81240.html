<h2><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">INVITATION TO THE MAFIA CHAMPIONSHIP (SEASON 7)</span></span></h2>
<p>Ahoy there! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png!v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m very excited to invite your community to participate in Season 7 of the Mafia Championship.</p>
<p><img src="../../uploads/default/original/3X/b/f/bf7de70b31d7ee422a56549b78d92eec0b045b34.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rk0Wo5cjlyFy4A4otFQtROPb3MM" width="586" height="500"></p>
<p>The Mafia Championship is an annual forum-based tournament series that pits representatives from various online Mafia (aka Werewolf) communities against one another as they compete to determine the Internet’s greatest forum Mafia player. Each participating community democratically elects one person to represent them and be their “Champion”.</p>
<p>The tournament first started back in 2013. Since then, 320+ different communities and 50+ different nationalities have been represented.</p>
<p>It’s a super fun event that has created many new friendships and close bonds between communities. I hope that you would be interested in taking part <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png!v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<h3><span class="bbcode-b">DO YOU ACCEPT THE INVITATION?</span></h3>
<p>If your community wishes to participate, please confirm your participation to Lissa as soon as you can to ensure yourselves a spot. Currently, the plan is to accommodate 150 communities this season. If there is further interest, additional communities may sign up as substitutes; generally there are some replacements needed both before and during games.</p>
<p>If your community agrees to participate, the deadline for selecting your representative is <span class="bbcode-b">April 27</span>, but the sooner the better.</p>
<p>The games will take place on Mafia Universe. If it’s okay, I can link directly to the general discussion thread regarding this topic on Mafia Universe.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Important notes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You may decide yourselves how you want to elect your representative, but we highly recommend some sort of democratic process (public nominations followed by a poll usually works out well).</li>
<li>In addition to electing a representative, you should also name an alternate who will be asked to step in if the first choice needs to back out.</li>
<li>Your representative should be prepared for having to read upwards of 500-600 posts per 24 hours during the early stages of the game. Additionally, there’s a requirement that each player must make at least 10 posts per Game Day. Only active players should apply/participate. I repeat: <span class="bbcode-b"><font color="red">Your chosen player needs to be able to promise a good amount of activity on a daily basis.</font></span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="bbcode-b">SEASON 7 FORMAT</span></h3>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The tournament structure</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">150 communities</span> will participate, each sending one representative.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">QUALIFIERS:</span> 10 Qualifier Games will be played, consisting of 15 players each. I.e. every representative plays in one Qualifier Game. The players themselves vote post-game to determine who is deserving of advancement. 1st and 2nd place will advance to the Semifinal Games.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">SEMIFINALS:</span> A Jury consisting of finalists from Season 6 will select 25 additional players to advance to the three Semifinal Games. From each game, five players will advance to the Finale Game based on a post-game player vote, just like in the qualifying phase.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">THE FINALE:</span> The Finale Game is played. Once it has completed, the players vote to determine who shall receive the title of Season 7 Champion and a winner’s certificate signed by Dmitry Davidoff, the creator of mafia.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">This year’s setup: <strong>JOAT</strong></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<p>The setup is called JOAT<sup>2</sup> and features 15 players.</p>
<p>The setup consists of the following:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><font color="red">3x Mafia Goon</font></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><font color="green">2x Town Jack Of All Trades (9x Doctor, 9x Motion Detector, 9x Tracker)</font></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><font color="green">10x Vanilla Townie</font></span></p>
<p>Note that the Jacks Of All Trades must use all three actions before repeating an action, i.e. they are rotating. This does not mean they must use the actions in the same order every time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Relevant mechanics info</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Day start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majority lynch is enabled Day 2+, but majority is not required at any point in order to lynch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being lynched at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No outside communication. I.e. you may not contact the other players outside of the thread (unless you are Mafia and wish to speak with your teammates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phase Lengths and Deadlines will be up to the players themselves (I’ll organize your representative into a game with deadlines that suit their preferences).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thread is locked during Night Phases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Votes are automatically locked in at LYLO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mafia factional kills are <span class="bbcode-u">assigned</span>. They can be tracked, watched, roleblocked, etc. (In this setup, that means they display as an action to the Tracker and the Motion Detector actions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mafia share a factional Night Kill, which is a single standard shot for their faction. The mafia faction kill is <span class="bbcode-u">mandatory</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mafia may communicate at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each individual player may make a maximum of 150 posts per day phase (this restriction is lifted 2 hours before day end).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The game will have a host to oversee everything and make sure everyone’s following the code of conduct, but otherwise the game is completely automated (automatic votecounts, thread locks and reveals roles automatically, the bot receives and processes actions, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="bbcode-b">SEASON 7 TIMELINE</span></h3>
<p>There will be 10 Qualifier Games, and your representative plays in just one of these. They will have start dates ranging from late April to mid-June. So in other words, as long as your representative can play sometime during that period, they should be good and I’ll make sure they get scheduled into a game that suits their schedule well. I.e. if your rep is busy until June, that isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>The Semifinal Games will be played in July, and the Finale Game sometime in August/September (whenever we can work out something that suits everyone).</p>
<p>If you want to get in contact with me ASAP, you can find me on Discord (Lissa#8083).</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Lissa</span></p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<h2>Now we will vote on our representative!</h2>
<p>Voting will take place over two rounds.</p>
<p>In the first round, select as many of the players who accepted their <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/mafia-championships-season-7-nominations/81113?u=orangeandblack5">nominations</a> as you would be okay with being our representative. You are encouraged to vote for as many players as you think would be a good fit, and you are encouraged to vote for yourself.</p>
<p>For the second round, voting will be done anonymously. Of the remaining candidates from the first round, you may give each one a numerical rating, with 1 being your first choice and higher numbers being lower. You may not skip any numbers or have any ties, but you may leave as many candidates blank as you would like, which will automatically assign them the lowest ranking. Your votes will be published along with the results, but they will not be tied to your name, so please vote honestly for the players you think would best represent us in the Mafia Championships.</p>

<a class="mention" href="../../u/orangeandblack5.html">@orangeandblack5</a><br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/vulgard.html">@Vulgard</a></p>
<p>Here’s how voting will work:</p>
<p>Copy and paste the below message into a PM to <a class="mention" href="../../u/thealtinourstars.html">@TheAltInOurStars</a>. Replace the six ‘?’ symbols with numbers between 1 and 6, indicating the order in which you would prefer each potential candidate, with 1 being your first choice, and higher numbers representing lower and lower preference.</p>
<p>You do not need to give every candidate a number - leaving one blank automatically assigns them the lowest priority. For example, if you have one strong preference and no other preferences, you may give one candidate a score of “1” and leave the others blank.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the process, send me a PM at <a class="mention" href="../../u/orangeandblack5.html">@orangeandblack5</a> or on Discord at <strong>orangeandblack5#4506</strong>.</p>
