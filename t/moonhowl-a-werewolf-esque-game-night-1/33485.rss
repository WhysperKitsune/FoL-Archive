    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/moonhowl-a-werewolf-esque-game-night-1/33485</link>
    <description># Gameplay
Everyone will be given a public role, and a secret identity, your secret identity is either &quot;Human&quot; or &quot;Werewolf&quot;
There are 2 phases, Day Phase and Night Phase

# Day Phase
During the day phase, players may talk, and perform actions around the town, all of these actions are public knowledge

# Night Phase
During the night phase, players perform secret actions

# Town Locations
Only 1 player may visit each location per day and perform the associated action, unless stated otherwise
Town Hall - A player who visits the Town Hall may call a vote, votes can be for many different things, the votes are publicly voted on, you can&#39;t vote for things that don&#39;t affect the game or things that don&#39;t make sense
Gallows(2 players) - A player who visits the Gallows may speak privately with any other players who visit the gallows today
Church - A player who visits the church may pray, confess, or steal silver, praying protects you from werewolves tonight, confession reveals the last place you visited secretly to the priest, stealing silver can only be done twice per game, but you get silver
Market - A player who visits the market may purchase meat
Blacksmith - A player who visits the blacksmith may receive a weapon, or have their silver turned into a silver bullet
Infirmary - A player who visits the infirmary will not die today
Morgue - A player who visits the morgue will learn about those who died recently
Witches Hut - A player who visits the Witches Hut will learn about Werewolves, if a player learns 3 things about werewolves, they gain the ability to create a cure for lycanthropy at the infirmary

# Night Actions
Any number of people can visit any location at night, as it is done secretly, however, you cannot visit Town Hall, the Market or the Blacksmith, you also cannot pray at the church

At night, all werewolves must choose a person to kill or a location to attack, if they attack a location, all visitors to that location will die, except those that prayed, you may also choose to bite a person, transforming them into a werewolf the following night

At night, if you have a weapon you may attack a person and make them bleed, if they do not get help the following day they will die

At night, if you have a silver bullet(and weapon) or cure for lycanthropy, you can use it on a player, if they are a werewolf the bullet will kill them and the cure will make them human

At night, if you have meat, you can keep it or place it in a location, if you keep it you are protected from werewolf attacks, if you place it somewhere that location is protected from werewolf attacks

# Winning
Humans win if there are no werewolves

Werewolves win if there are only werewolves

# Roles
Mayor - You have two votes when it comes to votes called by Town Hall
Priest - You hear all confessions
Monk - You can pray or confess even if there is someone at the church
Apothecary - You can heal a player during the day without them needing to visit the infirmary
