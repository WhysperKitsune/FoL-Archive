# Mechanics

~~It&#39;s 15 player mountainous lol~~

# Gameplay

* Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours. 
* Yeets are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the yeet will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.
* No-yeet is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-yeet and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-yeet will have priority in the rand.
* Self-votes are considered valid votes. Accompanied AtE is not required. 
* Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios. That is to say, in situations where a misyeet or a no-yeet will guarantee a Mafia victory, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.
* All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote** . This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.
* The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.
* The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

&gt; **You are a member of the Town!  You have no abilities, but you have a voice, and a vote.**
&gt; 
&gt; *Defeat the Mafia.*

&gt; # [color=red]Orange Justice[/color]
&gt; ![DifferentAnxiousFruitbat-max-1mb|300x169](upload://5QVMVC8kLUr5AQ5Ul49sqky8Z31.gif)
&gt; **You are a member of the Mafia!  You share a 24/7 private chat with your teammates, and must factionally kill a member of the town each night.**
&gt; 
&gt; *Reach parity with the Town.*

**This flavor is not present in the game. Flavor is not alignment indicative in this setup.**

            <p>Maybe the award should be called something like “Game Spirit Award”. Being a team player is often a large part of following the spirit of the game, so in many cases they should be the same. But embodying the spirit of the game can include more, like being a sporting player or doing your best to keep trying to solve despite the odds. This would help to include other options like Neutrals with no team who did well at their wincon and made the game interesting.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the award is supposed to indicate anymore tbh.<br>
Can we point out anybody who was a “team player” with good reason in the recent team player awards<br>
I sure as hell had a decent clown fiesta towngame but my “teamplay” was literally ignoring the entire town’s opinions (on Ici)</p>
