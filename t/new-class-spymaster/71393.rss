    <title>New Class: Spymaster</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-spymaster/71393</link>
    <description>This class is a BD built around finding and infiltrating the Unseen/Cult (I will only use Cult here as a shorthand for both factions).

Day Ability 1: Infiltrate (1 use)
If the targetted player is Cult, jail them. You will appear in the cult room instead.

Basically, you put the person in a jail like the Prince’s and you appear in the Cult room able to talk to them. It will look like in spectator mode to you, with (Cultist) used instead of people’s names and numbers. You will know their action, but not their targets, i. e. you’d see “The Cult Leader will convert someone tonight”

Night Ability 1: Disguise (Infinite uses)
You will see all whispers sent to and from the target player tomorrow. Additionally, all whispers you send will appear to be from the target player. Does not count as visiting.

Night Ability 2: Skullduggery (3 uses)
Reveal a list of all players visited by the target.

Note that the list isn’t in chronological order, so you would know they’d visited 2, 4, 15 but not which night each was visited.

Unseen Class: Impersonator

Day Abiltiy: Kidnap (1 use) - When the Prince jails someone, you will appear in jail instead with your night abilities disabled. You will look like the jailed person, and if the Prince executes, he will kill the original target instead (he will not lose his executes if they’re a bd however).

Night Ability: Skullduggery (Same, unlimitted use)

Disguise (Same, 3 uses)</description>

            <p>I think it’s a creative and original idea but overpowered.  Jailing a Cult member would disable the Cult night chat as <a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a> said.  And knowing which abilities are used by Cult reveals the number of members as well as their class types.  It would be basically a Paladin or Sheriff but 10x stronger.</p>

            <p>I didn’t make one since I figured there’d be no point if people didn’t like the BD version. It would probably be basically the same, but without Infiltrate</p>

            <p>So I’m aware that it’s prtty darn confirmable for a BD class. So here’s why I think it works out:</p>
<p>This class is going to spread a bit of confusion amond bd since it will be basically trollboxing whispers, which should help offset the advantage of a confirmable bd.</p>
<p>Additionally, and more importantly, an outed Spymaster is basically useless. People will be far more suspicious of whispers, and the evils will almost certainly implement passwords making Infiltrate useless. In other words, this class can confirm itself, but it really doesn’t want to.</p>
<p>Another thing that could help would be to give the poss the second part of Disguise (ie, his whispers will appear to be sent by the person he possed. This is a poss buff which is always good and decreases Spymaster’s confirmability)</p>

            <p>I think this class is WAYY too confirmable for a BD class, as all of its abilities are very difficult to fake or impossible.<br>
I do however like this class as an Illusionist rework, the whisper mechanic is a social ability and can be used to spectacular effect if used correctly.</p>
<p>Skullduggery is a somewhat useful ability for unseen, if only to help with faking logs.</p>
