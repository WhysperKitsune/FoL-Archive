    <description># **Class Cards**
&gt; # [color=steblue] The Constable (BD Offensive) [/color]
&gt; **Refute (Night)** - Until the end of the next day, your target&#39;s day abilities will secretly fail. - Inf uses, cannot target the same person twice in a row
**Tunnel vision (Night)** - Until the end of the next day, be alerted whenever your target uses a non-infinite use day ability for the first time - 2 uses

&gt; # [color=purple] The Agent (Unseen Offensive) [/color]
&gt; Converted from the constable
**Scold (Night)** - Until the end of the next day, your target&#39;s day abilities will secretly fail. Additionally, if they try to use a day ability, you will be alerted - Inf uses, cannot target the same person twice in a row
**Sabotage (Night)** - Prevent your target&#39;s night ability, stopping them from having an effect on the game - 2 uses, does not work on occupy immune targets

# **Why should this exist?**
**What does the constable do?** Simply put, you interract with day abilities. You can stop them from happening, or you can learn when they happen. This is kind of a double-edged sword, because you could deny important BD roles, like prince, CW and physician from using their important abilities, but you can also make sorcerer miss a bomb, posessor miss a facelift and reaper miss a chill
**What does it add to the game?**  Day abilities are currently 100% reliable, and this class is here to change that. Right now, a reaper with a lot of souls can literally win a 1v5 with all the vote manip reaper has. This class gives BD a way to counter multiple threats that they could never deal with before, such as NKs, trollboxes and bleeds
**What does the agent do?** You are the evil counterpart of the constable, able to disrupt important BD classes, like king or prince. You can also use your abilities to make plays with hunters, nobles and sheriffs. This class is essentially a hard counter to prince

# **In depth explaination**
Note: __Refute__ and __Scold__ start an independant day-occing immunity counter akin to the already existing earned occ immunity. You become immune to day abils after 2 uses of these abilities, wether you lose an ability or not
__Refute__ silently makes someone&#39;s day abilities fail. Since it is secret, a valid fake claim would be to say that, for instance, your force vote as noble failed due to an Agent. This ability cannot be used on the same person twice in a row to stop an unfun scenario as NK where you cant use your important abilities twice in a row
__Tunnel vision__ is a kind of investigative ability, allowing you to play detective like a real constable would. Since infinite abilities dont trigger this, claiming sheriff as mastermind will still be valid. This also makes sorcerer and posessor unspottable from their bombs and facelifts
__Scold__ is a mix between Refute and Tunnel vision, allowing the Agent to disrupt BD classes and learn if they sucessfully broke one of their abilities. Additionally, you learn if your target attempted to use any day ability, not just non-infinite ones, which can let you find NK
__Sabotage__ is an occupy that doesnt tell their targets they&#39;ve been occupied. It can allow for some cool plays, but it&#39;s a giveaway for investigatives classes as they wont recieve feedback

# **Feedback**
__Refute__ - You will prevent [Player] from using day abilities tomorrow
__Tunnel vision__ - You will watch over [Player] tomorrow, learing when they use a day ability - You noticed [Player] using a day ability
__Scold__ - You will prevent [Player] frim using day abilities tomorrow, and learn if they attempt to use one - You noticed [Player] using a day ability
__Sabotage__ - You will stop [Player]&#39;s ability from having any effect - You prevented [Player]&#39;s night ability - You were unable to stop [Player] from using an ability. They could be Occupy Immune, did not use an ability or were intensified by the Court Wizard

# **Changelog**
V1.0 - Original 
[details=&quot;Retired class cards&quot;]
# **Retired class cards**
&gt; # [color=steblue] The Constable (BD Investigative) (Retired) [/color]
&gt; **Refute (Day)** - Until the end of the day, target player&#39;s day abilities will fail. Cannot be used on the same target twice in a row - 3 uses, cannot be canceled
**Interrogate (Night)** - Determine whether your target used their primary ability or their secondary ability - Inf uses
**Revise files (Night)** - Determine how many limited use abilities target player used since the start of the game - 3 uses

&gt; # [color=purple] The Agent (Unseen Investigative) (Retired) [/color]
&gt; Converted from the constable
**Refute (Day)** - Until the end of the day, target player&#39;s day abilities will fail. Cannot be used on the same target twice in a row - 3 uses, cannot be canceled
**Stalk (Night)** - Determine how many limited use abilities your target has left - Inf uses
**Forge evidence (Night)** - Make target unseen player appear as target role if executed today - 2 uses
[/details]
V2.0 (Current) - Complete overhaul of the role
 - Scrapped most abilities (__Interrogate__, which was already the name for inquisitor&#39;s ability, __Revise files__, __Stalk__ and __Forge evidence__)
 - Moved __Refute__ from a day ability to a night ability taking effect the next night
 - Increased __Refute__ uses from 3 to infinite
 - Added new night ability: __Tunnel vision__, an ability designed to switch the focus of the class from being on limited use abilities to only day abilities
 - Added a difference between the Constable&#39;s __Refute__ and the Agent&#39;s __Refute__
    - Now called __Scold__
    - Buffed the ability to be a mix of the Constable&#39;s 2 abilities, allowing space to add another Agent night ability
    - All changes to __Scold__ are mirrored on this ability, making it infinite uses
 - Added a day-occing counter to counter the potential of chain stopping someone from existing with 2 Constables/Agents
- Added a new night ability: __Sabotage__, to make the Agent a slightly more enticing convert than a simple NK stopper
- Completely changed all feedback, uses and descriptions for all abilities
- Changed the Constable and Agent&#39;s class types to Offensive</description>

            <p>Refute is going to get moved to a night ability that takes effect the next day, so it wont hard confirm as much. Also, IDK if you noticed but unlike force and wolf, refute doesnt provide feedback, it just stops day abilities without calling it, so to know if your ability failed you have to wait until the end of the day</p>

            <p>Shouldn’t <strong>Refute</strong> (disable target’s day abilities for 1 day) be an evil-only ability, so that it stops players going, “Noble use force-vote to prove” or “Hunter wolf”?</p>
<p>If Blue Dragon has this ability then it will be mostly used to confirm the Constable.</p>

            <p>Yes. It’s written in the explaination</p>
<p><strong>Refute</strong>  lets you stop neutral killers from using their majority-changing special day abilities, an assassin/CL’s bleed, and a BD’s harmful abilities. Aditionally, a failed ability does not provide feedback. The ability just fails and loses a charge, letting you make some sneaky play, like disabling a hunter’s wolf. Abilities that resolve at the end of the night will always get canceled by this ability, even if declared before the use of refute (Note: the sheriff’s scout will not move, staying on the previous target / the sorcerer will know if their ability failed, as the bomb icon will not appear)</p>

            <p>I mean I think the idea behind the class itself just makes it inherently incredibly powerful and adding it to the mix would tip things considerably in the favor of the already favored BD.</p>
<p>It’s not <em>unworkable</em> but when the counterplay is “don’t use very useful abilities” and to have to keep track of <em>another</em> thing its just</p>
<p>really really oppresive to have to play against even the chance of this class spawning.</p>
<p>I might see it if there were a larger core rework to the 1st/2nd/limited use ability system as a whole but right now I dont see it working, sorry.</p>

            <p>So here’s the thing. First of all, i’m not a designer. I submitted this knowing that it was probably flawed, as I was looking for feedback on the whole thing</p>
<p>For the primary/secondary ability thing, i dont agree that the primary/secondary ability is randomly positionned. If you take a look at every class, the ability they tend to use the most is always the first one, which is what the ability is based around. I will say that while i agree that it is pretty iffy for killer classes to sucessfully fake claim, there is still workaround</p>
<p>Also, you were mentionning that “Hope this doesnt spawn”. Then just hope no investigatives spawn at all, because they all have the power to find you if you claim a certain thing. Princess can find you if you claim something other than the 4 BD classes in your group, Observer can find you if you claim to visit the guy you didnt, and sheriff can just find you. My point being that all investigative roles are strong in their own way</p>
<p>Also, no evil class is “Required” to use limited abilities, but they all have some that they can use to aid them with their fake claim (MM has foresight, Ass has bleed/silence, Reaper has COD (Though using it does hurt), Poss has mind controls) except cult, which this class is made to be a soft counter to, and sorc (Sorc’s just still pretty weak). If you wanna fake claim knight as assassin, just dont bleed until the constable is dead. It’s more restriction, but in the current claim train meta, it’s far from unbearable</p>
<p>I will say that you’re right on the fact that it does add something else one has to look after, which may make it harder for evils</p>
<p>Also currently thinking about changing interrogate to “Determine if they used their sec or not”, to allow for some more fake claiming. The problem being that this might make the class less fun to play IDK</p>

</aside>
<p>this is another layer of fakeclaim</p>
<p>I just like<br>
I don’t think it fits in the game seeing how hard it is to counter.</p>
<p>Cult/Unseen/NK already have to worry about obs/princess</p>
<p>this makes fakeclaiming pretty tight and would mean more or less that evils would just have to hope that this doesn’t spawn because, like, a knight claim checked as using any limited abilities is outted as evil, a princess claim too.</p>
<p>Like<br>
It just is incredibly overpowered logistically and the whole “first/2nd” ability thing is arbitrarily placed and could lead to some imbalanced interactions.</p>

            <h1><strong>Class Cards</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue"> The Constable (BD Offensive) </font></h1>
<p><strong>Refute (Night)</strong> - Until the end of the next day, your target’s day abilities will secretly fail. - Inf uses, cannot target the same person twice in a row<br>
<strong>Tunnel vision (Night)</strong> - Until the end of the next day, be alerted whenever your target uses a non-infinite use day ability for the first time - 2 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="purple"> The Agent (Unseen Offensive) </font></h1>
<p>Converted from the constable<br>
<strong>Scold (Night)</strong> - Until the end of the next day, your target’s day abilities will secretly fail. Additionally, if they try to use a day ability, you will be alerted - Inf uses, cannot target the same person twice in a row<br>
<strong>Sabotage (Night)</strong> - Prevent your target’s night ability, stopping them from having an effect on the game - 2 uses, does not work on occupy immune targets</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><strong>Why should this exist?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>What does the constable do?</strong> Simply put, you interract with day abilities. You can stop them from happening, or you can learn when they happen. This is kind of a double-edged sword, because you could deny important BD roles, like prince, CW and physician from using their important abilities, but you can also make sorcerer miss a bomb, posessor miss a facelift and reaper miss a chill<br>
<strong>What does it add to the game?</strong>  Day abilities are currently 100% reliable, and this class is here to change that. Right now, a reaper with a lot of souls can literally win a 1v5 with all the vote manip reaper has. This class gives BD a way to counter multiple threats that they could never deal with before, such as NKs, trollboxes and bleeds<br>
<strong>What does the agent do?</strong> You are the evil counterpart of the constable, able to disrupt important BD classes, like king or prince. You can also use your abilities to make plays with hunters, nobles and sheriffs. This class is essentially a hard counter to prince</p>
<h1><strong>In depth explaination</strong></h1>
<p>Note: <strong>Refute</strong> and <strong>Scold</strong> start an independant day-occing immunity counter akin to the already existing earned occ immunity. You become immune to day abils after 2 uses of these abilities, wether you lose an ability or not<br>
<strong>Refute</strong> silently makes someone’s day abilities fail. Since it is secret, a valid fake claim would be to say that, for instance, your force vote as noble failed due to an Agent. This ability cannot be used on the same person twice in a row to stop an unfun scenario as NK where you cant use your important abilities twice in a row<br>
<strong>Tunnel vision</strong> is a kind of investigative ability, allowing you to play detective like a real constable would. Since infinite abilities dont trigger this, claiming sheriff as mastermind will still be valid. This also makes sorcerer and posessor unspottable from their bombs and facelifts<br>
<strong>Scold</strong> is a mix between Refute and Tunnel vision, allowing the Agent to disrupt BD classes and learn if they sucessfully broke one of their abilities. Additionally, you learn if your target attempted to use any day ability, not just non-infinite ones, which can let you find NK<br>
<strong>Sabotage</strong> is an occupy that doesnt tell their targets they’ve been occupied. It can allow for some cool plays, but it’s a giveaway for investigatives classes as they wont recieve feedback</p>
<h1><strong>Feedback</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Refute</strong> - You will prevent [Player] from using day abilities tomorrow<br>
<strong>Tunnel vision</strong> - You will watch over [Player] tomorrow, learing when they use a day ability - You noticed [Player] using a day ability<br>
<strong>Scold</strong> - You will prevent [Player] frim using day abilities tomorrow, and learn if they attempt to use one - You noticed [Player] using a day ability<br>
<strong>Sabotage</strong> - You will stop [Player]'s ability from having any effect - You prevented [Player]'s night ability - You were unable to stop [Player] from using an ability. They could be Occupy Immune, did not use an ability or were intensified by the Court Wizard</p>
