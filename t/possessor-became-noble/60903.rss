    <title>Possessor became noble?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-became-noble/60903</link>
    <description>I played a game as a possessor. I swapped bodies with a Noble, and suddenly my kill skill was replaced with gossip, and switch bodies with maid spy?!

At the end score board I even had possessor in BLUE, and a NEUTRAL noble xD
