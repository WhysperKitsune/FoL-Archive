<blockquote>
<p>Alice - Opening was by far the best out of everyone I’ve seen. She has started very seriously and is taking no prisoners. I believe that she is genuine townie atm who is trying to make sure everything runs smoothly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You - I think your frustration with me and Kyo feels quite legitimate, no sort of wolf theatrics being played. Only reason you’re not higher is I dislike that you’re refusing me to be able to use meta, but the point you used of just using this game as is, is valid.<br>
Vul - Started off with a fairly early vote which is fine, backing up what they say early on which is good as they’re trying to promote discussion this way<br>
Sulit - Sulit is starting off really weakly and I think as scum they’d be putting more effort into early game to avoid being put in PoE.<br>
Mode - Seth is someone that I just don’t know how to properly read. He is often lacklustre (but much to my surprise did well last game). I believe this game his reactions have been genuine and that is why I think he is slight town.<br>
TBE - Blue is someone that did not act serious early on. However slowly evolved to take things more seriously and I believe Blue therefore has acted genuinely.</p>
<p>I realise I included Seth twice and EVO hadn’t even talked. I think I mixed EVO and Evil up but then that means I would’ve included EVO twice. Idk, I’ll read up from there and try to do so again.</p>
<p>Chloe - Chloe started off a bit quiet but then seemed to get more into things when I made the list. She made sure not to jump to conclusions too fast which I like tonally as well.<br>
Evil - Evil just didn’t seem to care at all. I think TWTBAW so far but I’ll be watching this slot in particular to see how it develops.</p>
<p>SDA - Derps literally couldn’t make their mind up when I was posting going from serious to joking and back and forth. I think if Derps was town that they would attempt to actually just be one or the other as instead it feels like they’re trying to seem like they’re doing more (by posting a fair bit) while not contributing much.<br>
Kyo - I didn’t like the Kyo/Ici interactions looking back on it after all. I think that Ici is more townie though so Kyo is the likelier of the two to be scum. Kyo also kept trying to draw discussion back to the ‘types of PoE’ constantly.<br>
Cloned - Cloned, like Seth, is someone I admit to not be able to read easily. I believe that they some of their more recent posts are trying to seem like they’re contributing while not actually producing anything new<br>
Marshal - Marshal had by far the worst opening in my opinion. Their shot is the thing I keep harping back to but it is a focal point for this read. I believe that Marshal actually <em>knew</em> there weren’t any D1 shots but did this on purpose as wolf theatrics because people would quickly assume that they would be paying more attention as wolf and therefore would use this to slide under the radar. I also hate how when Alice was making her tentative town reads how Marshal was like “You’re missing me” which feels like LAMIST.</p>
<p>I have not read anything recently that has happened due to making this though so I do hope that I’m not interrupting anything or posting at a bad time.</p>

<p>I do like this though as it shows what he thinks of the other players, and doesn’t feel faked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alice - Alice has continued her strong start, constantly re-evaluates who to shoot between and who her suspects are. I loved her tone during the Chloe trial too as she took it all in her stride. I think that she’s amazing this game and her dedication is very much indicative of a town alice who’s had enough of us losing giant mashes like this (Or whatever it would be considered. I think Mash is the right term)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ici - Ici early on had a good tone, I still like his Kyo/Ici interaction and attitude of trying to end it early on, so this continued from my old list. Ici has been frustrated and his reactions to Sigurd and claiming speed felt legitimate. I’m concerned about his slot because he is good but he’s the closest for me to move up the reads list.</p>
<p>Vul - Vul’s reactions have come across as legitimate and not forced, being frustrated with me and questioning me about my readslist before. Vul’s done a lot of analysis on different slots, re-evaluating and checking who’s doing what. I would like <a class="mention" href="../../../u/vulgard.html">@Vulgard</a> to do a readslist if possible and discuss some more. Vul, what did you think about the grand trial thing I did? Tonally who did you like/dislike during it?</p>
<p>Marshal - Now that I re-evaluate this slot, I can see that Marshal was frustrated with me due to me not picking up what he was saying. His attempt to cover for my slot is absolutely a pro-town move and I think I mostly just got annoyed with how he wasn’t being serious and disliked the fake townslip earlier on.</p>
<p>Gorta - Gorta’s the one on this level that I have the least reasoning behind. I remember someone said that Gorta is either really townie / really scummy and I have liked his reactions to the grand trial with Chloe since it shows Gorta isn’t just stagnating in his reads.</p>
<p>Leafia - Leafia is someone that is quiet but from what they posted I don’t see anything which stands out as scummy. This slot potentially could go down to 6 if they don’t speak more because I could see them trying to fly under the radar if they stay quiet. I’d like to see <a class="mention" href="../../../u/Leafia.html">@Leafia</a> produce more conducive reads. Their reaction to the grand trial was quite normal and didn’t stand out much.</p>
<p>意大利 - Claims a killer (potentially) and I don’t think it’s just a reaction test. I’m not sure what the plan from this slot is but I like it so far. I want to see some more from them before I lock them into this position as I’m tentatively putting them here. They act seriously but sometimes just disappear from nowhere.</p>
<p>Apprentice - Apprentice’s reactions have been normal. They were annoyed when I didn’t add them to the reads list before. Apprentice used some meta on the cloned slot and has been making reads / small points to explain their feelings. Would like a bigger list if possibleOnly thing which really annoyed me about this slot is they refused to answer my questions (which as y’all can see later led to my questions being clearly shown why they were as they were)</p>
<p>My 8/7 reads.<br>
Posting these first so it’s not too overwhelming and we can discuss them throughout.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Centuries - Centuries has made really mild reads but has made a couple of decent questions. I want to see more content from them, but they’re not particularly scummy thus far, just a bit too in the background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mode - Seth has continued to be quiet, his tone keeps changing a bit which makes me unsure of it, however, I feel like he just keeps being like “Guys, I’m town, please listen” which comes off as a desperate villager who’s a bit lost in a big setup. He’s the one I’m the least certain of that’s on this rating atm. I’d like him to speak more, give solid reads and just <em>try</em> instead of being like ‘I’m good. Listen to me’</p>
<p>Sulit - I think scum sulit would be trying more than they have been. The fact that I have seen a non-serious tone for so long in his ISO just tells me that Sulit feels safe and he has nothing to worry about. I could be wrong about that but it’s been too calm to be scum.</p>
<p>Chloe - I think this goes for myself and everyone when I say that Chloe’s start was fairly abhorrent, which is why I targeted her with my ability due to having to pick someone anyway. She picked things up from there and took things in her own stride. I’m tentative to call her town due to the shift, but I like how things are going. I look forward to seeing more from her.</p>
<p>Evil_Ginger - Had some fair points earlier on such as post <span class="hashtag">#501</span>. Evil was quite non-serious earlier on as I know and I don’t think that Scum!Evil has that type of entrance which is uncaring. I like some of their posts, but others seem like they don’t care. Need a bit more actual content from this slot. Thing which erks me most is Evil’s refusal to cooperate when I was asking for high scum targets (E.g. for ToL Trial or for shooting). I’m only keeping them here because there’s already a fair few slots lower than them.</p>
<p>Darth - Darth is someone that I have had the pleasure to play with for quite some time so I <em>think</em> I can read them well. They tried to blend in a bit and make some reads but it’s nothing outside of his town meta from what I remember. I’m going to double check this, but due to it being town AI for Darth iirc, I’d be happy to say Darth is town. I want them to do more things on their own back though instead of trying to just get by.</p>
<p>TBE - TheBlueElixir has been doing fine, asserting some pressure but also being fairly jokey at certain points. They come across as genuine but uncaring, a similar thing to Evil but I think that in general, TBE has been more townie than Evil.</p>
<p>CRich - Biggest problem with this slot is that they’re saying “(X) has acted like (Y)” instead of analysing things which have gone on this game, which makes me think they might have possibly ignored the whole Chloe thing on purpose. They ask some questions, make some shallow reads. I’d like for them to actually read more of the thread instead of just (for example) them comparing me to the ToS game but I can see they’re at least trying to contribute like this.</p>
<p>Here’s my 6’s.</p>

<p>I feel that T!PKR would’ve put Seth a lot lower on the list to be honest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EVO - Post <span class="hashtag">#2367</span> was the only good post from them that I have seen and even that was not impressive. It seems to me like EVO is trying their best to flake just about enough that they can get away with their reads and I really dislike that as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hippo - Hippo’s entrance was unsurprisingly not good due to his jokey nature coming into play. The fake ITA being why I originally sus’d Marsh happening again and they subtly quipped at me for no reason about the LOTR FM game. I have not seen any serious posts from them and claiming speed <em>could</em> be seen as scummy to try and get people to give away whether they are or aren’t our protag. Also just won’t read, doesn’t care.</p>
<p>Cloned - Out of my lowest reads, cloned is the one I always struggle on but I just don’t really like their entrance. Cloned has also disappeared at some very weird times which I do further dislike. A lot of their posts have had quoting others but then not really contributing or giving their own take of the posts. Their most recent posts are also like ‘should I sleep’ ‘I fell asleep’ etc. Which just isn’t helping at all.</p>
<p>Light - I think Light relied on the fake clear earlier on a bit too much and went quiet due to it. They have a lot of not serious posts with some slight serious ones sprinkled in to try and hide perfectly. The first 50-60% of their ISO is joke/fluff. The only reason this isn’t lower is because they at least pardoned Chloe, not too slow. They also just aren’t expanding on things at all. Their second to last post needs explaining but they’re like “I dunno”. I dislike this as a whole and don’t see them acting as to how they have in recent town games</p>
<p>Derps - Derp’s tone has changed more than anyone else’s this game and not necessarily in a good way, just being serious then not and never changing from there. As I said earlier, I think if Derps was town that they would attempt to actually just be one or the other as instead it feels like they’re trying to seem like they’re doing more (by posting a fair bit) while not contributing much. Faked a N0 on L1ght who I also think could be scum, was joking around to try and get me to claim and saying they’d hero shoot me or whatever. I want some serious action by this slot, <strong>reads</strong> and analysis.</p>
<p>Kyo - Just going to keep this short, Kyo literally hasn’t improved much from when I posted my last readslist so my basis is still here, but combine that with Kyo just fading into the background which is unusual for them.</p>
<p>Italy - Italy refuses to make reads and take things seriously when asked they’re like ‘no lol’ and just don’t care at all about contributing to the town. Their reaction towards me was also abhorrent saying that they won’t take threats or bluffs as if they just don’t care. This slot won’t do anything unless they have to, so I think they need to be made to do stuff. I’m getting bored of it and it’s exclusively anti-town.</p>

<p>Kind of goes against the last statement in a way. So he’s basically saying that if he thought someone outside the PoE was scummy, all guns should be on them because then they’re confirmed scum then in the next statement says that he’d shoot out of the PoE himself if he thought someone outside of it was scummy. Definitly wolfy behavior. Probably a scumslip too.</p>

<p>That’s true, the three of us have played a lot of games together and both of us are excellent at telling when Seth is scum. It just seems really weird to me how PKR could be tricked into thinking a scumseth could possibly be town, especially with how Seth was playing. It seems like he was coaching Seth to get him to act more townie.</p>

<p>This confirms my thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>It’s clear to me now why the scumteam didn’t kill PKR. Because he’s one of them. That’s the only possible explanation I can think of.

My guess is that either he and his buddies weren’t thinking straight or because he thought claiming to greencheck Zone would make more sense.</p>
