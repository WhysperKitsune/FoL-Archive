    <title>Knight Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/knight-suggestion/27357</link>
    <description>I think knight in its current state dies too early, since both of his abilities can kill him, and while I think this is fine if you are using his abilities recklessly, I think knight could be more fun to play if it rewarded players for using playing more carefully. My suggestion is to give him the following passive:

&gt;**Passive: Honor**
You start the game with this passive disabled. If you kill an evil player with cold steel, you will become immune to death and you cannot be occupied when using cold steel.  If someone attacks you you will lose this passive.
_(Only cult/unseen players count, killing neutrals won&#39;t activate this effect. You will also be immune to death if someone attacks a player you are guarding, but you will lose this passive as well. Trying to cold steel a member of the blue dragon will still kill you immediately even if you have this passive. If you lose this passive, you can activate it again by killing another evil role with cold steel)._

This gives knights a reason to be careful with their abilities, and rewards them for using cold steel on the right targets.</description>

            <p>Giving knight an ability to be immune would not make it harder to claim, in fact it could make it easier to claim for some.</p>

            <p>I was in a game where me and another knight were outed in Prince logs. We both died next night (independently) cs’ing each other—I assume he thought same as me, at least one confirmed knight will remain. BD lost for lack of votes.</p>
<p>Gotta be careful there. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>That said, it was certainly a memorable holy shit game moment for all involved.</p>

            <p>Here is why that works:</p>
<p>1: Knight and Evil kill each other</p>
<p>2: Knight kills a scum usually fool and is now confirmed</p>
<p>3: Knight hits immune claiming Knight and calls him out. NK/MM is killed and Knight is confirmed (or possibly they both are lynched)</p>
<p>4: Knight hits immune but also dies. The other person is obviously lying cuz there is now 2 dead knights</p>
<p>5: Knight hits MM but is defiled to look like a fool/assassin/whatever. An obs watching the knight just found the entire unseen. If he is watching the MM he knows who the MM is now.</p>

            <p>I agree with this. I’d go further and say the primary objective of the Knight class is to not get killed among the fake claims, at least before they can do some good with a cs or sacrifice.</p>
<p>Whether that’s what the devs meant it to be, I don’t know, but I kind of like having a class where the main challenge comes from navigating other players’ suspicions instead of the game mechanics.</p>

            <p>The true role of knight is to be an easy fake claim for people.Knight is a powerful class but its often faked because of how easy it is to fake.Sheriff and Paladin are also very powerful classes that are easy to fake.Changing knight right now might make picking a class to fake claim harder.<br>
I mean sure you COULD claim butler but who would you have in your will?<br>
Your MM?Dead People?I agree Knight is a boring class to play but it can carry and will.<br>
In Cult games knight can just slaughter them all and sometimes does.I do agree that making knight a little more fun would be good.I like this honor passive as it might make knight harder to claim for unseen while also giving NKs a nice go to claim.</p>
