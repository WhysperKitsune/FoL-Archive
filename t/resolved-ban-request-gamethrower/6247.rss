    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-ban-request-gamethrower/6247</link>
    <description>I was playing prince and jailed the guy on night 2 , he refused to give me his log also cursed at me . Jailed him later again with him saying kill me without giving any proof for no execution . I execute him and he comes up as BD as me. I also lose my executions and die the next die. His journal was &quot;Logs are for tryhards&quot; and procceeded to taunt me in dead chat.
