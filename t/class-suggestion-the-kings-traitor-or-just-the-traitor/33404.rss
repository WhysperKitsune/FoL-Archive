    <title>[Class Suggestion] The king&#39;s traitor, or just the Traitor</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-kings-traitor-or-just-the-traitor/33404</link>
    <description>**Type**: social
**Objective**: Win as a Neutral king.

**Passive**: Royal blood.
**Passive**: appears as BD to anyone but the king. Immune to death at night until becoming the king. Immune to conversions.

**Night abilities:**
Mind Warp (1 use) : Cause the king to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities tonight.
Prevent healing(2 use): prevent any healing on king. He will die if he get attacked and not guarded.


**Day abilities:**
Trollbox(unlimited)



**Idea:** this class will make the starting king alot weaker, he will now  afraid not using guards at himself firsts nights.The win condition is very hard but very satisfying, as he needs not only to become the king but also to survive the game as the king.</description>
