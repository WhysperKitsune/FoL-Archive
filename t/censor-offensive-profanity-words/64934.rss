    <description>First. **Feedback.**

**1.1** As a Mongolian who lives in Mongolia i am offended by some player who using &quot;**mong**&quot; word shortened form of &quot;**Mongoloid**&quot; a derogatory term for a person affected by mental disorder/down syndrome. People needs to understand it&#39;s not just offensive to people with down syndrome, It is very offensive to **Mongols** that East-Central Asian ethnic group native to Mongolia and China&#39;s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Imagine your ethnic group name is used to call people with mental disorder/down syndrome in another country. I tried to explain this to that player but he sent me F word with snowflake.
                                ![mongoloid|387x500](upload://5shE0hotj1azfnbrtw3NIhjlfLi.png)



**1.2** I don&#39;t use any profanity word in my discussion/conversation with stranger. But when strangers started talking with me using profanity words i feel uncomfortable. It&#39;s not region locked game so you need to expect people from different regions with different culture, different race etc but players keep using profanity words in someway like * * * * * or changing letter with another letter like &quot;Nigga&quot; to &quot;N1gga&quot; etc.

Second. **Suggestion**

**2** I like to suggest censor of Offensive/Profanity words otherwise game is pretty fun.
When people using Offensive/Profanity words it will automatically appear as ***** or some replaced good meaning word, or won&#39;t show at all.

Thank you for showing attention and spending time to read it.</description>

<p>Also very exploitable. Especially in competitive games. Overwatch had the issue where a guy would avoid every good player, allowing him to climb much more easily. This ended in the avoid feature being removed.</p>
<p>Id be all for this in ToL but if we ever gain a competitive mode. Avoiding should be disabled there.</p>

            <p>Racism is already against the rules. If anything, concealing such remarks with ****** just allows the behavior to continue. Better to make it easier to report it. Nobody wants to sit around for 30 minutes in a game where they’re dead on night 2 just to report the racist guy.</p>
<p>Another (I think more elegant) way to address this problem would be to implement blacklists, as I’ve seen suggested elsewhere. There are certain people I see in games that I know I never want to play with again, no matter what. I’d gladly double or triple my queue time to avoid ever having them in a game with me again. I wish I had that option.</p>

<a class="mention" href="/u/icibalus">@Icibalus</a> I am sure filter can work like what to filter and what to not since filter is made from professional people, easily giving access to bypass filter</p>
