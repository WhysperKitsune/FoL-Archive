    <title>Mastermind (Minnor Changes)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mastermind-minnor-changes/71307</link>
    <description>**Changes**
Will now show up as unseen to the sheriff/Observer on the first three nights. (Remove In the shadows)

Day ability
Disappear, Hide from investigative classes the following night appearing as Not Suspicious (3 uses)

Starting Assasssin and the First convert will become the new Mastermind if they die, If the OG Mastermind used &quot;Disappear&quot; the number of uses will be shared.


-Buffs unseen a faction that is currently slightly worse then cult, giving it edge over being screwed over from a Masterminds early death, also requiring the Mastermind to hide from sheriffs now lets it choose when it wants to appear NS.

of course if you think there should be changes or this is a bad idea I want you to leave feedback.</description>

            <p>True, but having the starting Assassin and first convert become mm can also help instead of a stupid set timer.</p>

            <p>The whole idea was to slightly buff Mm because of unseen having generally lower win rates then cult right now also games that are very unlucky, letting it appear NS first three days was something fine, but I think it’s better if it requires the Mastermind to think if they are going to be checked or not, yeah they could use it the first three days still or not, and currently if mm is found early it will be kept alive until day 4 then killed then rip unseen.</p>
