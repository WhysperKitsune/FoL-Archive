    <description>Before this plane existed, there was a world above. A place that known as the Upper Realm. It was a vast area, filled with infinite acres of every biome. In this area, housed legends. Of different shapes, different sizes, from all different kinds of everything imaginable, they all resided here.

However, the realm was inactive. It was a place of resting for these legends. Civilizations had been destroyed and reborn. Heroes had lived and died. The present remember little of the past. For every year that went by, the influence of these legends weakened, and the force they could exert on our world decreased -- from accruing their large groups of followers and worshipers, to be merely mentioned in modern tales as myths.

Soon, however, this all changed. What happened? Nobody can say for sure. But this infinite world of old... it came alive once more. And that brings us to the world below.

---

Men and women, in dreams, making deals with characters and gods from fiction and various mythos. When the first story broke, nobody would believe it. How could you? But even so, it kept happening. The reports increased in number, and before long, the public was forced to acknowledge the truth. These people, in accepting this deal... they&#39;d become truly superhuman. 

So a meeting was called, a diplomatic party of sorts. The leaders of our world scrambling to ensure they have power to hold onto. This is where our story begins. *As some of the first people to obtain their power, you&#39;ve received a very exclusive invite. You’re there to contact others like you, persuade nations and powerful people alike to your god&#39;s side, and perhaps even cause some mayhem. The game begins.*

---
[details=&quot;Plot So Far:&quot;]
### The Game Begins - Part 1 [Posts 1 - 176]
The legends have come to earth via dreams and have blessed the higher-ups of society,with powers of a godly sort! All for them to partake in their legendary game of war. Many were bewildered at this sudden change in humanity, and began to fear what would happen next. President Rogers, leader of the country, organised a meeting to sort out any problems people had. And it seemed that order had been restored, when suddenly, a seemingly feeble reporter came to terrorise those in the meeting! After a battle with an envoy of Hecate, Gavan Nord , he was defeated. There was definitely something odd about the reporter, however.

Unfortunately, the meeting had to be ended abruptly because of the incident. The press was asked to keep silent about everything that had just transpired, but you can&#39;t be sure with them...

### Terrors - Chapter 2 [Posts 177 - 313]

You really can&#39;t be sure with them. Despite requests to have a media blackout, the press reported the incident, exposing the whole world to this new age of human civilization. A few hours after the report, some kids had gained their legendary abilities. Power hungry, they decided to go and raid a local store. However, they were stopped by two men; Samuel Rogers, son of the president, and Francis Ward, a follower of Hephaestus. Despite both their strange tactics, they eventually beat the teenagers, and handed them into police.

### Money and Marching - Chapter 3 [Posts 314 - 573]

After the incident that happened to him yesterday, the son of the president, Samuel Rogers has spoken out against the spread of legacies that have so quickly taken over. With his speech, he influences quite a large number of people to protest against these powers.

Gavan, being an assassin, receives new bounties, most being people around the area. But there is one big one that catches his eye. The 10 million dollar bounty for Samuel Rogers. Gavan believes it&#39;s the best opportunity to seize that bounty, and so approaches the government building in an attempt to intercept Rogers. During this attempt, he is stopped by a guard, whose name is later revealed to be Pierre. This guard is seemingly immune to the magic he deploys, and thus the mission is aborted, for now.

Rito, follower of Cthulu, finds himself in the protest going on. He sights Samuel in the crowd, and is seemingly angered by his presence. He attempts to mentally attack Samuel, but his attack is stopped by the same one who stopped Gavan. Both the guard and Rito take to the skies in a chase. It ends with Rito losing, and falling asleep. Garfield, a delivery boy obsessed with sleep, happens to be where Rito and the guard ended up. He is commanded to watch them both. Pierre enters the dreams of Rito, turning him complaisant for the time being. All 3 leave the location they were at... to see Francis Ward running towards them.

Rito and the guard then fight Francis, but it&#39;s not long before Francis is subdued. Pierre intends to take him into custody, but Garfield is able to take him away before Pierre can do so. It turns out that his sister, Laura told him to take Francis and meet up at a local cafe, to discuss about distributing one of Francis&#39;s inventions, a breadmaker, in France.

Meanwhile, Garfield and Alexander discuss Garfield conducting some contract work for Alexander to subdue the legends. 
What will come of these relationships? What will come of the continual protests? Who knows, for now.

### Relation Degradation [Posts 574-994]

It&#39;s day two of the protests. However, the protesters are more aggressive this time around, and are acting strange. Rito and his band of cultists attempt to solve the situation to no avail. Daniel, a power follower of Zeus, Pierre and Rito ward off the aggressive crowd, and a young boy who still attempted to attack, but not in the same way as the others.

Daniel goes to do his job of protecting Samuel Rogers. However he manages to piss Samuel off. Samuel leaves the building, and a curious Daniel follows. After some investigation , he finds the entrance to where he thinks Samuel is from a shopkeeper. And sees a horrible of sight of teenagers being tortured by two captors for an attempt for them to revoke their powers. A fight occurs, and Daniel pleads to the captors to let the teens go, however , this angers one of the captors so much, that it makes him violently attack one of his victims so hard that they revoke their pledge, and power. The battle ends with one of the captors leaving, and Daniel being locked in the cage that was once for the victim that revoked their power.

Meanwhile, both Francis and Laura attempt to go to the government building to see Samuel. However , Pierre denies them entry. Francis prepares a monologue in a fit of rage, but is stopped by... himself?

It turns out to be his brother, another Francis, who refers to his other as &quot;Edmund.&quot; He&#39;s tired of his brother&#39;s shenanigans. Another fight ensues, yet both fall.

Later, Francis appears again, to Pierre&#39;s irritation. However he asserts that he is the &quot;real&quot; Francis.

Which makes you ask... is the physical realm a reliable indicator of a person...?

<p><em>Its been a few days since the gathering at the Cthulu Cult’s quarters.</em><br>
<em>As you all wake up:</em><br>
“This is Silver News, this is Terry Partridge.”<br>
“Determined to integrate the notion of legacies into our society, the government has worked with scientists, researchers and volunteers to bring an event which will mark the first formal usage of legendary powers in a competitive setting. According to certain reports, unlike the conference, this will <strong>NOT</strong> be open to the public. Instead, letters will be handwritten to desired participants. This tournament will be heavily inspected by researches to analyse the nature of these powers. It is expected to start within the next month.”<br>
<em>Everyone of you has received a very official-looking letter.</em></p>

            <p>Huh? What’s this? The rest of the files have been corrupted?! That’s a weird coincidence. Maybe the Cult doesn’t want us to know its history, it could be too terrifying for the human soul to contact. That is all for now for A Cult Classic. Now for your regularly scheduled programming.</p>
