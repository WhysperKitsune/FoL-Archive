    <title>[New Class] The Vizier - Neutral Social</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-class-the-vizier-neutral-social/56615</link>
    <description>The Vizier watched. The Vizier waited. He knew that it would soon be his time, he knew that without his judgement and skill with the court that the Kingdom would fall into disarray. He had stood by the King loyally, even when he put his Son into a position that The Vizier wanted, even when he let his Daughter flirt with the Kingdom, laughing at his hand and eventual place to the throne. No more! The Vizier decided to act and take matters into his own hands. A kingdom needs a strong ruler after all and he would be waiting there with open arms when the ash clears.

&gt; Class Card Name : The Vizier
&gt; Class Card Faction : Neutral
&gt; Class Card Type : Social
&gt; 
&gt; Win Condition: Live to see the Original King and Prince killed. Like most Neutral roles, the Vizier&#39;s Win Condition will change if they take the Throne.
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; Snake-like: When The Vizier would be Killed by a Faction at Night, he instead pleas for his life and survives the Night Kill, learning **which faction** tried to Kill him. This ability only works once per faction and does not stop the King&#39;s Order Execute or Prince Execute.
&gt; 
&gt; Morally Grey: If The Vizier takes the Throne they can choose to become a Good, Neutral or Evil King.
&gt; 
&gt; Royal Blood: The Vizier can choose to step up to the Throne before those without Royal Blood.
&gt;
&gt; **Abilities:**
&gt; Ear to the King (Day, 2/Game)
&gt; The Vizier is able to hear all whispers coming to and from the King this Day.
&gt; 
&gt; A Quiet Word (Day, 2/Game)
&gt; The Vizier&#39;s whispers (to and from) are hidden from the Court today (but not from the users using it).
&gt; 
&gt; Rile the People (Night, 2/Game)
&gt; The Vizier riles up the common folk. The Vizier chooses two targets. If a targeted player kills a Blue Dragon player tonight, they will be Killed as well. This can target the King.
&gt; 
&gt; Blackmail (Night, Unlimited)
&gt; The Vizier can choose two targets, and redirects the ability used by the first to the second. The Vizier does not count as visiting this night nor do they know they&#39;ve been redirected. This cannot target The King.

Many people complain about the King whisper and Prince whisper meta, and while it isn&#39;t generally good design to have a role that directly counters the others, this role is a massive wild card in the game. A Vizier can play BD or Scum and easily help one side or the other. While it is more Scum sided (as it has a condition where the Prince must die), he can quickly turn around and become a Blue Dragon tool with its **Blackmail** ability and **Rile the People** (though a clever Vizier may use it to remove a troublesome Prince if he guesses right). Through using **Snake-Like** the Vizier can gain valuable information on the killer classes in the game and trade information during the day discreetly with **A Quiet Word**. While it may be difficult to trust a Vizier on the Throne, you know he will always have his best interests in mind with how difficult his other win condition may be (and if he kills an Evil King in the process, even better). With clever redirections and the ability to listen in on the King, The Vizier is a force unlike any other in the court.</description>

            <p>I’m a bit confused at Rile the People, how is that supposed to work? If you know an assassin/cult leader, why not just kill him during the day?</p>

            <p>I’m trying to find a balance. Originally it was that The Vizier only learned what Faction tried to kill them, I’m thinking of rolling back to that due to the fact that it picks off NK’s too easily.</p>
<p>Yeah, going back with my gut and just learning the Faction.</p>
<p>“Someone from the [FACTION HERE] tried to kill you tonight but your silver tongue got you out of it.”</p>
