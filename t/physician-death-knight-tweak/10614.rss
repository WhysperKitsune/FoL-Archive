    <title>Physician/death knight tweak</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physician-death-knight-tweak/10614</link>
    <description>One thing I was thinking of, is a possible solution to 1 of the problems, and a bandaid to another problem.


Problem 1. Because the phys cannot speak to the dead, he has no way to guess whether the dead are afk or not

Problem 2. It makes phys too much of an insta death fake claim.

Possible solution
When a physician creates a death knight, He may chose up to 3 targets in order, Nothing at all happens that night.

Next day, Each target gets a pop up, in order &quot;A physician is attempting to turn you into a death knight, will you accept&quot;, If the first guy hits yes, then the rest see nothing, if 15 seconds go by without the first accepting, the second one gets it, etc...

This gives a little more wiggle room for fake physicians, as it buys more time. It also solves the physicians problem of reviving someone who is afk, by checking to see if they are actually availible to return.</description>

            <p>Ignoring the left the game part, my suggestion is mainly to also to deal with people who did not leave the game, but also did not stay in front of the keyboard while dead, and thus are not going to contribute to the game when brought back. By it falling to the next person if they don’t accept the revive, you have very high odds that you will in fact revive someone who is prepared to return to the living and participate.</p>
<p>And as an added side dish to it, buy a fake or converted physician claim an extra day if they are called out and demanded to prove themselves by resurrecting someone.</p>

            <p>So, in your particular situation, you attempted to revive a dead BD player, that had left the game, and you either forgot or missed it in chat? A suggested fix for that would be to have the square of people who have left the game  not be lit up when you try to revive</p>
<p>Or possibly have a line drawn through their name on the scoreboard or something denoting they left the game. I don’t think there is any indication currently. Your suggestion also works as well <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>yes currently it revives them, which is why my suggestion, is that it only revives them if they click a button during the day to confirm that they are not AFK. If a phys gets 3 choices, odds are very low that all 3 are going to be left or afk.</p>

            <p>Why couldn’t Said player be reanimated? Was it because they had left the game? Wouldn’t that be the only reason? If they are afk sitting in graveyard I think, currently. It revives them</p>

            <p>I like this. I got boned one game because I couldn’t prove I was physician when I got a message saying “your target could not be reanimated”</p>
