    <description># The Archivist (Neutral Investigative)

**Passive 1:** The Archive: You have an archive you can use permanently until dead, but not when hung over, or defending yourself. It contains a list of all people alive and dead and you can add a starting class to each one.
*Starting class! Not current class*

**Passive 2:** Truth upon death: When you die your archive will show up correct guesses as green and wrong guesses as red. Your direct killer gets your archive(public execution:First accuser); otherwise it is public(e.g.multiple killers, Hunter, bleed, poison)
*This makes your life harder... claiming archivist is a death sentence unless its late game*

**Day Ability 1:Paper of Truth:** 
Guess the starting class of your first target and send the guess to the second target. It will turn green for the second target if it is correct, otherwise it will turn red.(2 uses) 
*Great for getting information if this goes public. Not so great for keeping yourself hidden *

**Day Ability 2:Paper of Lies** 
Guess the starting class of your first target - it can be yourself - and send the guess to the second target. It will turn red for the second target if it is correct, otherwise it will turn green.(2 uses) 
*No, they can&#39;t trust you... you can fake a class for yourself with it tho. And it still gives you info. But.. it announces your presence, ofc.*    

**Night Ability 1:Desperate Search** 
Instantly determine the starting class type and alignment of someone who died last night or day. This will make your presence public(1 use)
*&quot;Hmm this person has no valid claim, was assassin, original assassin died D2 and I have no idea who this was&quot; - this is for emergencies such as that one. Plus you cannot be occupied for this one.*    

**Night Ability 2:Careful Examination** 
Examine your archive carefully to determine the number of wrong guesses. If the number is 0 you will publish your archive and be convert immune for the rest of the time.(2 uses)
*The number can tell you many things, but you still don&#39;t know WHAT is wrong, exactly. Using 2 of them can tell you if a guess is correct or not, however... but you have only 2.*

**Goal**: *Survive, publish a correct archive or have a correct archive upon death*
*Yeah survival... not easy to accomplish because no one wants your info in the enemies hands! Completing the archive is a long term task so it will not make a big difference, actually, but you still have to try it(and get a couple more wins)*</description>

            <p>I was mostly thinking of careful examination. There are still too few use cases for the ability and the ones that are left are already covered by the cases you just mentioned.</p>
<p>Btw I would have paper of truth have 3 uses and paper of lies 1 use</p>
<p>Right now the info is just as likely to be wrong as it is to be right</p>

<p>And I’m pretty sure this ability tells everybody exactly who you are, not that you exist,  and if everybody already knows who you are then you’re probably dead.</p>

            <p>Almost all abilities make you known so yes the disadvantage is not big. That’s NOT the main point to this ability. The main point to this ability is that no one will want to tell anyone if your guess is correct or not(Paper of Lies or Truth) because there is no high value to it(unless you use it on a defiled target, or on an unknown Soulcatcher while someone claims priest).</p>

            <p>the other ability’s can make it possible to figure out dead player’s original roles. The desperate search ability doesn’t seem worth using if you aren’t already known to exist and if you are then the disadvantage is meaningless. I would still make it target a living class and give their current role. It isn’t too hard to figure out there starting role from there. If a player is dead then you have effectively already used this ability on that person but now you have they’re journal. That is almost always enough info to figure out what they started as even without the day ability’s</p>

            <p>Uh no you don’t. Your archive contains all names and you can pick an <strong>original class</strong> for each name.<br>
Two are already known- You, the archivist, and the King(obviously).<br>
The rest… you have to find out.<br>
People dying makes it easier but… ehh… there are still Herbalist and promotions. Especially promotions(to the cult leader or assassin) can make a good guess(if there is no journal) straight out impossible…</p>

            <h1>The Archivist (Neutral Investigative)</h1>
<p><strong>Passive 1:</strong> The Archive: You have an archive you can use permanently until dead, but not when hung over, or defending yourself. It contains a list of all people alive and dead and you can add a starting class to each one.<br>
<em>Starting class! Not current class</em></p>
<p><strong>Passive 2:</strong> Truth upon death: When you die your archive will show up correct guesses as green and wrong guesses as red. Your direct killer gets your archive(public execution:First accuser); otherwise it is public(e.g.multiple killers, Hunter, bleed, poison)<br>
<em>This makes your life harder… claiming archivist is a death sentence unless its late game</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1:Paper of Truth:</strong><br>
Guess the starting class of your first target and send the guess to the second target. It will turn green for the second target if it is correct, otherwise it will turn red.(2 uses)<br>
*Great for getting information if this goes public. Not so great for keeping yourself hidden *</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2:Paper of Lies</strong><br>
Guess the starting class of your first target - it can be yourself - and send the guess to the second target. It will turn red for the second target if it is correct, otherwise it will turn green.(2 uses)<br>
<em>No, they can’t trust you… you can fake a class for yourself with it tho. And it still gives you info. But… it announces your presence, ofc.</em></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1:Desperate Search</strong><br>
Instantly determine the starting class type and alignment of someone who died last night or day. This will make your presence public(1 use)<br>
<em>“Hmm this person has no valid claim, was assassin, original assassin died D2 and I have no idea who this was” - this is for emergencies such as that one. Plus you cannot be occupied for this one.</em></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2:Careful Examination</strong><br>
Examine your archive carefully to determine the number of wrong guesses. If the number is 0 you will publish your archive and be convert immune for the rest of the time.(2 uses)<br>
<em>The number can tell you many things, but you still don’t know WHAT is wrong, exactly. Using 2 of them can tell you if a guess is correct or not, however… but you have only 2.</em></p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>Survive, publish a correct archive or have a correct archive upon death</em><br>
<em>Yeah survival… not easy to accomplish because no one wants your info in the enemies hands! Completing the archive is a long term task so it will not make a big difference, actually, but you still have to try it(and get a couple more wins)</em></p>
