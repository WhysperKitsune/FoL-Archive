    <description># [color=gold]**You feeling lucky? Think you&#39;re a match for The Brotherhood? Well pray tell good brother, how will you fair against us?**[/color]

This is a custom game of Forum of Lies involving my own created Faction that I have called:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4b869682b003d6113c8774fe597da0737de05da.png&quot; width=&quot;96.5&quot; height=&quot;125&quot;&gt;

# [color=gold]The Brotherhood[/color]
[color=gold]A pacifist crime syndicate looking to take over Castle Adiart using skills in bribery and deception. The Unseen and The Cult have been thwarted many times but the threat to Blue Dragon isn&#39;t over. Reports were also brought in of violent attacks on unsuspecting victims. They may have also found their way into Adiart.[/color]

All details about my Faction Suggestion are here: [[Class Suggestion] The Brotherhood](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/faction-suggestion-the-brotherhood-w-classes/1826?u=theplex)

#Rules

&gt;1. Follow The Global Forum Rules
2. Respect the host and the players

4. Keep all of your talk about the game, in the game! (But feel free to ask a Host/CoHost with questions about the game)
5. Do not screen shot any private host messages.
6. Don&#39;t try to Game throw, asking for Recruitment IS Game throwing.

#Executions

&gt;To accuse someone say &quot;/accuse [player]&quot; or &quot;/vote [player]&quot;

After the votes are revealed, the King has 24 hours to choose to allow or veto the vote, if the king does not respond the vote is allowed.
Executions end the Day
Trials pause the counter

            <p>As for the BH, I think for forum games it’s a great faction.  I wonder if it could work on the game though because it requires a lot of communication between the members. It was frustrating there was no abilities to kill but that’s what made it more fun for me.  I especially liked the order of classes I went through.  In case anyone is interested Icibalus started out as princess but when I took over I was already converted. Every princess result I gave was me making it up.</p>

            <p>Also, I wish I had gotten to defend myself when I was lynched.  I didn’t get to because the combo of my computer/network card not working and I was really busy with work.  Also, the night before I had asked Insanity if Aftertech was his merc.  I never got an answer so I was hoping he was when I admitted to being BH.  I didn’t have enough info to play that day correct.  <em>shakes her fist at her network card</em></p>

<p>also I’m not mad about losing but I’m fucking pissed about the fact that every time I’m evil I get executed for stupid shit like “the other knight claim didn’t have blood” that’s fucking dumb</p>

            <p>Having a Merc on an unknown/unclaimed player is not worth the risk. Both of you could have been BH for all we knew. You had reason to claim - it wasn’t a random demand. It being Day 2 is a cop out. And the fact you didn’t claim was a red flag.</p>
