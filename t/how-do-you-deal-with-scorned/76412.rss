    <title>How do you deal with scorned</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/how-do-you-deal-with-scorned/76412</link>
    <description>My question is here, how you do deal with scorned. 

saying Scorned is detrimental to the Blue dragon is not fake. 
By disguising people and framing invest, the scorned can do a lot of damage  to a court. 
However, one thing to keep mind, the Scorned cannot frame the king.   

personally. I prefer to let scorned live. and order frame on people I believe to be evil.
in though even, a scorned can make the good king win vs 2 evils. 

but multiple people prefer to just remove   scorned. they messed up invest. 
like invest are needed to find evils</description>

            <p>If you wanted to get someone executed but you have to find out he’s kinda confirmed BD, you can just choose to frame someone else. And you can choose to frame already suspicious people (that’s probably even the best strat since they get probably invested). I think in my last scorned game I won because I framed the NK and the Assassin.</p>

            <p>Because of the Good king.<br>
As Scorned. you can frame anyone.<br>
but you cannot frame a target that the Good king will not find acceptable.</p>
<p>Like I said. Evils are generally not interessed in Trials, they often prefer quiet game, where there is few trials.</p>
<p>I always had this problem as Scorned. I have a good target, but the only way to reveal them is claim scorned and no one want to hear that claim.</p>

            <p>Yeah. any neutral want to side with other neutrals.   but as Scorned, you want your target executed in Trials.  and Evils, nk, unseen and Cult, they are not interessed in Trials.   Plus if you frame a confirmed trials. you can say good bye to your execution.<br>
Framing suspicious target will give more chance to win.</p>
<p>When you want trials. the BD is the faction that generate the most trials.</p>

            <p>Key word there is “<strong>could</strong>”</p>
<p>The scorned <strong>could</strong> help the Blue Dragon, but unlikely. The scorned <strong>could</strong> help the Unseen/Cult, more likely. Or the scorned <strong>could</strong> help the neutral killer and other neutrals, most likely. Why take the chance of who the scorned is going to side with? Once the scorned wins they have no loyalty or allegiance to anyone so they will probs either side with unseen/cult or Neutral killer.</p>
<p>Scorned is a neutral evil and it’s goals do not align with the blue dragon. If you have a neutral evil in jail with 3 executes left. It <strong>is</strong> better to kill them and get the confusion out of the way. Rather than be the <strong>nice</strong> player and generously free the scorn d when they can turn on you.</p>

            <p>Well, I know how it seems in the first place, but I wrote down my reasons for it, and I won a few games because of that. Scorneds aren’t dangerous enough to be a real threat, but if you can make them to your allies, they are really helpful.</p>
