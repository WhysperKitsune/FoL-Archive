    <title>Streamer Mode and some tidbits</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/streamer-mode-and-some-tidbits/4687</link>
    <description>This is a suggestion of how I would make streamer mode just for minimalising stream sniping. It also covers what streamers should probably be doing if they want their identity hidden.

Always remember to report stream snipers

Journals will still reveal roles. But don&#39;t trust a streamer because of their journal. (Marshall can also find out if the streamer is in their game by checking journals)

**Streamer Mode Should Have:**
* Smaller Hud (allowing covering stuff to be easier)
* Nametags Removed
* The ingame role guide doesn&#39;t default to your role when clicked on.

**Streamer Mode Should Possibly Have:**
* Blank room that you are alone at night in (so other unseen won&#39;t be sniped and so jails aren&#39;t public to streamsnipers).
(this one should be toggleable)

**Streamers Should Cover:**
* Portrait and name under portrait (technically identity)
* Chat logs
* Abilities and who they are used on
* Player list (so if Unseen/Cult. Other teammates don&#39;t get called out on it)

Feel free to add any suggestions. I haven&#39;t tried streaming this game because Australian internet is shit.

As said by the community, streams are the most fun when the viewer has all the information.</description>
