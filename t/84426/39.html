          <p>Bank<br>
(outside)<br>
<em>Outside of the doors of the bank, there is a gargoyle with a chipped face. It appears to be attached to some form of fountain, but although its mouth is open as if it were a water spout, no water is coming out.</em></p>
<p>(inside)</p>
<p><em>In the bank, you find what looks to be a  record of deposits for an American businessman named Nicodemus Hext. Next to the deposits are a pile of beads sitting in front of a gargoyle - a bright red bead, a dull orange bead, a faded yellow bead, a chipped green bead, a sky blue bead, and a deep purple bead.</em></p>
<p>$65,261 - rent from the Johnsons<br>
$10 - lemonade stand<br>
$64,206 - speaking fees at the banker’s conference<br>
$10 - found on the ground<br>
$1,027,565 - poker winnings<br>
$48,813 - sold Netflix stock</p>
<details>
<summary>
Solution</summary>
<p>Taking each amount as a decimal number and converting it to hex code (this is heavily clued for by the name of the businessman), you get the phrase ‘feed a face a faded bead.’ Solving this puzzle requires feeding the faded yellow bead to the gargoyle.</p>

<p><em>The garden has several plots of land marked out by wooden dividers. As you enter the garden, you step onto a brand-new welcome mat with a smiling pig printed on it. In the upper left corner of the garden, there is a pile of gardening supplies.</em> [the pile can be inspected with normal, non-puzzle-solving actions and contains a <s>shovel</s> (Wazza), a <s>spade</s> (kat), <s>a watering can, gardening gloves, mulch, and several varieties of seeds</s> (Jane).*</p>

Solution</summary>
<p>This one is pretty simple. The different wooden plots spell out ‘DIG UNDER THE MAT’ in Pigpen code, with the flowers taking the place of dots. Digging under the mat finds <s>a wooden chest containing a small vial of sparkling blue liquid, that once consumed gives a permanent +1 bonus to all stats</s> (found by Mist)</p>

          <p>Library Puzzle (only activated if somebody says to search the entire library):</p>
<p><em>Walking around a corner in the labyrnthine network of shelves and occasional stairs making the library somewhat reminiscent of an M.C Escher painting, you enocunter a strange sight- a steel device that looks almost like a cash machine, with a note attatched to it:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I am SICK of this. I am BLOODY SICK of this. So, the legal department sets me a Last Will. This should be the easiest thing possible! I mean, wills are easy to figure out, relatively- you simply arrange the mailing of the relevant assets- occasionally the old fart is  a dramatic twat and forces you to do a “reading of the will” with all his surviving relatives, as if that’s something that actually happens. But never this.</p>
<p>So, APPARENTLY the dramatic arsehole left some books to three of his friends, right? I can’t say their names legally, so I’ll just call them Y.Y, Low, and Critic. And he’s set a bunch of convoluted conditions on who gets first pick of the books based on fucking umbrellas and other such balderdash, but nobody can remember any of the relevant fucking conditions! So, I move to declare the will null and void, before I notice a clause at the bottom of the will where he says “The will is legally executable even if the relevant information is not recalled.” But how could it be, when he’s left this fucking information:</p>
<p>Clause 1) No person who has seen me in a green tie is to pick before Low.<br>
Clause 2) If Y.Y was not in Oxford in 1920, the first chooser never lent me an umbrella.<br>
Clause 3) If Y.Y or Critic has second choice, “Critic” comes before the one who first fell in love.</p>
<p>I was not trained for this. Which is why I’m leaving you this note, Mr. Librarian. You’re better at this sort of thing than me. Sort it out, before I fucking strangle this man’s corpse.</p>
<ul>
<li>William Prospero</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Below the note is a screen and a keyboard, the screen on a very much outdated operating system, the kind so outdated and purpose-built that it would be impossible to hack. The screen reads:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><code>[Check-Out - Plays]</code></strong></p>
<p><code>Thank you for checking out a play! In order to complete your check-out, please place the manuscript in the slot below and enter your code:</code></p>
<p><code>ENTER PASSWORD: []</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As indicated by the screen, below is a slot large enough to contain most books. Given that the library contains a massive amount of works of literature and journalism even in its’ abandoned state, the book that was being checked out is probably still in there somewhere, even if it’s nowhere near the machine.</em></p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>I am a big fan of Caliban’s Will, so of course I was going to include it as a puzzle. However, since the answer is available online, I decided to add my own tiwst on the thing.</p>
<p>The book that is being checked out is <em>The Tempest</em>, which is indicated by the fact that the puzzle is called Caliban’s Will and the screen says a play is being checked out (and the name of the author of the irate note). The password is the order of picking- [LowCriticYY]</p>
<p>This one has a lot of hints, and is easy to solve if you know Caliban’s Will, but if you have not encountered the puzzle before there’s a chance that you’ll have to actually solve it, and it’ll be interesting if somebody attempts to. It’s still very much possible thanks to how blatant William Prospero is (the William is there in case somebody unfamilliar with Shakespeare comes up, since they’ll be able to infer that it might be a famous playwright with William as their first name, and there’s only <em>one</em>, really).</p>
<p>When the correct book and password is entered, the machine opens up to reveal… something.</p>

<p>This one is rather difficult and multi-staged, so we should labour it with a strong reward. Essentially, the key is the symbol and the changed motto-</p>
<ul>
<li>The changed motto is “emperor’s cipher”- in other words, ceasar shift.</li>
<li>Each segment of the symbol has its’ own message- the top says “Red tells you where to look”, the middle (in other words, the one in red)  says “IN PLACE OF ARTS MAGICAL”, the right says “Look on the starless side” (in other words, the left side (this one is mostly there to mess with anybody who tries to brute force the puzzle) and the left says “Password is original motto”.</li>
<li>The place of arts magical is the library building, pointing to the locked storage room in there.</li>
<li>The password is EPLURIBUSUNUM, the original motto indicated by the fact this is the Apotheosis of Washington.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, although by actual cryptographical standards this one is easy, I like it because it will acheive aims amenable to DR gameplay- it forces movement between locations in a manner that could become quite interesting for trials. Obviously puts prospective solvers at a greater risk of being murdered.</p>

<p>Detailed Notes:</p>

</summary>
<p>This one isn’t actually a puzzle. It’s a tiny room that can be moved into other rooms. Essentially, when you touch the IN button, it moves you and all your items into the Minature Box™. The button on the table changes the glass to become opaque, not revealing what is inside the box. But it’s one-way. Inside the box, you can still see out.</p>
<p>If you throw an item at the Inside IN Button™, it will move an item (or possibly person) within line of sight inside the box against their will. If you throw an item at the Inside Out Button™ it will move you out of the box, with the catch that in order to leave you effectively have to either pass an AGI check or give up an item. Or wait for someone to come free you.</p>
<p>In other words, this one is for murder, and murder only. And it’s going to be interesting to see if somebody finds out a way to use it.</p>
<p>It’s made of glass because some smartass is going to try and break open the box and put a regular-sized item in it. And what will happen is a disproportionately small bit of glass will break, not small enough to put an item of any meaningful size in. Because it’s actually shrank glass.</p>
<p>(Also, might put in some lore details linking it to the Homunculus Box, since they function in relatively simmilar ways.)</p>

          <p>also i think one of the rules of magic should be that all magic is inherrently tied to objects<br>
and if those objects are destroyed so is the spell</p>

          <p>Shop:</p>
<p><em>As you enter the shop, you pass through a door with a faintly shimmering blue glow inside the frame. Lining one wall is a series of trays containing threatening sharp objects, each of which has a strange cube fixed into it. This warrants further explanation. There is a large screen on the desk that is showing the following message on repeat through means of an infographic:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>HELLO</p>
<p>WELCOME TO ELDRITCH ELLIE’S MAGIC ITEM STORE.</p>
<p>You have just passed through our state of the art Product Gate™, using the latest in thaumoturgical technology to prevent unauthorised extraction of goods from the store! You may notice the black boxes implanted into all of our products. Well, the Product Gate™ won’t allow any item with a black box to exit the store <em>unless</em> they use the stamping machine next to the door to stamp the box… <strong>with blood</strong>.</p>
<p>Hah! Isn’t that fun! We have a supply of blood stamps that will last a while, but to prevent needless purchases, you will be limited to one stamping per Daily Life per person. Tap this computer’s screen if you want to see a log of extracted items  (the anonymity of the buyers will be ensured, of course).</p>
<p>Now, what is the cost of stamping? Nothing, thanks to our Buy Nothing Get One Free:tm: scheme! We hope you have fun using our <em>distinctive</em>, powerful artifacts for whatever purpose you choose to put them to!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You turn to your left, and by the door there really is the stamping machine the compuer describes. A reinforced glass tank can be seen poking out of the machine, filled to the brim with blood.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Now, what is the significance of the machine stamping the items with blood? Well, one of the rules of the game is that <em><strong>bloodstained items cannot leave the building they were stained in</strong></em> unless they are no longer bloodstained. That’s the catch. It’s a cache of strong weapons that require extra work to extract, but can potentially be very very useful indeed.</p>
<p>My plan is to have the shop contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 “melee weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>2 “ranged weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>1 “what the fuck are ici and arete doing” magic item</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is the most important, obviously. The other two will be relevant once we calculate the kill chances of various generic weapons, I guess?</p>
<p>Also, the labels on the products should big the products up unnececarily without containing anything that is <em>technically</em> a lie.</p>

          <p>Okay. I think I have it. I think I’ve figured out the lore for this one.  Obivously, since it’s DR lore it’s gonig to… faintly resemble previous ones, since there aren’t that many reasons why somebody would create a killing game, but this one was in fact created not deliberately but as the result of a failed iterative process.</p>
<p>Essentially, the game takes place in a pocket dimension called The Knot, which is gaurded by an artifact called The Bear. The Knot was filled with magical artifacts and fifteen school students; with the intent of making those Ultimates unlock full control of their magical potential.</p>
<p>The system iterated like this. You can see the exact moment things began to go wrong.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Summary</summary>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rules Of The Knot [1]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Number of Subjects: 15</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><code>There is only one way to exit the town; be selected by The Bear to graduate.</code></li>
<li><code>The Bear's grounds for seleciton in the next iteration will be based on this iteration. This detail will not be revealed to subjects.</code></li>
<li><code>After a certain amount of time has passed the iteration will end and all subjects will "Die". The "dead" subjects will partake in the new iteration, as well as clones of the ones to graduate</code></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects ran election in order to determine who deserved most to leave based on magical prowess and ability to prevent the experiment’s continuation, and one subject won the election in a landslide and graduated.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rules of the Knot [2]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Number of Subjects: 15</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><code>There is only one way to exit the town; be selected by The Bear to graduate.</code></li>
<li><code>Graduation is decided by the results of an eleciton.</code></li>
<li><code>The Bear's grounds for seleciton in the next iteration will be based on this iteration. This detail will not be revealed to subjects.</code></li>
<li><code>After a certain amount of time has passed the iteration will end and all subjects will "Die". The "dead" subjects will partake in the new iteration, as well as clones of the ones to graduate</code></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects refused to vote, giving no conclusive answer. Instead, they attempted to find the location of a magical artifact strong enough to escape. Eventually, one of them did, and managed to escape. This was treated as them Graduating, even if they violated the rules of the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rules of the Knot [3]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Number of Subjects: 15</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><code>There is only one way to exit the town; be selected by The Bear to graduate.</code></li>
<li><code>The Bear will select the one to graduate based on whoever finds and demonstrates mastery of a certain artifact first.</code></li>
<li><code>The Bear's grounds for seleciton in the next iteration will be based on this iteration. This detail will not be revealed to subjects.</code></li>
<li><code>After a certain amount of time has passed the iteration will end and all subjects will "Die". The "dead" subjects will partake in the new iteration, as well as clones of the ones to graduate</code></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects were cooperative this time. A subject found this aritfact and managed to graduate legitimately.  In particular, he succeeded due to finding the designated artifact first them hiding it from the others.</li>

<ul>
<li>Subjects were mistrustful of one another, and did not interact for much of the iteration. This  peace was broken later in the iteration; however. An unknown subject killed another, seemingly suspecting them to have nearly mastered the artifact, in a vain attempt to save their own life. The remainder of the loop was spent attempting to find this killer, and an attempted trial to find them did not stop them from completing the artifact quest. They were prevented from graduating by a last-minute enchantment due to the amoral way of reaching their goal.</li>

We did not feel that the only remaining student was worthy of graduation, given that they were the murderer from the previous iteration, and thus prevented their graduation.</li>

</details>
<p>Essentially, the Mastermind remembers every previous loop and has long since given up on escaping. Their only goal now is to make the loop so miserable that the scientists on the outsifde have no choice but to stop the loops, not aware that they have no control over the Knot anymore.</p>
<p>The scientists are tryng to send in limited pieces of information in order to identify the Mastermind, but the test is double-blind and they don’t know who has graduated or who did the killings, only certain details of the simulations.</p>
<p>I’ll probably send details of the past murders the Mastermind has supposedly committed as part of the stuff for the Final Trial, like what we did with AZ Raphael in DR3.</p>
<p>Not sure how we’ll reveal this; I do like the file detailing the iterations but that should be a bombshell for Chapter 5, I think. But I think it’s a good bit of lore to work off of.</p>

<p>ok I’m going to focus on making interesting puzzles and then I can figure out what the puzzle rewards are once we have puzzles</p>
<p>Records room</p>
<p><em>You find an aged diary that seems to have belonged to an archivist, describing the details of their job. Most of the pages have been damaged by water, but a few entries are legible.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>March 2nd</p>
<p>At last, I’ve obtained a position at the Archive. My first day is today, and I can’t wait! Ever since I was a child, I had dreamed of working here, surrounded by the records of bygone times.</p>
<p>April 7th</p>
<p>Bad news today. I received a letter from the governor of the prefecture. He says that there isn’t enough funding to support the research project that we’re trying to conduct on Shakushain’s Revolt.</p>
<p>June 27th</p>
<p>I haven’t left this archive in three days. My boss says that it’s nothing, but I know it’s here somewhere. I don’t know what will become of me if I can’t find it. All I know is that if I can discover what I seek, it will usher in a new era.</p>
<p>September 1st</p>
<p>Every day, I can feel the pressure inside me building higher. I’ve lost so much already. I have to keep going. I have to. I don’t have a choice any longer.</p>
<p>December 22nd</p>
<p>I’ve finally found something. I don’t think it’s what I’m looking for, but perhaps it can serve as a point of entry on the long road out of this nightmare. Today I finally went outside; I had nearly forgotten what the sky looked like. Still, when I stare at the night sky, I almost believe that I can escape from this nightmare I’ve found myself trapped in and see brighter days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Next to the diary, you see a bottle of ink and a quill pen. The last page of the diary is completely blank and untouched by water; there’s space for you to write a word in it, if you so wish.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
Solution</summary>
<p>Using the number in each date, count the words in each diary entry, and choose the [that number]th word. If you read those words, they spell out ‘Last letter of every entry.’ The last letter of every entry spells out the word ‘stars.’</p>
</details>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><em>As you write the word Stars in the diary, it immediately fades away, to be replaced by what looks like a printed photograph, slowly fading in. But what you see on the photograph is beyond horrifying.</em></p>
<p><em>Five mutilated bodies line the pavement of what looks like the Town Square. Their clothes are burnt to near unrecognisability. Ashes cover the ground. And as you look at their faces, their features have been burnt off. There is no easy way to recognise who these people are.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>One of them is surrounded by a pool of splinters, and has many cuts over their body, concentrated on their hands.</em></li>
<li>
<em>One of them, even in death, is clutching a burning piece of paper, reduced to nothing but cinder at the time of the photograph.</em><br>
<em>One of them has a piece of glass in their eye, with a little bit of melted plastic aside their corpse.</em>
</li>
<li><em>One has a few shards of ceramic next to them, all of them damp.</em></li>
<li><em>And one of them is clutching a small metal rod, covered in ash but seemingly unharmed by the explosion. The arm holding the rod is pointing towards the source of the explosion</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>All of them are now nothing but faceless dead bodies.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>So, this is potentially one of the most important documents in the game, but it is not easy to figure out. It potentially clears 5 people of being the Mastermind (we’ll have to be careful not to put in information 100% clearing people like this one. However, in order to do that, you need to be at the end of the game, <em>and to figure out that these people were holding their role items at the time of their death.</em>.</p>
<p>Solution to this puzzle:</p>
<p>Assuming these 5 to be the Mastermind’s victims in Iteration 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first body is meant to be Alison Hutchinson, holding up her snowboard against the explosion to try desperately to save herself.</li>
<li>The second is Harleck Abode, franticly leafing through the Codex Arcanis at the last moment to try and find a way to escape his death.</li>
<li>The third is Sonja Erikkson, holding the remains of some of her chemistry equippment, trying to brew some kind of potion that would make her survive.</li>
<li>The fourth is Josephine Farrierson, drinking the Elixir of Things Past out of a ceramic bowl so she wouldn’t have to feel herself burn to death.</li>
<li>And the fifth is Alison Henderson, attacking the killer with Symphone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I imagine <em>some</em> of these will be figured out, but not all of them, which is why I feel confident enought to put this in the game. Given the Final Dead Room puzzle seems the best place to put the details of the previous games, I think this one might end up being balanced.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s a shocking mystery people will want to solve from the moment they see it.</p>

Well, the Product Gate™ won’t allow any item with a black box to exit the store <em>unless</em> they use the stamping machine next to the door to stamp the box… <strong>with blood</strong>.</p>
<p>Hah! Isn’t that fun! We have a supply of blood stamps that will last a while, but to prevent needless purchases, you will be limited to one stamping per Daily Life per person. Tap this computer’s screen if you want to see a log of extracted items  (the anonymity of the buyers will be ensured, of course).</p>
<p>Now, what is the cost of stamping? Nothing, thanks to our Buy Nothing Get One Free:tm: scheme! We hope you have fun using our <em>distinctive</em>, powerful artifacts for whatever purpose you choose to put them to!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You turn to your left, and by the door there really is the stamping machine the compuer describes. A reinforced glass tank can be seen poking out of the machine, filled to the brim with blood.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Now, what is the significance of the machine stamping the items with blood? Well, one of the rules of the game is that <em><strong>bloodstained items cannot leave the building they were stained in</strong></em> unless they are no longer bloodstained. That’s the catch. It’s a cache of strong weapons that require extra work to extract, but can potentially be very very useful indeed.</p>
<p>My plan is to have the shop contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 “melee weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>2 “ranged weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>1 “what the fuck are ici and arete doing” magic item</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is the most important, obviously. The other two will be relevant once we calculate the kill chances of various generic weapons, I guess?</p>
<p>Also, the labels on the products should big the products up unnececarily without containing anything that is <em>technically</em> a lie.</p>

</aside>
<p>Item A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eldritch Ellie’s Sparkling Sporknife</strong></p>
<p><em>For cannibals and people who like LARPing as cannibals, this weapon will allow you to truly understand the Cannibal EXPERIENCE.</em></p>
<p>Attack bonus: +40%</p>
<p>Has two prongs attatched to it, as well as the distinctive Shop Cube that won’t let you remove this item from the shop unless stamped with blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item B:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eldritch Ellie’s Hungry Hungry Hammer</strong></p>
<p><em>SPLOINK</em></p>
<p>Attack Bonus: +30%.</p>
<p>Looks like two steel tentacles curved around the stick in the rough shape of the hammer, with the distinctive Shop Cube that won’t let you remove this item from the shop unless stamped with blood at the back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Frightening Freddie’s Kunai Gun</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy shit.</em></p>
<p>Attack bonus: +40%</p>
<p>Can only fire projectiles shaped exactly like kunai. Has a Shop Cube implanted in it, preventing it from leaving the Shop unless stampted with blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item D:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Frightening Freddie’s Ridiculous Revolver</strong></p>
<p><em>If the people who made silencers weren’t idiots.</em></p>
<p>Attack Bonus +0%.</p>
<p>Contains two bullets; makes no sound when shot. Has a Shop Cube implanted in it, preventing it from leaving the shop unless stamped with blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item E:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alarming Alan’s Larceny Linament</strong></p>
<p><em>Well, this shouldn’t have any negative consequences.</em></p>
<p>Potion. When drank, gives you the ability to walk through a single wall on the map before wearing off. Also wears off after 5 minutes. Only contains a single dose; bottle vanishes once drank.</p>
<p>Bottle has a Shop Cube implanted in it. Cannot be removed from Shop until the Shop Cube is stamped with blood. In addition the bottle cannot be opened inside the shop, thanks to location tracking technology.</p>
