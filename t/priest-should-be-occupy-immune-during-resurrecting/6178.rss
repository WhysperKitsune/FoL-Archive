    <title>Priest should be occupy immune during resurrecting?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/priest-should-be-occupy-immune-during-resurrecting/6178</link>
    <description>There is sometimes this discussion in chat during a day, that someone claims Priest and is told to revive somebody to prove it, but ofc bad people listen to it too and occupy him, so Prince cannot revive and dies to treason next day. This is a little stupid I think, Priest should be able to perform his only real action during the whole game.</description>

            <p>I think it might be reasonable if Priest isn’t occupy immune, but if they are occupied while trying to ress they don’t lose the ability, either.  That way it can be stopped, but a rando occ by a butler doesn’t screw them over, either.  It seems like most players don’t understand that they don’t have to use an ability every night, judging by the number of day 1 noble cries.  Or maybe the playerbase just needs to learn.</p>

            <p>Also screw the hours argument, that has been one of my pet peeves for years.</p>
<p>While I can see where more hours may help, it does not directly correlate with game balance knowledge in any way. Suggestions should be judged on their merit, not how much of a life the person suggesting it doesn’t have.</p>

            <p>I think it depends on the situation.  Outing Prince or Priest pre-ress can be bad, yes.  At the same time though, if the investigatives aren’t getting hits, forcing claims is the only thing you can do.  The alternative is to sit around and be picked off at night.  Forcing roles <em>might</em> lose you the game, doing nothing <em>will</em>.</p>
<p>Also, Priests shouldn’t be holding their ress all game, either. Some priests refuse to ever ress anyone but the Prince, which is a misplay.  While it’s nice to get a ress on Prince the longer the game goes the less likely you are to get a ress off and the more value you get out of the ress because you had an extra BD for more days and nights. I’m not saying to always ress the first BD who dies either, but it’s definitely give and take and part of playing Priest right is knowing when to ress.</p>

            <p>Don’t you think that, most of the times, the reckless role outings from BD are those who ruin the games?<br>
How many times did the king ask for “everyone’s role” and people start posting logs publicly without even having a clue if the king is good or bad?</p>
<p>I mean, why would a priest out his role in the first place?</p>
<p><em>Don’t make me out my playtime now please, I have way less, just making assumptions based on what I’ve seen so far <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></em></p>

            <p>don’t try to flout how many hours you have when you don’t have that many.</p>
<p>More hours does not prove your point. CW can make 2 PLAYERS OCCUPY IMMUNE! If the BD doesn’t lynch every CW claim, priest will be fine.</p>

            <p>If we are talking numbers I have 260 hours. It shouldn’t have any bearing here. So by your logic I know more than you</p>

            <p>Oh, we get to pick the variables when arguing about if something is common or not? Well in that case:</p>
<p>Fool is pretty under powered since 100% of the games in which you die as fool night 1 you lose without any ability to do anything.  I mean, sure <em>overall</em> you don’t die as fool night 1 very often, but see, I’m only talking about the games where you do, and in <em>those</em> games, I lose as fool 100% of the time, so obviously it’s a problem, right?</p>
