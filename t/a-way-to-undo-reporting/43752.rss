            <p>reports are judged by humans… so yeah while you should try to avoid mistakes to make their jobs easier, if your description is good they are most certainly going to see the real offender when they look at the report, and almost certainly see what you were really talking about.</p>

            <p>When reporting someone, you have to file out the reasons and type a description!<br>
There’s plenty of time to just undo who you’re reporting, isn’t there<br>
Unless you don’t realize for such a long time and submit everything too quickly.</p>
<p>When reporting always make sure you’re reporting the correct person.</p>
