            <p>Shhhh I love all of the abilities like i said - the nonsense one being my favorite :). I just don’t see how they could work together. All I could see the drawings being used for would be to troll people. Like getting a death note when you die is oftentimes. They’d know it means absolutely nothing because the child can’t gather info on its own and is neutral.</p>
<p>An suggestion would be to allow him to draw on (or edit) people’s logs? So when they die he can cross out names, add info (useful or not) or just doodle. Kind of like Fool type play but withlogs instead of voting</p>
<p>Maybe a passive could be that he can’t write in any journal (i.e. type info), but can only draw. (this means his as well as others)That actually sounds real interesting. Not sure what purpose it would serve lol. Probably none. Just spitballing</p>

            <p>The second ability doesn’t really have any potential for sharing information as your current iteration of “the child” has no way of gathering information. I don’t think there is a neutralinvestigative role in game yet though so this could be interesting If that’s what he was</p>
<p>I feel the abilities would need to be tweaked to work more in tandem in order for him to provide information. Either he is providing information or just… spouting nonsense to people? If his goal is to survive till the end well… I don’t predict a high win rate for him with those abilities. He can only save himself twice?</p>
<p>Love the concept of all of the abilities - just not sure if they would “mesh” well on one character</p>
