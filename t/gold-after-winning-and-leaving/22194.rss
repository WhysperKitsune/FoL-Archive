    <title>Gold after winning and leaving</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/gold-after-winning-and-leaving/22194</link>
    <description>Can we get our gold sent to us in the mail after leaving a game that you ultimately win. At the very least offer a seriously better reward for sticking around. This could be more gold than if you left by like 100% or something BUT then you have to make the gold not pointless too. As it stands now cosmetic don&#39;t mean shit. Rarely I execute somone for my animation. And only one outfit looks good. Maybe we can spend gold to increase our RNG chance to be a class we pre select from a list in one or so games. 

Example: 
I spend 100 gold to increase my chance of being a sorcerer on my next game by 3% and it can be stacked by multiplying. You can have a priority list of say three classes or class type and you csn distribute your gold or percentage accordingly.

Maybe we can buy preset deathnotes slots or extra log book pages with the gold.

In game I would likento buy a button that can look at a random persons private logs for like 5k gold. 

Maybe we can have a gold betting system while in dead chat to where we bet against each other on who will die or who is evil or inking is good or bad. Make death chat interesting and interactive.</description>

            <p>Then chances are good that you will leave regardless, unless you get precisely the conditions you want… which is kind of a non-starter convo<br>
If the goal tho is to host a constructive dialogue about how to improve a player’s experience post-execution, it’s a good topic - and I think there are many many diff ways it could be done. I’m p easily entertained myself but I wonder what others would find engaging to keep them in game (?)</p>

            <p>I’m leaving no matter what tbh. Sitting dead chat sucks badly. It’s boring as he’ll and is more frustrating and toxic than being alive. You have no control and morons are morons.</p>

            <p>So<br>
2. If you are publicly dead, and have already won or lost, you may leave the game; you will not lose your gold when doing so(EXCEPTION: You are defiled).<br>
If you are dead, and your death was announced publicly and correctly, you can leave as the following classes:<br>
1.Neutral King<br>
2.Alchemist<br>
3.Fool<br>
4.Scorned<br>
5.Inquisitor<br>
6.Sorcerer<br>
7.Reaper<br>
8.Possessor<br>
You may leave as the following class only if your contract has died:<br>
1.Mercenary<br>
You may not leave as Blue Dragon.<br>
You may not leave as Cult.<br>
You may not leave as Unseen.<br>
You may not leave if you were defiled.</p>

            <p>Best plan: if you leave before winning (or dying as a Neutral role that needs to survive to win), you get 0 gold.</p>

</aside>
<p>then people will just start using word documents<br>
the whole point of private notes is they can’t be read, also devs don’t want anything that increases your chance of winning to cost gold</p>

            <p>How about a minigame where the first person to successfully guess everyones class gets extra gold. It wouldn’t tell you if your guess was right until the end but it would get you more invested in the discussion.</p>

            <p>Or maybe more incentive to engage socially if we’re stuck in the graveyard for most of a game?<br>
I would guess the % of players who die n1 to random kills and stay through a 12-day game is quite low.<br>
What if players had something to do after death besides argue, like a random doodle pad or some simple minigame where we could win +gold in spite of our team’s loss or victory (sort of like the idea behind the death gambles, but more interactive with one another)? I mean even a tic-tac-toe board would be preferable to thumbs up butts &gt;&gt;</p>
