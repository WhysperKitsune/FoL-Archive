    <description>Hypnotist (Neutral Investigative) 

_Day Ability 1:_
**Sleep** - Put a player to sleep for the day [2 uses]

_Night Ability 1:_
**Gaze** - Determine a player&#39;s faction [unlimited]

_Night Ability 2_ 
**Hypnotize** - Convert a player to the opposite faction. No effect on neutral players. [2 uses]

**Lore:**
The hypnotist is a sneaky traveling salesman who can make anybody believe what he says is true. He uses this ability to get people to buy snake oil. He can get away with anything.

**Win Condition**: Survive

**Comments:**
There isn&#39;t a neutral investigator yet. I was trying to come up with ideas for neutral classes people would want to keep around. I think it would be really powerful to turn an unseen/cult member back to the good side.</description>

            <p>Those are kinda the examples I’m worried about - Alch (and to a lesser extent Merc) are often treated as kill on sight because they’re regarded as being more problematic to BD than they’re usually worth.</p>

<p>That’s a good point. What if Hypnotize makes you drowsy and you can’t speak for 2 days?</p>

<li>It wouldn’t work and it would tell you why.</li>
<li>To help whatever side he’s allied with win. Similar to the Alchemist.</li>
<li>Because he can be a valuable member of their team as long as he’s on their side. Similar to Alchemist/Merc/etc.</li>

            <p>I think hypnotise should be able to switch a targets class to a specified BD class.<br>
Doesn’t work with unique classes (you cannot change ___ into a Prince for example. You also can’t make the Prince a ____.)<br>
Only works on Blue Dragon.</p>
<p>It’d help with your surviveability too, you can turn a Noble into a Physician. Then use ask that Physician to heal you.<br>
(or you can help Unseen and turn someone such as a Knight into a Drunk)</p>
