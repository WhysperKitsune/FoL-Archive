            <p>You can superficially act somewhat BD.</p>
<p>But you wouldn’t genuinely try to help BD.</p>
<p>Neutral King can do it because in the event that the help he provides makes scum lose he can just… not do the betrayal.</p>

<p>B: Neutral King sides with Evil - Why not just spawn an Evil King to the same effect?</p>

            <p>First of all it means the Neutral King doesn’t actually add anything meaningful, since at that point they may as well just spawn as a faction and act like that faction that way.</p>
<p>Second of all it means that in a turbo setting they are impractical to scumread. Since the difference between a BD King and a Neutral King that is currently helping BD is extremely tiny. On a forum spotting it might be plausible, but not in a turbo setting where people often struggle to even scumread regular scum.</p>

            <p>It really doesn’t.</p>
<p>At any given moment a competent neutral king will be playing like one of the other 2 Kings depending on who he wants to win.</p>

            <p>That means you don’t have to purely rely on scumreading elected Kings, since the BD would need to already be convinced beforehand into electing them, at which point mechanical information was still a thing that can be used, fact checked and manipulated.</p>
<p>Also it’s impractical to prevent elected neutral kings from existing, whereas removing starting neutral king is very easy seeing as we already did it.</p>
