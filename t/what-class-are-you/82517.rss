    <description>What Class Do You Identify As?

Ok so I’m still new to forums as most of you know, and I just thought of this fun little idea. Basically, just tell me what class you are. Which class represents you the most or summarizes you the best for the rest of you guys? You can also just pick your favorite class or the class you would want to roleplay/act as the most I don’t know. This is purely for fun I guess and maybe for a way to get to know all of you better. I don’t really care tho if this blows up or dies down, tis the way of the forums.

No rules really… any class from Throne of Lies, Forum of Lies, SFoL, Custom-Made Classes, Classes from GI, etc. Just make sure you add in what faction you are a part of as well, whether it be Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult, Neutral, Neutral Killing, uhhhh something something Red Dragon I think… idk what other factions exist lel.

~~I hope no one else had the same idea as me though this would suck then~~

Preferable Layout (You don’t have to follow this and I won’t judge for it)
[Your Name], The [Insert Class Here]
[Faction] [Class Type]
*Add Description or whatever you want*

Example:
Intensify, The Illusionist
Unseen Social
Needs professional help 24/7 about trust issues</description>
