    <title>Clicking Leave in queue when lobby reaches 16 players causes freeze</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/clicking-leave-in-queue-when-lobby-reaches-16-players-causes-freeze/36302</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
1. Clicked leave.
2. The lobby happened to reach 16 players and start the game right as I left the queue.
3. My game froze, no crash. Did not join the started game or leave the queue.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
1. Either I should have left the queue, or the game should have started with me in it, with no freeze.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Leave a game right as it hits 16 players.
