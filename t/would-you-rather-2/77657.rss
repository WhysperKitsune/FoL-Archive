    <description>Death has became bored again and decided to play another game.

He has came up to you and told you this.

There’s two guys right now. You need to choose which one dies.

The first guy killed thousands of people in the past, however in the future is going to reform his life and become a millionaire helping homeless people.

The second guy is a millionaire helping homeless people, however in the future will kill thousands of people

Who would you kill?</description>

<p>Anarchism is not anti-government, it is anti- <em>statist.</em>  If people govern themselves like anarchism calls for then, yeah, that’s the system of  <em>government</em>  they have but they would be  <em>stateless.</em>  There is a distinction.</p>

            <p>People insult others over the internet for god knows what reasons. People murder people for breaking up with them. People do stupid stuff for no conceivable reason. People will do stuff because they can do it. If people murder people today for selfish reasons with all the laws and stuff we have, what prevents them from being imperfect in your society.</p>
<p>As well you are wrong on the cop part. Cops do keep things peaceful by stopping people who break the law.</p>

<p>Yes, a group with the same rights, benefits and influence as those outside of the group. It changes nothing. “Mob mentality” depends from some degree of hierarchy, being those the cultural, social and economical effecs stated in the very link you sent me.</p>

</aside>
<p>No one has to gain with these lynches because there is no reason to lynch people, they won’t commit most of the crimes that depends from capitalism to happen. If you considerate the crimes that happens because of mental disorders, said people will either go to rehab or banished from said community. If you don’t follow the rules you will not be any part of this society. This concept of punishment, however, depends mostly from the government made. People can change it, it is just the most acceptable one.</p>

</aside>
<p>The people who have nothing to gain with it being chaotic? I mean, suppose you are on an anarchistic community where everything works fine, then you and the rest decide to rob what you already have, throw fire into things and idk kill some people<br>
Nothing stops you and nothing would even in non anarchist societies lol the difference is the way we would treat it, stated above</p>
<p>It is not like cops indeed keep things peaceful, it uses the same fear resource you were complaining on religion moments before</p>
