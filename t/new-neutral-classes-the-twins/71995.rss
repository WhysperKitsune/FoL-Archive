    <description>**Stabby Twin** (Neutral Killer)

Passives:
**&quot;Playing Together&quot;**: You spawn together with a Burning Twin. You know who each other are and meet together at night to talk and &quot;play together&quot;, to decide on how to win the game. If you would die for any reason, your sister becomes the Stabby Twin. You are both immune to conversion.

**&quot;Fake Tears&quot;**: If you would be executed by the Prince at night, instead you stab the prince and cause him to die. If you kill your twin with **&quot;Let&#39;s Have Fun!**, you will be immune to death at night until the end of the game.

----------------------------------------------------------

**Day Ability 1: &quot;Gimme That!&quot;**
Steal your siblings torch and swap classes with them. If both twins use this, nothing happens but the cooldown still activates.
You become the Burning Twin. (Infinite Uses with 2-Day Cooldown).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Night Ability 1: &quot;Let&#39;s Have Fun!&quot;**
Stab a player. They will die tonight. If you target your twin with this, you will be immune to death till the end of the game.


**Night Ability 2: (Not MY Sister!)**
Protect your sister for one night, dying to kill any attackers who would threaten her life. Bypasses night immunities and empowered abilities. (1 use.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Win Conditions: Standard Neutral Killer
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Burny Twin** (Neutral Offensive)

You are both immune to conversion.

**&quot;Orphan&#39;s Burning Wish&quot;** : You are immune to redirection and prevention. If someone is prevented do to this ability, they will not be told.

-----------------------------------------------

**Day Ability 1: &quot;Gimme That!&quot;**
Swap your torch with your sisters knife. If both Twins use this, nothing happens but the cooldown still activates.
You become the Stabby Twin. (Infinite Uses with 2-Day Cooldown)

**Day Ability 2: &quot;Quiet Sis!**
Whispers are hidden between you and your Twin, but neither of you can whisper to anyone else for the rest of the day. (2 uses)

----------------------------------------------------


**Night Ability 1: &quot;Playing with Fire**

The court will be told this happens the following day. Cannot target the King.(3 uses)

**Night Ability 2 : &quot;Play with me!&quot;**
Force someone to target you. Bypasses immunity.
---------------------------------------------------------
Win Conditions: The Stabby Twin wins the game. You do **NOT** need to survive.
---------------------------------------------------------

**Lore: Playing with Knives**

&quot;Hey sis? Mother&#39;s really gone right?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;I miss her. She always played with us.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to find someone who can play with us again?&quot;
&quot;Okay. What about those adults over there? They look like they can take a few stabs.&quot;
&quot;Aren&#39;t those the ones who wanted Mother dead?&quot;
&quot;We should teach them how to really kill. Don&#39;t you agree Sis?&quot;
&quot;As much as this one was easy to kill.&quot;
   As the two girls walked, a pool of blood chased them towards the grand hall, escaping from a guards neck, each step soaking the carpet a darker shade of crimson.
The two turned to each other, as if looking into a mirror, before they said in unison : 

&quot;They&#39;ll be seeing Mother soon.&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------

Over my time playing ToL, I&#39;ve been kinda sad because there were no classes that actively swapped each other out to shift alibis or abilities, so this one has been on the backburner in my mind. I also think a neutral killer that has someone supporting them could be a unique twist on the formula, even if it needed to be tweaked heavily. Lastly, I wanted the gameplay of each Twin to be different enough so that there would be a reason to swap them, yet still not trying to make them over powered. (Originally, I was going to have **&quot;Fake Tears&quot;** just be night death immunity, but i think the prince needs to be punished for mindlessly exeing neutral classes.)

Feedback is wholeheartingly welcomed, I want to improve this to be playable in the game,(or at least something similar), if the devs look at this and go,&quot;Wow, this could be something.&quot;.</description>
