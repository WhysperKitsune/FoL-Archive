    <title>Neutral CW Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/neutral-cw-suggestion/55355</link>
    <description>I have heard the suggestion of a neutral class that gets unlimited tornadoes like the old CW. It would be like the alch where all he has to do is live to the end of the game.

For his second ability you could keep it the same, give him a killing ability like alch, or give him something different. 

This would be seperate from the new CW rework</description>
