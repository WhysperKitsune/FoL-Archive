    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaper-left-with-court-wizard-and-game-wass-auto-draw/32634</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was playing the reaper.
Me and the court wizard were  the only ones who left alive in the game. The game ended as draw
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Any natural killer should win at 1 vs 1 unless its the prince or the king.</description>

<p>The old Tornado wasn’t affected by occupy immunity, so yeah it’s definitely a leftover from before the latest patch.</p>

            <p>I guess it’s a leftover end-game rule from the old court wizard with infinite swaps, since it’d be impossible to kill old CW in that situation</p>

            <p>Was in a game today with the same scenario except poss v. CW.  I just think they haven’t updated auto end scenarios to account for changes to CW.</p>
<p>I also had a scenario where I was MM against a possessor, and the game ended with possessor win.  I think it should have ended as a draw given MM is night immune.</p>
