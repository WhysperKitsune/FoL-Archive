    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-arena-master/1799</link>
    <description>**[color=#FF287D]Arena Master[/color] (Neutral Special)**

The [color=#FF287D]Arena Master[/color] is a &quot;special&quot; type neutral that enjoys watching others fight.
The [color=#FF287D]Arena Master[/color] cannot be converted.

Goal: Have your champion win 3 games. (They can be different champions)

This role is unique.

Kills by the [color=#FF287D]Arena Master[/color] will be annouced as such: **&quot;x was killed in the Arena.&quot;**

Passive: Conditioning of the Arena
You and your champion are immune to death at night and from being occupied. Your champion is notified of their status. You and your champion may chat at night.

Day 1: Coercion of Champions
If you don&#39;t have a champion, select someone to be your champion.

Day Ability 2: Forced Participation
Your next use of Enter the Arena will have the fight occur the same night. - 2 uses

Night Ability: Enter the Arena
Choose a player to fight your champion tomorrow night. The loser dies. This does NOT count as a roleblock. (Winner based on role list.)

[color=red]Offensive[/color] loses to [color=#25EDF2]Defensive[/color].
[color=#25EDF2]Defensive[/color] loses to [color=green]Patient[/color].
[color=green]Patient[/color] loses to [color=red]Offensive[/color].
[color=purple]Cheater[/color] wins against any. 
[color=pink]Fool[/color] cannot be chosen as a champion or fighter, attempts to choose him will fail.

If two players are in the same category, then it will follow the fight tier list.

Bolded are unofficial classes.

[color=red]Offensive[/color]: [color=blue]Knight[/color] &lt; [color=gray]Mercenary[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Paladin[/color] &lt; [color=purple]Assassin[/color]/[color=red]Invoker[/color] &lt; [color=gray]Possessor[/color] &lt; [color=gray]Reaper[/color] &lt; [color=orange]**Demon**[/color]
[color=#25EDF2]Defensive[/color]: [color=blue]Noble[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Princess[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Court Wizard[/color]  &lt; [color=blue]Priest[/color] &lt; [color=green]The Alchemist[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Physician[/color] &lt; [color=red]Ritualist[/color]
[color=green]Patient[/color]: [color=blue]Psychic[/color] &lt; [color=blue]**Maid**[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Butler[/color] &lt; [color=red]Apostle[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Observer[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Sheriff[/color] &lt;  [color=red]Seeker[/color] &lt; [color=#43FF28]**The Electricutioner**[/color]
[color=purple]Cheater[/color]: [color=#ECEE45]**The Greedy**[/color] &lt; [color=red]**Acolyte**[/color] &lt; [color=blue]**Squire**[/color] &lt; [color=#AE3620]**The Scorpion**[/color] &lt; [color=blue]Prince[/color] &lt; [color=purple]MM[/color]/[color=red]CL[/color] &lt; [color=#FF287D]**Arena Master**[/color]

[Unofficial Classes Here](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-cards-for-forum-based-tol/249?source_topic_id=1799)

Important Info:
If the same roles fight each other, they will both live.
The Mercenary wil refuse to fight if fighting against their contract.
Cult will always lose against the Paladin.
If someone is jailed, they cannot fight.
You can cancel a battle.
**The Revenant** is at the same position as the player they are bound to.
If you are somehow forced into a fight, you will always win.

Additional ideas by the public (enter ideas here): 
Bounty recommended a different win con (fight based rather then survival based). Changed abilities to focus on your &quot;champion&quot; rather then just random fights.
Thanks to B_Psycho for the recommendations for collaboration between AM and their champion.

###Changelog:
5/25/17: Creation.
5/25/17 (Later): Revamp for balance + stability, added unofficial classes.
5/25/17 (Even later): Edited the abilities so the champion and AM could colaberate.
5/26/17: Rewording, clarity, and [color=#FF287D]color.[/color]
5/30/17: Serpent &gt; Scorpion

##To-do:
Balance the tier list 
Continue refining the class and abilities
Lore

######Stolen from this:[The Fighter](https://www.blankmediagames.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=66590). I wanted to try out a ToL version. 70% of credit goes to Malony1.

Note: This is probably not balanced. Still, it seems pretty fun to me.

So should Unseen converted roles be the same as their BD counterparts? Or should they be different?</description>

<p>The main reason for keeping the Merc in Offensive is due to the fact that I don’t want any type to have too many more then the other. The Cheater list probably has too many, tbh. If I could figure out the balancing (or if someone could help me with the balancing <em>wink wink</em>), I’d be perfectly willing to move the Mercenary to the Cheater type.</p>

            <p>The abilities are definitely a solid idea, I like the idea of the AM and champion collaborating to help each other win (or not).</p>
<p>The Serpent is from the class cards, so I’ll leave it where it is for now.</p>
<p>I’ll leave the Merc where she is for now, but I’ll consider re-balancing in the future.</p>

            <p>Hey, I think this is a great role.  However, would it be wise for it to spawn in with NK’s in the game? I don’t know. I’ve got some ideas for it.</p>
<p>I request that you add links to all unofficial classes in the bottom, though.<br>
__<br>
<strong>Day Ability: Coercion  (Changed name from Choose your Champion</strong>: You can’t passively choose a champion unless it’s random. I suggest it be changed to a day ability. Also, if both players lose, should they live? Given  that this isn’t a traditional NK, and shouldn’t be, it shouldn’t cause as much death.) (<strong>Tell me if this is too much, but could the Champion get some sort of menu to send anonymous messages to you during the day and night? In a way that they could recommend fights to make without knowing who you are, and you can talk back without revealing yourself. That way you can have 2 playstyles, which is 1) go through targets trying to find a better warrior, or 2), find easier battles for your current champion to win faster)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive: Recruit Conditioning (Changed name from Fighting Instinct):</strong> You and Your champion are immune to death at night., along with occupation. Your champion is notified of their status.</p>
<p>**Serpent:**A while back I changed the “Serpent”, fleshing it out into the Scorpion(Probably offensive or cheater), Iudex(Definitely fits in cheater), and Ritualist.</p>
<p>If this is the serpent you are referring to, I ask that you change the name.</p>
<p><strong>Mercenary:</strong> Being always armed, I think the Mercenary should be in the cheater category, and instead of killing herself, she should simply refuse to fight if told to face off against her contract.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, this is one of the best ideas I’ve ever seen, and keep up the great work</p>

            <p>I feel what would make the arena master very good is let him have a “warrior” that will fight in the arena, the “warrior” is a random player given in game. You need to make him win three fights aka choose his opponents wisely and if you let him win three fights you win the game or something to that matter. I really like this role but i don’t think they can add this any time soon.</p>

            <p>I guess “Survive until the end of the game.” would work, but it feels too passive. “Kill anyone that would oppose you.” isn’t good, though, since the Fighter is such a slow killer.</p>

<p>This role is unique.</p>
<p>Kills by the <font color="#FF287D">Arena Master</font> will be annouced as such: <strong>"x was killed in the Arena."</strong></p>
<p>Passive: Conditioning of the Arena<br>
You and your champion are immune to death at night and from being occupied. Your champion is notified of their status. You and your champion may chat at night.</p>
<p>Day 1: Coercion of Champions<br>
If you don’t have a champion, select someone to be your champion.</p>
<p>Day Ability 2: Forced Participation<br>
Your next use of Enter the Arena will have the fight occur the same night. - 2 uses</p>
<p>Night Ability: Enter the Arena<br>
Choose a player to fight your champion tomorrow night. The loser dies. This does NOT count as a roleblock. (Winner based on role list.)</p>
<p><font color="red">Offensive</font> loses to <font color="#25EDF2">Defensive</font>.<br>
<font color="#25EDF2">Defensive</font> loses to <font color="green">Patient</font>.<br>
<font color="green">Patient</font> loses to <font color="red">Offensive</font>.<br>
<font color="purple">Cheater</font> wins against any.<br>
<font color="pink">Fool</font> cannot be chosen as a champion or fighter, attempts to choose him will fail.</p>
<p>If two players are in the same category, then it will follow the fight tier list.</p>
<p>Bolded are unofficial classes.</p>
<p><font color="red">Offensive</font>: <font color="blue">Knight</font> &lt; <font color="gray">Mercenary</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Paladin</font> &lt; <font color="purple">Assassin</font>/<font color="red">Invoker</font> &lt; <font color="gray">Possessor</font> &lt; <font color="gray">Reaper</font> &lt; <font color="orange"><strong>Demon</strong></font><br>
<font color="#25EDF2">Defensive</font>: <font color="blue">Noble</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Princess</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Court Wizard</font>  &lt; <font color="blue">Priest</font> &lt; <font color="green">The Alchemist</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Physician</font> &lt; <font color="red">Ritualist</font><br>
<font color="green">Patient</font>: <font color="blue">Psychic</font> &lt; <font color="blue"><strong>Maid</strong></font> &lt; <font color="blue">Butler</font> &lt; <font color="red">Apostle</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Observer</font> &lt; <font color="blue">Sheriff</font> &lt;  <font color="red">Seeker</font> &lt; <font color="#43FF28"><strong>The Electricutioner</strong></font><br>

<p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-cards-for-forum-based-tol/249?source_topic_id=1799">Unofficial Classes Here</a></p>
<p>Important Info:<br>
If the same roles fight each other, they will both live.<br>
The Mercenary wil refuse to fight if fighting against their contract.<br>
Cult will always lose against the Paladin.<br>
If someone is jailed, they cannot fight.<br>
You can cancel a battle.<br>
<strong>The Revenant</strong> is at the same position as the player they are bound to.<br>
If you are somehow forced into a fight, you will always win.</p>
<p>Additional ideas by the public (enter ideas here):<br>
Bounty recommended a different win con (fight based rather then survival based). Changed abilities to focus on your “champion” rather then just random fights.<br>
Thanks to B_Psycho for the recommendations for collaboration between AM and their champion.</p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#Changelog:</span><br>
5/25/17: Creation.<br>
5/25/17 (Later): Revamp for balance + stability, added unofficial classes.<br>
5/25/17 (Even later): Edited the abilities so the champion and AM could colaberate.<br>
5/26/17: Rewording, clarity, and <font color="#FF287D">color.</font><br>
5/30/17: Serpent &gt; Scorpion</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#To-do:</span><br>
Balance the tier list<br>
Continue refining the class and abilities<br>
Lore</p>
<hr>
<p>#####<span class="hashtag">#Stolen</span> from this:<a href="https://www.blankmediagames.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=66590" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Fighter</a>. I wanted to try out a ToL version. 70% of credit goes to Malony1.</p>
<p>Note: This is probably not balanced. Still, it seems pretty fun to me.</p>
<p>So should Unseen converted roles be the same as their BD counterparts? Or should they be different?</p>
