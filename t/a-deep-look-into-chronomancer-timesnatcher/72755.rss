    <description>
[details=&quot;Chronomancer&quot;]
**The Chronomancer**
&gt; **Pocket Dimension** - If you die tonight, delay it for 2 nights. This will delay bleeding and
&gt; poison in addition to attacks. Deaths delayed this way cannot be redirected with Distort Reality.

^Alright Idea, giving blue dragon a death immune ability, this is obviously a way for mm to claim they had used Pocket Dimension, which i kinda like after Mastermind basically couldn&#39;t fake claim anything.

&gt; **Time War** - Delays a player’s death for 2 days. This will delay bleeding and poison
in addition to attacks. You can prevent a death multiple times. Cannot delay unhealable attacks or suicide.

^So a mix of Knight/Physician, it&#39;s a weaker of both which I like more claiming for unseen is good, but I  mean if you are going to make a class that unseen should be allowed to fake claim then this kinda ruins it since you can heal somebody which if you don&#39;t immediately outs yourself, but I can see this being a fun fake claim
&gt; 
&gt; **Distort Reality** - Redirect a player’s death you prevented with Time Warp to another player. Can be healed and does not bypass death immune

^Good idea honestly, but how would this work in game this just adds some heavy RNG as you would have to predict that they would be attacked, this would probably work better as a Timesnatcher though allowing you to protect unseen, but ok ability.

Overall Rating - 6/10
Good - Nice fake claim is always a plus, uniqueish concept.
Bad - Heavy Rng, probably more fun as a fake claim then the actual class.
[/details]






[details=&quot;Timesnatcher&quot;]
**The Timesnatcher**



&gt; **Rewind** - If you become an Assassin and have no uses of Two-For-One left, you will regain a charge.


^This is an interesting idea giving Timesnatcher another use of Two-For-One-Left but wouldn&#39;t if just be better being a day ability and giving the already existing assassin another use, but then again this is probably the best thing for Timesnatcher.

&gt; **Time Snatch** - Target a poisoned/bleeding player. Causes the poison/bleeding to speed up and kill them tonight.

^if BD are smart they will notice the person that claimed poisoned yesterday had died thus outing The Chronomancer  as being converted

&gt; **Dark Dimension** - Make the Unseen appear not suspicious to investigative abilities.

^Why? Why? Come on I know I love this game, but this is just lazy, this is a complete copy of Princess&#39;s Dark Wisp, and has no reason to be on Timesnatcher, as all other unseen abilities have a correlation with their bd counterpart, but this has obviously just been slapped on to give Timesnatcher something.

Overall Rating - 3/10 
Good: Rewind is a good unique passive
Bad: Dark Dimension has no reason to be on Timesnatcher,  Time Snatch is easily identifiable. Overall seems a boring class.
[/details]

Overall this is just my opinion and only time will tell, since they have just been added how good or bad they might be to TOL is impossible to tell rn

Opinion on the Chronomacer
[poll type=regular public=true]
* This class is perfect and fits well.
* An ok class but needs a few tweaks in order to be good
* Seems Boring
* Rubbish Class doesn&#39;t seem fun or interesting.

            <p>I have played one game of ToL recently.</p>
<p>It was with eevee.</p>
<p>He was Cult, I was BD.</p>
<p>NK won because everybody on both of our teams was playing <em>incredibly</em> poorly.</p>
<p>As was the Alchemist-turned-King.</p>
<p>I would play more but did I mention how much work I have with midterms right now?</p>
<p>Also note I’ve not been in FoL for like two months either. My time away from ToL is not due to ToL.</p>

            <p>To clarify:</p>
<p>The idea of Chronomancer isn’t one that I immediately like, but as I have literally no gameplay experience with anything comparable I cannot say I dislike it in good faith. My opinion is essentially outstanding until I have time to play with it in FoL/ToL.</p>

            <p>Wait what</p>
<p>How can you claim that the devs made Chronomancer in spite of the community when it is literally a community suggestion</p>
<p>I’m not even sure I like Chronomancer, but it is literally a community-generated idea lmao</p>
