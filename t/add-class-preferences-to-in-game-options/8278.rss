    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/add-class-preferences-to-in-game-options/8278</link>
    <description>Suggesting the addition of preference settings in the form of slider buttons be added to the game like below:
https://i.imgur.com/AklAn5e.jpg

There would be one button for each class type: 

IE: Killer [Low/Medium/High] 
Offensive [Low/Medium/High] 
Special: [Low/Medium/High]. 

Each setting would influence the odds you have to get a class from each category.This would, to a degree let people possibly play what they like, and have less chance of playing something they don&#39;t want to play.

This is much better than scrolls like some other games have for this purpose, and far less expensive.</description>

            <p>No, he already solved that issue the same way BMG did. Roll the game, then match players by preference.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of this idea at all to be honest. I’d prefer a ToS-like system, it’s much harder to cause issues with that.</p>

<p>Let’s say that by far the most popular NK is possessor. With this system in place, it’d be way more likely to have a possessor in your games</p>

</aside>
<p>Instead of choosing the Possessor as your preferred class, you’d choose the Neutral Killer. This gives a higher chance of you being any Neutral Killer, not the Possessor. Problem solved.</p>

            <p>This would damage the game in the way it is suggested here in the following way.<br>
Let’s say that by far the most popular NK is possessor. With this system in place, it’d be way more likely to have a possessor in your games, losing an aspect of social deduction and class variety. What would work instead is having the game generate the role list for a given game randomly before taking into account preferences, and afterwards match the preference lists of players to the available roles.</p>
<p>Academically speaking the random serial dictator mechanism would probably be best suited for this as something that is easy to implement, computationally efficient, strategyproof and relatively efficient. Other options are probablity serial or rank efficient mechanisms. However any heuristic solution is probably also satisfactory for ToL. Floofyboy describes one way of implementing random serial dictator.</p>
<p>I support this idea as a whole as it can only add to the game, however it might not change much, if the ToL community largely has homogeneous preferences over classes. If everyone prefers MM for example, the system cannot discriminate who should be assigned MM. If this would be implemented, data analysis can quickly make this visible by simply checking the chosen preference lists of a sample of players for similarities.</p>

            <p>Bump.</p>
<p>This should be a thing. Stating class preference wouldn’t mean you always get the classes you prefer, you’d just be more likely. You might think that some classes are universally liked or disliked, but I feel like most games would be better balanced (socially) if most people were playing classes that they actually want to play. Not everyone wants to be prince or NK or investigative or king. Someone people like drunk/butler or psychic or whatever.</p>
<p>I think it should be specifically class-based (possessor, alch, CW, hunter, etc) not type-based (killer, offensive, special, etc)</p>

            <p>They still would be. It’s just favored ‘weighting’ towards any given class, depending on their own preferences.</p>

            <p>See here is another proof this is a good idea. I prefer playing fool over reaper <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I think the ideal would be to allow us to simply rank all the roles in order from FAVORITE to less favorite. Then your “less” favorite role would pretty much never be picked (unless all other 15 players also picked that but that’s like impossible).</p>
<p>I think the algorythm for the programmers would look like this:</p>
<p>Step 1: Pick a random player out of the players that has not been assigned a class yet.</p>
<p>Step 2: Look at his favorite class that has not been picked yet.</p>
<p>Step 3: Assign that class to whoever has this class as highest rank of favorite. If there is a tie, assign it randomly among people in the tie.</p>
<p>Step 4: Go back to step 1.</p>

            <p>Really good idea! As long as there is a disclaimer that you could still get stuck playing a role you don’t like, seeing as a lot of people will prefer reaper prince MM etc and not a lot of people will prefer drunk or butler. People would have to know it’s possible to get stuck with not preferred roles. Also they should have the option for you to select ONE and only ONE neutral role for you to never get. Some people hate fool (me). Some people don’t like being alch or merc. Heck some people are awful with reaper and possessor and would love to never get those. So if you could select ONE neutral role to never get, I think everybody would love that, and it wouldn’t impact the balance of the game too much since let’s say everybody in a game had merc selected, a game without a merc is not terrible. There are always games without any given neutral role. And I guarantee you everybody has a neutral role they can’t stand at all. Being able to select 1 neutral role to never get no matter what, would be amazing.</p>

            <p>VERY good idea.</p>
<p>Yes, i expect some class to be “over prefered” and some to be “under prefered”, but my guess is we all have different preference.</p>
<p>As an example, i absolutly hate playing merc. I’m sure some people enjoy it. But i love being fool or scorned.</p>
