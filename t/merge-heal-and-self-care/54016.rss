    <title>Merge Heal and Self-Care</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/merge-heal-and-self-care/54016</link>
    <description>Why not do away with Self-Care and let Heal target self a maximum of 2 times?  Then we can give Phys another night ability to make him even more fun, like Exhume.  

I&#39;m not saying Phys isn&#39;t fun, I think the new phys feels more important with inoculate and more durable with self-care, I just think phys has a space for an extra night ability and why not use it?</description>

            <p>I’d say to not do this until after we get another ability to use instead. Self care currently is redirect immune because it doesn’t target. Your suggestion would make it not so. While a 2nd night ability is better than the self heal not being redirectable we do not have the 2nd night ability yet. Once we do then sure.</p>
