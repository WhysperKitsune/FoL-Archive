    <description>Currently it is:

&quot;Send for a servant to Privately deliver a message in the morning.&quot; 

At least for me, intuitively this means A: I do not visit the target during the night (a nameless servant does and the message gets delivered in the morning); and B:They do not know who I am.B is true, A is not - it still shows as me visiting the person who I gave the message. 

A better description (in my opinion) would be:

&quot;Slip a private message under someone&#39;s door. They will find it in the morning.&quot; 

Because it implies that you are visiting the target.</description>
