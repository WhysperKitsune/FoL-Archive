    <description>&gt; # [color=steblue]The Priest[/color]
&gt; [color=steblue]**Blue Dragon Social**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; **Shepherd (Day)** - Turn as many players as you like into sheep.  All sheep are forced to vote the same as the majority of the sheep.  You count towards the majority. (∞ uses)
&gt;
&gt;~~**Shibboleth (Day)** - Pick a password.  Anyone who uses your password in day chat becomes a follower.  When you or a follower is on trial, the votes of yourself and other followers will count twice. (∞ uses)~~
&gt;
&gt; ~~**Last Rites (Day)** - Receive the feedback of target player whenever they die.  Remains on target player until changed, like Scout.  Needs a more a generic name, I know.  (∞ uses)~~
&gt; 
&gt; ~~**Count Sheep (Night)** - Learn the number of living Blue Dragon players. (2 uses)~~
&gt;
&gt; **Grapevine (Night)** - Read all whispers from the entire match, but anonymized by hiding speaker labels and shuffling them in a random order.  ~~Maybe it should give all feedback also?~~ (2 uses)
&gt;
&gt; **Confessional (Night)** - Open up a tab for anonymous communication with scum. (∞ uses)

To illustrate the **Shepherd** ability, say 5 people vote to execute Prince while only 3 players pardon (counting your own pardon).  By herding the 2 other pardons with any single one of the executes, you force that particular execute to flip into a pardon.  So the final tally is 4 pardon and 4 executes, and Prince is saved.</description>

<p>That is a good point, it is overpowered even if it doesn’t count the King (it doesn’t matter whether it counts yourself since you would take that into account anyway).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>better noble target vote.</p>
<p>no</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not better, it’s different.  It’s harder to use but has more potential.  And it can actually backfire if misused, unlike Noble Twin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also it lacks a convert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easier to design an evil class than a balanced good one, which is why I’ve left that for later.</p>

            <p>I’d say… a deathnote that includes information is actually beneficial to your side… 1 in 50+ games. Worsening your position with a truthful information deathnote… is far more common. (assuming information as things like “X is NK” if you are unseen/cult etc…</p>
<p>In death notes that I’ve seen in the few hundred games I’ve played… 98% are just taunts, for fun, or don’t bother etc… 1.5% or so, contain information of the NK etc… and giving it to BD worsens the position of scum… .4% or so… contain information that is false maybe a 5% chance of actually improving scums position if BD buys it. Then lastly the unicorn .1% where scum leaves truthful information, BD believes it, and in following that information it improves scum’s position. it’s a hypothetical .1%, I haven’t quite witnessed it before… and can’t quite think of a hypothetical for it.</p>
<p>probably more likely to be useful for the NK than the unseen/cult. Unseen/cult should be far more threatened by BD. The NK going down early is far more likely to screw over unseen/cult than the NK living to the end imo</p>

<p>That’s like saying optimal play is for scum to never leave deathnotes, clearly not true</p>

<p>Are you saying they only happen in public day chat?  Why do you think that is the case?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what even is that day ability</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think what he’s saying is if 10 people are alive and 4 are voting for bob, Shepard could force someone else to vote for bob. So I guess it’s a weaker version of nobles force vote.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not weaker, it has more potential.  If 5 of 8 people vote execute on Prince, Priest can save Prince by [sheeping] all 3 pardons with 2 of the executes to turn the latter into pardons.</p>
<p>If you consider the [bracketed] votes as sheep in the flock (Priest’s vote counts as a sheep here), every sheep in the flock is forced to vote how the majority of the flock is voting.  Since 3 of the 5 sheeps are voting pardon, the 2 execute sheep are forced to pardon also.</p>
<ul>
<li>Priest [pardon]</li>
<li>[pardon]</li>
<li>[pardon]</li>
<li>[exe]</li>
<li>[exe]</li>
<li>exe</li>
<li>exe</li>
<li>exe</li>
</ul>
<p>A noble with twin could turn that into 4 pardons against 5 executes, but it wouldn’t be enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t dislike the confessional ability, though I would also say it’s 99% of the time likely to be useless, but could be kind of fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am more optimistic but yes</p>
