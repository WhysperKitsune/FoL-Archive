    <title>Possessor jumping to jailed target loses use</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-jumping-to-jailed-target-loses-use/22701</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was possessor and used the possess ability to attempt to jump to another. That person was jailed that night, so I got the standard message that I was prevented from visiting. After that, I could no longer use possess as it was out of uses.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The use should be refunded if it fails? At least, that&#39;s how I thought it was meant to work.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Get prince to jail someone.
2. Get possessor to use possess on the jailed person.

#### Comments:
This might not actually be a bug, but I remember this sort of thing being in the patch notes previously.</description>
