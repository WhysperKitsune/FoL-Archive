    <description>## Noble (Blue Dragon Social)

**Passive - Royal Blood** - We all know this one.

**Passive - Noble Commission** You will communicate with your felllow nobles once one of you uses the &#39;Convene&#39; ability. They will show up in chat as &#39;Noble&#39; and you will not know each one&#39;s allignment.

**Day - Convene** Send a message to every member of the Noble Commission, allowing you to communicate with them anonymously for the next night. - 2 use (May only be used by one noble, shared ability)

**Night - Influence of the Commision** - (Only usable on nights that the Nobles convene) Vote with your fellow nobles to decide whom you wish to put a scandal against. They will require one less vote to put on trial. - Infinite Uses

**Night - Lineage Test** - Investigate a player, seeing if they have Royal Blood or not - 2 uses.



----------
## Aristocrat (Unseen Social)

**Passive - Royal Blood** - We all know this one.

**Passive - Noble Commission** You will communicate with your felllow nobles once one of you uses the &#39;Convene&#39; ability. They will show up in chat as &#39;Noble&#39; and you will not know each one&#39;s allignment.

**Day - Convene** Send a message to every member of the Noble Commission, allowing you to communicate with them anonymously for the next night. - 2 use (May only be used by one noble, shared ability)

**Night - Influence of the Commision** - (Only usable on nights that the Nobles convene) Vote with your fellow nobles to decide whom you wish to put a scandal against. They will require one less vote to put on trial. - Infinite Uses

**Night - Lineage Alter** Target a player, preventing them from stepping up to become King in the following 2 days - 2 uses.

----------

Royal Commission remains a passive if a Noble is converted to an Apostle

If converted then on nights that they communicate Aristocrat/Apostle can see Unseen/Cult chat but can&#39;t post in it, and Unseen cannot see Noble chat.

(If there is one of these in the game there is gaurenteed to be 2 of them)
Please give feedback to the probably worst suggestion of them all!</description>

            <p>Yeah, I like it. Just vizier should stop them stepping up for 2 nights. Doesn’t matter if they are king or dead if they can step up on another occasion</p>

            <p>Agreed with the last point, especially as it is infinite uses.</p>

<p>I like this idea. It also makes sense since Nobles are respected and have some power to go along with them – so people would easier believe their words.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel like this ability is too strong. Preventing it for a day or two is fine… but completely seems too much, especially considering its infinite uses.</p>
<p>Edit: However I agree that having 3 appear seems a bit much.</p>
