    <title>King Types and Starting Kings</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-types-and-starting-kings/47834</link>
    <description>I love the Evil King with his ulterior motives. The power to mislead the Blue Dragon is a great one.

That&#39;s why it makes me so mad that there is only one neutral king, his only goal surviving. The neutral faction is all about differing motives.

Also, it feels lame that Scorned, Fool, Inquisitor, and Mercenary can escape their goal by becoming the King. So here is my suggestion.

&gt; **[color=green]King (Random Special)[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Head of State: All your votes for accusation count as two. Your actions do not count as visits, and you cannot be occupied or redirected. If you are the Psycho King, you are immune at night.
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Loyal Subjects: If you are executed, there will be no trial tomorrow. Good and Foolish King only.
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Failure: If your target dies, you will commit suicide. Protective King only.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Decide Fate: Determine the outcome of a trial. One use. If you are the Starting Vengeful King, you cannot use this on either of your targets. 1 use.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Offer Protection: Choose a player. They will be your target for the rest of the game. Must be used day 3 or before. Protective King Only. (Should also replace Mercenary Offer Contract)
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Guards!: Protect a player from death. If you are the Starting Good King, this will also protect against conversions. If you are the Protective King and you are using this on your target, it will prevent all visits. 4 uses, 6 for Starting King. Does not appear on Psycho King.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Fatal Guards: Kill a player. Psycho King only. Infinite uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Order Execution: Kill a player, bypassing death immunity. This action will be announced to the Court. 2 uses, starting King only.

King types:

* Vengeful King (Queen?): Crowned from Scorned. Receives two random targets if Starting, keeps targets if crowned. Scorned goal. Starting Vengeful King may not use Decide Fate on targets.

* Foolish King: Crowned from Fool. Fool goal.

* Protective King (Queen?): Crowned from Mercenary. If Starting King, chooses target, otherwise keeps their target. Protective King&#39;s guards stop all visits, though only only on their target. Guards on other people work normally.

* Cowardly King: Current Neutral King. Crowned from Alchemist.

* Inquisitor King: King, but with Inquisitor goals. Crowned from Inquisitor.

* Psycho King: Same.

My preferred Starting King type chance:

&gt; Good: 60%
&gt; Evil: 30%
&gt; Vengeful: 5%
&gt; Protective: 5%</description>

            <p>It’s not needed, by any means. But I think it would make the game more interesting.</p>
<p>There’s only one ulterior motive a King can have. I think it would be more interesting if there was a wide variety of ways Kings could act to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Also current Neutral King is boring, since it basically acts Good most of the time.</p>

            <p>I see where you’re coming from, but as per usual I remain entirely unconvinced that Scorned is necessary to serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Or, at least, if Scorned <em>is</em> necessary for that purpose, your game is <span class="bbcode-u">very</span> broken elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Note: If they are crowned after the first King dies than can use Decide Fate on targets.</p>
<p>I personally like it as it leads to distrust to who the King wants executed. Scorned serves this purpose at the non King level now.</p>

            <p>I don’t like this version of the Vengeful King, either.  I’d rather just have them not appear at the start, but be able to Decide Fate their targets - it should be a win condition for the Scorned, not something that appears at random.</p>
