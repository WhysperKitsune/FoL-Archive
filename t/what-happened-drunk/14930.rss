    <title>What happened (drunk)?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-happened-drunk/14930</link>
    <description>I was drunk, debauched someone, and I ended up getting these messages:

:You were attacked last night
-You were attacked last night, but were immune
-You were healed

Shouldn&#39;t the attack and heal come in the same message?</description>

            <p>No, if you get attacked and healed normally it comes as two different messages.</p>
