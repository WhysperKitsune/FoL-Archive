    <title>Replacement To Pity Converts</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/replacement-to-pity-converts/73800</link>
    <description>It may seem like it can&#39;t be done, with Mastermind and Cult Leader already having 4 abilities, but look at Alchemist with 5 abilities.  I think letting Mastermind use Foresight during the day should be considered.  Or, let him get feedback from Foresight instantly (bypassing prevention) and also use Convert the same night.  

And something similar for Cult Leader.

Because, anything is better than RNG.</description>

            <p>That or just start with someone preconverted, start it on cooldown, and disable the MM/CL’s abilities N1 (stacking with the cooldown so Convert is available N3)</p>
