    <title>[BUG] &quot;Connection is not secure&quot; warning for new registrants from invite</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-connection-is-not-secure-warning-for-new-registrants-from-invite/834</link>
    <description>If you recently received an email like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/97e12655095b8cc1281bc9292d2cc06edafdd42c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;349&quot;&gt;

**It&#39;s legit.** The warning looks scarier than it actually is - **just like any http sites without the &quot;s&quot; (https), if you are on a PUBLIC network, be careful when registering new accounts.** If you are at home, it&#39;s no worries. 99.999% of the time you&#39;re fine, but yea we will add the &quot;s&quot; to https soon!

We added SSL (https) to all of our sites so far except the forum. The forum is next -- but we we plan to add it in a couple weeks (after Alpha). As long as you&#39;re on a private network, there&#39;s no concern. It&#39;s the same for any http (not https) site.

**We&#39;ll add https ASAP after alpha is released ;) don&#39;t worry!**</description>
