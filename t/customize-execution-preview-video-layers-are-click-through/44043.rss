    <title>Customize execution preview video layers are click through</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/customize-execution-preview-video-layers-are-click-through/44043</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

The execution preview window is clicktrough when opening the buy gp menu. Bad thing about this is you can&#39;t close the execution preview window as the x button to close it does not work instead the buy gp content has click focus.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Either the execution preview window should close already when clicking on the buy gp button. Or not having the window be click through. so you can exit the execution preview while the buy gp is open. Or simply have the buy gp also be visually on top of the execution preview window instead of being below.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Open customize shop. click on any execution preview, click on the buy gp button.

#### Comments:

Version: 1.0.18e1

The cancel button for the buy gp is in around the middle of the preview execution screen (in Fullscreen mode. Just in case you want to close it the screen without having to forcefully close the program).</description>
