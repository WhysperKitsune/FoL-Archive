    <title>Any tips for someone who&#39;s new to this game?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/any-tips-for-someone-whos-new-to-this-game/26556</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!
I just started playing ToL today, and I&#39;m full of questions and uncertainty. 
I have read the guide and the wikia, played the short tutorial and went through the character cards, so I have an idea about how this game works. The problem is, I just tried to play my first game and I absolutely sucked :D seriously, it was awful and painful and cringeworthy :D More than anything, I just felt bad for the other players, especially since I was The Prince and it is my understanding that he&#39;s a very powerful force (which I rendered absolutely useless). It all just happened so fast and I had no clue where or how to start figuring things out.
So, my question is - what should I do? I feel really bad about ruining other peoples&#39; games, especially since all of them seemed very intelligent and experienced, coming to conclusions I haven&#39;t even thought to conceive. Should I try reading some other online guides? Are there any more resources? Is there maybe a group for &quot;n00bs&quot; such as I?
Thank you very much for any ideas or thoughts you might have on this!</description>

            <p>Thank you so much for the tips everyone :). I think I’ll just watch some playthroughs and join a few games then, and hopefully I’ll catch up soon.</p>

            <p>Yep, the best advice is to just keep playing.  Everyone was new and learning the ropes at some point. Stick around and watch games unfold and talk to dead chat about what’s going on (don’t give out info if you were evil faction). After game ends, if you did something really dumb (blew all your exe as Prince bc you killed a BD), just apologize and say you’re new and ask for tips.  Ask for tips in dead chat, as well.  Don’t stress too much.  I thought they added a thing to prevent noobs from getting heavy roles early, but I guess not.</p>

            <p>You will get the hang of it after playing a bunch of times. Take note of someones behavior when they show up evil later, keep an accurate and short log, and you will be fine</p>

            <p>The best advice is to keep playing and watching games - especially if dead and try asking other dead what they think and why they think like that.</p>

            <p>I am personally new to it as well. I have found watching Wahooz and TwoPercentSkimm to help me understand it better (minimum of watching different classes play).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/7chmjg/accusation_cheat_sheet/" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/7chmjg/accusation_cheat_sheet/</a> and <a href="http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/Mid-Game_Reference" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/Mid-Game_Reference</a> could help though just playing  will also help since then you can know the ins and outs of classes.</p>
<p>As for a newbies place, the devs have claimed to me that the discord community is way better than just doing it solo.</p>
<p>Also, don’t worry about being bad, I was the Mastermind my very first game and sucked balls. And have been a more passive king (way too many times I got this role) and been yelled at for that. But, def try to join in on private games and people might be better (have been busy, so unable to see if the claim was true). And also something to remember is if someone is being really toxic, you can report that (incase you are like me and thought only very extreme cases are reportable).</p>
<p>People also have said that you need to stick around to watch the game and maybe figure out and since if there are things maybe you can pick up on or plays that you can learn from.</p>
<p>That is all I got since I have been trying to catch a private game when I can, but when I am ready there is no one up for private.</p>
