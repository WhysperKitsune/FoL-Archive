As many of you may know, form posts in the news section, Guides and Mods have access to , and handle, reports. I refer to a member of either group as ‘reviewer’ , but mods make the final decision on closing reports. I’ve answered lots of report-related questions in the community, and seen a lot of confusion around what a goes into and/or helps provide evidence of rule-breaking for reporting players. I’ll give some advice on reporting by category, starting with the ones that usually need the most details. Following this advice should make it much easier for us to handle your reports, by report category

Racism/Homophobic:
   It’s easy enough to spot people doing this directly in the game. Mentioning the day the behavior occurred on can still help the reviewer to find it and verify the severity of the behavior.
For reporting inappropriate deathnotes and logs:  Please do your best to have someone make a screenshot and link it in the report, using a site like imgur, etc. Without this it is nearly impossible to punish the culprit
•	Include details about who the deathnote was found on and the day they died, this will help us to find the guilty player much more easily if they didn’t admit to doing it
•	For logs, the screenshot is still needed, but just the player name and the day they died should be enough information.
•	Strength in numbers! Several reports on the same person, with a screenshot  included in at least one, will help the reviewer to be sure that the player actually broke the rules
Streamsniping/cheating:
    It’s not easy to prove that someone is cheating over discord unless they admit it in-game. Mentioning the day/time this occurred will help the reviewer to find it more easily

For streamsniping: please include the name of the streamer and the general day/time the offense occurred. If you can get the streamer to clip the video where it happened and send it to a mod in discord, or link it in the report, it will be much quicker to punish/ban the sniper.

For targeted harassment and spamming, gamethrowing, we receive a direct copy of the game logs and the player’s name, etc. We can determine if they are probably new , or intentionally outing their teammates, etc. 
If someone harasses you or spams outside of the game, meaning in the lobby before or on the end-game screen: you can report them and screenshot it, and link in the report. We don’t see the endgame screen in the logs, so this will help us to punish that behavior appropriately as well. 

General tips:
•	Always try to mention when the behavior occurred, so the reviewer can find it quickly
•	Strength in numbers! Multiple people reporting the same person makes it more noticeable and indicates that this wasn’t just a salty report.
•	None of this is required action for reports ,but can help ensure that your reports are acted on and provide evidence to ban baddies.
•	Following these guidelines will make it much easier for reviewers to quickly handle your reports and ban the trolls
