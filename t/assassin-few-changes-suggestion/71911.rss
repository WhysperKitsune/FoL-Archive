    <title>Assassin+ - Few Changes (Suggestion)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassin-few-changes-suggestion/71911</link>
    <description>&gt;[color=purple]Assassin[/color]
I have a few suggestions to add a new level of bussing/&quot;confirming&quot; assassin
1. Make assassin able to poison himself. This way in the late game with a healer left, assassin can be able to &quot;confirm&quot; himself, and this way you can poison sus people late game and people will say &quot;don&#39;t heal him its assassin trying to confirm himself&quot;.

2. Make assassin suicide **have a deathnote**. This way mastermind can claim knight, claims to have cs&#39;d him when in reality it was assassin suicide plus a deathnote saying &quot;knight&quot;.

3. Buff assassins distract! My suggestion:
**Day Ability (Distract)** - Make a player unable to talk for 15 seconds, and be unable to vote+use day abilites for 15 seconds. _2 uses_.</description>
