    <title>Ideas to improve playing experience as a knight</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/ideas-to-improve-playing-experience-as-a-knight/18153</link>
    <description>Firstly, since the new Court Wizard changes adding the tornado, i&#39;ve twice had (as a knight) happen when i tried to cold steel a target, the target is switched to a bd and then you commit suicide. The idea behind the knight as a class is that you can keep targets safe and, in case of need, gamble with your life on suspected players. It is very unsatisfactory to then die because a fellow BD member swapped targets on you. Moreover, if you logged who you targeted with your attack, other players will think that your original target is a confirmed BD unless the Court Wizard outs himself at that point, setting BD back even further.

What I would propose is that knight is immune to the retargeting of the Court Wizard, so BD doesn&#39;t get disadvantaged so badly if this scenario occurs and will improve knight gameplay somewhat. Other redirects should still do their job of course, because those are not from the BD faction.

Second suggestion for knight gameplay is that when a knight stands guard, you get a message notifying you (or making a general message with someone send a guard perhaps when king, merc or knight does so, but those guards work differently, so maybe not). As the game is now, knight is often chosen by cult/unseen and neutral killers and it&#39;s just very hard to claim knight if you actually are one. Same as it was with alch some time ago.</description>

            <p>Personally I love it as is for evil. That’s exactly what they would do. Makes no sense for BD to redirect to other BD.</p>

            <p>Transporter under regular name.</p>
<p>And by meta I mean ‘The way a game is played’ Like if it became standard for starting king to be lynched Day 4  it would be a meta.</p>

            <p>Yea because the devs have already said they are strictly against meta gaming. Hence why I am here “moaning.”</p>
<p>Meta gaming does nothing social deduction at all.</p>

            <p>Bus driver is hugely powerful. Just because it is used badly, doesn’t make the class bad. If Prince meta was to random exe day 3, you wouldn’t be here bemoaning Prince now, would you?</p>

            <p>Making Knight’s ability show guard would make it even harder for NKs and Assassins though.  Literally no one could claim Knight ever except Knights.</p>
<p>It’s a fine class as it is.  Maybe not super exciting, but it’s really strong and if you get bored or suspect someone you can take matters into your own hands.  CW is an issue for sure, but… honestly it’s an issue for everyone.  They get physicians and alchs killed by tornadoing their heal targets, they screw up Sheriffs and Observers by throwing checks into random people or themselves.  It’s more a CW issue than anything, but thankfully there is only one anymore.</p>

            <p>Thats my point. Noone ever uses it “properly” which makes it useless and pointless. If it was evil only it makes sense to have that chaos because you can see the evil and bd. It needs to be removed or reworked for cw and definitely Not target himself.</p>

            <p>There is no chance to prove for classes like knight. Make your claim and get executed immediately because it can be proven and statistically speak you are successful when executing knight claims. NKs and assassin both claim knight. There is no deduction there at all. Just the meta.</p>
<p>Secondly not a person alive can honestly say they like the new cw ability tornado. It fucks over every side.</p>
