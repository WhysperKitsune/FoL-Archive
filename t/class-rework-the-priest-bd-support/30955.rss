            <p>That’s fair. I just hate the typical “I’m sheriff, 3 is unseen” to getting converted the next night. It’s fairly frustrating, but outing yourself as sheriff with a confirm kill on unseen is a risk in itself. I respect your opinion though.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t, to be honest. Balancing the game around conversions is already a headache, having a class that prevents conversion throws everything under the bus (because its presence or absence in the game has too much of an impact).</p>
<p>Besides there are already ways to combat conversions: the Prince’s jail, the Court Wizard’s swaps, and the Paladin’s Smite. The Sheriff’s Scout doesn’t prevent conversions but it does discourage it somehow (if you yell “Please Scout on me”, the MM probably won’t convert you if he suspects another Sheriff is present.)<br>
Also, if you are playing against Cult, anyone that sneezes in the Cult Leader’s direction can block conversions. XD</p>

            <p>Unseen/Cult get a lot of power from knowing who their other members are. Anyone who removes conversion is far too powerful, as that information is revealed. If there is a psychic in play, the newly formed Death Knight can tell Psychic who all the unseen are, since that’s his new goal.</p>
<p>Even without a Psychic, the Death Knight can leave a death note when he kills a confirmed Unseen, since he knows who they are, and then write in his death note who the rest of his ex team mates are. It’s immensely too powerful.</p>
<p>I do wish we had a new conversion prevention class. I think old CW was too strong with two blocks, but I think someone with one would be fine.</p>
<p>I’d also add the day ability is a bit strong, as it prevents a player from converting or getting converted with no down sides to you. Most blocking abilities come with some risk, but there is none here.</p>

            <p>All reverse conversion are too powerful because that person knows their remaining previous faction members and their exact classes. All they have to do is name them and the game is effectively won for BD.</p>

            <p>well they can only kill one at most , and (i’m not sure if it can) cant take out an mm , so they cant still be converting.</p>
<p>about the another paladin thing do you mean smite? its sorta like a stronger version but with 1 use. Paladin’s main ability is to find cult though. Priest is about stopping conversions</p>

            <p>Yes, but it kind of seems like an another paladin to me. And reanimating another Cult/Unseen would be quite OP since they could just kill their members</p>

            <p>wow fast</p>
<p>and no . it was meant to be unseen cult. i did kinda like the idea of a class that could change an evil back to bd , but i wanted to make it as balanced as possible. however i feel like they woould just probably cs one of the members and be off with it i suppose</p>
