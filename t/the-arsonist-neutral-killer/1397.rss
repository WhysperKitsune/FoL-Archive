    <title>The Arsonist (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-arsonist-neutral-killer/1397</link>
    <description>**The Arsonist**
Faction: Neutral Killer
Room: Smokehouse

Passive: Stench: Every direct investigative role (Ex:Sheriff) sees them as the Arsonist. In addition, everyone who has been primed shares this quality. 

Night ability 1: Prime: Cast a hex on a player. That player is now Primed for ignition, and thus appears to be an Arsonist (See: Stench) 

Night ability 2: Ignition: Snap your fingers, causing all primed players to burst into flames, killing them. 

Night Ability 3: Flame Wall: Infinite Uses: Enchant a player&#39;s room, surrounding it in flames within an alternate plane of existence. These flames, being not of this plane, do not damage anything nor do they spread. The target is occupied, and no player may enter that room out of fear.

Day Ability 1: Solar Flare: 3 uses Cast a hex on a player. If they use their day ability at any time, it will backfire on them. If a day ability (from anyone) is used on you, it will take away an ability use and backfire.
