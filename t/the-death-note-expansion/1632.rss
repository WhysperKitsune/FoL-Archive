    <title>The Death Note Expansion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-death-note-expansion/1632</link>
    <description>Perhaps later in say, ToL 2.0 you could add more death note colors, either as a in game purchase cosmetic type thing, or free. 

But only natural colors. Like green would be Grinder leaves, brown would be :poop:, blue made from ink berries. And things as such, or perhaps a class named Mad Artist or something, that has access to numerous colors and kills people just to publish art, now that&#39;s passion. 

Anywho, that&#39;s my idea for a color expansion, but I like my Mad Artist idea better than paying for colors or them being free, a role with Rainbow access :stuck_out_tongue:</description>
