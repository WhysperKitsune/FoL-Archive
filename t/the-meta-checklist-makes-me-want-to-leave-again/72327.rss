    <title>The meta-checklist makes me want to leave again</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-meta-checklist-makes-me-want-to-leave-again/72327</link>
    <description>I took like... several months off.  Came back.

Every game I&#39;m executed for not following some magical meta procedure for everything.

I&#39;m observer.  My logs don&#39;t follow &quot;the pattern&quot;  I&#39;m executed.  It was the pattern when I played, but apparently there is a new one or something.
I&#39;m noble, I don&#39;t twin vote on a pointless early vote that ended up being a fool.  Executed for being &quot;obviously evil&quot; because Aristocrats don&#39;t have the same power set as Noble and I was proven as a Noble.  Ok sure.
I&#39;m a physician.  I didn&#39;t exhume immediately.  Instant death.
I used the &quot;wrong&quot; abbreviation for an ability.  Death.


Almost every game I&#39;m killed for not following some arcane BS the community decided on while I was gone.

And I have like 300 hours in the game.  Apparently new people have no chance in hell and aren&#39;t wanted?

And it&#39;s never like a clever ploy from the unseen or anything.  It&#39;s BD people deciding that because I didn&#39;t follow paragraph 5 subsection 34 of the Rules of Conduct, I need to be killed.</description>

            <p>Observer logs can be fake.I mean nightwatch and seeker have follow too.Anyway,people are fake claiming observer with using outed info or people are making their logs too complicated as ''observer" so others wouldn’t bother to read it.</p>

<p>If you would just play for like 2/3 hours again after all these months, it would become normal to you. So many competitive strategic games have meta’s that change. That is what keeps a game fresh.</p>

</aside>
<p>I played for like 3.  And it’s not like you get every single class in that time.  Hell, you get a handful at best.  And it’s not game meta, which one expects to shift.  It’s a format for logs meta, which never existed before.  Tearing apart my logs for being inaccurate is one thing.  Tearing them apart for the <em>formatting</em>, is another.</p>

<p>Which is fine, but it’s the dumbest thing.  It used to be as long as your logs were legible, people didn’t care much.   Now it’s like a spreadsheet that if one thing is off, somehow that makes you evil.  Because… evil couldn’t possibly copy the formula.  That everyone apparently knows.</p>
<p>The Observer one probably bugs me the most.  Because it’s observer logs, which are basically unfakable.  They were confirmed by 3 other people.  Not that it really mattered since I don’t think I saw BD lose all night anyway.</p>

            <p>Half the time evils are pushing these executions anyway. So not really your fault that Bd are sheep.</p>

<p>I find this false because usually evils do push stuff like this, it’s just BD doesn’t try to stop them.</p>

            <p>If you would just play for like 2/3 hours again after all these months, it would become normal to you. So many competitive strategic games have meta’s that change. That is what keeps a game fresh.</p>

            <p>I took like… several months off.  Came back.</p>
<p>Every game I’m executed for not following some magical meta procedure for everything.</p>
<p>I’m observer.  My logs don’t follow “the pattern”  I’m executed.  It was the pattern when I played, but apparently there is a new one or something.<br>
I’m noble, I don’t twin vote on a pointless early vote that ended up being a fool.  Executed for being “obviously evil” because Aristocrats don’t have the same power set as Noble and I was proven as a Noble.  Ok sure.<br>
I’m a physician.  I didn’t exhume immediately.  Instant death.<br>
I used the “wrong” abbreviation for an ability.  Death.</p>
<p>Almost every game I’m killed for not following some arcane BS the community decided on while I was gone.</p>
<p>And I have like 300 hours in the game.  Apparently new people have no chance in hell and aren’t wanted?</p>
<p>And it’s never like a clever ploy from the unseen or anything.  It’s BD people deciding that because I didn’t follow paragraph 5 subsection 34 of the Rules of Conduct, I need to be killed.</p>
