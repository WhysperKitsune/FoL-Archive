    <title>6x Key Giveaway [Closed] (and a poll on where you found ToL)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/6x-key-giveaway-closed-and-a-poll-on-where-you-found-tol/81841</link>
    <description>Hey, so I recently got some keys, and seeing as the game doesn&#39;t have many active people, I thought I should start a giveaway. 
The link is [https://gleam.io/1nIIM/throne-of-lies-key-giveaway](https://gleam.io/1nIIM/throne-of-lies-key-giveaway).
*Please, if you already have the game don&#39;t enter, as this is to try to get the game more active.*

3 Keys provided by @Insanity 

Either way, how did you find out about the game?
[poll type=regular results=always max=4 chartType=bar]
* Word of Mouth
* Sales
* Videos/Streams
* Other
[/poll]

Love you all :heart:</description>

            <p>There are 6 days left today, I would recommend getting in if you haven’t yet, and if you can, please share with your friends that would play if they had the game! Word of mouth is apparently the second most common way of people finding the game, so if you tell your friends, you will be helping the community greatly!</p>

            <p>Hey, so I recently got some keys, and seeing as the game doesn’t have many active people, I thought I should start a giveaway.<br>
The link is <a href="https://gleam.io/1nIIM/throne-of-lies-key-giveaway" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://gleam.io/1nIIM/throne-of-lies-key-giveaway</a>.<br>
<em>Please, if you already have the game don’t enter, as this is to try to get the game more active.</em></p>
<p>3 Keys provided by <a class="mention" href="/u/insanity">@Insanity</a></p>
<p>Either way, how did you find out about the game?</p>
