    <description>Everyone is sheep. They only do what the king says.

The cult put my number in a death note, so people questioned me. I was butler and people confirmed my occs. 

But then someone said that cult can occ too. I said I could poison king to prove but then they just exed.

Call this advanced game mode &quot;Shepherds&quot;</description>

            <p>I’m with you. I play it less and less. I just can’t handle the stupidity. I will plain as day spell it out to the news and they just don’t get it. The other day we had all unseen dead by d4 and reaper dead n3 from poison. With no unseen deaths until n3. So that means there were zero converts and the game kept going. Everyone being dumb as they are kept thinking another assasin. Even though two other confirmed BD players with smarts said it is king and told them exactly why. Even said MM was reaped n2 so he couldn’t have converted. It finally ended d7 after everyone killed everyone else and ended up being king and a BD. BD won because a butler poisoned the king d6. King died and ofc he was evil. I got cancer from that game. People JUST don’t listen to reasoning. That is a culture and society problem man.</p>

            <p>Exactly. That type of system doesn’t exist, and never will.</p>
<p>It’s not worth your time to try and come up with some magical “perfect ranking system”. It’s a team-based conversion game with hundreds of outside variables, we’ll never find a system that avoids the issues inherent to this setup and I suggest we never try.</p>
<p>If anybody really wants to, I won’t tell you not to waste your time. Just be aware that that’s what you’re doing, plain and simple.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see why this in particular would need to be any different, people just want to play with people that know what their doing. I’m sure most players would be happy to get no gold from games just to play this.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could match people with the closest range of games played e.g. 50-100 games(played) players would try to match with others in their range within a time before going to the next range and so on, so people will match with similarly experienced players.</p>

            <p>That gamemode could be more difficult, or say, more rewarding in terms of gold.</p>
<p>But at the same time, should be somewhat extended.</p>
<p>A gamemode where you sacrifice 10k gold ? to unlock?<br>
or when you reach<br>
x amounts of wins this gamemode is unlocked?<br>
or total x games played (1,000? 2,000? 2,500?)</p>
<p>But, even then. how would it be different? a SR? system?<br>
You win 100 gp + 10 sr?<br>
1-100 sr (squire) 101 - 250 (knight) 251 - 350 (paladin) 351 - 500 (noble) 500 - 1000 (royal)<br>

            <p>well there’s been suggestions for things like the bulk of the weight going on things that happen on your team while you are in it, Mixed with individual accomplishments etc… But that still doesn’t solve what I consider the greater problem. an OK player in a good team, will massively outperform a great player in a bad team, by all metrics. If someone is misfiled into an unskilled rating. Or if they legitimately earned a bad rating, but got better… no algorithm would be able to identify that they need to be recatagorized.</p>
<p>Even as the roles that can carry normally, say prince… it only takes 1 BD player that thinks acting like a fool is a brilliant play to keep unseen from killing him… to neuter the princes abilities.</p>

            <p>Here’s the long and short of it IMO</p>
<p>Nobody would be against an advanced complex ranking system… if it worked, if it avoided the “hell” problems that come from trying to judge people on the games they are in. The problem is coming up with a balancing system for that would take a very long time, and most likely involve many many failed iterations.</p>
<p>A “you must have played this many games” is a much simpler solution, that still accomplishes 75% of the point in a ranked system. As at least in my opinion the difference between a new player, and an experienced player, is 10x larger than the difference between the averages of experienced players.</p>

<p>yeah i get that its hard for a game like this that has so many factors that are out of the players control, I wouldn’t know where to start but surely there is something more advanced than ‘100 games’ even a leveling system in my opinion would be better than that.</p>

<p>So you want this over a complex system that actually works and takes skill into account when matching players?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well there is a boatload of debate on a system that takes skill into account etc… Namely avoiding concepts like ELO hell etc… that naturally wind up in most “skill based” ranking systems.</p>
<p>IE in a small pool of games, factors of luck, the competence of your team mates etc… have a much bigger impact than skill. It likely takes a hundred games to really get a close to accurate assesment of someone’s skill, and when you start seperating people before that hundred, you screw up any algorithm.</p>
<p>IE someone loses 7/10 placement games, 2 of them he was outplayed, 5 he just had crap luck/teams/classes. After that he’s put into the bad player pool, always gets bad teams, his rank continues to drop. He never gets another chance to reach the better player pool, because he’s always pooled with 80% incompetent players, being with bad teams quite often makes playing well if anything a detriment.</p>
<p>I have made suggestions for uber complex ranking systems etc… but I also have to aknowledge, the first and foremost thing really should be, seperating the people who don’t know the mechanics, from those who know them like the back of their hands.</p>

            <p>To be fair. Leading people like the sheeple they are is super fun. Just kill/convert the smartest players and tell the rest what to do. Even if you are wrong repeatedly they will still listen to you. I have won as reaper by doing just that, I lead the game in the day and eliminated the people that can think for themselves at night.</p>

</aside>
<p>Asking never seems to get an answer in terms of voting considering the time limit and the fact that most people don’t know why their voting. Every game I’m explaining why you shouldn’t just vote people but that doesn’t mean those people don’t deserve to play the game and they will learn in time.</p>

</aside>
<p>I personally just read the tutorial and a few of the classes then learnt as I went. Most people probably do this but instead of sitting back and learning they are vocal and vote for ignorant reasons. Like when a princess thinks killer/offensive means evil or that they are sus because of it, or when psychics think they are some god that you have to give your class to otherwise your evil and everyone just goes along with it like it makes sense.</p>

<p>There’s atleast one person in every game that has a twitch emote for a name and just uses twitch emotes in every possible chance they get, it’s cringe.</p>

            <p>Before I played this game, I read the entire wiki and class cards, and asked questions to guides when I was confused. At that point, I understood the mechanics. Some people  don’t, or only know from the streamers they watched.</p>
<p>I think everyone should watch a basic strategy guide before playing, something that just outlines:</p>
<p>-don’t just vote someone because other people are<br>
-if an investigative log is filled almost entirely out of dead people, it is likely fake<br>
-after executing that person, if they are evil, consider the possibility that the living people they have in it are their allies<br>
-Don’t vote with king just to vote with king, he has the highest chance of not being BD</p>
