    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Scourge</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-scourge/22736</link>
    <description>The Scourge would function as an enemy of the Blue Dragon, taking the place of Cult/Unseen. 
_Goal:_ Overcome all who would seek to cease your endless advance. (The Scourge must be the only people alive to win, all BD/Neutrals must die or become Scourge.)

**The Scourge** 
The main goal of the Scourge will be to amass an army of the Undead to overcome the living. The Scourge may have an unlimited amount of members.  Five new classes will be added, the Gravemind, Scourgeling, Lich, The Purifier as well as a Scourge version of the King.
**BE SURE TO READ EVERYTHING SO IT MAKES SENSE**
&gt;
**The Gravemind**
 The ONLY starting member of the Scourge. Social class. 

**Passive 1: Necromancer&#39;s Shroud**  
Immune to Death first night. Immune to Occupation. Appears not suspicious for the first 3 nights.

**Passive 2: Defy Death**
If attacked at night, a random Scourgeling will die instead. If hung during day or executed by the prince, the Gravemind can still use his night abilities for 2 nights. 
_^ This is to ensure that if the Gravemind dies early the Scourge aren’t totally rooted._

**Day Ability 1: Mindfulness**
Give your Scourgelings the ability to vote pardon or execute for that day
_Unlimited uses. 1 Day Cooldown_

**Day Ability 2: Dark Command**
Select a Scourgeling, the next message you type will appear as if they had spoken.
_Unlimited uses, 3 uses per day_    (Trollbox but for allies basically)


**Night Ability 1: Arise!** 
Convert a target (Only convertible targets) to become a Scourgeling. Does not consume a charge if the target is convert Immune.
_1 Night Cooldown. 3 charges._

**Night Ability 2: Return to Me.**
Revive a dead Scourgeling to become a Lich for one night.
_Only usable past day 5. 1 charge._

Lore: The brains behind the operation, leader of the Scourge.
&gt;
**Scourgeling**
Minions of the Gravemind. All converted players become a Scourgeling. Offensive Class.
Infection appears as a poison.

**Passive 1: Rotting Mind** 
You will be unable to vote execute or paradon for trials (Unless Mindfulness is used). You may only talk once per day, but have free speech at night. (Whispers are unlimited)
_^ This is to make the Scourge ‘weak’ and easier to detect, thus putting more pressure on the Gravemind to cover for his Scourgelings. Scourgelings will only be able to message once to Prince and Psychic._

**Passive 2: Withering**
Scourge must successfully attack a living player within 3 days or they will die. The same player may be attacked by multiple Scourgelings at once. Your heart does not beat, you cannot be healed.

**Night Ability 1: Maul**
Attack a player, infecting them. The player will turn into a Scourgeling within 2 days, regardless of convert immunities with the exception of The Purifier. (Heals from Physician, Alchemist and The Purifier remove the infection)
_Unlimited Uses_

**Night Ability 2: Burrow**
Prevent anyone visiting you tonight.
_^ 2 charges_

Lore: We are one. We are legion.
&gt;
**Lich**
Revived Scourgeling. Will die in one night. Appears dead. Primary goal is to kill The Purifier. (Use Wisely) 

**Night Ability: Annihilation**
Attack a player, killing the target and all those visiting him.
_1 charge (He dies in one night anyway)_

Lore: Death 
          Ends 
          All
          Desires


&gt;

**The Purifier**
Member of the Blue Dragon. Wins when all Scourge are dead. Functions similar to the Sheriff /Paladin.


**Passive 1: Unshakable Faith**
Immune to being converted/attacked by the Scourge.

**Passive 2: Holy Communion**
All whispers to and from the King are hidden
_^ Helps prevent the Scourge from figuring out who Purifier is early on_ 

**Night Ability 1: Scales of Ma&#39;at**
Determine if a player&#39;s heart is beating or not.  (Equivalent to the Sheriff’s Expert Investigation or the Paladin’s Test Faith)
_Unlimited Uses, 1 per night_

**Night Ability 2: Purify**
Heal a player’s poison (Infection). 
_^ Only one Night Ability may be used at a time_
_Unlimited Uses, 1 per night_

Lore: Put your faith in the light!
&gt;

**The Scourged King**
Even if the king spawns as evil, he can still be bitten or converted and gains new abilities when he’s converted. Evil King will win with Scourge regardless of if he’s converted or not. If you become Scourged you can see the other members of the Scourge. Evil King still cannot tell who is who.



**Passive: Whispers from the Dark** 
Whispers from the Purifier are now visible to all players and whispers to the Gravemind are now hidden. (Visible as in X has whispered to Y, not readable publicly)

**Day Ability 1 : The Point of Death**
The King’s next vote decides the vote for all scourge. 
_1 charge_

**Night Ability 1: Corpse Shield**
Replaces Guard with an ability that saves a Scourgeling from death when the Gravemind is attacked. (Basically Stoneskin Potion for the Gravemind.)
_3 charges_

&gt;


_Comment:_ The Scourge offers a new unique way of winning the game. Rather than relying on killing as your main form of success, gaining numbers via conversion and overwhelming with sheer numbers is more important. The Scourge is very weak early game and relies on smart decisions by the Gravemind to get the ball rolling. As the Scourge gains numbers, they become more powerful.
As the Scourge it&#39;s important to eliminate all healer classes as soon as possible to ensure mass conversion, as well as trying to convert the King to easily discover who the Purifier is. 
The Blue Dragon must attempt to outsmart the Gravemind and his Scourge to quickly thin out the Scourge’s numbers and take them out before the living become overwhelmed. 

Please post suggestions and any balancing changes/ideas you may have!
**Changelog**
&gt; Added charges on all abilities.</description>

            <p>Evil King would keep his same abilities. Only the converted infected king would gain new abilities, making him WANT to be mauled and turned into a Scourge.</p>
<p>But I do understand where you are coming from, thanks for your input! I’m glad you liked it <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Looks extremely nice, but Evil King needs to have the same abilities as always, because The king is not a class.</p>
<p>Maybe with some fixes this would be epic to see in game!</p>
