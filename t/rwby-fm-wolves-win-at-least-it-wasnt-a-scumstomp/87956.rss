[details=&quot;Town Abilities&quot;]
Town Vanilla - You have no abilities except for your voice and your vote. Use them wisely. 

Town Even Night Doctor - On every even night, you may choose to heal a player, which will prevent them from dying if they are attacked.

Town Tracker - You may choose a player at night. You will see who they visit, if anyone.

Town 1-Shot Night Vigilante - **One time** at night, you may choose to target a player to kill.

Town 2-Shot Neighborizer - Each night, up to **two times**, you may add a single player to a neighborhood chat. This chat will be active only at night.

13 of the 17 town cards will be picked. The remaining 4 cards will be sent to the Mafia to serve as fakeclaims. The power roles will then be randed among the members of the Town. Once all power roles are randed, all other players will automatically be Town Vanillas.

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The energetic leader of Huntress Team RWBY. Armed with her trusty scythe, Crescent Rose, and a Semblance full of speed and petals, she&#39;s ready to do whatever it takes to protect the people of Remnant.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;![image|250x500, 75%](upload://dgEllLEvZwlHUq0YD96aiGE0RAi.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The blonde brawler of Team RWBY. Sure, she might be under the leadership of her little sister, but don&#39;t that fool you - she&#39;s got quite the nasty punch. And, if you manage to mess with her hair... well, let&#39;s just say that you&#39;ll regret it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The esteemed Heiress to the Schnee Dust Company. Constantly challenged while growing up, she has learned that only the strong survive. Her icy heart and cold demeanor are enough to turn most people off from approaching her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The dark-haired ninja with a secretive past. Enjoys reading books of... *questionable* content, but otherwise does her best to stay out of the limelight. But, we should have all learned by now... we can never outrun our past, no matter how fast we are or what our Semblance is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;When you got to Beacon, you were nothing more than a bumbling teen with a big dream and missing the tools to make it come true. Sure, maybe you&#39;re not too much better off now, but, for *some reason*, you&#39;re the leader of Team JNPR. And, hey, doesn&#39;t that just roll off the tongue?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;[color=scarlet]**Pyrrha Nikos**[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Pyrrha Nikos, the Invincible Girl, the Pride of Mistral. You&#39;ve been competing in tournaments for years, and you haven&#39;t lost yet, and you sure as Oum don&#39;t plan on starting now. But, you know what they say... *the bigger they are, the harder they fall*.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;[color=green]**Lie Ren**[/color]
&gt;-
&gt;![image|279x499, 75%](upload://7ZjKVyYqRZ72blmdj0YTCZknVDC.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Practically the antithesis to his companion, Nora, Lie, more commonly known as Ren, is often quiet and can easily hide his presence. His past isn&#39;t well-known, and he&#39;s not too willing to share.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;[color=orange]**Nora Valkyrie**[/color]
&gt;-
&gt;![image|250x500, 75%](upload://clhEe0k5JojR10BfA4hEo1GRlfd.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Practically bursting with energy, Nora Valkyrie acts like she&#39;s on a constant sugar high. And, based on the amount of syrup she consumes, that might not be too far from accurate. Even worse, she has a massive hammer, and the muscles to swing it around. Who thought this was a good idea?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;[color=DAC2DF]**Headmaster Ozpin**[/color]
&gt;-
&gt;![image|250x500, 75%](upload://mJNOp79GJt7Rs8kZv8fobGteYYv.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The ever-wise Headmaster of Beacon Academy, Vale&#39;s premier school for training Hunters and Huntresses. However, Headmaster Ozpin has plenty of secrets up his sleeve, and he&#39;s not willing to share them all, even to his inner circle. Among them... what the *hell* is in his mug?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;[color=D1C32F]**Professor Goodwitch**[/color]
&gt;-
&gt;![image|376x500, 50%](upload://qrqPYz9U5vf5hn5vr0Bhrt1y0Tj.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;A teacher at Beacon Academy, and an accomplished Huntress in her own right. Second-in-command to Ozpin, and a valued member of his inner circle. Her abilities in evading and using her Semblance, a form of Telekinesis, are practically unmatched, even among the Hunter community.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]***Defeat all members of the informed minority.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Ruby and Yang&#39;s uncle. You inspired and taught Ruby how to use a scythe, but you&#39;ve learned to not spend too much time around your loved ones, lest you end up getting them hurt. Constantly drinking and taking personal offense against authority, you&#39;re probably not the *best* role model, but that doesn&#39;t stop the girls from adoring you anyway.

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Massive gatling gun? Check. Beret and sunglasses? Also check. Kickass personality? Check, check, check. Coffee? Never enough. You&#39;re ready to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and you can fucking multitask.

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;A rabbit Faunus, you&#39;re used to being discriminated against for your heritage. It&#39;s not in your nature to fight back, but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t pack a massive punch. Your love for taking pictures, Semblance, and trusty light camera can make you a force to reckon with in any situation.

&gt;
&gt;Definitely not a reference to any mythological figure, you have a massive staff, blond hair, monkey traits, and the ability to create a clone of yourself. You&#39;re pretty carefree and willing to bend the law if you think said law is stupid.

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Definitely not a mythological reference. You have a trusty trident-gun, and your Semblance is a very strong form of Hydrokinesis. Unfortunately, due to trauma stemming from incidents as a child, you really hate the water.

&gt;
&gt;A chameleon Faunus, your heritage makes you brilliant at stealth missions and blending in. Despite your... *less than moral* actions, all you have ever wanted is the best for your people.. and maybe the love of a certain Faunus.

&gt;
&gt;[color=gree]**Town**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;Having lived most of your life directly under the thumb of General Ironwood, you&#39;re not too good with social interaction, or the idea of freedom in general. However, something you *are* good at is fighting, and your knives can shred through just about anything with ease.

&gt;
&gt;[color=red]**Mafia Even Night Roleblocker**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;The devil in a dress and heels. You&#39;re ruthless, and will stop at nothing to achieve your goals. You have control over fire thanks to your Semblance, and you can use it with ruthless efficiency.
&gt;
&gt;On even nights, you may choose to roleblock a target. This target will be unable to leave their room, and will not be informed of this.
&gt;
&gt;[color=red]***Reach parity with the Hunters and Huntresses.***[/color]

&gt;[color=71F471]**Emerald Sustrai**[/color]
&gt;-
&gt;![image|250x499, 75%](upload://i7vckmosZf3vdv04m6xMpFqNaWI.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;[color=red]**Mafia Universal Backup**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;You used to be a petty thief before Cinder took you under her wing, and you&#39;re eternally grateful for the chance to do something greater with your life. You have a masterful control over your flintlock/kama hybrid weapons, Thief&#39;s Respite, as well as your Semblance, which allows you to target people and cause them to see illusions.
&gt;
&gt;If a [color=red]**Mafia Power Role**[/color] dies before you, you will inherit the class&#39; ability.
&gt;
&gt;[color=red]***Reach parity with the Hunters and Huntresses.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=red]**Mafia Goon**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;You&#39;re the son of a successful assassin. Or, at least, you *were*, right up until you killed him. The ultimate test of any assassin - killing their teacher. Sure, he may have stolen your Semblance, but you don&#39;t need it anyway. Your mechanical legs, fighting skill, and teachings have proven to make you more than capable in a fight, holding your own against even the likes of Pyrrha Nikos and Yang Xiao Long.
&gt;
&gt;You have no ability other than your voice and your vote.
&gt;
&gt;[color=red]***Reach parity with the Hunters and Huntresses.***[/color]

&gt;
&gt;[color=red]**Mafia Neapolitan**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;You may be a mute, but you don&#39;t need to speak to have an impact. You mostly serve under Roman Torchwick, but you&#39;re on loan to Cinder Fall for the moment. Your parasol blade and ability to create glass-like illusions lend themselves well to your natural fighting capabilities, and you definitely look fabulous.
&gt;
&gt;Every night, you may target a player. You will learn if they are a [color=gree]**Vanilla Townie**[/color].

            <p>The only way I don’t vote Eli in f3 is a scenario where nobody votes for a while and I remember that there were reasons to clear Eli. Especially relevant in a world with only 1 wolf between you and Eli.</p>

            <p>Well I explained ‘convince villager to quickhammer’. I wanted as little time for you/arete to post and realise the other was v. That was my main rationale.</p>
<p>After that it was f5 and I weighed my options.</p>
<p>I wanted you to vote first (as you figured out) but that couldn’t end up happening, and <em>I</em> had to vote after the cross.</p>
<p>You had thrown out the idea of a me/eli w/w team pretty strongly, and seemed to be leaning eli, so I thought that even if I voted atlas you’d be going eli 100% of the time.</p>
<p>At that point if you did go eli I was in a solid position, because if arete goes eli then we win, and if arete goes atlas, eli already thought it was you/atlas and me voting with him and you against him only solidified that, and I thought i would be able to use atlas cred to convince you it was eli over me.</p>
<p>It was the safer option overall, I thought that as long as you voted eli the game would be in a good position regardless</p>
