<p>yes but used incorrectly could have a dire effect if someone was basically confirmed unseen and turned out to be “bd”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You got a point there. If unseen, this ability could out yourself when mistimed. But so can an improper defile while being a phys claim. It shares a similar issue that defile, but is also far more applicable in its usage. The real problem with Besmirch is it being a day ability, and therefore it can be used as a reaction, which requires significantly less thought to use with an incredibly strong effect to boot.</p>
<p>The offensive potential of this is still ridiculous.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the end, Besmirch would make a really good night ability, for a different class. I’d suggest incorporating this into a support unseen class. I don’t know what that would look like, but Besmirch would make a very interesting ability if that were to exist.</p>

            <p>yes but used incorrectly could have a dire effect if someone was basically confirmed unseen and turned out to be “bd” then that would make the sheriff claim especially suspicious, used incorrectly if can have grave consequences leading to 2 unseen get lynched, but if the player using it is very skilled they can practically fool bd.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This ability doesn’t seem like something an investigative class would do (information manipulation) even if Duchess has dark wisp. It would be better suited on a social/support class.</p>
<p>It also wouldn’t work correctly with butler/drunk (certain), and probably not with other classes (uncertain).</p>
<p>For example, butler targets 3.<br>
Marshal selects butler and 8.</p>
<p>Butler gets feedback telling them they successfully occupied 8, with out any ‘redirected’ feedback telling them why that happened. This proves the existence of converted sheriff mechanically.</p>

</aside>
<p>Extremely OP. Can be used to confirm unseen and to effectively frame bd. The weakness of Scorned’s disguising ability is that it few effective uses, while having to predict who will be hung the next day. It’s unreliable.</p>
<p>Besmirch can effectively (and efficiently as it is a day ability) eliminate the downsides of making aggressive plays as unseen while also allowing them to unconfirm investigative BD classes.</p>
