<p>And finally, here’s my take on FoL’s Squire/Page. Skill names have been modified to add a more thematic feel to his skill names and also conditional immunity has been given in order to prevent issues such as they dying n1 while at the same time discouraging them from not remembering a class to keep the immunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue"> The Squire </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="steblue"> Blue Dragon Support </font></strong><br>
<strong>Cowardice (Passive)</strong> - Grants night immunity to the Squire for the first three nights or until the Squire remembers a class, whichever comes first.<br>
<strong>Pick up the Mantle (Night)</strong> - Allows the Squire to select a non-unique Blue Dragon-aligned class from the Graveyard. The Squire will change his class to the selected one by the end of the night. - Infinite uses<br>
<em>Defeat the Unseen or Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<h1><font color="purple"> The Page </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="purple"> Unseen Support </font></strong><br>
<strong>Innocent Youth (Passive)</strong> - Causes the Page to appear as a member of the Blue Dragon to faction checks until they remember a class. When converted, the Mastermind’s visit will not show to Scouts.<br>
<strong>Ascending Villain (Night)</strong> - Allows the Page to select a Blue Dragon-aligned class from the Graveyard. The Page in turn will become their Unseen equivalent by the end of the night. - Infinite uses<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Again, the Priestess has no dead interaction and this is not exactly a resurrection per-se and rather puts the “dead” player in a state of limbo. In order to resurrect a player via Forgiveness, the Priestess needs to be able to correctly predict if the person executed during the day is a member of the Blue Dragon, and she only has 2 shots to do it as Confession does not have unlimited uses.</p>
<p>If the Priestess wants to revive a player via Bind Soul, then she must correctly predict who is going to be attacked. This is roughly the same town-reading done by Physicians and Knight to predict who the Assassin/CL/NK is going to attack.</p>
<p>In short, this is less of the old Priest/ToS Retributionist and more of a protective class with a different flavor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>confirmable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This basically requires the Priestess to pull off a proper resurrection in order for her to confirm herself. It’ll be very likely for an unskilled/unlucky Priestess to never get a resurrection off the entire game. Even than in Unseen games, a Pardoner would be more likely to pull a reincarnation off than a Priestess so a revived player wouldn’t necessarily be 100% confirmed at times, especially because of the game’s conversion element.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This could really OP<br>
Minstrel, if converted before the MM’s BD veil goes away could be OP. Minstrel targets assassin, MM appears as BD, Minstrel appears as BD<br>
Meaning all of the Unseen are disguised and it’s infinite uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would have two nights most where the Unseen is fully disguised. The Minstrel will only be able to use Ballad after he’s converted, ergo not in n1, and the MM is shown as Unseen after n3. So assuming the Minstrel was converted the earliest possible, then the Unseen will have only 2 nights of being fully disguised, which would technically be the same as the usage of Dark Wisp. Even then, we still have the new Investigative empower to counter abilities like this and it’s still possible to find the MM and the Assassin via social deduction or mechanic confirmation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So basically like a stronger frenzy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A weaker one that also works with offensive classes. Crescendo doesn’t bypass healing or Knights. Sages and Enforcers still do a better job than the Minstrel at killing outed Princes.</p>

<p>But the dead BD player should still be able to see dead chat they just can’t use it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not being able to use dead chat means neither typing nor being able to see messages. Essentially, when a player dies with their soul binded or given Clemency provided they’re BD, they don’t count as technically dead and are instead stuck in a state of limbo. Albeit Clemency only lasts until the following night and if the player is not revived via Forgiveness the coming night then they will die for real and are able to use dead chat. In short, this is less of a resurrection and more of a delayed healing as true resurrections such as the old Priest is a mechanic extremely detrimental to game balance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the player probably won’t stay to be resurrected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Confession (Day) - If a Blue Dragon-aligned player is executed this day then for the coming night they cannot use dead chat and <strong>will be informed that Confession was used</strong>, but they can be revived via Forgiveness. - Two uses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bind Soul (Night) - If the targeted player dies this night, then they will be resurrected the next night provided that they are not a member of the Unseen or the Cult. <strong>If the player was killed while their soul was bound, they will be notified.</strong> In between death and resurrection, the player cannot use dead chat. The Reaper’s Reap and the Possessor’s Possess bypasses Bind Soul. - Infinite uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My design here is that if a player dies they will also be given a “You have been given clemency!” or “Your soul has been binded!” message in green text, similar to healing, as the next sentence after their death message. Since the player will be notified that they are now in limbo instead of being dead, there is no reason why they should leave.</p>
<p>While pseudo-resurrection is still a mechanic, there is no dead interaction with this class at all which fits in with i42’s vision for the game.</p>

          <p>Err, care to word your question in a more lucid manner?</p>
<p>If you’re asking about the order of skill activations, resurrections would work as a last resort. The current order of night actions is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Occupation, Redirection, Guard;</li>
<li>Attacks;</li>
<li>Healing;</li>
<li>Investigative abilities;</li>
<li>Conversion.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, first the game will check if the target is being guarded by a Knight. If not then they’ll check if they are night immune. If not then they’ll check if they are being healed. If not then if Bind Soul or Reincarnation is used on the target then it’s effect will be activated. Basically, the Priestess is a last line of defense for a target.</p>
