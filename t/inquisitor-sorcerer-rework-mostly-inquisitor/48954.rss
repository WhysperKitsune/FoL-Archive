    <title>Inquisitor/Sorcerer rework (mostly Inquisitor)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/inquisitor-sorcerer-rework-mostly-inquisitor/48954</link>
    <description>The idea is to make Sorc and Inquisitor more like 2 NK&#39;s.

&gt; # [color = &quot;gray&quot;]Sorcerer[/color] :shield: :crossed_swords:  
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer[/color]**
&gt; Passive 1: Mage armor - Immune to Occupy, Redirect, Death, bleed and Poison.
&gt; Passive 2: Rivalry - Magic missile will no longer have a cooldown once the Inquisitor is dead.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability 1: Power shot - Magic missile will pierce night Immunity tonight. (3 uses)
&gt; Day Ability 2: Aura Read - Learn target player&#39;s class type (4 uses)
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 1: Magic missile - Kill target player. If you would fail to kill them you will not do anything. (Unlimited. 1 day cooldown)
&gt; Night Ability 2: Circle of death - Kill everyone visiting your target. Bypasses death immunity. Unusable until D3. (2 uses)

&gt; # [color = &quot;gray&quot;]Inquisitor[/color] :shield: :crossed_swords:  
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;]Neutral Killer[/color]**
&gt; Passive 1: No one expects the Spanish Inquisition! - You are death, poison and bleed immune and your abilitys don&#39;t count as visits.
&gt;Passive 2: Rivalry - If the Sorcerer is killed then Ruthless Efficiency won&#39;t have a cooldown.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Find Magic - Find out if target player is a magic user at the start of the night. (Unlimited)
&gt; Day Ability 2: Holy hand grenade - Target player will die at the end of the next night. Bypasses everything exept healing. Does not notify the target. (2 uses)
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability: Ruthless Efficiency - Kill target player. If they are a magic user this will not go on cooldown. (Unlimited. 1 day cooldown)

They both have the Wincon to kill all other factions and turn into Psycho King&#39;s if they step up (they still need to kill each other if they do however).</description>

            <p>I agree, Inq and Sorc need to be reworked so that Sorc is invisible to BD and INQ is actually <em>needed</em> to find him.  And Sorc needs to be unable to deceive Inq’s abilities.</p>
<p>But basing completely new classes on the OP would be cool.</p>

            <p>Anything to nerf the Inquisitor winrate is fine in my book.</p>
<p>Honestly if we were to keep the cat/mouse Inquis/Sorcerer game, we should make it so Sorcerer’s attacks work like an Enforcer’s Frenzy on exclusively the Inquisitor. That way they can’t claim to the court and get free town cred.</p>

<p>I think it would better to create an Evil INQ and a Good sorc. to alternate their alignements for once in a while. The Good sorc goal would be to survive the Inquisitoror to see the bd WIn and the Evil inq would have to kill the BD… this way the INQ will remain the sorc main’s problem.</p>
<p>If their alignement are random. the INQ will no longer be a certain a BD ally.</p>

</aside>
<p>Or instead of making three classes with random alignments(King is 1), you have them as two NKs, but they have to fight each other and everyone else.</p>

            <p>actually. no…</p>
<p>it is a NK that is directed by 2 person for a certain time, during which they can kill 2 extra person every 2 nights. after this time is up, it become a nk who kill 1 person every nights,  with a few extra (holy grande, death circle). hoverer since people often need lead to find these nks. Also, with this, the inq is a better nk the sorc, since if he killed magic, he can kill again next nights. and the Sorc lose her abilities to avoid the knight.</p>
<p>I really think alternative alignment would be better.</p>

            <p>The inquis and sorcerer are still the main threats to each other. They both have far more useful information than most other NK (especially the inquis) and a better KPN, this makes them automatically much better than other NK at dealing with the BD.</p>
<p>However the NK cannot be too good at dealing with BD or else the lifespan of the counter will make that class swingy.</p>
