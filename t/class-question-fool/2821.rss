    <title>Class Question (Fool)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-question-fool/2821</link>
    <description>I decided to post this because i asked boslof, and he didn&#39;t know. So im wondering if this is actually something that can happen. 

If a fool is reaped, but he is executed the next day. Does it still count as a win for the fool? :thinking:</description>
