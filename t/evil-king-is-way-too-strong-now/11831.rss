    <description>Its so hard to beat the evil kings now, they are just executing naturals to buy some time and by the time they get executed its way too late.

It doesn&#39;t made any sense to buff evil king because once you got evil king you&#39;re already on better shape then most games, so why make it so OP?



I think evil king should have the former ability of finding evil allies.</description>

<p>I doubt it applies to king. It only says if you CAN tell them before hand, and whisping them before accusing them would be susp.</p>

</aside>
<p>once all the neutrals are dead, BD would be able to deduce king’s alignment…</p>
<p>My suggestion is instead a neutral class that spawns if there is a good/evil king that sides with the opposite of the original king’s goal. It would not know it’s alignment until the original king died.</p>

<p>My time I take the lead as MM/CL/EK separates from the gamethrowing ones, call me crazy although the ones I intend to remove from the living have reason for their deaths, to take place for the newly converted as BD becomes weaker.</p>

            <p>Also, Blue Dragon will reluctant to take down the first king if you point out who is Blue Dragon/Ally, Unseen(or cult)/Neutral/Not Ally correctly, I do agree that taking down the Mastermind after Night 3 is considered gamethrowing but having members ‘found out’ in cooperation with the likes such as Sheriff/Paladin, Observer or Princess do slow down Unseen but also themselves. Allowing the Mastermind able to convert again.</p>

            <p>I think from a design stand point, the change the devs made was nice. The problem is i think, devs needs to make sure something compensate the presence of a GOOD or EVIL king because it makes a massive difference in the game. We don’t want the alligment of the king to be the main deciding factor.</p>
<p>Just do random stuff.</p>
<p>When its a evil king, there can be less neutrals more BD, the existing neutrals can be more good like alchemist or mercs.</p>
<p>When its a good king, the opposite happens. More neutrals less BD. Neutral roles are more evil (fool scorned). There can also be less investigative roles like sheriff/paladin</p>
<p>Of course, none of this should be set in stone. We shouldn’t be able to deduct anything from this.</p>

            <p>Also, with no noble’s maid the king can just tell evil guys that he is with them and do whatever he wants because he is the king.</p>

            <p>I have to agree with everyone else. Any King that hasn’t made much progress in dealing with Unseen or Cult by D4/D5 needs to be executed. Blue Dragon has the majority vote early game so if they don’t fix it, <strong>it’s their fault</strong>.</p>

            <p>… No, that’s not it.<br>
It is the players fault to not realize the alignment of the King…<br>
but the players cannot magically convert the King into BD… or reverse, Unseen, Cult…<br>
Given that the first king has the extremely powerful Allies ability… an evil King is currently MUCH worse for BD than a Nking or BDking in a way that you CANNOT counter as BD.</p>

            <p>No, I agree in principle, the King is a bit too important right now, have a good king and Neutrals and Unseen/Cult are in trouble, get an evil king and BD and Neutrals will have more problems. Neutral King is also unnecessarily forced to support BD early.<br>
There are two possibilites to change this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nerf the King to the ground<br>
2.Introduce a less powerful class that doesn’t like aligned kings(guess what I designed one) AND replace Allies.<br>
Right now Allies is an extremely powerful weapon in the hands of BD, 65% of the time… and the bane of all neutrals, especially neutral killers, 97% of the time. That’s why that ability definitely needs to go.</li>

            <p>Its so hard to beat the evil kings now, they are just executing naturals to buy some time and by the time they get executed its way too late.</p>
<p>It doesn’t made any sense to buff evil king because once you got evil king you’re already on better shape then most games, so why make it so OP?</p>
<p>I think evil king should have the former ability of finding evil allies.</p>
