    <title>I am sorry, to everyone I have hurt</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-am-sorry-to-everyone-i-have-hurt/76661</link>
    <description>Over the past few months, many has noticed that I have became very aggressive and swearing a lot, having a horrible attitude all around, many times where I took it too far, and was never warned for it. Which in my opinion needs to be more payed attention to. If people spoke out about it sooner, I would&#39;ve just stopped. Because little to no one spoke out about it, I continued to get more and more aggressive, leading me to becoming more careless with how I spoke.

Recently I was told how a certain post effected someone at the time. I will and shall not quote the post here. I refuse to put any more attention to it. But, it made me think, do more people feel this way about me? Are people actually scared/against me? The post I made was an aggressive post to someone scumreading me in a certain game. After that, I&#39;m starting to get &quot;Town-Read&quot; for existing. Now I&#39;m wondering if that post, is the cause of that.

I&#39;m honestly really afraid if I did actually hurt anyone. So please, if I did ever hurt you with any of my posts at any point in time, please leave a message below. Also I promise to not be so careless with my words from now on. I hate to make a post like this but it *needed* to be addressed and I *needed* to apologise to everyone I have hurt. I don&#39;t know specifically who I have hurt and that makes it worse. I don&#39;t even know who I have wronged on this forum.

I may, or may not, take a break from the forum while I re-coup myself. It is currently unknown to me. I have a game that is planned to be post for signups currently and I don&#39;t want to just drop that. But, if you ever see me being aggressive, swearing, or shouting at people. Please, warn me to stop, if no one speaks up about it, I probably would just start continuing again.

If you read this post fully, thank you.

TL;DR: I have been being too aggressive on the forums, I apologise and I ask you all to say if I have hurt you and to warn me if I ever become aggressive again.</description>

            <p>That aside, I’m glad to hear it looks like you’re able to take a decently objective look at where you were.</p>
<p>That means you’ve undoubtedly made shit tons of progress as a person. Good job.</p>
<p>I don’t really have any advice for this kind of situation, but you being able to take stock of yourself like this shows me you’re already stronger than you were a few months back.

            <h1>Explaination:</h1>
<p>Now, I believe it’s time I have realised why I became this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: <strong>That… <em>age</em></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve been this age before, you know what age I’m on about. Back in October 2nd, it was my birthday! Yay! A few months later… <em>that thing</em> kicks in. That happened a few months ago, and that might have a little part in my changes in my ways. But, there are a lot more factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 2: <strong>Loneliness/Bullying</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In real life, my bullying worsened, I was constantly getting abused, name-called or worse. I also didn’t have any friends except my one friend, who is abusive and still is today. I just stick with him as I’ve got no one else. This caused me to do something things. Like, not coming to school or forcing myself to get sent home, this worsened my school attendance down to 90.2% (around that) right now. I also ended up doing something horrible. <strong>Warning: This has been spoilered as it may contain triggers or something you do not like.</strong> <span class="spoiler">I also ended up grabbing a razor (Those ones you shave your beards with) and forcefully cutting my head open to try stay off school.</span> This also caused my “depression” to worsen at the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 3: <em><strong>Her</strong></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time also, I had a girlfriend who I also stuck with, as once again, I had no one. Back in January, our relationship had been on lots of rocks. It was not okay at the time, we broke up a lot of times and got back together, a lot of times. Back in January, so, <em>so</em> many people told me it was abusive, but I just ignored them as I was idiotic and selfish, and just didn’t want to believe she didn’t love me. Back in April, you may have noticed I became <em>EVEN MORE</em> aggressive. This is because I ended up breaking up with her for good. <strong>Warning: May contain a trigger</strong> <span class="spoiler">She admitted she wanted to abuse me, to break me</span>. She also constantly lied to me about <em>everything</em> for no reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 4: <strong>The Facade</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That… was not the real me. Sure, the other factors about contributed into it becoming the real me. But at the time, I was pretending to be aggressive and pretended to act tough. Why? Because I felt like if I didn’t, people would find my insecurities and use it against me, something that is going on to me right now in real life.</p>

            <p>if you want you can read this as “if he exists he’s village” but to be frank I don’t actually have to explain why the read works considering that I’ve never been wrong on a Wazza read and in general my reads are pretty close to consensus</p>

            <p>it’s very simple:<br>
If wazza is a villager, you will KNOW. Everything, from their tone to their actions to their analysis just screams “villager”</p>
