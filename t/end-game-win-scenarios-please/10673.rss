    <title>End Game Win Scenarios PLEASE</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/end-game-win-scenarios-please/10673</link>
    <description>There should be some kind of spreadsheet or something that explains each and every outcome of a match explaining who will win in X scenario at the end of the game etc.

Example: &quot;If a Prince and a Assassin are in a 1v1 on the last Day, Game will end with Blue Dragon winning&quot;

I have lost one too many games as NK/Evil roles because of my lack of understanding the &quot;weight&quot; each role/class has when if i killed the Prince or something that night, I could have won. I&#39;m sure many other players agree with me on this point.</description>

            <p>If someone with a lot of experience playing the game wants to send me info on their games such as: who was left and who won for each game they played/remember, I can throw together a class Weight spreadsheet and Win Scenario/Conditions spreadsheet and get it put on the wiki. Or if someone else is already in progress with the idea, just let me know!</p>

            <p>Yep. So many games have ended prematurely where another faction could’ve won.</p>
<p>It’s like the game assumes each players knows exactly what each other player is.</p>
