    <description>NO QUOTE FOR YOU-The Quote Nazi

Once an youthful doctor the Alchemist has been forced into hiding due to improper medical practices. Now striped of his job and social status they simply wishes to live in an hostile court. He has developed potions that can save lives or take the lives of their enemies. They are currently developing more potions that could ruin this court. Who knows what their experimenting could bring.

I liked the quote on the wiki already so I made a Seinfeld joke. (Soup Nazi) 
I don&#39;t really like the reason that he was sent into hiding, but if you would like to suggest an idea that would be great :)
