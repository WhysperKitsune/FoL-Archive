<p>Passive: Royal Blood (You know this one)</p>
<p>Day Ability: Influence: Your vote to accuse somebody or your vote when someone is on trial counts as two. The Court will be informed. Unlimited uses.</p>
<p>Night Ability: Support: Your target’s vote to accuse someone will count double tomorrow. May not be used on King. Unlimited uses.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have said this before and I will say it again. Pure vote manipulation is boring. This is because it doesn’t matter unless it changed who the majority is or changes the result of a trial. This is why every attempt at a vote manip class gives them knowledge of what people are voting for so that they know if an ability can actually reverse the trial.</p>
<p>This can be solved in one of 2 ways: Pair it with another type of ability like the current noble, or broaden the function like I did with Merchant.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just because people are not using it properly does not mean the proper use doesn’t exist. You may not have seen the coordination I have talked about but I have. Most of my psychic games either involve me doing that or end too fast for it to be a factor anyways (except when I am converted). This was especially true when there was the 2 target version that let 2 people talk to each other as well as you. This is why my suggestion gives them that.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/nuclearburrito.html">@NuclearBurrito</a> If you could target 2 people, you could actually coordinate (especially between key Blue Dragon like King and Prince). Even so, I still feel like private night chat is under the Prince’s domain. It also gets rid of the annoying Psychic tab, which always sucks if you are jailed and linked and have to keep switching between tabs.</p>
<p>But honestly, I feel like getting the claims of 2 people might be too powerful, since the Psychic would move too fast.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here is solutions to both problems:</p>
<p>1: Make psychic unable to link people in jail again. It worked like this for a bit already so it isn’t a big deal to do it again.</p>
<p>2: Make Astral project (the 2 target one) Either require that at least one of the people you link has been targeted by link minds before or require that BOTH have been.That way you would always have no more than 1 person that hasn’t been given a chance to claim to you that could in any given night.</p>

<p>The idea is that either A: Its the psychic and someone trustworthy interrogating a 3rd person (this is not preferred and is why I was considering making it require BOTH people already be linked before.) or B: 2 people who already are sufficiently trustworthy and can thus value them. For example linking a merc with his contract or a sheriff with someone he checked.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not when you are psychic. You just need to have enough information to know that both of them are good. Since BD will trust you if you are linking them then you can just tell them to trust each other and they will cooperate at least for that night. Maybe they won’t claim per say but you also don’t need them to because you already got their claim from link minds earlier.</p>

<p>That’s still a huge risk if one of the people is Prince. Although it is a small chance, it’s one that would definitely make me nervous. And of course, the Psychic’s judgement could be wrong.</p>
<p>Also, one problem with the current Psychic is that it can be converted and tell the Unseen/Cult the classes they found. I think an ability like this only works on an unconvertible, like Prince. But of course, we should generally avoid that.</p>

          <p>Regardless of Paranoia, it’s still basically redundant. Link Minds definitely is, and your new ability would either work as</p>
<p>A: Imprison with 2 Princes, which isn’t very helpful above Current Link Minds or Imprison<br>
B: Having 2 people claim to each other, still subject to conversion and fake claims. You already know who one or both are, so you can just talk to each one individually.</p>
<p>I just feel Psychic is unworkable as long as it’s as similar to Prince now.</p>
<p>Besides that, what do you think of the other ideas?</p>

          <p>The purpose of talking to both people if you already have talked to both of them is to A: Reveal that they are both trustworthy to each other. B: Allow them to plan out what they will do together given that they already trust each other for whatever reason C: To direct them both directly yourself because you know stuff that they don’t. Prince takes far longer to do all 3 of those things with or without my change but especially without.</p>

          <p>There isn’t really a reason to jail more than 3 times.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>A: Just tell them via link, private matters, or telepathy<br>
B: BD can generally plan in the open, since they are the majority, unlike the Unseen/Cult.<br>
C: It’s rare to have information they don’t have, besides claims. Anyways, Prince can do this (very slowly) and Psychic can kinda already do this. But information like this is pretty rare, since you only have claims.</p>
