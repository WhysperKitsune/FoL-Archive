    <description>Court Wizard
Unique
Day Abilities
Time Slow
1 Time Use
Increases Day Length by 30 seconds and another trial to be put up (announced when done to all as &quot;The Court Wizard has slowed down time, adding time and another trial may be cast!&quot;

This ability is primarily a lategame one time use when you are down to the last few members and your court cannot decide on who to pick, this extends BD time to discuss so they can come down to an agreement. This also lets an additional trial be held if they realise they selected the wrong target.

Night Abilities
Mirror Image
1 Time Use
Create a second copy of a character, the first time they are attacked at night the copy dies instead of the user, lasts until attacked

And extremely powerful 1 Time Use, this lets the court wizard make one person gain the &quot;death immune&quot; trait with 1 use, if you find the prince put this on him to make him more powerful, or if you mistakenly put it on the assassin, make your lives harder!

Dispel
Unlimited Use
Cures Poison/Bleeding and prevents the user from being occupied/redirected

Similar to the Physician however this cannot save a target who is attacked that night, this can only remove Poison/Bleeding. Useful since I believe the CW should share the same spawn% with a Physician so we do not crowd the support role to much.

Sage
Day Abilities
Tornado
Unlimited Use
Make someone swap positions with another user.

Tornado, but a day ability, this is so that the Sage can swap in secret while also &quot;proving&quot; himself with his fake abilities.

Night Abilities
Mirror Weapon
1 Time Use
Lets the Assassin attack again, this stacks with double kill for a potential 3 attacks in 1 night!

A simple assassin empower to match the power of the BD version of the ability.

False Dispel
Makes the user believe his poison/bleeding is cured, however it still kills them 1 day later(if it was to kill them that night, it gets extended 1 day) 

This lets a Sage &quot;Prove himself&quot; with a heal, however all this does is extend the duration of the bleed/poison and dosnt let the user know they are still bleeding/poisoned. When they die they will realise it was all a dupe.</description>

<p>??? This is not a good idea, giving CW a confirmable ability but not the same one for sage is just not good imo, also how would sage confirm himself when CW has no tornado??</p>

<p>This one I do kind of like</p>

            <p>Having Tornado as a day ability is a horrible mistake. Tornado is already a very powerful and swingy ability. Using it incorrectly will lead to massive mistakes on everyone’s part. We already have CWs who tornado just for the fun of it. If Tornado remains, it MUST be a night ability, as it allows Sage to combo it with team mates and CW to actually think about who and why he’s swapping.</p>
<p>Everyone else went over the rest of the major problems with your abilities.</p>

            <p>I mean imo Tornado is a good ability if you actually had some way of knowing when might be a good point to use it. I’d be fine to see it removed but I’m also good with it being kept.</p>

            <p>Id say you can only have 4 healers in a game max as a standard, which is what I would want as I agree 6 healers is to many. Also the way Mirror Image works is like the Inquisitors Holy Blessing. So you add 1 Death Immune charge to them, meaning an assassin kill will fail to kill them, but the next time they attack it will.</p>
<p>The super confirmable ability is a one time use, which I think is fair that most classes have a way to confirm themselves once.</p>

            <p>Court Wizard<br>
Unique<br>
Day Abilities<br>
Time Slow<br>
1 Time Use<br>
Increases Day Length by 30 seconds and another trial to be put up (announced when done to all as “The Court Wizard has slowed down time, adding time and another trial may be cast!”</p>
<p>This ability is primarily a lategame one time use when you are down to the last few members and your court cannot decide on who to pick, this extends BD time to discuss so they can come down to an agreement. This also lets an additional trial be held if they realise they selected the wrong target.</p>
<p>Night Abilities<br>
Mirror Image<br>
1 Time Use<br>
Create a second copy of a character, the first time they are attacked at night the copy dies instead of the user, lasts until attacked</p>
<p>And extremely powerful 1 Time Use, this lets the court wizard make one person gain the “death immune” trait with 1 use, if you find the prince put this on him to make him more powerful, or if you mistakenly put it on the assassin, make your lives harder!</p>
<p>Dispel<br>
Unlimited Use<br>
Cures Poison/Bleeding and prevents the user from being occupied/redirected</p>
<p>Similar to the Physician however this cannot save a target who is attacked that night, this can only remove Poison/Bleeding. Useful since I believe the CW should share the same spawn% with a Physician so we do not crowd the support role to much.</p>
<p>Sage<br>
Day Abilities<br>
Tornado<br>
Unlimited Use<br>
Make someone swap positions with another user.</p>
<p>Tornado, but a day ability, this is so that the Sage can swap in secret while also “proving” himself with his fake abilities.</p>
<p>Night Abilities<br>
Mirror Weapon<br>
1 Time Use<br>
Lets the Assassin attack again, this stacks with double kill for a potential 3 attacks in 1 night!</p>
<p>A simple assassin empower to match the power of the BD version of the ability.</p>
<p>False Dispel<br>
Makes the user believe his poison/bleeding is cured, however it still kills them 1 day later(if it was to kill them that night, it gets extended 1 day)</p>
<p>This lets a Sage “Prove himself” with a heal, however all this does is extend the duration of the bleed/poison and dosnt let the user know they are still bleeding/poisoned. When they die they will realise it was all a dupe.</p>
