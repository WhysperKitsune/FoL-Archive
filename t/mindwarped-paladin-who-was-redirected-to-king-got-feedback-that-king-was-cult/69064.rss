    <title>Mindwarped paladin who was redirected to King got feedback that king was Cult</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mindwarped-paladin-who-was-redirected-to-king-got-feedback-that-king-was-cult/69064</link>
    <description>A drunk forced Paladin to test King and an Apostle mindwarped the Paladin at the same time.  He got feedback saying the King was Cult.  This was confusing so we executed King just to make sure and of course he was Good King.  

It should have said &quot;1 is the KIng&quot; even though mindwarped, since only an ignorance of game mechanics would have let the mindwarp have any affect besides confirming the existence of an Apostle.</description>
