#### What happened? A fool tried to occupy me night one, but for some reason it failed and I was able to kill without problem

#### What was supposed to happen? I should have been occupied and the kill prevented.

#### Steps to reproduce: Have a fool occupy an assassin night one and see what happens

#### Comments: So... yeah. Indirectly got me killed, as I shouldn&#39;t have been occupy immune!

            <p>I have had this same glitch, thought it was fixed in one of the patches. I have had this bug at least in 2 different games, maximum 3</p>
<p>Note: I know because I was assassin, not because other people’s word</p>

            <p>I have to agree with you there. I guess we will have some confirmation still some point later today or soon.</p>
<p>I’d be surprised if my reasoning was right though.</p>

            <p>That sounds possible, the problem was that the feedback I get is confusing… and the fool got feedback that I was occupy immune. Which I’m not, so I was double whammied. If that’s the case, either the fool shouldn’t be told the occupy failed, or the assassin should be told ‘A fool attempted to occupy you, but couldn’t’ otherwise I’m kinda screwed there.</p>

            <p>The occupy is the fireworks right? I believe (in my own opinion, might be wrong though) that the fool is unable to use fireworks on the Assassin as the kills are unable to be replaced by the Fool’s fireworks.</p>
<p>As I said, most likely I’m wrong, but at the same time, I think I had that problem once before when I tried to replace the Assassin’s kill with fireworks and it said that you were unable to change it.</p>
