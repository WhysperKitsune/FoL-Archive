    <title>Threatening with Reporting</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/threatening-with-reporting/8141</link>
    <description>Is it ok in game to threaten to report people if they take certain actions .

I occasionally get a game where someone will continually command everyone to do what they say or they will report everyone for throwing ..

Example

Scorney McScorneyson says &quot; if you are b d  and don&#39;t vote execute here I am reporting you for game throwing &quot;

or even 

Butler McButlerson says &quot; if you are b d  and don&#39;t vote execute here I am reporting you for game throwing &quot;

or occasionally 

Mastermind McMastermind says &quot; if you are b d  and don&#39;t vote execute here I am reporting you for game throwing &quot;

Whenever I see this it leaves a bad taste , it seems like meta gaming almost . 

Anyway is this alright or not ?</description>

<p>No.  Not even remotely.</p>
<p>Doing so should get you reported by everyone in the match.</p>

            <p>Tbh, it’s stupid, since reporting is not really part of the game itself. It’s like saying “Vote 14 or I’ll leak your nudes” to your ex <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"> In some cases it could be punishable. (The example was kinda extreme xD)</p>

            <p>It’s not a “reportable offense” to say you’re gonna report someone (just ignore them, if you didn’t do anything wrong you’ll be fine), however if it’s clearly a false report OR if it comes with extra toxicity it will count against them.</p>

            <p>Is it a reportable offense to threaten to report someone if they don’t take a certain game action ?</p>
<p>As in the example above , if someone is using the threat of report to get other players to act differently in game .</p>

            <p>Im guessing these people don’t actually file the reports they just try to use it as an edge to get people to vote with them for example</p>

            <p>Nope. False reports or threatening false reports will instead result in consequences for the reporter who falsely reported. False reporting or threatening to do so is I believe a reportable offence in itself.</p>
