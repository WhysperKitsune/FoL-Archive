    <description>Hey there Nazle here

**I have 2 suggestions that I would be very glad if you guys could state your opinions on**

**Progression system:** I feel like having somethings the players can play towards, that either being leveling up your account, doing daily challenges, can keep the player base alive. Maybe unlocking certain amount of gp at certain levels, or just tracking the level of your account. I myself would really like a system where you get certain amounts experience points after each game which you can level up your account with.

- Suggestion = awards for certain levels : gold, weapons, armor.

**Stats:**
The next suggestion I have is something that I would really like with my other suggestion, which is stats. With stats you can check wins/losses, wins with certain roles and anything else that is relevant.


**Edits**

People will just start calling people noobs and other shit like that
[/quote] 
-**You can make the level not visible for others, and that problem is solved.**

[quote=&quot;TryphonX, post:9, topic:3251&quot;]
levels leads to people thinking about their levels too much, ruining our respectful community.
[/quote] 

-  **I am more worried about the game dying from not being able to keep their player base, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily ruin the community, the level system it is a gratitude to show how much time and love you&#39;ve spent in the game as armor and weapons does.**

[quote=&quot;NuclearBurrito, post:2, topic:3251&quot;]
What would the progression actually unlock?
[/quote]
- **It doesn&#39;t have to unlock anything right now, but later the devs can figure out what they want to do with it. Myself I would just like something to play for rather than just armor and weapons because I feel like that isn&#39;t enough, and I think adding a level system to it would make sure the player base stays alive.**

[quote=&quot;orangeandblack5, post:14, topic:3251, full:true&quot;]
Honestly a progression system doesn’t have to be anything favoring those with higher levels

Everybody is already given a completely random name in-game anways, so level wouldn’t be shown in-game

Either way, leveling up is more satisfying than “play 50 games to unlock x mode or y feature” imo, and while it’s not necessary by any means the medieval RPG-like theme begs for it imo

            <p>Eh, I am done arguing.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that the current game mode is called “casual,” there will be a ranked system regardless of if I protest it.</p>

<p>I am not saying it will bring more people in, but that people will stay and play more.</p>
<p>Now my suggestion is not about a rank system but a level system. It doesn’t have to be shown for everyone else and it doesn’t mean that since I am level 20 that I am better than a level 15, its just something we can have to show our gratitude to the game.</p>

<p>About the gamethrowing, gamethrowing will always be apart of a game like this, but let me tell you something. I played a lot of ToS, till the point where everybody took the game so srsly that I never saw 1 gamethrower in ranked/trolls, not intentionally, it got to the point where I couldn’t queue up for normal ranked practise because there were to many trolls and players that didn’t take the game seriously. You have the players who play casual, - the all any types of players, the I want to take it a bit seriously, and the full on trihard. These 3 personalities does not mix well up with eachothers in 1 gamemode, and that is why they should add a competetive mode. So pretty much having a competetive system with ladders is something the game should have for those who want to take the game very seriously and stay away from the trolls, so you rather just play higher up in the ladder system.</p>

<p>I think ToL needs to differentiate itself from ToS, and having a level system for unlocking a ranked system can be better than just having a x amount of games played, and yeah ofc but in the end, the game has to have something else added than just gamemodes or else the community will get tired, and having new functions added to the game as for example a level system would make sure the player base stays alive and doesn’t die out.</p>

            <p>Message from a professional salty player: No.</p>
<p>You should be playing ToL not for levels, but for fun. I can see unlocking higher game modes with <strong>amount of games played to the end without anything to do with winning</strong> (for purpose of experienced players only), but nothing else.</p>
<p>Having a ranked system in this kind of game with conversions encourages game throwing, increases amount of false accusations of game throwing, and increases salt.</p>

            <p>I guess you could call gold the current “progression system”, levelling seems like a cool idea (maybe more RPG elements will be added in the future?).</p>
<p>Daily Challenges could also be fun IF they were done correctly.</p>

            <p>Playing enough Town of Salem I noticed the thing I wanted to grind most to show that I played a lot was having a lot of silver to show my gratitude to the game, not just silver, but grinding to get all the skins in the game. This was just an example, it doesn’t necessarily have to be this, but I know a lot of players who did the same, therefore I would like a system in Throne of Lies that can be different from just having armor and weapons.</p>
<p>Having personal stats like showing how many games you have, wins/losses and this level system is definitely some functions I  think should be added into the game.</p>

            <p>Honestly a progression system doesn’t have to be anything favoring those with higher levels</p>
<p>Everybody is already given a completely random name in-game anways, so level wouldn’t be shown in-game</p>
<p>Either way, leveling up is more satisfying than “play 50 games to unlock x mode or y feature” imo, and while it’s not necessary by any means the medieval RPG-like theme begs for it imo</p>

            <p>Yeah, but I feel still that people will get bored out by just hunting after armor and that adding a level system can also benefit with this system where you can get rewards as gp, armor, maybe weapons at certain levels. In the end it will just keep players playing which is something I want so the player base doesn’t die out.</p>
<p>Personal stats works out well, doesn’t need to be global.</p>

<p>Progression system: I feel like having somethings the players can play towards, that either being leveling up your account, doing daily challenges, can keep the player base alive. Maybe unlocking certain amount of gp at certain levels, or just tracking the level of your account. - Please come with ideas or anything at all that can help, I myself would really like a system where you get certain amounts experience points after each game which you can level up your account with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Progression system with experience and level would be really bad for this kind of game. Let me tell you how this could go bad. It will essentially look like a ranked system which also doesn’t really work well in this kind of games. People will just start calling people noobs and other shit like that, 'cause <strong>let’s be honest</strong>, every game that has any kind of levels leads to people thinking about their levels too much, ruining our respectful community.</p>

<p>Stats:</p>
<p>The next suggestion I have is something that I would really like with my other suggestion, which is stats. With stats you can check the accounts with the highest levels, most wins/losses and anything else that is relevant.</p>

</aside>
<p>No offence, but that’d be a bad idea. Personal stats could work, but global stats seems like a no no to me.</p>
<p>(I’m not a dev, so I’m not saying there’s 100% these won’t be added, it’s just my opinion)</p>

            <p>Atleast you agree with what I suggested, the devs can always work on ranked when they feel for it, right now its not something I think they shouuld focus on, but the 2 ideas I suggested is something I would like implemented as fast as possible tbh.</p>

            <p>This is probably going to hijack the thread and I apologize in advance <strong>but</strong></p>
<p>How do you suppose Ranked works in a conversion-based game? Because as far as I can see there is no good solution to prevent excessive salt or keep ranks as an actual measure of skill. And this is a problem I’ve been looking at for years.</p>
<p>That being said progression systems are fun, and ToL seems like the right theme for one.</p>
