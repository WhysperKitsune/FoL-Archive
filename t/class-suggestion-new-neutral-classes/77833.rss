    <title>[Class suggestion] New Neutral Classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-new-neutral-classes/77833</link>
    <description>I love the Neutral roles.
I want more Neutral roles.
So I decided to make some.

This is my first time making classes, please be gentle.
Feel free to suggest changes to make them more balanced or better in another way.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It has been a while since i posted but for the Patrician prehaps up the amount of gold it takes to either win or to occupy some1 who attacks you otherwise its just a class who is immune to getting killed by an assasin or cult leader since he will gain 1 gold from the visit and will use 2 to prevent the attack wich means he can get a save claim D1 with the Loyalty Bonus or Silence is golden and there is no real reason to push on him form BD and the other factions prob dont want to waste there time going trough his gold so unless the NK has a grudge against you or the prince you can get an very ez win as the class</p>

<p>Good points, I made it so that the game does not end if The Royal Vampire is still alive (like Inq) and removed the notification about how many royals there are.</p>

<p>The whispers only infect if the infected player whispers another player.<br>
But I’ve nerfed it in case Prince outs and whispers players for claims instead of asking them publicly.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna run any math on this, but I predict the whole court is gonna be infected by d4/d5.</p>
<p>No direct kill ability, infection is not an attack so it cannot be protected from, infection outs the type of NK easily.</p>
<p>While the idea might be interesting, this class will not work in this game.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not gonna run any math on it either (it’s summer vacation after all) and I wasn’t expecting it to be added, so I can live with that. Nerfed it regardless.</p>

<p>Reused names (this is me being nitpicky). I assume empower as in CW emp? But why…</p>
<p>This class is too strong. It offers too much for literally nothing compared to the other NKs. It also has self confirmation as 2 of the strongest BD, Butler and Drunk.</p>

<p>How? It would need at a perfect 2:1 Execution/Pardon rate, and it could be a Fool or an evil trying to waste a day.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Pro tip: Instead of starting with a mechanical concept, try and start with a problem that can be solved.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Problem - Investigators are far too trustworthy</p>
<p>Solution - Scorned, a class that can frame and is highly encouraged to fake claim invest</p>
<p>While not all neuts are designed this way (merc and alch don’t solve any specific issues) it tends to result in better classes more often than not.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna run any math on this, but I predict the whole court is gonna be infected by d4/d5.</p>
<p>No direct kill ability, infection is not an attack so it cannot be protected from, infection outs the type of NK easily.</p>
<p>While the idea might be interesting, this class will not work in this game.</p>

<p>Overall, I like the ideas, don’t like the execution.<br>
Neutrals need to affect the court somehow, they can’t just --exist–.</p>

            <p>Does the Royal Vampire have to also get the King killed? Or does it not count? Also, if the Terror is occ immune, It will likely out him. Especially the “occ anyone visiting you” will out him. I do not like this part. Also that occ immune killers can kill him. I don’t know what I would do to change this, because without it it’s not really unique.</p>
