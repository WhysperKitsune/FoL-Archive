    <title>Folders for PMs</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/folders-for-pms/583</link>
    <description>As a suggestion, I think that folders would be useful so we can organise PMs on these forums.

I&#39;d think that other people who are looking to host and/or play games on these forums would agree with this to an extent as it would help to keep certain things in certain places. For example, I&#39;m probably going to end up having sent around 30 if not more PMs for BtM 1 and I know that there will probably be more than I&#39;m estimating. 

I think that while it&#39;s a simple thing for the forums, not something too complicated. It&#39;s also very useful in general and therefore something I&#39;d recommend without recommending too much at the same time &lt;3 Thanks for reading and/or replying and have a nice day.</description>

            <p>Hmm I can’t find a plugin or option for this (then again it’s hard to search for this with generic keywords) – I don’t think it’s possible. If you find a plugin for “Discourse” that does this, feel free to prove me wrong and link it below ;D</p>
