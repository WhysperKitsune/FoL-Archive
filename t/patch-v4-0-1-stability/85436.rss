    <title>Patch v4.0.1 - Stability</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/patch-v4-0-1-stability/85436</link>
    <description>## Status
Live!

## Desync/Stability Fixes
* If someone leaves at the name selection screen, it&#39;ll no longer desync the party (freeze 1 minute &gt;&gt; then throw you back into the lobby). Apologies this took so long to fix! :slight_smile:   
* Local gold cache should now be better sync&#39;d with the server (eg, buying items, getting bonus gold, etc).
* Bonus gold now *always* factors in -- not just when you get MVP and other odd cases. This includes MVP voting others (5 gp per), among other bonuses.
* Bonus gp is now properly separated from win/loss gold at the end screen.
* Fixed the lobby memory leak when you&#39;re there for a long time.

## Class Fixes

* Scorned Incriminate abil now properly rewards marks as intended.
* If a Sorc gets silenced, and silence expires when they could normally use &quot;Escape Fate&quot; (at pardon/exe selection), they can now properly use it again.
* If a Sorc gets silenced, and silence expires *before* they can normally use &quot;Escape Fate&quot; in a trial, it will no longer allow it&#39;s use.
* At a trial&#39;s pardon/exe select phase, Noble/Aristo force vote abils will no longer allow its use.
* When Possessor&#39;s Puppet Strings abil forces a player into a player shielded by the Merc, there will be better feedback that you were **forced** to attack.
* [4.0.1a] Sellsword can now self-target with *Stonewall* (thx `@Sellsword` + `@Amelia`)

## Class Cards / Feedback
* Seeker&#39;s &quot;Can&#39;t Target King&quot; feedback now adjusted to explain that it&#39;s more of a fallback (the feedback is sync&#39;d with feedback - I&#39;ll add some exceptions at a later date).
* Fixed some class cards that target more than 1 player were showing &lt;Target&gt; in feedback section instead of &lt;Target List&gt; (eg, a list of players).
* Wolf Companion&#39;s &quot;Not useable until D3&quot; text moved to memo for consistency and less bloat.
* Added Inquisitor missing Heretic info about Prince+Hunter.

## Fluff

* If you&#39;re a guest of a private room, you&#39;ll now receive a toast saying {host name} treated you the court fee (free).
  * ![image|335x100](upload://8ds29waOOoD4XYthcztv9Uy0YBs.png) 
* Status icon text on the left no longer break to new lines when hovering over them.
* Silence icon prettied up a bit.
* Loading screen clipped text fixed that sometimes showed at tips.
* Less generic colors for you win/loss @ end screen.
* Player panel text now looks less pixelated in some resolutions.
* &quot;You are now the private host&quot; popup prettified.

            <h1>v4.0.1c</h1>
<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Randomized or manually-input naming now works properly again (from release-candidate revert).</li>

<li>Sellsword can now self-target with <em>Stonewall</em> (thx <code>@Sellsword</code> + <code>@Amelia</code> )</li>
<li>Enforcer can now self-target <em>Protect</em>.</li>
<li>Start Early in a public queue removes the mention of 500 gp (was just a visual error).</li>

<li>Fixed an occasional text overlap in lobby at the classic mode banner text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MVP and King vote panels now have a highlight hover/click color.</li>
