    <title>Prince losing executes to MM</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/prince-losing-executes-to-mm/9781</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I executed the MM night 3 and lost all my executes. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should&#39;ve had 2 executes left

#### Steps to reproduce:
Jail MM night 3 while he&#39;s still showing up as BD

#### Comments:
I&#39;m still very new to the game,  but I jailed a princess claim n3 after hearing from a drunk n2 that they were occ immune.  No-one in my game was sure why I was out of executes,  but best guess is that it&#39;s because MM is shown as BD for the first 3 nights.  Not sure if intended or not.</description>

            <p>That’s good to hear. I wish I had saved screenshots and logs,  but I didn’t think of it at the time.</p>

            <p>Even of he was immune to detection and with you executing him, you should not have lost your executes since you executed member of the Unseen and not the Blue Dragon.</p>

<p>This should definitely not be intended as Mastermind being seen as “Not Suspicious” has nothing to do with the Prince.</p>
