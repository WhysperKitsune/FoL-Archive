    <title>Wisp doesn&#39;t show when converted?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/wisp-doesnt-show-when-converted/45470</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
N1- Princess wisps king, see&#39;s paladin visit, but it was actually paladin AND Cult Leader

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Last I knew king should have seen 2 visitors

#### Steps to reproduce:
Wisp and convert someone

#### Comments:
Some people say wisps have never shown converts, but since I&#39;ve lost like 3 games to it, I know that isn&#39;t the case.  If something got changed it REALLY needs to say so in the Wisp Description that &quot;Converts will not be shown&quot; or something similar.

We lost because we killed the Observer who saw the Cult Leader visit because _obviously_ he was a Scorned since there was no visit that night per the wisp.</description>

            <p>Wisp at least makes sense since it tended to make the person who used it lose the game from it. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>That’s kind of an important thing to not put on abilities.</p>
<p>But… he DID see the convert with his follow in my example.  So, even that isn’t correct.</p>
