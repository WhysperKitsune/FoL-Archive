    <description>Okay so most people find fool really annoying so I&#39;m gonna try to make it not annoying
&gt; 
&gt; [color=gray]Fool, Neutral, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
&gt; =
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 1: Tricky Trickery - You are occupation/target change immune, but you won&#39;t come up to that to you&#39;re occupier/target changer
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 2: Poor Fellow - Will now only take 1 day for a new lynch to happen
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Trollbox - Same
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Deceive - Same
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Protective Troll - Heal you&#39;re self from attacks, 2 use, (note: if you do this and someone tried to occupy/target change you, they will gain a message saying you are immune to that)

I feel like scorned needs some changes soo

&gt; [color=gray]Scorned, Neutral, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
&gt;  =
&gt; Passive 1: Resolve -  Immune to attacks and occupation/target change, will not appear to be occupy/target change immune to occupier/target change
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 2: Failure - If both you&#39;re targets die after night 1 you will leave the kingdom, (note: if both targets die night 1 you will get 1 new target)
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Trollbox - Same
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Frame - Same

Also gonna add my converted version ideas cause why not?

[quote=]
 [color=lapurple]Trickster, Unseen, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
 =
Converted from the fool

Passive 1: Prankster Fellow - if you get lynched then king will lose their force vote if they are good/neut because you stole it

Passive 2: Tricky Trickery - you are occupation/target change immune but you will not appear to be that to your occupier/target changer, you also don&#39;t trigger MM&#39;s conversion recharge time

Day Ability 1: Trollbox - Same

Night Ability 1: Frame - Frame a player

Night Ability 2: Disguise - disguise as a player making you’re results exactly the same to his, unlimited uses
[/quote]

[quote=]
[color=lapurple]Nemesis (name suggested by Firekitten), Unseen, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
=
converts from scorned

Passive 1: Vengeful - You will gain 2 uses of frame and 1 extra uses of me only if one your  of  targets is lynched

Passive 2: Enraged - Immune to occupation/target change but will not appear to be that to the occupier/target changer.

Day Ability 1: Trollbox - Same 

Day Ability 2: Me Only - Use this ability to become immune to death for the night, 1 use

Night Ability 1: Frame - Frame a player 2 use.
[/quote]

Note: Scorned that won wouldn&#39;t be convertible

<p>I don’t even see why you try to make this comparison. The Mercenary assists their target, the Scorned actively goes after their targets. So obviously converting a Mercenary’s target is great for unseen and converting a Scorned’s target is not smart at all. The best strategy is to try and not kill/convert scorned’s targets and leave Scorned alone too, because they’ll just side with you trying to execute their targets and can possibly side with you later.</p>

<p>Then you can act like a scorned and get 1 target exe’d and claim scorned, generally good kings don’t like to kill scorned’s cause they could side with them and evil king wouldn’t want to exe for this reason and you could be nemesis</p>

<p>There can be 2 sheriffs, also a sheriff who hasn’t found anyone yet would be more sus than someone who found an unseen</p>

<p>Yes it does in fact how would you know he won’t sign up to an unseen member after his target dies? Also scorned can do just that, get 1 target lynched and then go with BD, converting a scorned is better than converting their target as their target would get targeted by the scorned</p>

<p>But he does have to try to confirm to it’s target that it’s still merc or else he dies, which the others don’t</p>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages and advantages for the convertible classes</p>
<p>Trickster - Advantages</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting a Trickster up on stand and killed would be unbeneficial to good/neut king as they would lose an important power</li>
<li>Even if Trickster gets killed somehow MM can just go convert another person without recharge time</li>
<li>Having an occupy/redirection immune unseen that doesn’t show is big</li>
<li>Trickster could act like a fool so everyone leaves him alone</li>
<li>Even if Trickster gets killed somehow MM can just go convert another person without recharge time</li>
</ol>
<p>Trickster - Disadvantages</p>
<ol>
<li>Loses Poor Fellow passive</li>
<li>Doesn’t help that much get majority</li>
</ol>
<p>Nemesis - Advantages</p>
<ol>
<li>There can be 2 immune unseen at night</li>
<li>Nobody believes the defense “oh I was framed” which would be a great strength of the Nemesis as she would be able to watch as this happens</li>
<li>Knows 2 BD</li>
<li>Even if Nemesis gets killed somehow MM can just go convert another person without recharge time</li>
<li>Having an occupy/redirection immune unseen that doesn’t show is big</li>
</ol>
<p>Nemesis - disadvantages</p>
<ol>
<li>Loses perma immunity</li>
<li>Doesn’t get 1 BD killed</li>
<li>Doesn’t help gain majority</li>
</ol>

            <p>Except claiming sheriff in the current meta where one guaranteed sheriff already spawns means you will be found out 50% of the time. MM is the most important member and that is ill-advised. The mercenary argument doesn’t go up, because he is BD-sided (you would know if he would be allied to an unseen and then it’d be even more stupid). It is smarter to poison and then convert his target, to get a Mercenary on your side regardless. The Sellsword is also way more powerful than the converts you have suggested.</p>

            <p>What if you really don’t want trickster/nemesis then out them as MM claim you are sheriff and get him killed and get yourself confirmed and then go on to convert anyone else since conversion trigger does not go down</p>
<p>of course you would have to ask for his permission</p>
<p>It is beneficial, like Vandalay  said before fool might backfire in his plans and BD completely ignore him</p>

            <p>This is simply not true, the double-vote is more important on good king over decide fate. Decide fate is more useful for evil kings. If you convert a fool/scorned n1, you’ve accomplished nothing. Fool/Scorned would still try to hinder BD if they hadn’t been converted and now MM cannot convert anyone else until a different unseen dies. If he simply failed his conversion attempt, he could attempt again n2. There are situations where this rework would be beneficial to the unseen, but there are definitely also plenty of scenario’s where this sets them back.</p>

            <p>Not really giving away decide fate is huge advantage and having a framer when no one expects it is huge</p>
<p>and again scorned being convertible is basically amazing esp if she was on the brink of death unable to help any evil</p>

            <p>In a lot of the cases it would actually hurt the unseen to be able to convert the fool/scorned, because they were already scum-sided neutrals to begin with and now unseen cannot convert anybody else until one of them dies. A lot of players also do not get that assassin+third convert are expendable.</p>

</aside>
<p>TO me at least the way I saw it, the main point was to lessen the pain if you hit, the alc, then the jailed guy then the fool etc… It’s not a conversion you’d strive for, but it doesn’t leave you undermanned if you happen to hit one.</p>
<p>also the one situation it may indeed be worth converting, is if his fool act completely backfired and BD has chosen to ignore him.</p>
