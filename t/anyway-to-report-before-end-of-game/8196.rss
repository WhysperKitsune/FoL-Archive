    <title>Anyway to report before end of game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/anyway-to-report-before-end-of-game/8196</link>
    <description>Basically get into a game with someone who&#39;s name is terribly racist or whatever, die on night 2 and then... can&#39;t report until the end.  Just curious if there was a way to report without waiting for the whole game or the like.</description>

            <p>Yeah there was a guy today who made his in game name “greedy game dev” and just spammed “HEY GUYS YOU CAN BUY GOLD NOW! 8000 GOLD FOR 10 BUCKS!” Obviously upset that the devs made an option to buy gold with real money. I died overnight N2 and he died overnight N3 after 3 days of spamming that. He turned out to be the priest. I have never wanted to report somebody so badly. But I didn’t wanna wait a half hour to do it. I figured he got reported enough today that he’s caught the devs attention. Hopefully.</p>

            <p>Reporting through the game is better. It’s a lot harder to deal with it like this.</p>
