<blockquote>
<p>The Gods in which the Priest prays to every night sent us a grand and holy emissary. They come to us with words of wisdom and wields great power from their heart. It is said that this humble person has the power to stop the teachings of Mithras and the power to prevent any sort of traitorous activity using his prayers to the Lord. Knights have also told that the great holy being can bring himself from death with a gift from the Gods. People have called this being… The Evangelist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Evangelist is not to be taken lightly though… some have said that they could just as easily be exposed to our enemies just as the other subjects of court are. Nobles have reported to have noticed people confessing their secrets to an unholy being, claiming that he seems more than trustworthy enough to confide in and that it brought them comfort to confess. A Sheriff had informed us once that he could not determine the identity of an Assassin because of a mysterious aura coming from some people. We didn’t know the source of the aura at first. Another instance of this weird activity comes from an Observer, who’s birds were ill one day and he could not send them out to watch people. People have infact called this powerful being… The Confessor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though… not all is doom and gloom. During a court session, we had been told that an Evangelist was murdered by The Unseen. We had thought all was lost. But as the Knights had told, a few days later a bright and powerful light was gazed upon The Evangelist and he was brought back. Our Sheriff identified a member of The Unseen and our revived Evangelist was able to detain him immediately. During the night, however, The Unseen had attempted to murder him once more, but he was more than happy to stay awake that night and bring forth Retribution. However, we did lose our Physician in the process, who was caught in the fight. The people talk about the revived Evangelist alot. But I would call him… The Martyr.</p>

<p>Pray should be a Day Ability because you need to choose your target before hand imo.<br>
<strong>I totally get you, but I feel a prayer would be done before bed. I also thought it could be treated like Psychic’s link mind</strong></p>
<p>Doesn’t Paladin own the same ability as Preach?<br>
<strong>You’re right! Perhaps I should tweak that… though, Unseen games won’t have that… so maybe I could alter it a little</strong></p>
<p>Why are they immune to reap?<br>
<strong>It’s a holy dude, Angelic almost, but I made it reap immune 1 time only as to not be overpowered asf</strong></p>
<p>So retribution basically kill anyone who kill you?<br>
<strong>Yes!</strong></p>

          <p>I’m interested to here some thoughts on the Retribution ability I got…</p>
<p>As for the Confessor, I was trying to keep it from being way more powerful than I originally wrote it…</p>
<p>Original draft Confessor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Confessor (Unseen-Investigative) - Immune to Occupation | Immune to Reap once</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability 1: Confess (3 uses)<br>
Force your target to reveal to you his Class Type</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 1: Curse (1 use)<br>
Hide Unseen members from Investigative classes tonight. (Not Sus)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability 2: Shun (3 uses)<br>
If your Target uses any Day abilities, his Class Type will be revealed to you at the beginning of the next Night Phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDITS:<br>
Changed Confessor to have 3 uses of Confess<br>
Added Night Ability Confessor “Miracle”<br>
Changed Retribution ability, unsure though</p>

          <p>I’m going to post what I’ve got for the Lore. ALSO! I’ve put forward a semi-suggestion for a new Type:</p>
<p><code>Divine</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gods in which the Priest prays to every night sent us a grand and holy emissary. They come to us with words of wisdom and wields great power from their heart. It is said that this humble person has the power to stop the teachings of Mithras and the power to prevent any sort of traitorous activity using his prayers to the Lord. Knights have also told that the great holy being can bring himself from death with a gift from the Gods. People have called this being… The Evangelist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Evangelist is not to be taken lightly though… some have said that they could just as easily be exposed to our enemies just as the other subjects of court are. Nobles have reported to have noticed people confessing their secrets to an unholy being, claiming that he seems more than trustworthy enough to confide in and that it brought them comfort to confess. A Sheriff had informed us once that he could not determine the identity of an Assassin because of a mysterious aura coming from some people. We didn’t know the source of the aura at first. Another instance of this weird activity comes from an Observer, who’s birds were ill one day and he could not send them out to watch people. People have infact called this powerful being… The Confessor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though… not all is doom and gloom. During a court session, we had been told that an Evangelist was murdered by The Unseen. We had thought all was lost. But as the Knights had told, a few days later a bright and powerful light was gazed upon The Evangelist and he was brought back. Our Sheriff identified a member of The Unseen and our revived Evangelist was able to detain him immediately. During the night, however, The Unseen had attempted to murder him once more, but he was more than happy to stay awake that night and bring forth Retribution. However, we did lose our Physician in the process, who was caught in the fight. The people talk about the revived Evangelist alot. But I would call him… The Martyr.</p>
</blockquote>
