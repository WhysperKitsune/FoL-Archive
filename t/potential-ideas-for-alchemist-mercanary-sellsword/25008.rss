    <title>Potential Ideas for Alchemist/Mercanary/Sellsword</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/potential-ideas-for-alchemist-mercanary-sellsword/25008</link>
    <description>EDIT: If this is supposed to be in the Feedback Section, I apologise, and if someone is able to move it then that is appreciated.

So I tend to find a lot of games where the Alch and the Merc are generally voted off or killed by Prince because they are Neutral and Blue Dragon tend to just go &#39;Oh well&#39; and move on, whilst Unseen/Cult generally execute them and I have been thinking of some ideas to improve their gameplay.

For Alchemist I would add a passive called &#39;Potion of Fate&#39; where if you are voted up by the court, you survive one round of voting (regardless of Execution or Pardon) however you lose your night abilities as a result. You also dont survive a 2nd round of voting. I would also reduce Stoneskin from 4 to 3.

This is because it would stop people just going  &#39;Oh hes alch, exe anyway&#39; As he would survive, it would also Stop any &#39;Yolobombing&#39; after this as he would lose night abilities. It also wastes the courts time to vote him up again too. I feel Stoneskin should remain after this as he basically just turns into a free target for the Unseen or Prince after this, but would suggest reducing it to 3 as the Alch wouldnt need to worry too much about night immunity after he is proven alch if he is voted up.

For Mercenary I would add the passive &#39;Obligation&#39;. This would mean if you are voted up by the court, your contract gets 2 votes instead of 1. 

This increases the chances of the Mercenary surviving a court vote. I would also consider removing &#39;Looking for work&#39; and instead of having to find a contract within 3 days, if your first contract dies, you are randomly assigned a new contract the next full day your first contract dies (EG If contract dies N2, you will receive new contract D3. If your contract dies by execution D3, you will get a new contract D4)

For Sellsword I would add a day ability &#39;Remember Me&#39; of 1 use. This ability would posion your former contract if you are killed that day or following night. (EG if used D5 and are executed, the Contract is poisoned N5, If you die N5, you are poisoned N5) This does allow for the former contract to be healed and not killed, and gives the Sellsword some survivability. I would also suggest it not being a passive in case the contract is a member of the Unseen.


Just some ideas floating in my head. The Alch im not so sure on, but the Merc/SS ideas I like.

Any feedback?</description>

            <p>Eh, for Alchemist, if you declare yourself as one to the King before they even have a chance to check you, they will <em>usually</em> leave you alone from what I’ve found.</p>
<p>Sellsword is already the most powerful convert for Unseen, too. It doesn’t need anything else.</p>

            <p>I disagree with everything but obligation and the random assigning of contracts. I really think mercs contract should have more control and the merc shouldn’t be able to pick his contract. That leads to the merc taking sides.</p>

<p>For me, mercs biggest problem is that unless thy are merc for the prince, I think they should be executed by BD every game. Even if the merc’s target is BD now, the target or the merc might be converted, and then the merc is just another unseen player.<br>
I think mercs should be unconvertable, and unique. Right now, its worth to exe every single merc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Regarding The Merc, Im trying to make it more appealing for them to be alive not dead. Its not really fun when you win but you died early on, the fate is sort of out of your hands.</p>
<p>I agree the prince is an issue, but cant think of a current solution to it.</p>

            <p>Not true. It’s more efficient to convert the contract than the Merc. But since the Merc blocks convert that isn’t likely to happen either. If he is on prince however then they would definitely want to convert the Merc to leave the prince vulnerable.</p>
<p>If the contract is unseen/cult then the Merc is even more likely to not be converted and possablely knows who the unseen/cult are. That means it is a good idea to kill the contract instead and force the Merc to contact BD and out the unseen/cult.</p>

<p>Terrible idea. Every alch claim will now be, lets exe, and see if he is really an alch,<br>
And alch will be auto win and not fun at all.<br>
This is game of deceit, the point of alch is to survive the court too. Just make the king trust you and you win.</p>
