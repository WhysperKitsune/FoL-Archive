    <description>**Mariner** (Blue Dragon)

Passive:
**Davey Jones&#39; Locker** - If you are killed on a night you successfully use your &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; night ability, your visitors will be &#39;wisped&#39; to the player you targeted.

_^ &quot;Wisped&quot; meaning your visitors&#39; names will be given to the person you used your ability on, like a Princess&#39; Wisp ability. Read about the &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; ability below, and note that the targeted player will need an extra day to be able to tell anyone what they saw. XD_

Day Ability:
**Leave Port** - Use your &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; ability on yourself tonight, using up 2 charges of the ability. (1 use.)

Night Ability 1:
**Bon Voyage** - Remove a player from the next day&#39;s proceedings. They will not be present to talk, to vote or be voted, and cannot use any day abilities or have any day abilities used on them. Everyone is notified in chat when this occurs. (3 uses.)

_^ Prince could be exempt from this, allowing him to use day abilities whether this is used on him or his target._

Night Ability 2:
**Sailor&#39;s Knot** - Select four players, preventing them all from attacking each other. (2 uses.)

_^ In other words, none of the 4 you select can attack any of the other 3 you selected. They will be prevented if they try. They **can** attack anyone else you haven&#39;t selected, and they can be attacked BY anyone else you haven&#39;t selected._

**Pirate** (Unseen)

Passive:
**Ghost Ship** - On nights you successfully use your &quot;Shanghai&quot; ability, you will not appear as a visitor to classes such as the Observer or Princess.

Night Ability 1:
**Shanghai** -  Remove a player from the next day&#39;s proceedings. They will not be present to talk, to vote or be voted, and cannot use any day abilities or have any day abilities used on them. Everyone is notified in chat when this occurs. (3 uses.)

_^ Prince could be exempt from this, allowing him to use day abilities whether this is used on him or his target._

Night Ability 2:
**Kraken&#39;s Grip** - Select four players, preventing them all from visiting each other. (2 uses.)

_^ This is the same as the Mariner&#39;s &quot;Sailor&#39;s Knot&quot; ability, but for visits in general instead of just attacks._</description>
