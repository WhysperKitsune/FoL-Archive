    <description># *&quot;Come hither, and help me with my work...&quot;*

&gt; ## The Apprentice [Neutral Special]
&gt; ### Passives
&gt; **Contracted** - Instead of your contractor visiting and doing their night action, you will do it instead.
&gt; **Apprenticeship** - You gain all of the passives that your contractor has.
&gt; ## Day Abilities
&gt; None
&gt; ## Night Abilities
&gt; **Make a contract** - Choose someone to become their apprentice. When they die, if more than 3 days have passed, you will become their class with all uses of limited abilities that they had. They will win if you finish their objective. *Inf uses, you will be occupy immune while doing this. If it succeeds, you will lose use of this ability*
&gt;
&gt; **Workshop accident** - Instead of doing their night action for your contractor, you will attack them. *1 use*
&gt; ## *Goal: Make a contract with another player and furfill their win condition*

### You can make a contract with any class
### This class is unique
### If it contracts someone who is later converted (or possessed), The Apprentice will be alerted.
### The contractor will be alerted that they have an apprentice.</description>
