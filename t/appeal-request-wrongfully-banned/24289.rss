    <title>Appeal Request: Wrongfully Banned</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/appeal-request-wrongfully-banned/24289</link>
    <description>I was reported for &quot;Gamethrowing/cheating with LadyLokari (admitting it) +VCs sharing private info. Naming yourself identifiably to RL friend (cheating). Final chance. http://i.imgur.com/Yy9zA3U.png&quot;.

First off, I have never played with any real life friends. Secondly, the conversation that took place wasn&#39;t even me. I was neither of the characters in the game and I never said any of that.

When banning, do you actually check to see if the offender was listed as one of those characters? I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never even had those names as my character in game.

Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Alright, we found it. Not sure what exactly happened there that caused you to get suspended instead of the actual offender. Maybe a Court Wizard swapped you two and we didn’t notice.<br>
In any case, we apologize, the suspension should be gone. Let me know if there are still issues logging in.</p>

            <p>I haven’t recently changed it to this, been the same for the whole time I’ve played. Here is the screenshot before hitting 1-click login. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8V2ME" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://imgur.com/a/8V2ME</a></p>

            <p>So, we can’t actually find an account with that name.<br>
Have you previously changed your account name to this? And if so do you remember what it was before?<br>
Also, could you please post a screenshot of your main ToL screen (before you hit “1-click log in” where it shows your account name)?</p>
