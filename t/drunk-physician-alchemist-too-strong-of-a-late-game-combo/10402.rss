    <title>Drunk+Physician/Alchemist Too Strong of a Late Game Combo</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/drunk-physician-alchemist-too-strong-of-a-late-game-combo/10402</link>
    <description>Right now if Drunk and Physician/Alchemist make it to the late game they create a nearly unstoppable chain of immunity with Drunk redirecting any attacks on the healer to himself and preventing it, and the healer healing the Drunk making him immune. I&#39;m not really sure what needs to be done here but this is very unfair and feels bad for neutral killing and cult/unseen killing roles.</description>

            <p>Unlike with other methods Occupy immunity is all you need to get past the drunk. Since both the MM and CL have means of bypassing occupation this has counterplay.</p>

            <p>is worth noting, the drunk actually can be a bane with protecting from conversion from the unseen.</p>
<p>Sheriff catches an unseen, CW walls sheriff, Drunk protects sheriff. MM tries to convert sheriff</p>
<p>CW is redirected to drunk, MM is occupy immune, he converts sheriff.</p>

            <p>I did this yesterday onKylestreamstuff. I was the butler and turned out he was the alchemist (I didn’t know he was the alchemist at the time!). But when the alchemist was outed and not killed, I just spam Debauched him and he healed me. This meant the only way to stop us was to convert me (which didn’t happen).</p>
<p>The big difference as Floofyboy stated is because the drunk is occupy immune, anything targeting the alchemist is countered and anything targeting the drunk is also countered, except the convert. Daily powers such as poison and bleed cannot stop it either. As there were already 3 unseen in the game, we were always confirmed as they could not stop us, so we were easily able to pick apart the unseen. Had I been converted then it would have stopped.</p>

            <p>Only real difference is the drunk can force players to redirect to him so phys doesnt have to guess who to heal. But the mechanic doesnt really need work. You should work around that. Get one of em voted off, or have one of your unseen/cult pretend to be poisoned so phys goes to them instead. If nothing works, then lose with grace.</p>

            <p>Not very different from alch/phys protecting each others, or knight/phys protecting each others, etc. Drunk just became yet another protective role. I do admit too many of those might not be the best thing.</p>
