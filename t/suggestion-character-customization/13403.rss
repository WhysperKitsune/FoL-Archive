    <title>[Suggestion]Character Customization</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-character-customization/13403</link>
    <description>I suggest we have a &quot;Pirate Custome&quot; For M/F Characters, perhaps a 1,500 / 2,500 Priced item, that can be used on both genders making it a one time purchase with a little cute parrot on your shoulder and a hook for a hand
Anyone Agreed?

- Edit 

Perhaps also a pirate hat with a Skull/boneman on</description>
