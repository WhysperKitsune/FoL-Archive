    <title>How i feel about the game in it&#39;s current stage</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-i-feel-about-the-game-in-its-current-stage/2614</link>
    <description>This review was originally made for steam. But due to the fact that game isn&#39;t released yet i figured i might as well post it here under feedback. Enjoy!

I won this game off of a giveaway on YouTube, so i decided to check it out and try the game while it was in Beta. so basically i&#39;m going to give you pros and cons based off of what i played.

Disclaimer: Like i said, this game is still in Beta, so by the time you actually read this, some of the problems may be fixed

Pros:

- The developers put time into making the class cards and the backgrounds. So it does feel like your in a medieval time based setting.
- As an evil class you can make a interactive death note that you can draw and basically make whatever you want
- For cosmetics, you can change the character models by purchasing them in the characters tab (This is done by using in game money you receive from winning in a match.)
-Tons of classes, like i said i just got the game so i still haven&#39;t gotten the chance to play all of them.
-Developers/moderators are very active in the game and the discord server for the game. (in my second match i played with xblade himself.
Cons:
-Not many people are currently playing the game, so finding a match is hard at the moment (I expected this, since it is in Beta, and the game hasn&#39;t fully released yet.)
- Having to register before you are able to play the game (I&#39;m lazy i know)
- In my opinion some classes have abilities that should be restricted from night one until night two. For example the prince is able to execute on the first night (Honestly, i don&#39;t see how this is useful considering you can claim anything on the first night and get away with it)

In this next section i&#39;m going to describe how the game is played:

So basically, just like town of Salem people stand in a circle with everyone deciding who is the evils that are destroying the kingdom, who is innocent and part of their faction, and who is neutral. Players click on the person that they believe is evil until a set number of votes that are required are reached to put the person on trial. From this point the factions decide to execute, or pardon the person on trial (This ability can be overrided by the king if he wishes to have the person killed or pardoned.) below this description of the game i&#39;m going to explain four factions that are in the game.

Blue Dragon: The Blue Dragon are the innocents, their job is to find the cult and the unseen before they are killed and the other groups take over as the majority in the kingdom.
The Unseen: Their job is to kill the Blue dragon members and spread their influences throughout the kingdom to gain more power.
The Cult: Same as the unseen when it comes to their goal, but in my opinion the Cult are a bit underpowered.

If you are looking to buy access to the game you can get it by going to the official Throne of Lies Discord server:
https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB

I look forward to playing with anyone that buys the game and i hope that this game becomes more popular in the long run.</description>

            <p>Very good to know, I love how hard the developers like you and everyone else work so hard on making this game to the best of it’s capabilities. It’s definitely more than what i can say for some of the early access games out there.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the review! To address some of the cons:</p>

</aside>
<p>Since we swapped data systems, we completely revamped our registration system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords are no longer used at all</li>
<li>You no longer need to activate your email</li>
<li>We no longer ask for a Username (it’s automatically generated based on your Steam name. You can change it inside the lobby)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the process is now <strong>click the Steam button &gt;&gt; enter your email &gt;&gt; that’s it.</strong></p>

<p>Yeaaa  we’re working on this <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> there’s been a huge influx of people since alpha, though! We’re optimistic. We also are very generous with giveaways to content creators.</p>

<p>We actually implemented this. The prince can no longer kill on the 1st night. There are some further restrictions to prevent 1st night trolls, although we don’t restrict it 100%.</p>

-Not many people are currently playing the game, so finding a match is hard at the moment (I expected this, since it is in Beta, and the game hasn’t fully released yet.)</li>
<li>Having to register before you are able to play the game (I’m lazy i know)</li>
<li>In my opinion some classes have abilities that should be restricted from night one until night two. For example the prince is able to execute on the first night (Honestly, i don’t see how this is useful considering you can claim anything on the first night and get away with it)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this next section i’m going to describe how the game is played:</p>
<p>So basically, just like town of Salem people stand in a circle with everyone deciding who is the evils that are destroying the kingdom, who is innocent and part of their faction, and who is neutral. Players click on the person that they believe is evil until a set number of votes that are required are reached to put the person on trial. From this point the factions decide to execute, or pardon the person on trial (This ability can be overrided by the king if he wishes to have the person killed or pardoned.) below this description of the game i’m going to explain four factions that are in the game.</p>
<p>Blue Dragon: The Blue Dragon are the innocents, their job is to find the cult and the unseen before they are killed and the other groups take over as the majority in the kingdom.<br>
The Unseen: Their job is to kill the Blue dragon members and spread their influences throughout the kingdom to gain more power.<br>
The Cult: Same as the unseen when it comes to their goal, but in my opinion the Cult are a bit underpowered.</p>
<p>If you are looking to buy access to the game you can get it by going to the official Throne of Lies Discord server:<br>

<p>I look forward to playing with anyone that buys the game and i hope that this game becomes more popular in the long run.</p>
