    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Reaper</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-reaper/2556</link>
    <description>Within sinners, liars and slayers, dwell souls who use their purity in increasing extent for the unjust purpose of giving life to those unworthy people. When surrounded by the truth, these empty bodies demonstrate their true nature, using slander to get rid of a just judgment. These beings betray their alliances, their people. There is no difference between a murderer and a corrupt king, or between a loyal prince and a treacherous knight, because all of them have their hands covered with blood; blood shed by their own selfish judgment. There is no justice when everyone is wrong. 

My function is to rid the soul, the pure essence of a being, of this rot.

My job is to show that your body, disgusting and dirty, means nothing to others without the soul that dwells in it. 

There are bodies that sin. There are bodies that lie. There are bodies that kill.
They all carry a soul.
A soul that is not theirs.
A soul that belongs to me.
All of you were already empty without it, after all.</description>
