    <title>Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/thumbs-up-and-thumbs-down/29067</link>
    <description>Okay, guys here&#39;s the thing...

There are a lot of things that are report worthy. Game throwing, leaving because you didn&#39;t like your class. The Devs made sure to cover this area well. However, there are small offenses which are not report-worthy. I think the greatest example of this would be the toxic behavior that is persistent in this game and in a lot of other online games.
My suggestion is to add a Thumbs Up and a Thumbs Down button on each player at the end screen.
Thumbing someone up would mean not that he was respectable or anything like that. Having respect is the basic, being nice to one another is also the basic. Thumbing up means that person when the extra mile. Either he was very good at the game, or he was very pleasant to play with, or any little thing that made this session of the game above average.
Thumbing someone down means they did something bad but not report-worthy. That person did not throw the game or left on the first day. He was a nuisance, was toxic to you or someone else. One simple example of this is a game I had yesterday where the reaper, frustrated that he got caught, made it so his last words were a Star Wars spoiler. Should I report him for that? No. But is that a cool behavior? No! So at that time I really wish I had a way of telling him and people who find him in the future that he&#39;s not the nicest of the players.
The way I think about it, getting a few thumbs down wouldn&#39;t do any harm. The fact is that after an X amount of thumbs down, you would be shown as an unfriendly player. That, of course, could be reversed with thumbs up. The same applies to thumbs up, a player with numerous thumbs up would show as a friendly player.
In the end of a period, could be a month, a trimester, anything, friendly players could be rewarded and unfriendly players penalized. Nothing big but enough to say &quot;hey, thanks for being nice to the community.&quot;.</description>

            <p>Yeah, it could work, but people can’t downvote you for downvoting them since they won’t know, so it doesn’t really fix the problem</p>

            <p>There could be a system where the more downvotes you have in place the less of an impact your own vote makes. I’m not supporting this system fully but definately think it shouldn’t easily be dismissed.</p>

            <p>On gmod it is fine. Roblox has a far far lower average age which probably explains this.</p>

            <p>It’s pretty simple,  after you<br>
a. Die<br>
b. Escape</p>
<p>You get the results of the game, by their names is a thumbs up/thumbs down button. There is 1 category for giving props. The other four for reporting. I.E Botting, helping the killer etc.</p>
