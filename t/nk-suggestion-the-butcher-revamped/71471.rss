    <title>[NK Suggestion] The Butcher Revamped</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/nk-suggestion-the-butcher-revamped/71471</link>
    <description>Another change cause FireKitten always knows best

* **Steel Behemoth (Passive)** - Immunity to occupation, redirection, poison, bleeding and death at night.
* **False Pretenses (Passive)** - When being healed, it appears as a false positive.
* **Unwarranted Provocation (Day - 2 Uses)** Force target player to target you tonight
* **Butcher’s Wrath (Day - 2 Uses after N3)** Bypass any redirection or life immunity tonight
* **&quot;Self Defense&quot; (Night - Infinite uses)** Kill any players that target you tonight
* **Hidden Nightmare (Night - Infinite uses after N3)** Chose target player, kill all that target/defend them
* **Meet Your Maker (Night - Infinite uses after N3)** Only usable while jailed. If you were jailed and the Prince does not execute you, you may kill the Prince.
*Win Condition*
* Take down any who stand in your way

**Strategy**
I suggest imitating either a drunk or a butler. Simple way to not get caught early would be to just occupy/redirect anyone but don&#39;t kill them. Also gives you an easy way to verify you&#39;re a drunk if you redirect someone and they attack you. You definitely can use the Unseen/Cult to your advantage; Anyone they poison/bleed is your target for attempted mass murder.</description>

            <p>I just think it’s more safe in case you call out that you’re bleeding when you aren’t and then the phys/alch that heals you also gets healed which would mean you just got outed</p>
