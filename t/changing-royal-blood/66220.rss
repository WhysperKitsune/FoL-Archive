    <title>Changing Royal Blood</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/changing-royal-blood/66220</link>
    <description>I honestly feel like RB is too good at confirming BD classes (or at least that they were originally BD) and ruining common evil claims. Many, MANY things have been changed through this game&#39;s history so it&#39;s harder to connfirm stuff, so I&#39;d like to see RB changed, but still kept somewhat the same role.

- First off, when King dies, anyone can now step up right away, Royal Blood or not, it doesn&#39;t matter.
- Once everyone has stepped up, you vote on whoever you want, whether they have RB or not.
- Votes for RB players are now worth 3x the votes against those without.
- Everyones votes are now kept anonymous.

What this does is keeps the same idea for Royal Blood, but without the confirmation. Now you&#39;d see a confirmation when you see how a person with 2 votes (with RB) beats out a person with 3 votes, so you&#39;d know your new king had royal blood, but this cuts out so much of the confirmation and allows evils to claim things they couldn&#39;t before. Noble is now a better claim for more than just Possessor (since they jump anyways, who cares if you&#39;re claiming a RB class?). Princess is a way better claim for MM, Drunk is a much better claim for OG or Butler-converted Invokers, etc.

I like the idea behind Royal Blood, but we need less things that confirm in the game. Social deduction games are like a puzzle that you have 80-90% of the pieces, but the last 10-20% should still be based on a bit of chance and trusting others, as though these people have the last few pieces to your jigsaw puzzle. When so many things are still confirmable (Mystic Link, Merc Guard, Butler Party, Drunk Deb/HH, Hunter Wolf, Noble Day Abilities, CW Tornado); I just think we could do with one less.</description>

            <p>You could allow all RB classes a once per game ability to “Renounce Claim” in exchange for something (death immunity? Visit prevention? A self-heal?). So MM claiming Princess can say they got scared of dying when they outed the assassin d4 and sacrificed their Royal Blood that night.</p>

            <p>True, but the problem is that is your only excuse if that was the case.</p>
<p>Like I said. you would have to rely on a specific class to spawn, target you with an ability , before a king dies and rbs step up.</p>
<p>It’s a really specific set of conditions which, I would not mind, but i feel it would not remove RB’s confirmability , but a unique way for a class to cause deception for its own benefit</p>
<p>(excuse me if im speaking nonsense &gt;.&lt;)</p>

            <p>I think the simplest solution to the royal blood confirmation thing is introducing a class that can remove someone else’s royal blood passive.  So that there is a plausible explanation for not stepping up as royalty (mastermind claiming princess especially).</p>

            <p>I support this.</p>
<p>Honestly I’d actually like Noble Blood to be a double-edged weapon. I liked the idea of the Pretender class I saw that wants to get all Noble Blood killed and be elected King, so having Noble Blood not be an immediately confirmable passive and instead something that only gets confirmed after the King election is a good change.</p>

            <p>I honestly feel like RB is too good at confirming BD classes (or at least that they were originally BD) and ruining common evil claims. Many, MANY things have been changed through this game’s history so it’s harder to connfirm stuff, so I’d like to see RB changed, but still kept somewhat the same role.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, when King dies, anyone can now step up right away, Royal Blood or not, it doesn’t matter.</li>
<li>Once everyone has stepped up, you vote on whoever you want, whether they have RB or not.</li>
<li>Votes for RB players are now worth 3x the votes against those without.</li>
<li>Everyones votes are now kept anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<p>What this does is keeps the same idea for Royal Blood, but without the confirmation. Now you’d see a confirmation when you see how a person with 2 votes (with RB) beats out a person with 3 votes, so you’d know your new king had royal blood, but this cuts out so much of the confirmation and allows evils to claim things they couldn’t before. Noble is now a better claim for more than just Possessor (since they jump anyways, who cares if you’re claiming a RB class?). Princess is a way better claim for MM, Drunk is a much better claim for OG or Butler-converted Invokers, etc.</p>
<p>I like the idea behind Royal Blood, but we need less things that confirm in the game. Social deduction games are like a puzzle that you have 80-90% of the pieces, but the last 10-20% should still be based on a bit of chance and trusting others, as though these people have the last few pieces to your jigsaw puzzle. When so many things are still confirmable (Mystic Link, Merc Guard, Butler Party, Drunk Deb/HH, Hunter Wolf, Noble Day Abilities, CW Tornado); I just think we could do with one less.</p>
