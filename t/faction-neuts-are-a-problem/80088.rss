    <title>&#39;Faction neuts&#39; are a problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/faction-neuts-are-a-problem/80088</link>
    <description>I am reffering 3 neuts I feel that are really problematic, alch, merc, pretender (knowing that pretender is agreed upon most community as a role that should be deleted, I will not talk about him here).

The alch and the merc have very passive or friendly abilities and objective, which gives them the option to open claim d1 and just &#39;do their thing&#39; until game ends without many problems.

I am sure that everyone on these forums played the game a ton and knows that winning or losing by the decision of a neut not only feels bad, but also fake.

My suggestion, is remake or remove merc and alch to have a more aggressive objective that cannot be ignored like fool/scorned/inq, and once any neuts finishes its objectives, he can no longer vote, and doesn&#39;t count as a living player. (for example, if a winning neut, and 3 other people are alive, only 2 people are needed to up for trial), that way, neuts no longer can dictate the winner of the game based on their agenda, they are just neuts who need to complete their objective silently.</description>

            <p>The original merc was great honestly it needs to be back but less powerful.</p>
<p>The concept really was there and it was really fun to play with it, the execution was that the merc was totally busted, have something like 4 nights of protection + 1-2 where he can kill all attackers.</p>
<p>But the concept of having someone who needs to side with someone else, and comply to their win condition as well as keep them alive just sounds great overall.</p>

            <p>I always look at it as “it’s the neutral slot nothing you can do about it”</p>
<p>I think two stone skins might make alchemist more easier for scum to deal with, In general being a physician that is un-convertable seems un-fun to me so I generally don’t claim day 1, a lot of others on the other hand will just open claim for the easy meta win.</p>
<p>Brilder Mercenary in general has never been that great of a neutral for me in general just easy to win and boring wincon in comparison to the  original mercenary design, not saying I hate getting mercenary it’s just not as good as most other neutrals.</p>
<p>And that thing called pretender by far is the worst neutral ever created by mankind.</p>

            <p>When it was like this (because this was a thing at one point), due to neither Cultseen nor BD being a reliable ally, the Alchemists HAD to be hidden at first and actively gain favor with someone (either scum or BD depending on situation and playstyle), rather than just claiming alch and being ignored like now.</p>
<p>Your issue was that they had “the option to open claim d1 and just ‘do their thing’ until game ends without many problems.” due to being passive and friendly.</p>
<p>So if we change their kit’s to force them to be more active then problem solved.</p>
<p>You don’t need to make them anti-BD to solve the problem you mentioned.</p>

I am actually salty that the situation is as bad as it gets, I usually claim D1 “Pret here siding evils”, nobody cares, kills king n2-n3, “elect me im pret siding evils” (In this stage I only post logs if I found K.O Royal or if I am asked to), always gets elected, usually someone tries to tell BD to kill me at this point, but I simply vote him, make up a reason why he is evil, he gets exed and everyone forgets. --&gt; that happens every game I roll pretender.</p>

“This person accused a flipped townie of being scum, Prince exe them”<br>
Truth potion was the worst. It was what made Alch the BD dog much like Pretender being buff princess.</p>

            <p>The more brilders required to win, thr less overall Occ immunes you can have for “Fairer” gameplay. If you need 10 Brilders to win but you have 3 Butlers and 3 Drunks, you basically can’t win. With 6 in this situation you <em>might</em> pull this off, despite it being improbable.</p>

            <p>My solution that keeps their true neutral status:</p>
<p>Alch - Bring back JOAT alch minus tar potion. Tweak the specifics a bit but the idea is the same. Truth potion has a cascading effect that ends up making Alchemist valuable enough for scum to kill while suspicious enough for BD to kill but also powerful enough to be fun to play as Alch in the first place.</p>
<p>Merc - Increase brilder’s needed to win. The idea is that if the game will usually end before he wins, then a merc must actively stall the game in order to win. This requires active play.</p>

            <p>Heya<br>
Joke post incoming, dont be offended :3</p>
<p>If ya wanna make them bad, make sure as Alchemist to shank somebody and do some shenanigans. It’s incredibly easy to make ppl distrust Alchs <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also lol day 1 claiming these people have no brains</p>

            <p>I am reffering 3 neuts I feel that are really problematic, alch, merc, pretender (knowing that pretender is agreed upon most community as a role that should be deleted, I will not talk about him here).</p>
<p>The alch and the merc have very passive or friendly abilities and objective, which gives them the option to open claim d1 and just ‘do their thing’ until game ends without many problems.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone on these forums played the game a ton and knows that winning or losing by the decision of a neut not only feels bad, but also fake.</p>
<p>My suggestion, is remake or remove merc and alch to have a more aggressive objective that cannot be ignored like fool/scorned/inq, and once any neuts finishes its objectives, he can no longer vote, and doesn’t count as a living player. (for example, if a winning neut, and 3 other people are alive, only 2 people are needed to up for trial), that way, neuts no longer can dictate the winner of the game based on their agenda, they are just neuts who need to complete their objective silently.</p>
