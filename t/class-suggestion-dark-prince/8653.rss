    <title>[Class Suggestion] Dark Prince</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-dark-prince/8653</link>
    <description>**Dark Prince (Offensive)**

The Dark Prince is Neutral.

He is death immune at night.

As long as the Dark Prince is alive, the Prince&#39;s jail ability is disabled, but he is also immune to death at night.

----------


**Day Ability 1:**
Jail someone of your choice. Works just like the prince.
The jailed person will not know he is jailed by the Dark Prince. It will look like he was jailed by the prince.


**Night Ability 1:**
Execute. 3 charges. You keep your charges even if your wrong. If you execute 3 people and you still haven&#39;t executed the prince, you commit suicide and lose the game.


**Comments:**
The Dark Prince&#39;s winning condition is to execute the prince.</description>

            <p>You inspired me and I submitted a similar idea: <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-hitman/8864" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-hitman/8864</a></p>
<p>I think that your win condition is way too specific.</p>

            <p>I mostly wanted to avoid the whole:</p>
<p>“Hey i got jailed”<br>
“Me too!!!”<br>
“There’s a dark prince!!!”</p>
<p>But maybe ur right.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, Prince should still be able to jail, but get priority if you both choose the same target.</p>
<p>Interesting idea though.</p>
