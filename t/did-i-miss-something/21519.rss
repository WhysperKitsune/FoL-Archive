    <title>Did I miss something?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/did-i-miss-something/21519</link>
    <description>So there was a patch today. And afterwards I played in a possessor game where 14 died and was a physician. But then that night 14 was in the graveyard saying 1 was possessor. I honestly didn&#39;t stay very much longer but does possessor not appear as that persons class when they jump now? Or was this guy trolling?</description>

            <p>It sounds like he figured out who the nk was and was trying to pass it along? I don’t think a jump was involved at all.</p>
