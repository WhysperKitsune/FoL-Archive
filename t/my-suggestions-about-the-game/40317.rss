    <title>My suggestions about the game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/my-suggestions-about-the-game/40317</link>
    <description>Hey, here are a bunch of things i&#39;d like to suggest, and since it looks like this is the place, here we go.

First of, i&#39;d bring back Priest. Abilities: Heal, Bring back a DK, can speak with the dead. Unique. Unconvertable?

Then i&#39;d change Physician/Medic so he can only remove poison. We can hop onto the upcoming patch with the quarantine thing? 

Alchemist would become then the only other healer, with priest (being unique), making them more valuable.

As for king, i don&#39;t really like Allies, so i suggest this one: Audience: You and your target can whisper with each other without it being known to others. Great way to have a little chat with a Prince or a MM? 

Thoughs?</description>
