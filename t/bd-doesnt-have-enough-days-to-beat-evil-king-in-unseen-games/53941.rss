    <title>BD doesn&#39;t have enough days to beat evil king in unseen games</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bd-doesnt-have-enough-days-to-beat-evil-king-in-unseen-games/53941</link>
    <description>BD have no way to win against evil king without extra time. evil king can&#39;t even make mistakes without exing a bd.

I&#39;ve seen games unseen get majority in d4!

Since DK is out now, bd lose almost every evil king game.

Even when the king is good, its hard to win without the prince wispering strategy because there is no way to find unseen fast enough without wishpers and no one trust king anymore.


my suggestions.

1. assasin can use 2 for 1 only after mm is dead
2. revert the inquisitor killing ability
3. allow prince to exe since n2 (like king)
4. make sheriff find mm at n3</description>

            <p>I think making the MM easier to find is the wrong choice. While evil king games may be unusually tough, I’ve seen far too many games where the unseen stood no chance because the sheriff happened to check the MM randomly on N4. This would more than double that number of non-games.</p>
<p>I’d be okay with letting the prince start executing on N2. Yes, that’s a slight buff for the prince, but is it even that much of a buff? How many princes would actually use it? Maybe I play prince over-cautiously, but it’s hard to feel comfortable executing someone from one night of information.</p>
<p>I also think the existing butler poison change helps at least a little bit, since it’s far less likely that you’ll need to waste a day hanging the evil king once he does something to out himself (execute prince, etc.).</p>
