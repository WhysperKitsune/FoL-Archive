    <description>I just had a game where a merc was contracted to a merc who was contracted to Prince.  It was great because you couldn&#39;t kill any of the three, and you could only convert one of the mercs (you didn&#39;t know which), and even if you did that you still couldn&#39;t kill or convert the other merc and Prince.  So Prince was invulnerable, needless to say BD won.  Was fun.</description>
