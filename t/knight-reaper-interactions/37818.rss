    <description>#### What happened?

So, today I was playing Knight. I got a lucky guard N1, killing an Assassin, had a deathnote. N2 I guarded the Reaper&#39;s target (I know that for sure since I asked him later). I died with a message that I killed someone while guarding and that my soul was reaped. Since it was a second attack on me, I died (nothing strange here). Stranger things happened later:

1. Reaper died N3. I asked him how that happened, he said he got Prince exed. However, after he died, I saw my deathnote near his name (and everyone else did).
2. I was later revived as a Death Knight, which shouldn&#39;t be possible since I was reaped.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

1. Deathnote on Reaper should have been different.
2. A Physician shoudn&#39;t have been able to revive me.

#### Steps to reproduce:

* Be a Knight
* Have one successful guard
* Die on your second guard while guarding a Reaper&#39;s target

#### Comments:

Sorry for not providing screenshots, my first bug report here. Will do next time :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I’m pretty sure not reviving a reaped person was a thing even for Phys for quite some time. However, I can’t find anything about this in abilities’ descriptions anymore. I also can’t find info about this particular change of Reap ability in patch notes. Some clarification is definitely required.</p>

            <p>The death note indeed sounds like a bug. though may be a bit greyer of an area (perhaps prince had no death note, reaper isn’t “immune” he spends souls to come to life if he’s killed, technically both you and the prince killed him, so maybe if prince had no note, your note counts).</p>
<p>Reaping does not prevent a phys from reviving you. (pretty sure that trait never was brought to the physician, it did used to be a trait for the priests old reviving).</p>
