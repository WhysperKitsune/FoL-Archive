    <title>Forum.imperium42 &gt;&gt; is now forum.throneoflies.com</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/forum-imperium42-is-now-forum-throneoflies-com/84220</link>
    <description>For a number of reasons, but mostly to split i42 stuff from tol stuff (publishers like it), we have moved from forum.imperium42.com to forum.throneoflies.com ~

* Update bookmarks: Links with cached bookmarks do weird things.
* Links should now work again as long as they&#39;re from forum.throneoflies.com
* oAuth2 (&quot;login with {something}&quot;) works again EXCEPT for FB, for now: FB didn&#39;t like we changed hosts so fast, so awaiting an unblock. I suggest an alt for the time being since they said COVID slowed down approval process and it is now weekend.</description>
