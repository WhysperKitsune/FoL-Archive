          <p>These are all my current class suggestions I’ve made in the pass. Tell me what you think.</p>
<p><em>**Name - The Devil **</em><br>
<em><strong>Class NK</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Win condition:</strong> The Reaper has failed you. The Devil decides to go up there and murder everyone himself</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - Pure evil - Night immune and occu immune</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2</strong> - Back from Hell - if you die then you will consume your living minions soul if you have one</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - Deep cut - make a player bleed. The message sent to the player says that they will die in two days but because The Devil gave you a deep cut you will die in one day{2 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - A New Face - Take a body from Hell allowing you to transform into any role for the night coming up and the next morning. Ex. Picks Butler to become. The next morning he will be able to poison king and that night he will be able to occu someone. If you are checked the night you do this then your will appear as the faction you’ve picked that night{1 use}.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1</strong> - Satins left hand - convert a non unique class into a Neutral Minion. {Unlimited uses} {Max 1 minion at a time} {3 day cool down}</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2</strong> - Depths of Hell - catch a player on fire this night burning them alive. The fire is so big that the players next to him can smell the smoke of the fire. (Unlimited use)</p>
<p>Ex. The Devil set 4 on fire. Players 3 and 5 will get a message saying that “you smelled smoke in the air” or “you see a big light coming from the other room”</p>
<p><em>**Name - The Minion  **</em><br>
<em><strong>Faction - Neutral</strong></em><br>
<strong>Win condition:</strong> Have the Devil win at all cost</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - evil runs in the family - You will know who The Devil is and what he does at night</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2</strong> - if you’re the first Minion then you will have 2 “strait to Hell” uses. If not then you will have 1. Read below for more information</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - known tourcher - when he use this Ability then you won’t go to jail tonight even if the prince selected you to {2 uses}</p>
<p>Notes: this will by you a day or two to give The Devil another day to either recharge his abilities or survive a bit longer)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - Slow learner - make a player bleed, but it will take 3 days for them to bleed to death instead of 2. (The message to the player will say that tou have 2 days to live){3uses}<br>
Night ability 1 - Strait to Hell - You send the player that The Devil killed tonight strait to Hell. Making it so nobody will know what the players class was and you also steal their log, making it so you can read it whenever you want(Similar to the Nobles snoop Ability)</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - taking the blame - when you use this Ability then you will go and murder the player instead of the Devil.(because you will be killing the player there will be no fire showing the neibors rooms)(The Devil will know when you do this action){2 uses}</p>
<p>Notes: I think this is a new take on the NK. Origannaly I was going to have him be able to have 2 minions and talk in a meeting at night.(similar to the unseen/cult).he was also not going to be able to kill and the minions would just be given a night ability to bleed. But I feel this works better. If you got any questions or comments please tell me below</p>
<p><em><strong>Name - The Tormental Class - NK</strong></em>(joke class)<br>
<strong>Win Condition:</strong> make a new and better life for all(Kill everything)</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - if any role from TOS is said during the game then they will be instantly poisoned</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2</strong> - after day 6 the Magna sword ability will allow you to pick up to 6 people and 3 of them will die. If there is not enough players then the number will go down. {unlimited uses}</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - Blinding sword - cause two players to go blind for 20 seconds making them miss everything that was said during that time. {4 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - trollbox - (to possibly make people get into a conversation about TOS){unlimited uses}</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong> - Magna Sword - take out a magma sword and kill a player. The sword is so bright that it blinds all other players visiting that target and yourself. (Making it so they don’t know what happened){unlimited uses}</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - Now you’re thinking - this will grant you a random night Ability that you will have for the rest of the game.{1 use}<br>
Hopefully someone gets this😂</p>
<p><em>**Name - Bishop or priest **</em><br>
<em><strong>Class - BD support/investigative</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - Angles Guidance - can’t be converted after day 5</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - Family Reunion - The Bishop Invites the King to join him in conference that night. {3 uses} (if the king denies the invitation then it will not count as a uses)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - Confession Meeting - invite a player with royal blood to confession tonight (Similar to a merc offering you a contract). • If the player has royal blood then they are given the option to accept or deny the invitation. The Bishop would know what decision the player has made. • if the player does not have royal blood then the Bishop is given the message that “[player name] is not worthy of a confession” • unlimited uses • only one time per day • if prince picks the player that you want to go to confession with, then the prince brings that player to jail</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong> - Locked with your sins - The Boship locks the player in the room with him. This occupy the player</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - guardian angle - The Bishop calls upon a living angle that helps keep the player alive tomorrow. Can only be used in the people you’re having a confession with (the next day the player you casted the angle upon can night be voted up for treason and can not die that night.){2 uses}<br>
What happens during confession: • Confession is similar to the prince jailing someone with a couple different mechanics • anyone who wants to do a night ability on one of the people in confession(healing,occu,killing, etc…) tge night ability will effect both the Bishop and the other player visiting the Bishop for confession.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think. Also if anyone can think of an idea for a converted Bishop and if the Bishop should be converted?</p>
<p>Backstory - <em><strong>The Punisher</strong></em> is sick of these silly faction wars and decides to take action</p>
<p><strong>Win condition</strong> - survive with any other Neutral player till the end of the game(includes NK’s also)</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1 -</strong> little hope - when no one has died when you wake up during the morning then you will be death and occu immune that night.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - knock out - from past battles you have learned all the secret pressure points instantly making them pass out. The player will not be able to vote, hear anything or say anything for the rest of that day{2 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - Deep cut - make a player bleed, they are given the normal message “you are bleeding, you have 2 days to live.” But really the have 1 day to live until death.(can only be used during the first half of the day) {3 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong> - Punish - click on two people making on of them bleed and you will attack the other one {2 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - special surprise - click on a player and any one that wants to do something to that player(attack,heal,occu) will be redirected to the Punisher that night. If any one was planning on killing that player but the Punisher redirected it to him then, the person attacking will die{3 uses}</p>
<p>Ex. The Punisher is <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. The assassin is <span class="hashtag">#3</span>. The alch is <span class="hashtag">#4</span>.<br>
The Punisher uses “special surprise” on <span class="hashtag">#4</span>. The same night <span class="hashtag">#3</span>(the assassin)wanted to kill <span class="hashtag">#4</span>(the alch)The assassin will be redirected to the Punisher and die.<br>
If you remember back when the drunk had his first night ability, it’s similar to that</p>
<p>Notes: This can only spawn when it’s a 16 player game.<br>
• Ability was removed. I thought this would make it too one sided towards helping BD. Day Ability 2 - lie detector - know secretly what a player did last night{3 uses}.</p>
<p><em><strong>Name - Inspirer</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>Neutral</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Win condition</strong> - survive until the end</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - My bright side - inspire anyone who visits you, healing them the night they visit you</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - True to your Kingdom - make a player conversion immune{1}</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2 -</strong> Hideout - have your followers meet you in a meeting tonight(simialar to cult\unseen meetings){2 uses}</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1</strong> - Convincing argument - Make a player realize that everyone should live together in harmony.(Convert a player into a neutral of their class, with one goal to protect the inspirer){2 uses}</p>
<p>Ex. If a Noble is converted Neutral then the Noble will keep all of his day and night ability but his win condition will change. He will also appear Neutral from there on out.</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - Pep talk - Convince your followers that they are unstoppable. Make your followers death immune and occupy immune for the night. {2 uses}</p>
<p>tell me what you think and if I should make any changes. Also should this class be converted and if so what should it be?</p>
<p>Name - lost soul<br>
Faction - Random(similar to king)<br>
Lost soul is a special class that doesn’t have any abilities but has one passive.<br>
Passive 1 - will keep changing classes at the start of each day for his own faction<br>
You will spawn as a random faction and is given a random class from that faction. You will be able to use that classes abilities as normal. But here’s the twist, the next day you will wake up as a different class from your faction and can use that classes Ability though out the day and night.<br>
Example - say day1 I spawn in as noble and then the next day I’m phys. I’ll be able to use the phys abilities at night as usual.<br>
You keep changing class each night playing as each class from your faction</p>
<p>Mechanic:<br>
you cannot become a unique class<br>
this character will count as a Neutral in the game even if his class isn’t neutral to start off with.<br>
if converted then you will keep switching classes in your concerted faction to other classes in that faction<br>
if you are merc then you can guard someone randomly<br>
cannot become any form of NK.<br>
if you become a fool one day and get killed in the morning by the Kingdom then you will win because that is the fool’s win condition<br>
does count as a member if spawns in beginning of cult or unseen game. Meaning that unseen is at its max during the beginning of their game.<br>
if you are a Neutral then you will have to survive until the end or complete the neutral goal such as fools win Condition<br>
if you become king then you stay king of that faction<br>
if you are forced to become the assassin or CL because the original got killed then you will remain as assassin or CL<br>
it will appear to everyone the class that you were last if you die<br>
I am also debating if this class should be able to become unique classes or not.</p>
<p>like he can become prince and jail someone but isn’t allowed to exe at night<br>
if becomes MM or CL then isn’t allowed to convert<br>
if becomes assassin then isn’t allowed to kill<br>
I think this would be cool because if you became prince and then died, it will tell everyone that the prince has died that day but the real prince is still alive. Can also work for Bad guys if you become MM and die but wasn’t the real MM people would think that no more converts are going to happen but secretly you were just a decoy</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments ask me below</p>
<p>Back story - the chosen one is a cult member that has been chosen to go on and complete the demons job. Gaining more power ever time he learns more knowledge<br>
Name - chosen one(thinking of better name)<br>
Faction - Neutral investigative<br>
Passive 1 - hard worker - may use both day abilities during one day<br>
Day Ability 1 - Demons eye - send the demon to go spy on your target, knowing who they visit tonight and the following night - starts at 0 uses but gains more with quick learner ability. Read below.<br>
Day Ability 2 - Quick learner - pick on a character and try to guess their class<br>
only one time per day - unlimited uses<br>
when you guess a players class correctly then you gain a small buff(listed below)<br>
cannot guess a dead players class or a player that has been on trial<br>
Buffs rewarded:<br>
Converted versons give the same;<br>
Obs or Assassin - gain 4 uses of demon eyes<br>
Butler or Drunk - occupy immune<br>
Phys or Alch - Bled/poison immune<br>
Inquis or Knight - death immune during the night once<br>
NK - death immunity during the night<br>
MM or CL - Learn who the Royals are<br>
Princess or Noble - You will gain more demon eye uses.<br>
Prince - Learn the identity of the harmful neuts (NK and neutral social)<br>
Psychic or CW - can hear dead during the night.<br>
Sheriff or Paladin - Learn who the Unseen/Cult are<br>
Fool or Scorned - find out all neutrals except NK<br>
Merc - Learn the classes of anyone contracted to a merc<br>
Starting Seeker counts as princess, Starting invoker counts as Butler and starting ritualist as Phys<br>
this suggestion was made by ** <a class="mention" href="../../u/nuclearburrito.html">@NuclearBurrito</a>**<br>
Night ability 1 - lots and lots of makeup - flirt with a player of your choice and know One thing about them (healer/protector,killer,magic user,investigator, master at communication, disturber)<br>
Healer/protector- alch,phys,knight,merc,CW<br>
investigator - sheriff,princess,paladin,observor<br>
Magic user - CW,psychic,sorcerer,inquisitor<br>
Killer - any NK,prince,hunter,CL,Assassin,merc<br>
Disturber - butler,drunk<br>
Magic of communication - fool,psychic,scorn<br>
Also all converted classes and cult classes are added also<br>
Night ability 2 - entity’s vision - select 3 players and it will tell you how many of them players are evil. Example: “2 of the three players are evil” -if there is not enough players then this ability will be disabled -(3 uses)<br>
Win condition - survive to see the BD fall</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name - The Tormental Class - NK(joke class)</p>
<p>Win Condition: make a new and better life for all(Kill everything)</p>
<p>Passive 1 - if any role from TOS is said during the game then they will be instantly poisoned</p>
<p>Passive 2 - after day 6 the Magna sword ability will allow you to pick up to 6 people and 3 of them will die. If there is not enough players then the number will go down. {unlimited uses}</p>
<p>Day Ability 1 - Blinding sword - cause two players to go blind for 20 seconds making them miss everything that was said during that time. {4 uses}</p>
<p>Day Ability 2 - trollbox - (to possibly make people get into a conversation about TOS){unlimited uses}</p>
<p>Night ability 1 - Magna Sword - take out a magma sword and kill a player. The sword is so bright that it blinds all other players visiting that target and yourself. (Making it so they don’t know what happened){unlimited uses}</p>
<p>Night ability 2 - Now you’re thinking - this will grant you a random night Ability that you will have for the rest of the game.{1 use}</p>
<p>Hopefully someone gets this😂</p>

<p>I think everyone who watch tormental knows it.</p>

          <p>I was trying to think of a way for a Neutral class to convert without it being to overpowered. What I don’t mention in the class is that the people you convert(followers) can be converted to evil artferwords. So using “true to your kingdom” on one of your followers can help with that. Thanks for the feedback. If it is too overpowered then what should it be changed to?</p>
