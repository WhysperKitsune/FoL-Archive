<p>Jane opens with a lot of observations and a couple of weak reads. The Andy read is reasonably worldbuildy especially at this point of the game. It’s interesting he pulls out Isabel’s opener but not the other similar openers that happened about good town play, which could indicate a reluctance to make too many townreads. Though this post can come from either side at this point of the game, even if it feels like Jane felt a need to start the game off strong with his opener.</p>

<p>Such a large percentage of Jane’s ISO D1 and D2 is literally just sideline talking, asking bad questions and ‘encouraging’ others to post instead of doing stuff themselves. Given that low level wolves usually like to try and stay UTR since they don’t want to draw attention to themselves/make many reads, I would say this is a pretty good indication that they may be a wolf.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, I confess that I was sideline talking at here, because I do not hecking know how to lead up or fit into a discussion inside the game, so I just sort of encouraging others to post. But how was I asking “bad questions”? And also, I could not refute if I were truly trying to stay UTR, as that is just your self-confirmation bias.</p>

<p>His readlist is very meh, I don’t know why he voted Ivo Day 2 if he was his top townread day 1. Also after just shading gilbert, he’s put my slot lower despite my slot not having posted anything? I don’t really see too much progression on Isabel or Helen either.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is just my read list at that time. And I voted Ivo on D2 because I really wanted to pressure onto him. And as I have said before, this is a hecking snap read. If you truly believe that my readlist is meh, then okay, it is meh, but then by your logic, everyone’s read list will be meh too if it doesn’t come out in the perfect way that you have think of in the ideal world. Also, I put your slot low down into the slight Scum list as pre-replace in Peter is just really meh with not much stuff going on at all. And also, it is my fault that I didn’t put much “progression” out to scum read people, apologies in advance.</p>

<p>This post just screams a wolf jumping onto a mislynch wagon, especially as Jane apparently top townread Ivo during the previous day and this was his opener day 2. I’m not too sure why the Ivo wagon formed in the first place though so there may be context I’m missing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am basically just flicking TRYING TO PRESSURE HIM. My intent is to just unvote after he have presented his defence against the wagon, and then vote Geoffrey.</p>

<p>This post just pinged me so hard, it was like he was asking me to find more people to scumread so that the PoE could be larger. It’s kinda worldbuildy but I would say he had a scumbuddy in that PoE I made if he does flip wolf here. The fact that he said <em>many others</em> really pinged me as well, there are 4 scum alive max, meaning that this PoE (even though I was sure it wasn’t perfect) was still of a size comparable to the current number of wolves, yet he’s was acting like I had half the number needed and many more people were scumreadable, as if to push me to find more people to put inside the PoE, helping his possible teammate?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I will just admit that I worded it terribly wrong then, but if you just want to scum read me based out of that, go ahead. I was questioning about that hecking PoE just because KILLING THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INTERACTING WITH THOMAS IS JUST A FREAKING TERRIBLE IDEA. And I said many other more just because I feel like that PoE is just so goddamn wrong.</p>

          <p>Alright<br>
Jane time Jane time<br>
Time to figure out what’s going on with this wagon.</p>
<hr>
<p>I remember really liking Jane’s opening posts. I think it was because they came out in a flurry of reads and solvey posts right out of the gate and they didn’t feel very scared to jump into the thick of it. I thought this felt townie.<br>
Perhaps I didn’t read the content with as much effort as I should have.</p>
<p>Just read back through Jane’s ISO, and I’m going to see if I agree with the reasons for this wagon.</p>

<p>Jane opens with a lot of observations and a couple of weak reads. The Andy read is reasonably worldbuildy especially at this point of the game. It’s interesting he pulls out Isabel’s opener but not the other similar openers that happened about good town play, which could indicate a reluctance to make too many townreads. Though this post can come from either side at this point of the game, even if it feels like Jane felt a need to start the game off strong with his opener.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Jane has a lack of conclusive wording in their opening post. They also came into the thread over a day after the game started, so I’d hope they would have <em>some</em> stronger reads?<br>
This isn’t AI, just something that sparked my interest.<br>
Ignoring this and not counting it as reasoning as Peter admits it can come from either alignment.</p>

<p>Such a large percentage of Jane’s ISO D1 and D2 is literally just sideline talking, asking bad questions and ‘encouraging’ others to post instead of doing stuff themselves. Given that low level wolves usually like to try and stay UTR since they don’t want to draw attention to themselves/make many reads, I would say this is a pretty good indication that they may be a wolf.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can agree with this. Doesn’t help that they weren’t around for a lot of d1, so there isn’t a <em>ton</em> to go off of.</p>

<p>This post just screams a wolf jumping onto a mislynch wagon, especially as Jane apparently top townread Ivo during the previous day and this was his opener day 2. I’m not too sure why the Ivo wagon formed in the first place though so there may be context I’m missing.</p>

<p>This is the main part of your post that I agree with tbh. And I think it also happens to be one of the worst parts of their ISO. Their progression and vote on Ivo.</p>

<p>Along with no progression, voting the person who the Prince claimed to jail doesn’t really make a lot of sense? It’s mechanically unlikely that they are a starting wolf, though not impossible. This vote just felt super sudden, really.<br>
On my first re-read this felt like “Oh shit Ivo claimed Prince. Who was Prince voting? Geoffrey? Okay I’ll vote Geoffrey and act like it was my original intention.”<br>
Then I read it a second time and looked for reasoning for their vote:</p>

</aside>
<p>Looks like they did intend to vote Geoffrey. This probably isn’t a lie.<br>
But I still don’t understand why they voted Ivo, especially right after saying that they don’t know why there was a sudden flash wagon for them.</p>
<p>The deepwolf/powerwolf reasoning is incredibly faulty, and often used by wolves to shade towncore. They were townreading Ivo before this, and I don’t see why a sudden wagon on them would make them immediately scared of a deepwolf. Never vote someone just because of paranoia. Figure out <em>why</em> you are paranoid. Can’t use the excuse that we keep flipping villagers, since we haven’t flipped anyone yet lol.</p>

<p>This post didn’t ping me as hard as it pinged you tbh. I see where you’re coming from but it feels kinda reachy.</p>
<hr>
<p>I find myself agreeing with you that Jane has a lot of wolf potential, and I understand why this wagon formed now. Pretty fine voting there, but three things are giving me pause:<br>
A. I feel like you went into this post with a conclusion in mind, and this was a scum-case, rather than a genuine attempt to read Jane? It could be conf-bias from the “heeby jeebies,” I suppose.<br>
B. You’re too focused on a single player. You aren’t really looking outside of Jane recently. Jane is the only player you made a wallpost on, and you haven’t done the same with the rest of your PoE. This feels kinda bad faith.<br>
C. The Gilbert wagon never picked up any traction. Not when Thomas first voted them (which was before I voted Ivo), and not when I hopped on it with Thomas. A super basic threadread makes me feel like something is wrong here, but I’m having a hard time telling what?  (I also have something extremely pre-flippy to say on this but I’ll leave it for allies probably lmao)</p>

</aside>
<p>I saw you Townread them but that’s about it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because I fully expected them to be converted.<br>
Take FOL 30 as an example. Paradox, the highest townread I believe was converted. Lucy was our highest townread by the end of day 1 and I assumed scum would’ve converted them.</p>
<p>Some Reads Now: I’ve looked people’s ISOs and started building my own conclusions on them. I probably should’ve done this a lot earlier, but due to time reasons I couldn’t. Also, some of my reasoning might be hypocritical, and I understand if you’re gonna scumread me based on some of those reasonings.</p>
<p><strong>Ivo_Wake (Locktown)</strong> - This is Prince. No need for ISOing<br>
<strong>Nicolas_Adams (Townread)</strong> - Nicolas’s ISO has improved definitely. Their day 1 for me was a little eh, but I’ve seen that they’ve improved day 2 and they seem a lot more townier. They’ve been somewhat solvey I guess, but I mostly like how they handled the “redcheck” on me. They didn’t immediately just go and say that I was evil, he instead pinged some of us and asked us first whether we had visited Lucy or not, which I don’t generally expect scum to think about and do often. Overall very good.<br>
<strong>Sarah_Lacey (Townread)</strong> - This one is perfect. Their ISO is good, mostly fluffless surprisingly and their posts alone show signs of a good townie trying to solve. Their tone is the thing that’s mostly contributing to this read, as I think their tone is very towny and straightfoward. Posts are fine as well, and I can’t really find much about any post in their ISO as scummy. Very good slot for me. The only thing that does slightly ping me is the cheery/excited mood they always seem in, but that’s just me being grumpy or something idk.<br>
<strong>Geoffrey_Bailey (Townlean)</strong> - Geoffrey’s ISO is pretty decent so far. His day 1 is a little weak in my opinion, but they kinda get excused for that since they arrived kinda late. After day 1 however, most of their posts were fine and some of them gave towny vibes for me, and very few posts actually pinged him as scummy. They also started solving which is very nice, and their solving was decent. The ISO wallposts on things weren’t really impressive nor necessarily scummy, but I still liked them. They’re not jumping onto things instantly as well, which does make them look better and their tone seems very towny. Overall, this one is pretty good.<br>
<strong>Peter_Carew (Nulltown???)</strong> - I’m very not sure what to think of Peter here to be honest. I originally wasn’t too impressed while reading his ISO. Their predecessor didn’t leave much behind, and their ISO wasn’t looking too impressive either, just basically one-liners, almost similar to what I thought about Gilbert. Also they claimed Noble and a Bounty on Thomas really quickly, which is very ehh. But then they posted their wallpost on Jane and that made me reconsider things. The actual Jane ISO wallpost from them was very good. It touched on a lot of things that I would’ve likely missed and on top of that, it seemed heavily town-motivated and had a lot of time put into it. Overall, it was a fantastic post. This kinda puts me in a weird place though, as I found their ISO mostly very bland and unimpressive, but their one good post was a very good and solvey one. If they would do more of these, I wouldn’t hesitate to put them as a townread, but for now, I will consider them a nulltown after thinking for a while.<br>
<strong>Gilbert_Lovell (Nullscum)</strong> - After looking at their ISO, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not very impressive at all. Most of their posts are very short and some of them are complete fluff. However, while this is bad, I still found most of their posts very null-like, with most of them being not very towny nor very scummy at all which is why I would only say Gilbert is a nullscum for now. Them also not solving too much and mostly answering questions in their ISO doesn’t give a good look for them, but I wouldn’t say that’s purely grounds for putting them as a scumlean. If this slot doesn’t improve though, I’m probably putting them as scumlean<br>
<strong>Mary_Savill (Scumlean)</strong> - Extremely not liking their ISO. Half of it can be pretty much considered fluff due to mainly interactions with ThomasTheFirst. The other half is very meh, as it mostly appears to be just answering questions and asking some “so-so” questions to other. Plus, there were some posts that I found scummy and overall this slot hasn’t been doing too much. Not much content either and it seems pretty clear they aren’t paying too much attention. Lastly, they’ve also decided to vote King out, which is something we never want to do unless we know most scum are out. Not very good in general and their ISO isn’t something I really like.<br>
<strong>Alan_Atlee (Scumlean King)</strong> - ISO is generally overall bad. Their opener was fine I guess, it had some towny tone but the actual post was just catchup, and after that, their ISO got pretty bad. Most of it was fluff due to ThomasTheFirst and then the rest was very not good looking for him. He also “forgot” to use Allies which is very bad. The only thing good was probably his reads that he started doing, and those were alright I guess, but nothing impressive. This is why I consider him a scumlean, but however, this is the King after all so I would go against ever lynching them unless we have most of the scums locked and pinned. As someone else suggested, poison would probably be better for us. On a side note, they’re ISO had some good jokes and gave me some chuckles.<br>
<strong>Jane_Drayton (Scumlean)</strong> - I won’t lie, this read is mostly me just sheeping Peter’s wallpost on them, but I’m fairly convinced by what their wallpost presented. There’s a couple of inconsistences pointed out by the wallpost and most of their posts are meh. So gonna put this a scumlean. Their OBS claim is also really weird, even weirder than Peter’s Noble claim as Peter’s claim had a understandable reason, but Jane’s claim just doesn’t have any reason. I do wanna see their defenses to Peter’s accusations tho.</p>

<p>Thing is he was stupidly insistent of it. If it were a faked then he’d probably just say quicker which is why I was just responding emojis to him until Helen fucked up my RT.</p>

<p>Also, why did the Gilbert wagon disappear? Thomas 2 has been gunning for Gilbert for this entire day, trying to convince plenty of people and having the advantage of being in a generally townread slot (“unfortunately townread”) who is never the last night’s convert. And somehow, there is only one vote on Gilbert’s wagon.</p>

<p>He’s been wolfy AF and yet his wagon has litelly been unable to pick up steam this entire game. The only thing going for him is that he kind of looks to not have killed Susan from not knowing they were dead.</p>
