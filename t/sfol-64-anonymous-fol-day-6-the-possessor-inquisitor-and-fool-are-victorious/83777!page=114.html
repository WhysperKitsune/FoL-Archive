</aside>
<p>The idea that Peter account’s previous owner had only two reads is something I’m inclined to believe, given his displayed attitude and type of posting within the thread. Unfortunately, the new player in the slot could easily say this as either alignment, using the previous player’s real (or fake) reads in the classcard, so this is not very alignment indicative of Peter.</p>

</aside>
<p>According to this post, Peter does not feel strongly about Thomas’ alignment either way. Yet a few posts later, he posts an implied scumread on Gilbert based on Gilbert defending Thomas, which… implies something about Thomas’ alignment. I’m not sure why Peter would feel so uneasy about Gilbert’s alignment here, when Thomas should be a nullread to him, according to Peter’s own words. He should not care much about Gilbert’s defense of his nullread, unless the defense was written in a suspicious way, which he doesn’t say.</p>
<p>Given the lack of satisfactory reasoning, and the lack of sense in Peter’s apparent progression, this comes across as opportunistic shadethrowing.</p>
<p>And it is not the last time Peter does this.</p>

<p>Follows up on Alice’s read by outright calling Nicolas mafia. Again, this feels opportunistic. Alice is a consensus townread. Backing her up here and further shaking Nicolas’ position is something a mafioso could easily do in order to buddy up to Alice.</p>

<p>He doesn’t say it, but his scumread on Gilbert also appears to follow Alice’s without much added insight on his own end. The only insight he had about Gilbert is that one time he threw shade on Gilbert for defending Thomas, when he didn’t even have a visible read of his own on Thomas.</p>

<p>Everything in Alice’s ISO seems very good and I agree with basically all of it, so I’m pretty confident agreeing with concensus on Alice here and putting her as town. She’s actively making reads and not going with the thread flow and her ISO is a perfect recap of the important bits of the game I think, with all the rubbish out meaning she’s actively seeking important posts to analyse, so I think she’s town at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is the one townread I could find, and Peter visibly buddies up to Alice by bouncing off her reads and scumreading the same targets she talks about. Theoretically, a townie could do the same thing by aligning themselves with their townread, but considering the progression issues I saw in Peter’s ISO earlier, I don’t think what he’s doing is very honest. The only person he seems to actively townread, and whose posts he always compliments… that person is Alice. Which is not even a read that is anti-consensus, or otherwise unique in any way.</p>
<p>So far, this doesn’t look very good. And I haven’t even mentioned the notably low postcount yet.</p>

<p>And this, about Jane. Again. Similar circumstances as his previous scumreads. He just attacks people left and right. At least this one was independent, so that is a plus.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect this ISO to devolve into a wave of criticism, but I really don’t think Peter has been towny this game regardless of who handled the slot. The first player mostly shitposted, whereas I saw the second buddying up to Alice and scumreading people for one-liner reasons, sometimes even contradicting his previous statements.</p>

<p>The way you defended him could be wolf motivated in that you wanted to keep a townie who was hurting the town alive to continue to help the scumteam, and if he flips town you get credit for reading him correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He finally explains his Gilbert scumread a bit more, but even this explanation is contradictory. When he scumread Gilbert for defending Thomas, like I said before, he had no <em>visible</em> read on Thomas. Now, he apparently townreads Thomas. “A townie who was hurting the town.” It is pretty much what I said, and I agree, but the fact he did not visibly use that initially is making he incredibly suspicious. This entire contradiction could have been partially avoided, had he simply said that Thomas was town in his eyes before making the read on Gilbert. But he didn’t, and I think it has to be notable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My read is a surface level read, there is no depth there</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I dislike the self-awareness. The only good thing about Peter’s accusations is his aggression, and that is a playstyle / emotional attitude which can be easily faked by a mafioso who is one step above a newbie mafia player.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I really struggle to see Peter as a townie, regardless of who was handling the slot. Many of his pushes feel opportunistic, his struggle to townread anyone but Alice is noted (to his credit, he <em>appears</em> to townread Geoffrey, because he agreed with Geoffrey at one point – but since I scumread Geoffrey myself, that doesn’t change my mind very much), and the person he does townread (Alice) is someone he visibly attempts to buddy up to. To his credit, his interactions with Alice’s content do not necessarily look like pocketing, but it seems very clear that he intends to use her reads to push people – and he has done it already. His independent reads lack sufficient reasoning and look like haphazard pushes, the suspicion of which is supposed to be masked by aggression.</p>
<p>I simply do not believe that most things Peter has done have been honest, and for that reason, he is firmly within my scumreads now.</p>

<p>According to this post, Peter does not feel strongly about Thomas’ alignment either way. Yet a few posts later, he posts an implied scumread on Gilbert based on Gilbert defending Thomas, which… implies something about Thomas’ alignment. I’m not sure why Peter would feel so uneasy about Gilbert’s alignment here, when Thomas should be a nullread to him, according to Peter’s own words. He should not care much about Gilbert’s defense of his nullread, unless the defense was written in a suspicious way, which he doesn’t say.</p>

<p>This is the one townread I could find, and Peter visibly buddies up to Alice by bouncing off her reads and scumreading the same targets she talks about. Theoretically, a townie could do the same thing by aligning themselves with their townread, but considering the progression issues I saw in Peter’s ISO earlier, I don’t think what he’s doing is very honest. The only person he seems to actively townread, and whose posts he always compliments… that person is Alice. Which is not even a read that is anti-consensus, or otherwise unique in any way.</p>
