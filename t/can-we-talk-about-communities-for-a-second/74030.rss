    <title>Can we talk about communities for a second?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/can-we-talk-about-communities-for-a-second/74030</link>
    <description>I’ve noticed the more traction a game gets, the more toxic a community shows itself. Good examples of this would be Town of Salem’s, TF2s, and a little bit of undertale’s. 

Has anyone noticed this?</description>

            <p>Being a child molester and a brownie are different things. Some child molesters are brownies.<br>
The problem come when you call every brownie a child molester. You can also have vegetarian child molesters, you don’t call all vegetarians child molesters because of that.</p>
<p>Also, making r34 of ponies isn’t wrong as long they are portrayed as adults, because otherwise it would be child molesting. It is just a fetish.</p>

            <p>Man do I have to heavily disagree with Marl and Luxy here. You look deep enough into ANY fandom you’re gonna find creepy pedophiles, it’s an unfortunate side-effect of the fandom being as big as it is. It’s wholly unfair to single out MLP just because its target audience is children.</p>

<p>I can show you multiple examples on Bronies that are not goddamn child molesters since <strong>I was a part of the fandom and you weren’t</strong></p>

<p>You must not know it very well then<br>
It’s a proven fact there is a problem with that kind of stuff in both the MLP and the Furry Fandom. Just because the people you know in the community aren’t doesn’t mean that there isn’t a huge problem with it.</p>

            <p>Theorically Toxic members are  not the majority of big communities. The problem lies in fact that Toxic players are more noticeable.</p>
<p>Also anybody who say adults who are watching “children” cartoons are some sort of “pedophile” without even researching has no rights to say what is wrong and what is right. Change my mind.</p>

            <p>Tbh I find stuff like making hentai of She-Ra strange but it isn’t morally wrong.<br>
So even making +18 material or MLP should be fine as long they are portrayed as adults? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/luxy">@Luxy</a>  I can completely agree that sexualising something that isn’t intended for it is bad. Enjoying a show made for a much younger target audience on its entertainment value is completely fine though.</p>
