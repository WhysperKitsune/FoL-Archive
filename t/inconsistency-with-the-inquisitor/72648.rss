    <title>Inconsistency with the Inquisitor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inconsistency-with-the-inquisitor/72648</link>
    <description>No, not a whine thread, just something i noticed - and discussed on Discord yesterday a little.

Unlike the other &quot;True&quot; Neutral Classes the Inquisitor gets the Neutral Killer Treatment in one point, he can prevent the Game from ending.
It&#39;s not like it&#39;s inherently bad, but Sellsword, Pretender, Scorned - all classes that need other players to die to fulfill their objective, the Inquisitor not only can kill them on his own, he also get to stall the game until he wins or is killed if the heathens are still alive.

Right now it makes his functionality more akin to a secondary NK from a Gameplay perspective than belonging to the other Neutral classes. 

It is to me just irritating this one class get&#39;s the exception. 

As the title said, it feels inconsistent with the general tone of how the Neutral classes work in Contrast to the Neutral Killers.

Just maybe review this little detail

Greetings,

            <p>Nah, I don’t feel Inquisitor should stop the game ending. If it hasn’t killed all heathens by the time the game should end, it should lose.</p>

            <p>I mean alch has three bombs and they don’t have to side with anyone or use them wisely more like a nk.</p>
<p>Inq normally has to find heathens and stab them or they can yolo stab for whatever reason</p>
<p>Honesty alch should get two bombs and inq should only be able to kill people they found as heathen</p>

            <p>I actually think the fact that the Inquisitor causes the game to stall makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>The objective of the Blue Dragon is: Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm.</p>
<p>The Inquisitor obviously isn’t Cult or Unseen, but he falls squarely into the second category since, if Cult/Unseen and NK are out and Inq still has heathens to find, then those heathens have to be BD, so Inquisitor is seeking to harm the BD. And Kuro mentions that Sellsword, Pretender, and Scorned need players to die as well in order to fulfill their objectives, but these cases differ from the Inquisitor in the simple regard that Inquisitor is still capable of claiming their win (Sellsword cannot see the BD lose if only BD and themselves are left), can directly kill to achieve this end(Scorned needs court to hang people, which isn’t going to happen if evils and NK are out) and needs only to kill their targets (as opposed to the Pretender, who can kill King but then has to be crowned King in their place).</p>
<p>He gets “the Neutral Killer Treatment” at that point because he’s a neutral class whose only job is to kill BD players. It makes perfect sense from a gameplay standpoint.</p>

<p>(No Damn TB, REEEEEEE)<br>
and no frame/fun times</p>
<p>i mean its basically a second NK.<br>
plus the targets know each other, which sucks. maybe they can change it so it doesn’t show you are a heathen to others, as if 2 of them are knights, Good luck.</p>
<p>and its basically knowing 2 Non-Scum, if its a cult game</p>
