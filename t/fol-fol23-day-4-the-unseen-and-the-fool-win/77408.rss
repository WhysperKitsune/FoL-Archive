# New player guide:


Always ask the hosts when in doubt. We don’t mind if we get 20 mechanical questions a day from you to ensure that you understand how the game works.

Read the original post carefully as many questions are already answered in there.

[FoL Class Cards (Now Officially Official) ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fol-class-cards-now-officially-official/1998) is where all the classcards are that are possible.

There are definite deviations from Throne of Lies the game, although many many similarities persist.

We have even completely new classes like Priest, Archer, Demon etc., so be sure to look at this link carefully. Small deviations for existing classes exist as well to provide a more forum balanced game.
An example is that a Knight can Cold Steel Night 1 already and a Physician’s Exhume only provides the faction of the dead person’s killer instead of the whole class.

The Cult functions very differently too and the following guide should provide some insight.
Cult points were added to allow for better fakeclaiming potential.

![|20x20](https://forum.imperium42.com/user_avatar/forum.imperium42.com/marluxion/40/10921_2.png) [Cult Points - How do they work?](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/cult-points-how-do-they-work/62045) [Forum of Lies ](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches/forum-of-lies)

&gt; mithras Cult Point Introduction corax What are Cult Points? Well, young disciple, I’m glad you asked! After being converted to the Cult, you receive a set number of Cult Points based on the class you were converted from. These can be found just below your Class Card in the [Class Card Thread ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fol-class-cards-now-officially-official/1998). Wowee, Mithras is great! How do I spend these points? At any time (Day, night, on trial, whenever!) via your Class Card DM you may spend your cult points into new abilities. You can take ANY ability…

Feedback is also heavily reduced in comparison to Throne of Lies. For an feedback (exhaustive for at least the BD) guide follow:

![|20x20](https://forum.imperium42.com/user_avatar/forum.imperium42.com/marluxion/40/10921_2.png) [Forum of Lies Hosting Feedback Guide ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-hosting-feedback-guide/75082) [Forum of Lies ](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches/forum-of-lies)

&gt; IF AN INVESTIGATION FAILS FOR ANY REASON “You were unable to investigate your target.” IF AN INVESTIGATOR HAS THEIR TARGET SWAPPED “Your target was changed!&quot; (They aren’t told who they were swapped to) IF AN INVESTIGATOR TARGETS A PHYLACTERY HOLDER “You feel a chill surrounding the target player. They are a Phylactery Holder for The Lich!” MAID Change Sheets: “Your targets were killed by the same player!” “Your targets were not killed by the same player!” Matchmake: “Your targets are comp…

Examples are that mainly investigative classes gain feedback. A butler occupying another player will not see if they are occupy immune or not. The player being occupied will not see that they are being occupied by anyone unless they are an investigative. Another example is that a Physician will not know whether their target was bleeding/poisoned and the target player will not know whether they are healed.

Trials also do not exist similar to Throne of Lies. That means when someone is “voted up”, they are immediately executed once majority is reached, so ensure that you stand behind your vote!

Forum players use a specific lingo and some common abbreviations can be found in the following link:

Remember, when in doubt, ask the hosts in your classcard.


... and don&#39;t forget, we are all here to have fun with each other. Please treat each other accordingly :)</description>

<p>My logic was to pick one of the most active and leading players and check them. Just because they are a vet that comes across as “towny” to other vets and palyers doesn’t always mean they are town; my instinct was to assume they were good at what they do. If these town-read vets assumed investigators were going to check newbs and scumreads that others pointed out, then they may have let their guards down.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is the trouble people who improve their scum game will often have and they’ll have to find the balance on when to act obvious town or when to shadow walk. The top players will get checked JUST for being a top player and I don’t feel its too great of an idea to stand out. Unfortunately, I don’t even think Dat stood out much this game…he just got checked for being himself.</p>
<p>I notice that when you have good scum games on this site, people will assume you are scum in your towngames (aka meta reads) and automatically check/accuse you. Not generally a great route since if they are good scum, their town games won’t have any descrepencies either. We’ve all been guilty of doing this.</p>

            <p>While i’m a complete newb to this forum version of the game, my gut was to take in-game veteran advice with a grain of salt. I don’t know any of these players and two of the vets were directing people to use their checks on scumreads. I had never done that before and did know enough of what to look for to get a decent scumread. My logic was to pick one of the most active and leading players and check them. Just because they are a vet that comes across as “towny” to other vets and palyers doesn’t always mean they are town; my instinct was to assume they were good at what they do. If these town-read vets assumed investigators were going to check newbs and scumreads that others pointed out, then they may have let their guards down. I’ll admit that I should have pushed harder on <a class="mention" href="/u/datbird">@DatBird</a>, but something was off about how <a class="mention" href="/u/alice">@Alice</a> was leading the chat. I realzie now this it was because she was Prince claiming Alchemist or whatever, but it kind of came across as a scum claiming soemthing to be not suspect.</p>
<p>This was a fun game and I look forward to more with you all! Thanks for making this one a blast!</p>

<p>In addition we have other mafia games running. Zombie Apocalypse mafia is in signups now, so you could join that too.</p>

            <p>So guess its write up time Just things I notticed and wanna spread some knowledge and positivity:<br>
So the plan is kinda just go down the list and give some advice, praise, or considerations for future games. Trying to improve in FMs is what Im always striving for so Imma hope yall do the same</p>
<p>First things first a few people wanted <span class="mention">@s</span>. Like sorry if u were really looking forward to this but its not to important but I will still fufill your wishes<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/maxwell">@Maxwell</a><br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/kape">@Kape</a><br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/sogman">@SogMan</a></p>
<p>So lets get to it, first o the list is the hosts</p>
<p>Priestess+Wazza: Great job, in general and I would like to thank you both for hosting this. My biggest complaint was not putting classcards in scumthread, made nightplanning on mobile a tad bit more difficult. But realistically that doesnt matter. Flavor was fun and interesting and the executions were great. The VCs were snappy and the question answering was fast. Yall were a dynamic duo and it was great. Be careful of not spoiling stuff until actions are locked, it didnt change my mind but just be careful for the future.</p>
<p>Maxwell: I couldnt ask for a greater scum partner. You had a ray of positivity most of the times that really helped with the shitty red check. I think both of us (until day 2) stayed in the general townlean to townread category. Which for me is hard thing to do, but you did it with ease. Biggest thing I want to see you improve on is confidence in your own planning. In main thread you had it out the wazoo, but in scum chat you didnt seem confident in any choices for night acions, until later in the game so ur already improving. If we were ever paired up again, I would love to see you take a little more charge in night actions cause you are a wicked smart guy, just gotta beleive. The only other thing I saw in my mind might have been seen as scummy but no one cared about was tunneling. You seemed to heavily tunnel in on someone day 1 and didnt get off them for a while. Be ready to drop a push if its not paning out. Or just dont listen to me cuz boi you had the townreads.</p>
<p>Arete: You played great, your reads were a little off but thats fine, the more you make the more you get better at them, but even then people always get somethings wrong no ones perfect. Best plan to step forward and grow is keep playing you are great to have around. Also dont mass claim day 2 especially as killer its very easy to plan around that</p>
<p>Alice: What can I say you played really good prince game. Up until you outed. Im in the mindset that the fake occ was fine, and realistically other than it being weird that no one claimed it, didnt set town back at all. Overall from a non scum pov I saw u as town pretty clearly. Overall good game, sorry GT kinda won us the game a little unfairly</p>
<p>Datbird: you suck</p>
<p>Teology: As a TOL Veteran, but a FOL newbie, you played extremely well for your first game here. I hope to see you not only in future FOLs but other games on this site and I cant wait to see you grow as you play. The SS claim was great, for about a minute you had me, but I told myself something felt off and waited it out. It was a good gambit and got u even more Townread and found more town. Keep doing you, cause ur you was great.</p>
<p>Hja: Overall, played well, you even won. Biggest thing I miss from previous games is your hard pushes, it seems you were a little more docile this match, so at my request your next couple matches I want to see you be a townleader again and actually push hard for scum. I need the 500 post day one Hja, where you catch some scum just with less Axoylotols</p>
<p>HTM: Great reads, from what I can remember you and Geyde were ethe only two that seemed to catch on to me being scummy Day 1, and for that I say good job. Biggest criticism is keep pushing if you called me out you might of had me. Also dont open claim as TK plz</p>
<p>Kape: What can I say you played a perfect game, you save me from the TK, you GT Prince. THis was an excellent game by you, and honestly scumteam had 0 chance without you. I had a hard time deciding this but ur easily scum MVP (sorry Maxwell dont kill me) since without u I was going to be jailed/exed and so was Maxwell. Keep playing your great.</p>
<p>Lymphoma: Two major things, be careful of voting peoople after you say you did an invest check on them, cause that implies a red check, and also defend your slot. Like if your not no one is. The best way to defend it is by keep talking and actually discussing thing. Do this and you can become really good</p>
<p>SirDerpsALot: For your first game you did really well. Be careful of using unseen and cult instead of scum. Something I want to see from ou a bit more next match is trying to post some reads. If something feels off write it down in ur logs or write it in thread. Explain whats odd, how it makes you feel, and if it changes ur idea on somebody. Giving reads is the next step, and I cant wait for you to continue playing. Ur actions were on point though, you saved fool, but at the time he was pretty universally townread plus you saved urself N1. Not many people can predict when they are gonna die.</p>
<p>Frostwolf: I think I heard you were on vacation. Well have a good one</p>
<p>Eevee: Honestly idk what to say, dont really know what happened in prison, so I cant really say much, but thanks for taking Prince N2 I guess.</p>
<p>Soulshade: Good game, huge improvement from older games. From a early game fluff poster to another, people dont like fluff, I get shit about it all the time, just be ready to stop posting fluff and be serious, when it needs to be. Not saying you werent but the best advice since someone (not me ended your game early)</p>
<p>OzzKozz: Biggest thing push your reads harder, especially if you have a red check. I get it yu were sus of Alice but a redcheck is a redcheck that should always be the lynch Idc what anyone say I should have died D2. I liked that you went off the books with your night actions (other than the fact, you caught me) by going for a null read of yours instead of following the nightplan that said to not check me. Always go for null reads with invests, easiest way to see what they are actually up to. Now to the Alice lynch that you were pushing. Explain what made you more sus of ALice and explain it to the people, if they disagree, or dont get it. Make them get it. Tell them whats up and dont stop. Good job overall</p>
<p>Possessed: Sorry for the bleed, you played really great and were a great scum bud. And you might be the first new fool win im not sure i dont think one has rolled yet. But yeah you played a great game and had us puzzled for a bit, but overall played one of the better games overall this match. Keep going and I so happy you overcame the tonal gap.</p>
<p>Sogman: Sorry, I had to do it. You mentioned Day 1 abilities and I wasnt letting a Sheriff or Prince slide. You were a noble which is the like least best day 1 ability of the three. I hope you continue to play. Also remider ask your questions in your classcard the hosts are here to help ya. If you ask in thread not only may people be wrong when they answer, but the hsts genuinlyy dont answr in thread and they are the say all be all. Keep playing, sorry again for the early kill</p>
<p>Geyde: Hi, dont really know what to say bt have a great day. Keep pushing me your one of the two best at reading me imo.</p>
<p>JakeTheWolfie: Just a general dont foget to night action, and be a little more active if you can. Dont be afraid to jump in and start talking, and hunting. The more you seak the more likely people can get a good read of ya.</p>
<p>OVERALL: Everyone did great, I had a lot of fun, thanks everyone new and old for coming out and I hope ya continue to play. Try the other games if ya can they are all pretty great in their own ways.</p>
<p>-The Best LolBearer</p>

            <p>Was my first game. I feel like I greatly improved throughout the game even, considering that my first attempt at reads were god awful and they progressively got better to the point where all of my predictions of who was scum was correct except one (I thought Poss was NE and Dat/Max/Jake were all scum, not realizing there wasn’t a convert). Made a risky play D3 to out myself as SS to try to get evils to out. Figured out that Kape was EK and Ozz and Derp were 100% town. Admittedly, it made me question whether Poss was evil or not because they didn’t vote up Alice while present, but obviously they were the NE and likely knew I was faking it. I do feel like I made some mistakes with night actions. Like N2 I was debating between Arete/Htm/H_Hja and I ended up choosing the one out of the three that wasn’t attacked. Also N3 I didn’t IW Derp because I thought he would’ve PD’d. Any advice for me?</p>

            <p>Honestly, you did really well overall. Looked town, was active and contributing, made reads.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for ways to improve your reads, there’s no surefire way for me to tell you something and you’ll just boom be able to make perfect reads all the time. You just have to keep playing FM and they’ll get better over time. It helps if you’ve played with the people before, you’ll pick up on small things they do as town/scum. Your reads were really good, and they’ll continue to improve the more you play.</p>
