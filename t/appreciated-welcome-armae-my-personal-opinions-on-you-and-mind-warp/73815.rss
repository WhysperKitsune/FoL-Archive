    <description>Hello Armae.

I&#39;m happy for you to have started development.

Personally I do think Bos/Ellie needs a break. She seems much more prone to mental breaks than usual as of recent. So I think it is absolutely great to have extra help with the game as being a one man dev can be extremely challenging.
I&#39;m concerned for ya here Ellie. I&#39;m not disliking you here. Sure I have disagreed with you in the past but I do care for you, like pretty much everyone on these forums

I&#39;m overall fine with the simplification change but it still doesn&#39;t really change that Illusionist was already a weak convert.

Now what I suggest is that you put it on the level of Noble by giving their primary ability as well as the frame.


&gt; *Personal change for Mind Warp*
&gt; **Warped Link (Night)** - Link target player, framing them as well.

I&#39;m fairly neutral on this train against Mind Warp&#39;s change.
but I still want Squire but it&#39;s not the end of the world to not have Squire ingame.

At least itll give Illusionist more flexibility on claiming Mystic so that&#39;s a plus. Also Unseen getting more claims is also nice.</description>

Definitely looking forward to your changes, personally I do like the direction of making mechanics and interactions clearer to newbies. The idea of using keywords is most important here.</p>

            <p>And frame/weaker mindwarp both players affected? Seems decent. I’d prefer to add more mindwarp effects to resolve it being too obscure for new players as opposed to eliminating it, but this is decent solution.</p>

            <p>This has been suggested (or was even in the game?) before and not accepted as no one would claim to Mystic anymore.</p>
