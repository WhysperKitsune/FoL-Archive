    <title>What are you interested in in an RP?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-are-you-interested-in-in-an-rp/68223</link>
    <description>Guys! Please post what elements you are looking for in a role play!
For example I would love to see character interaction and development in an rp, and the world building experience!

What would you want in an RP? Is it the story? Is the action? Or is it something else? 

And on that note. What kind of genres do you want in your RPs? Anything specific?

            <p>no then it gets even <em>more</em> politics-y, if they were hiding their identity in the first place.<br>
like “the head of the super hero controlling organization was secretly a super hero?! <em>gasp</em>”</p>

<p>Offensive Capabilities<br>
Physical. Magic limited to staves and tomes…<br>
Players will start off weak… plenty of ways to grow…<br>
However. Question. Do you want a FE battle system in place for straightforward battling? Power levels are an obstacle imo.</p>

<p>Story<br>
A growing tension between the two nations has plunged both into chaos. Players can decide to fuel war or stop it. Conflicts in both nations will be highlighted, and roleplayers can come in and change the situation accordingly…</p>

            <p>I like RP’s that allow for meaningful decisions. In other words I am not looking for a story to experience but rather a world to explore (with the story being an emergent property).</p>
<p>Basically my favorite thing to do in a roleplay is go off the rails. Reveal things that are not supposed to be known. Act when we are supposed to be confused and freaked out. Generally just pushing the boundary of the world to see what happens.</p>
<p>Of course I also value good characterization (which I am unfortunately bad at) so it’s not like I just immediately go on a killing spree or anything like that.</p>

            <p>It does seem exciting!<br>
Why hide their identity of a superhero? Something we can ponder…</p>
<p>How do they go through everyday without getting  exposed?<br>
How do others view them? Mmmm<br>
So many things!</p>

            <p>Trying to balance it tho… where should we focus on? The normal life or the superhero life? I personally would lean with the normal part.</p>

<p>What about like a superheroes RP but not like the ones where you “do a thing get a power” more like one where there’s superheroes and they have different origin stories or whatever and they just do superthings also maybe some of them have to balance civilian life with a life of super-ness</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>anyone wanna comment on my cool idea</p>

            <p>I’m planning on a medieval setting. Tomes and Staves will be used for magic. Thus magic wont overpower every single person…</p>
<p>To personally use magic from the atmosphere, certain conditions have to be met… Usually only done by advanced practitioners…</p>
<p>Yay or nay?</p>
<p>Adding on… This will have guilds in it…<br>
About battle… I am thinking of adding a system to keep things in check… It does feel a little restrictive tho. We all need to decide on the power levels of the characters before the rp begins…</p>
