    <title>Can we get rid of this mercenary first contract?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/can-we-get-rid-of-this-mercenary-first-contract/46104</link>
    <description>Im sick of getting a really bad first contract as Mercenary.

You are saying Im going against my objective for getting a better contract but you dont say the fact, If I get a bad contract who will die anyways Im going even more against my objective.

Please, *LET MERCENARY PICK HER FIRST CONTRACT* and we will stop this problem.

Thanks.</description>

            <p>You are allowed to let them die, you just canâ€™t deliberately get them killed.</p>
