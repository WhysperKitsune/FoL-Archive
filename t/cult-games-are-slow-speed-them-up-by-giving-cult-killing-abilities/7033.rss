    <title>Cult games are slow, speed them up by giving Cult killing abilities</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cult-games-are-slow-speed-them-up-by-giving-cult-killing-abilities/7033</link>
    <description>As we all know Cult games are dreadfully slow. Usually, cult strategy is: recruit, turtle, kill every 2-3 nights because their killing capability compared to Unseen is incredibly shabby. I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all familiar here with overly long Cult games..

Something I&#39;ve also noticed in Cult games is that it&#39;s usually especially slow for Physician, too. Whom is otherwise fairly busy in Unseen matchups because of the poison.

So, I&#39;m suggesting Cult Leader or Ritualist get a new additional daytime ability:
**Pestilence**
_Inflicts a disease that causes bleeding on the target. The disease spreads to whomever the target visits or to whomever visits them (up to three) and causes death in two nights if not Healed._
**Uses:** Two
**Curable by:** Physician &amp; Alchemist (both are immune as well)

As an aside, this would actually make Alchemist REALLY desireable by Blue Dragon in Cult matches as well rather than the usual &quot;lol neuts get out&quot;.</description>

            <p>I like that the cult is different. Makes it so that you’re interested so see if it’s cult or unseen. If you give cult killing abilities, they become too much like unseen. And then the only difference will be if you’re seeing red or purple letters. The unseen are deadly assassins and you should fear for your life. The cult are evil diplomats and you should fear the BD being taken over through manipulation. It’s a nice contrast!</p>

            <p>Although I agree with you. I find that your spacific solution isn’t very good. My solution would be to have a Cult Killing like the acolyte that you can get from converting the Hunter or Knight.</p>

            <p>if you play cult well as CL, you will kill every other night.</p>
<p>Not only this, but people die due to CL"s sacrifice, further speading up the game.</p>

<p>It’s not really that different though. Same ol’ conversion gameplay just a lot slower.</p>

</aside>
<p>yes it is different. Unseen kills much faster, cult converts much more often. Unseen get converts based on class, while cult gets it based on class type.</p>
<p>Cult can have up to three non killing or converting abilities happen in one night, while unseen get 1</p>
