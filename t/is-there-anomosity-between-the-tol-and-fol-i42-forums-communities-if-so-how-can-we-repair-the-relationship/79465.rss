    <description>Hey all,

I&#39;m kind of wondering if there might be any sort of tension or animosity between the ToL and Forums communities. If there is, I don&#39;t want there to be. Some people like kat, Arete, and I, try to have an active role in both.

I guess I made this thread to discuss why this animosity exists, if it does exist, and how we may try to repair the bond between the two communities, if there is this animosity.</description>

            <p>I think in addition to both of your points I would add ‘at rand, all players have ~reasonable odds of achieving their win condition given average players,’ ‘at rand, all players have ~reasonable odds of achieving their win condition given really good players on all sides,’ and ‘the outcome of the game will primarily be determined by which side plays better’ as things I consider worth optimizing for</p>
<p>ToL currently passes the first and fails the second, FoL currently fails both but mostly because NKs are a thing (I think it passes both if we ignore neutrals), and I would say both are doing <em>decently</em> on the third front but both could also use some improvements in that regard</p>

            <p>If we look at the bottom graph the second derivative is negative (you improve faster at first, then more slowly) but the first derivative is always positive (you are always improving)</p>

            <p>I don’t want there to be an arbitrary limit on how good people can get at the game if that’s something they care about</p>
<p>Obviously that’s not what everyone is optimizing for but there shouldn’t be a point where you <em>can’t keep improving</em></p>
<p>I’m not saying we should make it like the left graph in the following picture (nor would that be possible) but I don’t want it to be like the right graph in the picture either (given the assumption that the player in question wants to improve)<br>

<p>Yes, but with hard limitations. Never make mechanics worse just to force the players to use more social.</p>

</aside>
<p>Depends on your definition of “worse”. It’s undeniable the original intent of the game was to be less mechanically heavy than it currently is (and especially moreso than it used to be). We’ve been trending towards reduced mechanical info literally since launch, and I think that trend has shown continual benefits to date.</p>
