    <title>Possible Solution to Deathnote Reporting</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possible-solution-to-deathnote-reporting/3353</link>
    <description>Have a report button that if you click it, it takes a photo of the deathnote and submits it along with the killer&#39;s Lobby name/Steam name/UUID to a mod location maybe?
# Pros:
 - One simple button
 - Easy on the mods
 - If they change their Lobby name and Steam name, you have the UUID which tracks their name changes
# Cons:
 - Requires a photo taken automatically-- Not sure how that would be programmed...</description>

            <p>Or if it’s going strictly through the game, maybe gives the mod a notification and a button that, when pressed, brings up the death note in the same /a similar manner as in-game</p>

            <p>With that con,  my suggestion:<br>
I would think there is a place that the image for the deathnote is stored, and maybe instead of maybe a screen-cap of the death note, when it appears, it just send the mods a copy of the file with the image already in it</p>
