    <description>I was BD king.
Had a alchy friend. He died. But HE KEPT HEALING ME TILL N5.. I executed MM two times.....Then When it went down.. To  A FOOL, A MERC,  A POSSESOR, and Me., Oh also a physician, BUT WE DON&#39;T TALK ABOUT HIM

he died...

I had 6 guards. I wasn&#39;t giving up. I was like ATTACK ME ALL YOU WANT. I HAVE 6 GUARDS. I AM NOT GIVING UP. so.. we went on. Till the fool got bored voted up the possessor.


I basically won this for the BD.. being the last BD alive.
