    <title>Nomenclature - Physician and Psychic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/nomenclature-physician-and-psychic/40364</link>
    <description>So, the Physician was renamed to Medic.

I know that it was because of a confusion between Phys and Psy, and thank you Devs for going through our threads so much, but in my opinion, Medic doesn&#39;t fit the theme.

I saw that there was a class for Casual mode called the Mystic, that was a combination of Psychic, Priest, and Noble.

What if the Psychic is renamed to Mystic, and the Physician can go back to being Physician? Because Physician is classic.</description>

            <p>Yeah, I was thinking of bringing up the Phys / Psy thing earlier, but I was going to say that we obviously wanted to rename the Psychic (whose name doesn’t fit the theme) rather than the Physician (whose name fits fine.)</p>
<p>Occultist has some potential, but “occ” is already used as an abbreviation for “occupy.”</p>
<p>Spiritualist seems like it would work.</p>
<p>Alternatively, how about <span class="bbcode-b">Priestess</span>?  This fits their art (which is female and mystical); and it doesn’t collide with anything because priest doesn’t exist at the moment (though, we do have Prince and Princess.)</p>
