    <title>Trident Crash (On Vulkan)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/trident-crash-on-vulkan/4478</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

The game crashes whenever someone uses Trident to execute.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The game was supposed to show the normal Trident animation

#### Steps to reproduce:

Have someone execute with Trident 

#### Comments:

I have to use the Vulkan one because the directx11 version freezes up for me. This crash constantly happens when someone uses a Trident to kill someone. 

Crash dumps for two examples:

(I don&#39;t know how to upload the dumps any other way.)</description>

            <p>I’m sorry it took so long to respond. I will try and do a clean install of the driver when I get a chance.</p>
<p>It usually happens right before the whole water animation begins. All I see is the trident going in or about to go in the person.</p>

            <p>Try doing a clean install of your graphics drivers.</p>
<p>Also at what point in the trident execution does it happen?</p>

            <p>Whoops, it seems that my game crashed for another execution weapon.</p>
<p>I’ll have to look into this some more. Odd.</p>

            <p>I think not being able to open the game with DirectX with any of the other solutions <em>might</em> be 'cause of an issue with your graphics card.  You’re above recommended requirements, so it <em>might</em> be an issue with your card. Can’t tell for sure.</p>
<p>I had an issue with my card too, I could play GTA IV and games like that but it really was a pain in the ass in this game. I’d suggest checking your Graphics card <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> (mine was faulty)</p>

            <p>I use the Vulcan version of the game because the DirectX version of the game minimizes itself and becomes unable to open on my computer.</p>
<p>That was a separate issue: <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/game-force-minimizes-and-cannot-open-again/3428/7" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/game-force-minimizes-and-cannot-open-again/3428/7</a></p>
<p>The only solution to that issue was to play the vulcan version of the game.</p>
<p>In the Vulcan version of the game, the game crashes whenever someone executes someone with a trident. I could try lowering the graphics but I really doubt my graphics card is not powerful enough…</p>
<p>TBH I play alot of games and have no idea why I am getting so many technical difficulties with this one.</p>
<p>My specs:</p>
<p>GTX 980 Kingpin 4GB<br>
I7-4790K 4th Gen<br>
16 GB Ram<br>
Installed on Samsung SSD<br>
Win 10 64 Bit OS</p>
<p>I just updated my graphics card drivers fyi.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure having your game freeze when using DirectX 11 is not normal. However you could try lowering the graphics, maybe the trident execution is too heavy(?).</p>
<p>Tbh I think it’s most likely an issue with your drivers, your  DirectX or your graphics card. I’d suggest checking for new drivers first.</p>
<p>Could you also send your specs? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
(Since it’s only you having this issue, this has been moved to the Support section of the forums)</p>
