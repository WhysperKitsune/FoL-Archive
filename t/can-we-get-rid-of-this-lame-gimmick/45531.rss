    <description>The Death Knight.

The Death Knight is an incredibly lame way to stop dead BD from leaving the game.  Once evil kills you, you should stay dead.  Evil can&#39;t be resurrected as a death-immune killer ghost so why should BD?  

A lot of games are turned by Death Knights when Evil played really well and should have been rewarded with the win.  Sometimes you even have 2 Death Knights (4 guards and 2 CS) that have all the information from the last night of the dead people&#39;s abilities, and possibly cooperating with a living Psychic and ALSO confirming living physicians in the process. And the Death Knights can communicate this information via deathnotes.

And the price of a Death Knight is simply a night without healing someone that probably didn&#39;t need healing anyway.

Death Knight please go away, get out of this game.</description>

            <p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>DKs that say “10 is Possessor!” just kill the point.</p>
<p>I get that psychic and illusionist are both hardcounters (unless you make possess targets UNABLE TO TALK) but not Physician too.</p>

<p>At the moment it is not fair that BD has DKs and evil can’t even talk to their dead.</p>

</aside>
<p>I strongly disagree with this reasoning.  ToL is an asymmetric game; different factions <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> have different capabilities.  It’s boring for absolutely everything to have both good / evil variations.  (Granted, it’s a good idea when it’s necessary to keep someone from proving.  But I’m not sure that’s the case here.)</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be totally opposed to an evil that can talk to the dead (it’d be interesting if the Reaper could see the dead chat, although they don’t necessarily need the buff), but I definitely don’t agree with the argument that every side needs the same abilities for “fairness.”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Gosh, I could not disagree with this more.</p>
<p>Dead have to be involved in some way or else everyone will just leave when they die. Any time there is a DK, the dead have to actively put their heads together to decide what to do. It keeps the game so engaging for the dead. That alone is worth its inclusion. A DK is potentially game-changing but not overpowered - I often am unable to accomplish anything as a DK, but sometimes help win the game. That is a dynamic feature.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Aquillion" data-post="11" data-topic="45531" data-full="true">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the DK as it is.  Interactions with the dead are necessary to keep them engaged, which is desirable overall - if people leave the moment they die, engagement with the game overall diminishes.  The game either needs to have a fair number of dead interactions, and powerful ones, or none at all, and I’m absolutely not in favor of going for none at all.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I feel that evils should always be punished for being too obvious, regardless of what stage of the game it’s at.  The point where evils can afford to be completely obvious should be after the game has already ended.  DKs help contribute to that, and reduce late-game situations where the game becomes boring because absolutely everything is known 100%.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, you’ve said it perfectly here. The inclusion of a DK, along with no public system note of the rezz, means that it is <em>always</em> risky for Unseen/Cult to play sloppily. That’s also a good feature. DK adds so many positives to the game.</p>
