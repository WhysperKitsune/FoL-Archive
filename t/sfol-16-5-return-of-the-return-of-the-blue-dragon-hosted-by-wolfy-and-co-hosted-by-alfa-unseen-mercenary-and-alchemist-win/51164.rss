    <description>The Unseen had won, taking over Castle Adiart. But now, the small remainder of the Blue Dragon is fighting to take it over again! 


[color=deeppink] Welcome one and all to a game where this time, the informed minority is the Blue Dragon, trying to get their Kingdom back from the clutches of the Unseen. Credits to @Ashe for creating the idea for a potential gamemode for ToL if it was to be developed.[/color]

**Rules:**

* [color=deeppink] Days will last 96 hours (4 IRL days)[/color]

* [color=deeppink] Nights will last 48 hours (2 IRL days)[/color]

* [color=deeppink] Players must post content within 24 hours. If no content has been posted for that long, then that player will recieve a prod. Failing to respond within 24 hours after the prod (as some players may be in different timezones) will result the player in getting replaced[/color]

* [color=deeppink]Journals will be presented on death, but only updated ones[/color]

* [color=deeppink]Blue Dragon will have a night chat **only**[/color]

*  [color=deeppink]A specific player can only be sent on trial once per day. If pardoned, they will gain immunity to being a valid vote until the next day[/color]
