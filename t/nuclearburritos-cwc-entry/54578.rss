    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Court Wizard [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Support [/color]**
&gt;
&gt; Passive: Mimicry - If you mimic a target who has a passive immunity you will get it too.
&gt;
&gt; Day ability 1: Magic barrier - Target player will be conversion immune until you select someone else, get converted or die. You will know if this is triggered. (Unlimited. Works like scout)
&gt; Day ability 2: Mimic - Weaken will also have the effect of target players primary night ability. Will not work if the ability is social, special or is 2 target. It will not give any additional feedback. (3 uses)
&gt;
&gt; Night ability 1: Weaken - Actions used against target player cannot fail. (Unlimited)
&gt; Night ability 2: Tornado - Redirect anyone visiting either of your target&#39;s to the other target. Bypasses redirect immunity. (3 uses)

&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;] Sage [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Support [/color]**
&gt;
&gt; Passive: Mana barrier - While you exist the assassin cannot be occupied or redirected. Anyone who tries will think they succeeded.
&gt;
&gt; Day ability 1: Freeze - Target player will be occupied through immunity&#39;s tonight. (1 use)
&gt; Day ability 2: Aura Shield - You will be immune to occupy and redirect tonight. (2 use)
&gt;
&gt; Night ability 1: Tornado - Redirect anyone visiting either of your target&#39;s to the other target. Bypasses redirect immunity. (Unlimited)
&gt; Night ability 2: Wall of Fire - Prevent anyone but the Unseen from visiting target player. Can self target. (2 uses)

Note: Mimic will also not work on Prince or Merc because he has no one jailed and has no contract. It will however work on Assassin, Reaper, Drunk ect but it will not give feedback.

Weaken also does not let you bypass knight guard but it will bypass hunter bear or phys heal.

Mimicry will not copy Armored if you select knight. It only copy&#39;s occupy/redirect, bleed/poison and death immunity.</description>

            <p>It’s not that I don’t like this idea, it’s more that mimic just feels like a little too much to me for a class designed around support. This seems like a more interesting neutral class idea to me than a BD support - one who sort of “absorbs” abilities from other players and used them himself.</p>
<p>Having this as a BD class would just make the Court Wizard too strong. He could effectively become a third of any other class, or even use his mimic to determine who and what other players are, giving him some investigative potential as well. I think this is much more interesting if retooled as a neutral whose only objective is to survive, kind of like the alchemist.</p>

            <p>No they cure bleed.</p>
<p>And it’s you doing the action not them. They aren’t affected at all unless you target them with weaken.</p>

            <p>Sure!</p>
<p>I’ll just go over every target it effects:</p>
<p>Butler/Servant/Invoker - Occupys your target through immunitys.<br>
Drunk/Alchaholic - Redirects your target to yourself through immunitys.<br>
Assassin/Sorcerer - Kill target player through immunitys.<br>
Knight - Kill anyone attacking target player.<br>
Hunter - Wolfs target player.<br>
Physician/Alch - Cures Poison or Bleed. (does not save them from attacks)<br>
Herbalist - Target will think they were attacked and healed.<br>
Enforcer/Sellsword - Prevent targets to Target player<br>
Poacher - Occupy target player through immunitys and Prevent all visits.<br>
Reaper - Kill target player through immunitys. They’re body will appear alive for a day.</p>
<p>Does nothing with anyone else.</p>
