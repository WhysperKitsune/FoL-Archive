    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-artificer-and-the-smith/70152</link>
    <description>Saw thread about classes giving night immunity and such, thought it was good so I&#39;m giving my take on it:

[quote]

[color=light blue]The Smith[/color]

Blue Dragon Support

_Abilities_

Diligence: (D) (2)
Guarantee that your action will be successful tonight. (This will not make you occupy immune however.)

Bolster: (N) (oo)
Make another player&#39;s abilities bypass immunities tonight. (Death, Occupation, and Redirection)

Fortify: (N) (3)
Make another player immune to death tonight.

[/quote]

[quote]

[color=purple]The Artificer [/color]

Unseen Support

_Abilities_

Restock: (D) (1)
Choose another Unseen member. Recharge 1 Use on all of their limited abilities.

Bolster: (N) (oo)
Make another player&#39;s abilities bypass immunities tonight. (Death, Occupation, and Redirection)

Garrison: (N) (1)
Make the Assassin immune to death tonight and heal all members of the Unseen. (Will show as visiting the Assassin)

Tried making The Smith as fake-claimable as possible</description>

            <p>This feels bland. There are very few useful situations where this guy is good and if that ever becomes false the utility would be gained in a CW change rather than a new class.</p>

            <p>The Smith looks good, maybe a bit too powerful with the ability to use both of his night abilities. Can make it harder for scum to kill confirmed BD and prince, but other wise not a bad role.</p>
<p>The Artificer on the other hand looks really insane with the ability to give an assassin an extra charge on their 241, while playing similar to the enforcer and allowing the assassin with both of the artificers night abilities to guarantee the kill on the assassins target. If the unseen get an artificer, he can use bolster to make his Smith claim some what believable, but he gives the assassin alot of power to kill basically anyone. Hone should be changed to something else, i dont quite know yet atm, but the artificer should make the assassin have death immunity at night instead, to make sure he doesnt die, while not crossing over with the enforcer`s frenzy, making him more unique, while decreasing the amount of power to the unseen.</p>
