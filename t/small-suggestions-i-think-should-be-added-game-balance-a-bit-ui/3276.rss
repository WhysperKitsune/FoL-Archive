    <title>Small suggestions I think should be added [Game &amp; Balance] - a bit UI</title>

    <description>Hey there Nazle here

**Here are some few suggestions I think should be added which would make the game easier to play**

**NB:** When responding to a suggestion, just include what number suggestion you are responding to.

**1.** Being able to whisper to a player while someone is accused.

**2.** Make sure the Journal you are writing doesn&#39;t close when someones else journal popps up after they&#39;ve died. 

**3.**  You should be able to check someones last  journal after they&#39;ve been revived from the dead. Prince die, read journal... he gets revived... then you can&#39;t read it anymore. There is crucial information in the prince journals, so thats why - example, this could be any role btw.

**4.** 
There should be a button right next to the Learn to play which would take you to a page in side the game with all the rules so players don&#39;t have to search for the rules, all in all it just makes the game more easier to understand and keeps you updated on the rules if you want to check them. 

This doesn&#39;t need to be right next to the l2p button, but it should be easily accessible. :smile:</description>

            <p>You can. I would still want to be able to edit my journal. Its more for if I think I might be revived so that I can prepare the journal in advance. Plus it makes it easier to keep everything in one place. It isn’t huge but it would make the game feel much better.</p>

            <p>That’s not a fundamental problem. Obviously they would make sure you couldn’t do that. It’s definitely possible because that’s how it works in ToS</p>

            <p>It’s not like you would know if they are being revived before hand. This seems more like a quality of life suggestion than anything</p>

            <p>I just think its something that should be implemented because it makes the game easier and fun to play, not a big change, but one very noticeable when it first happens.</p>

<p>you should be able to check their journal if you are f.example. evil as you could check it when they were dead. Its just stupid in my mind that you can’t check their old journal beacuse they were revived. It sets up for more strategies and deduction, this I can vouch from as I constantly read dead peoples journal and use their information for my own use.</p>

            <p>Hey there Nazle here</p>
<p><strong>Here are some few suggestions I think should be added which would make the game easier to play</strong></p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> When responding to a suggestion, just include what number suggestion you are responding to.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Being able to whisper to a player while someone is accused.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Make sure the Journal you are writing doesn’t close when someones else journal popps up after they’ve died.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  You should be able to check someones last  journal after they’ve been revived from the dead. Prince die, read journal… he gets revived… then you can’t read it anymore. There is crucial information in the prince journals, so thats why - example, this could be any role btw.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong><br>
There should be a button right next to the Learn to play which would take you to a page in side the game with all the rules so players don’t have to search for the rules, all in all it just makes the game more easier to understand and keeps you updated on the rules if you want to check them.</p>
<p>This doesn’t need to be right next to the l2p button, but it should be easily accessible. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
