*This challange is part of 2nd anniversary event*

Task is simple - write a story/fanfic/poem.

There is a twist however - each person who **/ins** this challange gets a randomized ToL class, location and item and have to write about it (and publish in this thread).

**For example:**
Class - Invoker
Place - Jail
Item - Axe
Would be most likely a story about prince executing them. (ouch)

Don&#39;t expect such easy combinations tho.
After all this task is meant to inspire creativness, not give obvious answers.

**Event clariffication:**
Each participant will get a 2nd anniversary lottery tickets, with bonus ones for extra entertaining solutions. ;)</description>

Whatever this thing is</summary>
<p><strong>THE WRAITH OF OUTPOST 420</strong></p>
<p>FADE IN</p>
<p><strong>INT. GUARD ROOM</strong></p>
<p><em>A dimly lit, relatively small room only illuminated by two hanging lamps. Two guards (<span class="hashtag">#1</span> and <span class="hashtag">#2</span>) are playing checkers on a grey table, sitting on two uncomfortable looking chairs in the center of the room. One guard (<span class="hashtag">#3</span>) is in a corner, playing solitaire near the door into the adjacent storage room. In the opposite corner is a door that connects to the rest of the outpost. Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> looks older and more decorated than the other guards. They appear to not be talking until Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> says something to Guard <span class="hashtag">#2</span>.</em></p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>So you heard the story of the wraith, right?</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>I can’t say I have, no.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>Well, can’t fault you too much for that. You’re new here. Also, side note, you’re terrible at checkers.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. So what’s the story about?</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>Story goes that there’s a spirit that can possess the bodies of people, and that it’s contained somewhere in this outpost.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>Yeah, that can’t be right. The only thing this outpost contains are objects from medieval times. Why do we do that, anyway? I forgot.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>They say it’s for preservation, but I don’t buy it. The spirit’s supposedly ALSO from medieval times, and (leans forward) I believe it’s trapped in the iron maiden. (he points to the door to the storage room) That’s why they moved all the old junk here, to get the spirit away from the continents where it can actually harm people. That’s also why they tell us we can’t open the maiden.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>Nah, I think it’s for preservation. Spirits existing, and HERE of all places? You gotta be joking. Also, it’s still your turn.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>Maybe I’m just superstitious, but I feel like I’m right. Hell, you’re usually in the room with the objects, I can’t be the only one who’s unnerved by the things.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>…actually, I have heard the story of the wraith before. Most of what you said is the same as what I know, but you got one little detail wrong.</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>And what’s that?</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
<p>I go by “possessor”, bitch.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, Guard <span class="hashtag">#2</span> reaches across the table and grabs Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> by the throat. Guard <span class="hashtag">#2</span> collapses into a bloody pile and Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is seemingly fine. The whole time, Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> watches in shock. Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> slowly turns around to stare at Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span>.</em></p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>Don’t mind me, I’m okay now.</p>
<p><em>Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> rushes through the door he was next to into the room which stores the medieval objects.</em></p>
<p><strong>INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM</strong></p>
<p><em>The medieval room is a very dimly lit and large room, lit by only a couple hanging lamps. The room consists of a catapult, a cannon, an iron maiden, a suit of armor, many antique swords, and several other miscellaneous medieval objects. Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> notices that the door to the iron maiden is open, even though it isn’t supposed to be. He then rushes to hide behind the cannon by crouching. He hears the door open and footsteps walk into the room. After three minutes pass, Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> hears the footsteps close to where he is, and peeks out. Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is dangerously close. After one minute passes, Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> leaves the area close to Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, and Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> slinks to behind the catapult. He picks up a nearby antique shield and tosses it between the catapult and the open iron maiden. He hears footsteps rushing to where he threw the shield.</em></p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p>GOTCHA-wait, huh? (picks up the shield, inspecting it)</p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#3</span></p>
<p>I’m WHEELy sorry about this!</p>
<p><em>Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> forcefully shoves the catapult into Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, which rolls right into him, causing him to stumble into the iron maiden. Guard <span class="hashtag">#3</span> hastily slams the door of the maiden shut with the possessed Guard <span class="hashtag">#1</span> inside.</em></p>
<p>GUARD <span class="hashtag">#3</span></p>
<p>Neuts out? More like…(looks at camera) neuts in. (Slowly puts on sunglasses)</p>
<p><strong>THE END</strong></p>

Summary</summary>
<p>Expedition of Sancta Lucia, 16th December of 1640.<br>
To your Beatitude, Patriarch Eclecto of Castelo Branco, following the formalties of Justo Lípsio.<br>
And to the sixth month of expedition, we first searched through the sea capitanies, although expulsed from the lands by the donee captains and dutchmen who fest over the place. It is in our belief the witch was there welcomed, and that she would get to know if we pleaded to his majesty, the King, first than the captains themselves.<br>
The expedition then appealed to the divine right of His Holiness, Urban VIII, and the possibility of being excomungated from the church. We gained free pass on the independent state of Maranhão, our search efforts there proving themselves unfruitful.<br>
It is of urgence to send troops to the land of Ceará, Itamaracá, Pernambuco where the dutch have bought the loyalty of the land owners. The captaincy of Ilhéus has been showing to keep steady, its six engines still working and loyal to the crown, the attacks of the natives of ill heart having stopped.<br>
In the captaincy of Espírito Santo, a force of four hundred dutch men was repelled in Vitória by the forces of the captain-mor João Dias Guedes. We were allowed to enter their territory and there to search for the witch. They were again, unfruitful results.<br>
The church was welcomed without having to appeal for the holyness of our mission in the captaincies of Count of Monsanto and the Countess of Vimieiro, where our forces were split. I kept myself searching alone in the captaincy of Santana, to discover both the nobles of São Vincente were the ones keeping cover for the witch.<br>
Attacked for justice to be done my appeal to the Lord of Santana, the witch gained knowledge of my existence and fled with a teleporting spell. But the evil fool forgot behind a toilet brush, which I could use to track her localization by the use of the Silvernight Spell.<br>
In Santana and São Vincente I have reunited a group of infants, none of them half my age, both missionaries and expeditionaries, to continue the hunt for the sorceress who made her majesty, the Queen, fall deadly ill.<br>
In about 500 leagues we entered the Amazon rainforest. The indigenous people of the rainforest have shown varied reactions to our presence. The good-spirited folk, followers of Our Lord and Savior, have regressed to their primitive ways of war, but shielded us against our enemies for recognition of the monastic wardrobe. They spoke in a pilgrim dialet much like portuguese, each one in a different variations from their original languages.<br>
We have there baptized the children who were recently born, discovering that the jesuitic conversion resources still pass on there once or twice a year to allow them to meet Our Lord and Savior. And staying there and slowly moving giving out masses, one of my young followers have turned his back on us, ordering the inquisitive force to leave, saying they were a better christian than myself although not stranged from sin, and there came the new sons and daughters of the Lord with their weapons, banishing the church from their tribe, their loyalty straying away from god for motives unknown.<br>
In other tribes however we were met with straight on heresy and distrust, when not outright attacked, although the rituals of Falling Dusk have helped me much on seeking for safe ways with more allies than foes.<br>
A month on and I have found out the spellplane was being adultered, the rituals of Falling Dusk and Silvernight Spell making me wander on circles. The witch was much more powerful than predicted and the traitor infant previously narrated was already on her influence. Reencountering him, we have found out he had on his entrails a walking bomb, being then bilbred by the warlock at her will.<br>
The subject of our following has demonstereed not only to be a mere herbalist but as well a dedicated and powerful sorcerer, mastering over the spellplane to throw off balance the spellcasting of the holy church. We have returned to the state of Maranhão, where I now write this letter to plead for your assistance on convincing his majesty, the King, on the importance and difficulties not only of our holy cruzade, but also by the people who fest over this land, giving out gifts to the slaveowners make their loyalty stray from the portuguese crown.<br>
My condolences and pleadings,<br>
Deacon Father Antônio da Costa.</p>

</aside>
<p>She had known a many good deed.<br>
Yet when the corruption took root, she was one of the fallen.</p>
<p>She knows not of common sense. She knows not of deceit. She only knows to do the one and only, serve. Seeking information to spread the influence of a vile god.</p>
<p>And today is the most important day of her life. It was her time of coming, to act as an offering to the gods.<br>
“Haha… Take me! Mithras! Take my essence to grant us the power to scatter the fools who do not see your glory as the Only One!”</p>
<p>And the next thing she knew… a blinding light enveloped her eyes. It was beautiful, beyond anything she had seen.</p>
<p>“…”<br>
She bolted upward, looking around her. Around she saw a horrific sight; an unfamiliar room with 4 beds and a door. The bed across from hers had a man sitting up, reading a book. He was none other than the late Prince, Aeneas. The two other beds had men tapping into the air for some things.</p>
<p>The Prince looked up, and simply closed his book. “Well Lydia, could you wear some proper clothing? That is not befitting of you.”</p>
<p>Lydia? That made things more confusing.<br>
“Where are we?” She snapped. She looked down at herself… and it only then came to her attention that she was wearing a two piece.</p>
<p>“Where are we? My, my, this is the retirement home just across the street. You should know it well.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Indeed. I do.” She lied. She stood up and smiled. The things she could do in the afterlife, to fulfil her duty to Mithras. “You know… why don’t we just stay here, Aeneas…”</p>
<p>Her princess mannerisms from her life as a princess. They were bound to help her into the right track to assimilate into the world and stay hidden.</p>
<p>Yet the man put down his book, and sighed.<br>
“Guys, we have a code yellow here.”</p>
<p><em>The two other men spun around.</em><br>
“Code Yellow? The hell is that?”</p>
<p>Wait… is this really the afterlife? Where was she really? And who was Lydia?</p>
<p>No matter. She had the powers granted from Mithras. Surely Mithras will destroy all of them in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>“You may know the truth, but I call up- Ugoh?”<br>
“She’s displaying the cultist tell-tale signs. Call gramps, idiots!”</p>
<p>Boy it wasn’t pretty. She struggled with all her might against Aeneas. But she couldn’t break free. As expected of the prince himself.</p>
<p>An old man walks into the room. As she struggled against Aeneas, the old man takes a look at her.</p>
<p>“The po0r l4ss is influenced by the dr34m g4me. R0FL. Sh3’ll be f1ne, just need ta-”</p>
<p>The Seeker wasn’t going to pay attention to all that. She was going to unleash the full power of Mithras onto all of them. They will worship his might as well.</p>
<p>Aeneas let out a scream of pain as she bit into his arm. As if she was a barking, raving dog, she held on tight. Of course he let go. She stood up in a triumph. The old man rushed out of the room with the other men and locked the door.</p>
<p>“They have gone, but you will be first, Prince Aeneas!” The seeker cackled in delight, licking her lips. In a fervant prayer, she ‘blasted’ her magic onto Aeneas in the afterlife.</p>
<p>No… Mithras? Why didn’t anything appear? Wasn’t she the offering? Why wasn’t she empowered as well as favour to the god?</p>
<p>“Damn it Lydia! Stop this! You’re scaring me!”<br>
Aeneas lunged forward, and tackled her to the ground with an embrace.</p>
<p>“…”<br>
Huh? Lydia… That… that was her name.<br>
She wasn’t getting crushed nor restrained. She was never attacked. It reminded her of someone…<br>
Someone… like him…<br>
Aeneas’s face came to mind. But the name that appeared in her mind was different. Josh…</p>
<p>Oh god. What had she done?</p>
<p>“J-Josh?”<br>
“Oh… thank god you’re back… damn it…”</p>
<p>“Told ya she be fine. LMAO.” Said the old man, walking in.<br>
“She’s definitely not alright!”</p>
<p>That’s right… they were at the beach playing with the rest of the gang. Then Josh wanted to visit his grandpa as the home was nearby. The old man then made them try some sort of weird helmet contraption.</p>
<p>“It’s d3f0 s4f3!” Said the old man before they tried it on.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Josh… does that hurt? W-what have I…”<br>
Lydia pauses, before turning to face the old man with a frown that spoke no lies…</p>
<p><em>“You know, you have some explaining to do.”</em></p>
