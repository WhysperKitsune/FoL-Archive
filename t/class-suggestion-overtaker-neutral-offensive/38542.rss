    <description>**The Overtaker - Unique Neutral Offensive**

**Passive 1: Beyond Corruption**
You can only die from Blue Dragon killer classes or by Execution. You will appear as a member of the Unseen/Cult. You may also talk with the Unseen/Cult in their night chat anonymous. They will not know you are there unless you speak.

**Passive 2: Pure Standings**
If the Unseen/Cult is wiped out, commit suicide the following Night. You are immune to conversion.

**Day Ability 1: Bribe**
If the Unseen/Cult kill tonight, force the person you bribed to do it instead. They will not be notified they were bribed. (2 uses)

**Night Ability 1: Forge Evidence**
Make the Unseen/Cult and yourself appear Blue Dragon tonight. If you are not visited by an investigative class this ability fails. (3 uses)

**Night Ability 2: Tear Gas**
Occupy all visitors to yourself or to an Unseen/Cult member. (2 uses)

Win Condition: Survive to see the Unseen/Cult win and take their throne. 
If you become King you will become an Evil King, keep all of your passives and maintain your win condition.

[Challenge Thread](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/suggestion-for-a-class-suggestion/38423/12)
**Note: The Unseen and Cult lose if they were supposed to win but you are alive.**

<p>Noâ€¦</p>
<p>An investigative class needs to visit you for all of the Unseen/Cult to appear Blue Dragon. Let me give you and example</p>
<p>The Observer visits the Overtaker and the Overtaker uses Forge Evidence. That would mean himself and all members of the Unseen/Cult appear NS. If the Observer did not visit him, or any other investigative class the ability wouldnâ€™t trigger and would waste a use.</p>

            <p>The first night ability is really specific. Make the unseen/cult appears as blue dragon only if an investigative role investigates you that night. So an investatator needs to invest that specific person and a person from the unseen/cult. Thatâ€™s really hard to predict.  Plus I donâ€™t know why the person wouldnâ€™t say there name to the unseen/cult at night and tell them not to kill him. Itâ€™s essentially another unseen/cult member that appears as Neutral. Please explain or reply back to me</p>
