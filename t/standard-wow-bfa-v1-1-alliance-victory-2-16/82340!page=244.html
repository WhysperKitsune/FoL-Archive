<blockquote>
<p>Alice: It looks to me like she’s applying pressure where it counts and legitimately trying to solve the game like she was in Insurgency and I honestly like her tone. Admittedly, she felt almost this same way in CM2, where she was the NK role, so this slot being wolf isn’t impossible, but for the time being, I’m townreading her. My greatest fear though is that she’s puppeting me again like in CM2.</p>
<p>ModeShifter: He doesn’t feel anything like Insurgency and for that I was townreading him, but his tone has worsened considerably with his last interaction with Alice so he’s slipped to a nullread for me. I’d like to see more solving from his slot.</p>
<p>SirDerpsAlot: He’s just here this game. I can’t recall a single post from him off the top of my head since nothing has really stuck out to me, so I’d say a scumlean.</p>
<p>Chloe: She’s a lot more relaxed than she was in Insurgency and for that, she’s my second highest townread because I think she’d seem a bit more stressed as scum. I’m open to reevaluating her if new info comes to light though.</p>
<p>Blizer: I remember townreading him at the beginning but can’t remember why as his pressance has been a bit lacking, so I’m putting him as a nullread right now.</p>
<p>Apprentice: Along with Derps and Blizer, he’s just been here, but it seems he’s at least putting a bit more effort into solving and stuff, so he’s a slight townlean for me. I definitely want to see more from him though.</p>
<p>oB_L1ght: Hmmmm, not sure what to think about him. Sure he scumreads me, but it doesn’t exactly feel like it comes from agenda. He might actually believe that I’m a wolf which is at least somewhat understandable, as he’s acted villagery otherwise. I’m putting him at a slight townlean. This is one slot that I’ll be keeping my eye on though to see how it develops.</p>
<p>Leafia: Hmmmm, this slot truly is an enigma. I’ve been quite a bit different from the last two scumgames that I was in, although I can honestly see why some people might think I’m scum, since I have been a bit sheepish admittedly, so I don’t blame anyone for scumreading me. My highest townread.</p>
<p>Frankie: My third highest townread at the moment as he’s both trying to solve the game and helping to motivate people to do better. It’s possible that he could be that way as scum though, but for the time being, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Ami: She’s just been in and out. A slight scumlean for me that I’d like some pressure applied to so that I can make a better read.</p>
<p>Centuries: This is my highest scumread at the moment. How he defended Mode when people were just trying to apply pressure to him and not lynch him was atrocious. Then as soon as I scumread him for it, he started attacking my slot and throwing shade on me for no reason whatsoever. He has started looking a bit better at least over time, so the possibility exists that he’s V, but I have my doubts.</p>
<p>Italy: He’s kind of just here and I can’t remember much content from him. I wanted to apply pressure to him so that he’d be more active and provide content for us to analyze, but that didn’t really get anywhere. Slight scumlean currently.</p>
<p>CRichard564: Hmmmmmmmm…this slot is the one I’m most unsure about. His scumread on me doesn’t feel wolfish, but at the same time, it doesn’t quite feel real, nor do his other reads quite feel real to me. This is one slot I’ll need to think about but for now, a nullread.</p>
<p>Chuck: He’s at least a bit active but hasn’t done much in the way of reading. Honestly, he’s the most likely candidate to be the LW I think. He just doesn’t feel very townie to me at the moment. I’m scumreading him.</p>
<p>Napoleon: Nappy feels a lot better than he did in CM2, but I do see hints of how he was acting in it in how he’s acting here, but not enough to scumread him for it. If he’s scum, he has really improved his scumgame. He’s a town lean for me.</p>
<p>10_posts_daily: This guy is the most inactive one in the game then he comes in and acts all macholike? I honestly hate his tone right now and he’s a scumread for me at the moment.</p>

<p>I’ve just finished getting caught up and I have a spicy read for everyone. I know it isn’t the consensus and that he was scumreading me earlier, but I think Light is town here and so is Alice. Here’s my reasoning:</p>
<p>Light just feels like a villager that has just given up here with how much he’s been scumread just for having the reads he has, and I don’t really see anything scummy with having static reads since town can do so too if they remain confident in their reads. I’d be more comfortable jettisoning someone who isn’t even trying to play the game than someone who is actually making reads. So I’m parking my vote on who I think is most harmful to the town regardless of their alignment.</p>
<p><strong>/jettison 10 posta daily</strong></p>
<p>Actually play the game that you signed up to play. Regardless of your alignment.</p>
<p>Could Light still be scum? Yes. It’s a possibility. Could Alice be scum? It’s also possible. Could a w!Alice be trying to bus a w!Light to gain towncred? This is the least likely scenario, but still not impossible, because the argument between the two of them feels real, and not staged or faked.</p>

<p>I feel like a Mode ISO could help a lot so I’ll do one right after stating my thoughts about EoD. I wasn’t on due to being overtired from RL and stuff, and I can’t exactly change my vote if I’m not here. I would’ve changed it to Chuck honestly. I don’t know why everyone was so eager to lynch App over him and if I’m not mistaken, Light didn’t just delay CRich’s death, he prevented it. Here’s some noteworthy changes in my views on people though.</p>
<p>CRich: Not sure what to think of him at the moment. He’s either a wolf trying to discredit townies a bit or a misguided town. If he survives tonight, it’ll confirm Light as well, and not knowing for certain whether or not he’ll survive tonight is the only reason why I’m not ISOing him instead of Mode.</p>
<p>Alice’s slot: She’s been slipping a bit in my view. I started out nearly convinced she was town, but she’s done a few wolfy things and her push on App just doesn’t make sense. Usually, she’s better at reading townies than that.</p>
<p>10 posts: My top scumread at the moment with how he has been acting. He’s either a wolf or a troll. That much is a certainty. No one can possibly expect people to think posting only 10 times in one ingame day is townie.</p>
<p>Centuries and Italy: 99% chance of both being town. Not possible for both of them to be wolf. 1% chance of being v/w. Yes, this is due to the fire mage thing. If they’re v/w, it’s always Italy who’s w here. Centuries is now locktown for me.</p>
<p>Mode: He’s definitely been slipping with his baseless accusations, which is why I’ve decided to ISO him to see if he’s town or not.</p>

<p>I don’t even know what to say anymore<br>
Like<br>
I’m exhausted over the amount of times we have pointed out the flip-flops from this slot<br>
I’m starting to think Leafia is LW over groupscum here, and something happened to my occ, because shes so <em>alone</em> - and shes flip-flopping on everyone.<br>
Could be indicative of her not knowing who her teammates are.</p>
<p>Also, she made that stupid bet with the hot sauce, and specified exactly “groupscum” rather than “scum.” I know that’s a stupid way to read someone, but it still strikes me as odd that she used such specific wording.</p>
<p>NKA shows that Frankie could have died because he scumread Leafia, and I wouldn’t put it past her to completely miss his Undead claim - thus not knowing he comes back as a treestump.<br>
I don’t actually think groupscum Leafia would have Vul killed last night - as he was convinced shes town.</p>
