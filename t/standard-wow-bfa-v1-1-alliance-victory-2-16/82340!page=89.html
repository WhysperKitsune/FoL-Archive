<p>And I think Ami just derpcleared herself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t like how Alice denies a derpclear from Nappy and then immediately approves one for Ami, but it could just be confbias on her earlier reads. I don’t like her push on Mode really either. She said that Modes posts were improving but still wanted wagon so I’ll let her explain why that is. I also just disagree with it. I’ve agreed with most everything else though so I’m pretty null on slot overall.</p>
<p>Chloe - I’m pretty sure Chloe’s town. I think I’ve got a decent soulread on Chloe and the main reason she is getting scumread is for her Napoleon push but I don’t think it was a bad faith push</p>
<p>Napoleon - Has improved a lot since start of game. I still think the RT was absolute garbage, but I think I can now reasonably see town Napoleon attempting this and his recent posts are much better. Null overall probably.</p>
<p>Light - I think Light is basically just posting in a way that’ll leave himself in PoE but isn’t distinctly scummy. He’s just providing content that’s hard to read into. I do kinda like his readslist though since it feels like his own legitimate reads.</p>
<p>Leafia - I said earlier, but Leafia tends to have terrible progression as scum and I haven’t seen anything too egregious yet.</p>
<p>Centuries - I really don’t see this as superpower. Maybe groupscum buddying with Nappy here, but the logic for fighting the Nappy push makes sense. Townlean overall.</p>

<p>This is when you actually start doing something rather than coasting with sideline analysis. This was after I called you out on it as well. Here is the post:</p>

<p>I’m concerned about how it doesn’t feel like he’s pursuing his reads or anything. In CFM4 he basically just threw a couple reads out there to make it look like he was analyzing, but never really pursued his conclusions wholeheartedly. It feels kinda similar here where he’s coasting.</p>

<p>I also pinged you for this in particular and asked you later about the Ami wagon, to which, this was your response:</p>

</aside>
<p>See the issue is that you’ve voted Ami, put shade on her, but you introduce a new wagon and really haven’t announced your reasoning for your dissatisfaction of the other wagons, except for this:</p>

</aside>
<hr>
<p>I’ll sum it up. I took all these posts to show how you’ve been doing analysis, but your pursuit was lacklustre. Here, you’re doing a lot of sideline analysis but haven’t been doing much with it until the Ami push. It doesn’t feel like you’re doing your Ami push wholeheartedly - it feels that it doesn’t seem to matter too much to you whether your wagon gets traction or not. You haven’t tried <strong>convincing</strong> people why the Ami wagon is much better than the other wagons rather than just shade Ami for not doing much, despite you admitting that it could be in her meta.</p>
<p>This is what you did in CFM4. Take some towncred, then offer sideline analysis to make it look like you’re doing something.</p>
<p>Also, FTR, I wouldn’t have assumed that if you said that me calling you out did prompt your Ami push, that it meant it was wolfy.</p>
<p>So Apprentice, are you invested in this game? Because it doesn’t feel like you are.</p>

<p>I can see the annoyance for the derpclear, but I still think something feels off with App pushing on Ami - it doesn’t feel complete. Annoyance isn’t unfakeable too and even from wolves it can be genuine.</p>

<p>Could Light still be scum? Yes. It’s a possibility. Could Alice be scum? It’s also possible. Could a w!Alice be trying to bus a w!Light to gain towncred?

<p>I still think you’re v for now, but you’ve begun to slip as your push on Light is beginning to feel like a possible push for a mislynch. I mean, I’ll still trust you for now, but if Light flips v, I’ll definitely be re evaluating your slot.</p>

<p>Leafia’s handling of Me/Light is… unsettling, really.</p>
<p>She’s been less agreeable this match than what I previously saw of her, but how she keeps all possibilities open and looks hesitant to commit to a world feels a bit unnerving.</p>

          <p>I’m going to do these things in chunks, so I can discuss these reads with everybody and have a little break.</p>
<p>Here is my top 4 Town Reads!</p>
<p>Town Reads:</p>
<p>Frankie!</p>
<details>
<summary>
Summary</summary>
<p>I’ve seen this player’s class card. Definitely a town member <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/joy_cat.png!v=9" title=":joy_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":joy_cat:">.</p>
</details>
<p>Crichard564</p>
<details>
<summary>
Summary</summary>
<p>Not much has changed, posting wise, from my original point on him. Copy and Paste it is!</p>
<p>He kind of sheeps consensus a lot. I suspect that he is probably a newer player, but this slot is one that I feel comfortable calling town because he’s been very consistent! CRichard564 has been constantly giving small thoughts on the game state and some of them are very observant and show a level of attention paid to the thread that I don’t think a mafia would usually have. I think this style of posting is much more likely to come from a townie mindset, and I think he is just posting what’s on his mind! This posting style feels like it flows, and is natural.</p>
</details>
<p>Napoleon</p>
<details>
<summary>
Summary</summary>
<p>Napoleon was not looking good during that reaction test of his, and I had a hard time believing it was real, but his posting has significantly improved! He’s been putting forward a pretty genuine attempt to solve it seems,  and there are a few things I think he has going for him. I think his reaction test conclusion was forced, town reading me for my reaction (which as far as I’m concerned is not Alignment Indicative), and I think that’s actually pretty townie. He has been consistently defending his reaction test and the results and I think that this is much more likely to come from a town who genuinely thinks they found a correct read off of the reaction test and is defensive of people disagreeing. I also think that his anger with alice’s disbelief of his reactiontest.</p>

</aside>
<p><strong>So what did you make of this? Did you really feel like this “!” thing was agenda? I also don’t see how this is different from when in a previous game, I asked Prince to execute CRichard N1 to prompt reactions from him.</strong></p>
<p>See this is the issue here. You’re ready to come in and shade where I feel like a V!Alice, if you felt like we both knew it was BS, would be more inclined to see how it plays out.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you referring to the “pocketing” thing? I don’t deny that was ingenuine because it was, it was moreso a mini-RT to see how CRichard would respond to it because people like CRichard tend to post more AI sort of stuff. I know this, look at everything I did to him in SFoL61.5</p>

<p>I know this. But the problem is that your pushes and reads seem way too jumpy. I’ve already explained why and how. You don’t feel to me as very analytical, but more agenda-y, like in RM4.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Looking at the bolded part, I think it’s pretty clear that he believes that his reaction test was genuine and produced results. So this is one of my higher town reads for sure.</p>
</details>
<p>Blizer</p>
<details>
<summary>
Summary</summary>
<p>Not much has changed, posting wise, from my original post.</p>
<p>Blizer has been pretty consistently been looking to solve. It’s the same thing that Light said in his ISO, I think he has had a very clear thought process and he seems to have a solid grasp on the game state. I liked his analysis on Napoleon, it seemed well thought-out and right now I think it is more likely to be solving than agenda.</p>
<p>He also has felt fairly bold. Not afraid to get his hands dirty.</p>

<p>Your not wrong on Centuries, their posts had a performative tone towards it, but i do agree with them on Chloe with her bad Nap push. overall im still ehh on Centuries, but their couple of posts improve (Similar to TBE from FoL 28). Want a bit more content to see their full thought process.</p>
<p>You, are still one of the harder people to read for me, but, from tone and perspective so far, you dont seem to be pushing agenda from my perspective, but i could be missing something</p>

<p>[quote=“Napoleon, post:518, topic:82340, full:true”]<br>
Now that my mind is fresh, I want to make a proper explanation to my actions. People still don’t seem to fully grasp this even when I came back to look again. Here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Napoleon! Your entrance sounded fake!</strong></p>
<p>This argument doesn’t hold. For one, I admitted that I had this pre-planned. Two, I’m not naturally a cocky player, I admit there are better players than me like Alice. Third, though I’m not sure if this impacted it, but it was the end of the night and I felt a bit more tired. This is not a good reason to scumread me.</p>
<p><strong>Napoleon! Your tone feels off!</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, of course. My tone was “off” and therefore I must be wolf. Rokugan, RM4 are both examples of this where I was incorrectly scumread for having a “bad” tone… Stop it… Not all of my villager games are identical and my approach can change based on a lot of factors. Look at my motivations, in Community, it was clear that I was a wolf trying to look town by doing RTs and not using them for anything (that was my worst wolf game, I’ve performed much better as a wolf in other games), but that’s the idea.</p>
<p>How I usually approach games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I’m town, I try and go into early conflicts to take out reactions - like in SFoL 61.5, to formulate reads (Me vs. CRichard D1)</li>
<li>If I’m scum, I try and make myself look town. I usually do this by attempting to mimic my town behavior, so it’s your job to figure out which is which. With that said, I’ll show you what my solving has looked like as town so far:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Napoleon! Your RTs didn’t do anything!</strong></p>
<p>Yes it did. I made conclusions make on this. Frankie was unaware it was an RT and I baited a good reaction out of him as he was the one with the most pressure. And while a few said that “I did RT and didn’t do anything with the results”. <strong>Yes I did</strong> .</p>

<p>I liked the initial response from Frankie but I didn’t want to stop there. I refused to share them for that reason. I’ve also later explained more from what I liked from Frankie further on.</p>
<p>Anyways… this leads me to something else…</p>
<p><strong>Napoleon! Your switch to an RT feels ingenuine!</strong></p>
<p>You seriously underestimate me as a player if you think I make hard scumreads using simple things like an “!”, or if I push agenda with that as a wolf. I’m a player who has a good amount of FM experience and half this thread knows it.</p>
<p><strong>It’s mostly my intro and my interaction with Frankie that’s facing most scrutiny. If anyone wants clarification on what I was thinking at a certain time when making a post, I would be open to it</strong> .</p>
<p>But it seems like only a few people like Alice (who I think is a wolf, btw, ill get more into that a bit later) have unique reads and the others are just sheeping off Alice.</p>
<p>So I was thinking about this overnight, and I’m pretty sure Alice is a wolf. I’ll make a case on her after this post, but to put it short, her posts feel agenda-y and there are some things that are questionable, just like in RM4, where I also correctly scumread her.</p>

<p>I think it’s noteworthy though, that a wolf convincing another wolf to switch targets seems less likely. I don’t think this is a W/W interaction. Alice changed course after Centuries convinced her to, I feel like W/W, Alice would be more adamant to show a level of distancing.</p>

<p>This readlist feels a bit inconsistent. She began by saying that “Ami and CRich” are good and they ended up on the top of the readslist. This is why I suspect that it might be pocketing. Also, she hasn’t really done anything with the Centuries and Napoleon interaction and I think based on her posts the Nap/Centuries ranking is way too harsh to the point of inconsistency.</p>
<p>For those of you are not familiar, Alice pockets a few people (in Community she did Leafia/App, in RM4, she tried pocketing Arete &amp; Seth (Seth wasn’t a hard pocket tbh tho, it was more justifiable)), and shades people to turn them into LHF. Here’s what she did in RM4.</p>

<p>Pocketing one I TR’ed CRich when I got more information than Alice initially did so that argument falls short.</p>
<p>I don’t want to make myself too subjective to conf!bias (maybe some things aren’t AI, but I do think a lot of it is), but I don’t think she did anything that is unfakable as a wolf here and I don’t think she has been warranted of a townlean knowing her skill. She did some shady things, <strong>which I tried to point out earlier</strong> , but no one followed up on it - which I’m assuming was because of my position on the thread as LHF and my OMGUS - but this slot deserves some pressure.</p>

<p>Your not wrong on Centuries, their posts had a performative tone towards it, but i do agree with them on Chloe with her bad Nap push. overall im still ehh on Centuries, but their couple of posts improve (Similar to TBE from FoL 28). Want a bit more content to see their full thought process.</p>

<p>if you actually read the posts, you can see why i town read him.</p>
<p>Look at it like this, Nap does his bad RT out of the gate, his plan was to generate discussion and to see not only the person he targeted her (Frankie), but how others react to his push on him.</p>
<p>afterwards, he gets peoples reactions, and he comes to his conclusion (which is Frankie being a V!lean from his beahviour towards the RT)</p>
<p>He scumreads both you and Chloe for your reactions towards it, and he explains and points out the logic behind his RT.</p>
<p>Nap also put the spotlight on himself by doing that play, Wolfs usually try to coast d1 and push agenda, which is something that lacks from his posts from my perspective.</p>
<p>His behaviour towards his own reaction test, to people reacting towards, and the conclusion of it, plus how he did it does not come from a wolf.</p>

<p>Alright, was busy last night, caught up now</p>
<p>Current Thoughts:</p>
<p>Chloe - Her re-eval of Nap was actually pretty solid all around, there was nothing there that heavily stuck out to me, and i dont see any agenda being pushed here when it comes to Nappy. Very natural all round and tone got slightly better. <strong>/Unvote</strong> Should not be the lynch today.</p>
<p>Alice vs. Mode vs. Light - These 3 had alot of interaction with eachother, and i do think there is a solid chance of a wolf being in one of the 3. Both Seths and Lights posts are all over the damn place when it comes to tone, but Light has a more natural progression when it comes to his thought process. I do wanna Re-Eval Alice depending on the flips here, and see if she is pushing these two in bad faith. I Request a Check on one of the 3 tonight, Pref on Alice.</p>
<p>App vs. Ami - Ami is her usually laid back self tbh, and i know IRL can be busy, but nothing seems off to me tbh. App is heavily pushing for an Ami wagon atm, and it is not gaining any traction. Tone feels off a bit to me, and honestly, feels like a bad faith push to me tbh.</p>
<p>Leafia vs. Centuries - From what ive seen from both here and CFM2, Leafia`s thought process and progression is more natural, where in CFM2, she jumped everywhere, and had actual garbage progression throughout that game. Townlean here. Centuries has gotten better a bit, and perspective reading from both a town and wolf angle, her thought process is more town then wolf. This is a TvT in my eyes.</p>
<p>Italy - Yeah, not much to be said here, hes in his scum meta, which is basically not posting at all, and no motivation to play the game. <strong>/Jettison Italy</strong> . Vote will stay on him unless he drastically improves in the next 12 hours here.</p>

<p>First read list. SDA being so high sticks out to me, along with mode and at the time Centuries.</p>
<p>Considering he just played with Leafia in CFM2, he states earlier that he sees her doing what she was in CFM2, which is quite false imo. Leafia has a much different tone and mindset this game, and has not been as erratic. Dislike the read aswell.</p>

<p>Light - Duh<br>
SDA - I know how SDA plays pretty well (at least when I’m not OMGUSing him), so this is essentially meta<br>
Mode - He hasn’t been giving much of a fuck what anyone else thinks about him. His “holier-than-thou” attitude, as I put it. He hasn’t been pushing agenda, and you push him, it’s not “you’re scum” it’s “well whatever dude”.<br>
Napoleon - I found their RT to be obviously pre-planned, and it seems town-sided. In the following arguments, he responded pretty well most of the time, except for ignoring Chloe.<br>
Blizer - Just pure gut<br>
Chloe - Their posts have been sounding pretty good, I just wish stopped attacking Nap’s RT and started focusing on the rest of the game quicker.<br>
Centuries - Just overall tone sounded pretty good<br>
Apprentice - Pretty much pure gut</p>
<p>Italy - Don’t remember interacting with Italy at all, nothing they did really stuck out to me<br>
Chuck - Don’t remember interacting with Chuck at all<br>
10_posts_daily - They said like two things and dipped. I remember one of their messages sounded good to me, but I’m not going to clear off of a single thing, and will wait for more info.</p>

<p>Now his more detailed reads. hes reading SDA here as Meta, which is think is bullshit tbh. He has a gut read on me (I know he did an iso on me, it wasnt bad, but nothing really noteworthy about it either)</p>
<p>The App read sticks out to me a bit tbh. App wasnt bad earlier, but his play has declined imo, and his push on Ami is in bad faith imo, espically when SDA has basically done as much as Ami.</p>
<p>This feels off tbh.</p>

<p>So my Tinfoil</p>
<p>I think App and Light are W/W here</p>
<p>their reads on each other are stupid, and while app has given a decent explanation for his read on Light, looking back at Light, this read looks bad. And Light just posted he has App for a gutread and nothing more.</p>
<p>I also think that the “Mysterious thing” that was irritating Light, was probs Italy tbh with how he just does nothing in thread at all.</p>
<p>Also, them both scumreading Ami with is stupid when SDA has literally done the same amount of shit as Ami has in regards to discussion, yet Light heavily townreads him, and App thinks this is fine.</p>
<p>I dislike their reads in general atm, and it feels like they are also avoiding interaction tbh.</p>
<p>They have not really talked to each other at all, and i want to see them interact with each other.</p>

<p>Not only tone, but it feels forced.</p>
<p>Ami`s d1 consists of mostly memeing, and i usually treat that shit NAI, cause i know she will start to play more d2, and thats when you can get a more solid read on her imo.</p>
<p>Also, the reasoning for it is bad, when compared to SDA, who also has not contributed to the thread at all, yet does not scum read him for it.</p>
<p>from the look of things, its a shit push, and it looks to be in bad faith tbh.</p>

<p>His first read is on me - but he doesn’t take a strong stance. He never directly says he scumreads me or townreads me, just says that it feels like I’m pushing LHF. Feels uncomfortable. He also doesn’t vote me to back this up until Alice calls him out on it.</p>

<p>This is unnecessary. Takes no real stance. Just says “I want to see more from this before I come to a conclusion.” Could be genuine? Seems a little bit like saying things just to say things.<br>
I also haven’t seen him evaluate SDA’s slot after stating he wants more posts.</p>

<p>Your not wrong on Centuries, their posts had a performative tone towards it, but i do agree with them on Chloe with her bad Nap push. overall im still ehh on Centuries, but their couple of posts improve (Similar to TBE from FoL 28). Want a bit more content to see their full thought process.</p>

<p>This is after quoting the entirety of Napoleon’s wallpost yesterday - in which he defended himself, and gave a stance on Alice. I hate the conclusion and the lack of analysis until (once again) asked for it.</p>

<p>Alright, was busy last night, caught up now</p>
<p>Current Thoughts:</p>
<p>Chloe - Her re-eval of Nap was actually pretty solid all around, there was nothing there that heavily stuck out to me, and i dont see any agenda being pushed here when it comes to Nappy. Very natural all round and tone got slightly better. <strong>/Unvote</strong> Should not be the lynch today.</p>
<p>Alice vs. Mode vs. Light - These 3 had alot of interaction with eachother, and i do think there is a solid chance of a wolf being in one of the 3. Both Seths and Lights posts are all over the damn place when it comes to tone, but Light has a more natural progression when it comes to his thought process. I do wanna Re-Eval Alice depending on the flips here, and see if she is pushing these two in bad faith. I Request a Check on one of the 3 tonight, Pref on Alice.</p>
<p>App vs. Ami - Ami is her usually laid back self tbh, and i know IRL can be busy, but nothing seems off to me tbh. App is heavily pushing for an Ami wagon atm, and it is not gaining any traction. Tone feels off a bit to me, and honestly, feels like a bad faith push to me tbh.</p>
<p>Leafia vs. Centuries - From what ive seen from both here and CFM2, Leafia`s thought process and progression is more natural, where in CFM2, she jumped everywhere, and had actual garbage progression throughout that game. Townlean here. Centuries has gotten better a bit, and perspective reading from both a town and wolf angle, her thought process is more town then wolf. This is a TvT in my eyes.</p>
<p>Italy - Yeah, not much to be said here, hes in his scum meta, which is basically not posting at all, and no motivation to play the game. <strong>/Jettison Italy</strong> . Vote will stay on him unless he drastically improves in the next 12 hours here.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This entire post feels like real solving. Tone seems genuine - and I don’t get any bad vibes from it. His read on Alice stays consistent - when earlier he said “You, are still one of the harder people to read for me, but, from tone and perspective so far, you dont seem to be pushing agenda from my perspective, but i could be missing something.” Asking for a check, and stating that he will re-evaluate based off flips is a good look. He isn’t doing any flip-flopping on the slot.</p>
<p>I wish he provided more insight in the Apprentice push on Ami, and what seems to be in bad faith. Quotes would be appreciated. (edit: ignore. just continued the ISO and he did provide more insight. we gucci)</p>
<p>I agree with his read on Leafia. She is forming her own thoughts (well, if I might add), and her progression on slots <em>exists</em>. She has done some sheeping but I think that’s just her playstyle. I don’t see Leafia flipping groupscum, as she seems very isolated, and I haven’t seen any hints of TMI that I would expect from her. I have a slight tinfoil that this is the superpower - but I <em>don’t know her townmeta</em> so I have nothing to base this off of. I also agree on the Centuries read.</p>
<p>Italy vote I agree with. He has reasoning to back it up - and it isnt naked. He actually <em>takes a stance</em> on the slot, and says hes in his scummeta. No hedge. I like.</p>
<p>What I don’t like is that he still hasn’t provided a real read on SDA after saying he wants more posts from the slot. I’m… unsure if SDA posted in this timeframe, but nonetheless - would like to have seen some mention of him in this “current thoughts” post.</p>

<p>I agree with his CRich read. Though I think any townread on CRich is NAI, as hes pretty freakin obviously in his townmeta. Anyone, regardless of alignment, would likely point this out.</p>

<p>LHF basically</p>
<p>Ami never really has a massive thread presence as either alignment, so it`s NAI</p>
<p>i know app stated it was more of gut read, and now wants an acutal wagon on Ami, but as you said, he has not heavily pushed it till it was pointed out (By you nontheless). Her reasoning for the wagon is blegh, and compared to everyone else who she could scumread, this almost felt like him trying to start a CW compared to the Light and Seth wagons happening at the time.</p>

<p>Ami is a player that is never fully connected and present in the thread as either alignment, she usually memes through d1 pretty much. At times she will point out posts and people she likes or dislikes, but she usually is laid back and non-caring except when it comes to her own slot.</p>

<p>SDA and Ami have both contributed very little to the thread and discussion. In my eyes they look similar tbh (both have given very little in terms of reads and discussion, and both have pushed very little). SDA states he has no motivation, Ami is memeing. I do want a more in depth reason to why you think Ami`s memeing is forced.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Finally we get somewhat of a read on SDA. However, he takes no stance. He just compares how SDA is acting to how Ami is acting - which… I guess means he has SDA as null? He said earlier that Ami’s thread presence is NAI, so I’ll take this to mean he has a null on SDA. This fits with his earlier posts in which he didn’t take a stance on the slot. Looks alright for him.</p>
<p>Next up he has a wall of quotes from oB (which im not quoting because its long) but he provides analysis. It isn’t IIoA - and his thoughts fit everything he previously said. He disagrees with oB’s read on Leafia, calls out oB’s metaread on SDA as bullshit. I like that he’s re-evaluating slots, seemingly not pushing any agenda - and finally taking stances, but not tunneling. Feels villagery. Ends up voting oB to support this.</p>

</aside>
<p>While I disagree with this tinfoil. The tone from this entire post (which i didnt quote the whole thing) feels pure and his thought process makes sense. I wish he would avoid making W/W reads, but this doesn’t feel like agenda. He isn’t hard-tunneling, and he ends the post by stating that he wants to see them interact more with eachother - meaning hes open to changing his mind.</p>

<p>Both of your first Iteration and Re-evaluation lists are pretty much similar.</p>
<p>you just moved me and SDA and Frankie into townleans</p>
<p>and you also havent given a solid read on App outside of it being gut.</p>

</aside>
<p>I like that hes engaging with oB, talking <em>to</em> him, rather than about him. Not afraid of confrontation.</p>
</details>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>… I like this slot.<br>
He has had consistent progression, as well as genuine tone when providing reads and analysis. He doesn’t seem to be pushing agenda, he is open to re-evaluation, and I mindmeld quite a bit with him.</p>
<p>What I really like from this slot is that hes a low-poster who has managed to provide a lot of game-related posts and content. Doesn’t feel like hes skirting around the sidelines. Hes taking stances, not being afraid of confrontation, and seems to be actively trying to solve the game.</p>
<p>Moving him from null to a townlean.<br>
Y’all can fight me on this</p>
