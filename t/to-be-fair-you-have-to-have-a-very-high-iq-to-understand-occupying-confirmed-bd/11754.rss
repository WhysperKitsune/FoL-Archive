    <description>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand occupying confirmed BD. The move is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical scumtells most of the reasoning will go over a typical VI’s head. There’s also NozBugz’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from James2 history, for instance. The Flow understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realise that they’re not just effective- they say something deep about WIFOM. As a consequence people who dislike occupying confirmed BD truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in NozBugz’s existential catchphrase “shove something up ya ass,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Deleter’s Starship Epiphron epic Ship of Fools. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as NozBugz’s genius play unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools… how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a WotC tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

            <p>To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand posting memes from ongoing FM games. The post is very suble, and without a firm grasp of theoretical ignorance most of the reasoning will go over a typical playre’s head. There’s also Icibalus’s nihilistic outlook, which is non-existtent- his personal philosophy draws heavily from not existing, for instance. The FM playerbase understand this stuff; they have the intelectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these posts, to realize that they’re not just funny- they something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike posting memes from ongoing FM games truly are idiots- of course they wouldn’t realise, for instance, the humor in NozBugz’s existential memepost:</p>
