    <description>please give Possessor 3 jumps again

reducing it to 2 was really dumb

EDIT: Poss needs buffs not nerfs, he was already weak and sure he got buffed with new Mystic change but taking away a jump negated that</description>

            <p>Right but now he doesn’t have to save them at all. So there needs to be a limit on it now that Psychic isn’t that.</p>
<p>Plus Possessor rarely used all 3 jumps anyway besides when running from a psychic.</p>

            <p>Who complained about Possessor being too strong, or having too many jumps?  People asked for Psychic to be unable to call out Possessor because of dead chat, nobody asked for him to lose a jump.  Some of my funnest and most interesting games were trying to figure out who was Possessor when there were only a few people left and he saved all 3 jumps for late game.  If Poss is given back his third jump he’s not going to be overpowered.</p>

            <p>I’d suggest making Possess an ability that bypasses healing and immunity rather than giving an additional jump, to be fair. Right now it’s way too common for the Possessor to waste a night and get stuck inside a risky body because they accidentally targeted the MM/CL or someone who got healed/guarded. Despite that the living can’t interact with the dead anymore, the Possessor is still the weakest NK as they don’t have Unseen/Cult to support them like the Sorc or ways to deal with guarded threats like the Reaper. Since the last patch I’ve seen several Reaper and Sorcerer wins, but the only time I’ve seen a Poss win is when both BD and Unseen/Cult played like complete morons.</p>

</aside>
<p>Taking away the jump was to avoid overcompensation. 2 safe jumps is more useful than 3 unsafe jumps making it still an overall buff.</p>
