    <description>I do not like the new global maid spy.  I understand it was intended to stop the whisper meta.  But when Prince outs and demands claims, nobody ever refuses because someone might be spying them.  It only works (somewhat) to dissuade early whispers to King.  And it has the unintended effect of discouraging cooperation among evils and neutrals, which was already difficult to do but is now impossible until it&#39;s gotten to the point where evils are winning anyway.  (e.g. Alch can&#39;t whisper Reaper D2, it&#39;s suicide now, whereas before he could get away with it).  

I propose that spy be reverted to single target, but usable on King.  In fact it used to be single target and not usable on King, so just letting it be used on King should have been the obvious solution to the whisper meta (for those who didn&#39;t like it).  Making it be global was just overkill and takes away any skill involved the ability, since now every Noble is just mindlessly clicking spy on N1.  

I do not like the new merc and sellsword.  It feels like you just die and hope your team wins.  Sellsword especially, you cannot communicate with your allies because of the noble spy.  So they always accidentally kill you.  

I love the new Court Wizard because his swap bypasses redirect immunity.  But the empower could be greatly improved.  I don&#39;t like how empowering a social class makes them conversion immune, we already have a day ability to do that.  It&#39;s redundant and we don&#39;t need a court wizard making two people conversion immune on the same night, conversion immunity is one of the most frustrating parts of this game.  

There is no penalty for accidentally empowering a Cult Leader, Mastermind, Reaper, or Possessor if he&#39;s using Possess.  This is terrible ... Looking at it another way, there is no reward for a Cult Leader, Mastermind, or Reaper convincing a CW to empower them.  

I strongly dislike Possess bypassing heal.  Bypassing healing was Reaper&#39;s gimmick and I wish it were reverted.  

I do think that Possessor should be able to jump out of order execution.  Possessor is already killing his current body by jumping to a different one, so it doesn&#39;t make sense that King helping him kill his current body should actually kill the Possessor himself.  This would also make Possessor better at framing King which a lot of people want already (he could bait King into order executing him then facelift as a BD class to make it look like King killed a BD).

[poll type=regular public=true]
* Noble spy is fine as is 
* Noble spy should be single target but usable on King to counter whisper meta 
[/poll]

[poll name=poll2 type=regular public=true]
* Possess should bypass healing 
* Possess should NOT bypass healing 
[/poll]

[poll name=poll3 type=regular public=true]
* Possessor should be able to jump out of King Order Execution 
* Order Execution should kill Possessor even if he jumps

            <p>But it discouraged whispering too much.  The old one would be fine if it could target king and worked like sheriff’s scout(meaning it remains on the target until you change targets).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Possessor needs a way to kill MM and king.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree, as BD is looking for the MM always (know what to expect) and usually the king is saving guards or using them all up by day 5. Also order execution leaves him time to kill.</p>

            <p>Noble: Agreed. Whispers didn’t need to be discouraged this much.</p>
<p>Mercenary: Agreed, merc needs another rework.  It’s win con is too easy.  There was nothing wrong with the concept of the old mercenary</p>
<p>Court wizard: Agreed.  I would still prefer the generic empower.  Night immunity is also redundant, it’s just a weaker version of other protective abilities</p>
<p>Possessor: Agreed, possess should bypass night immunity instead.  Possessor needs a way to kill MM and king.  I disagree about poss jumping when OEd though, they’re dead when they get OEd</p>

            <p>I think we need to do something better with merc and sellsword. Right now they feel of place and even if BD kills a merc, nothing is really lost. I liked merc when he was guarding a single target. What do you guys think</p>
