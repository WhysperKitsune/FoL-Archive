    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-execution-suggestions/3182</link>
    <description> Hey guy&#39;s today i just wanted to talk about the topic known as &#39;executions&#39; basically i was thinking of executions not  so i decided to suggest some executions anyways here we go 

**Bare hands**- First of all you punch your target to break their jaw you will hear a crack sound then break their ribcage with a  barrage of blows then start breaking their other bones at the end your target will be at the ground and you will lift him up and throw him to the ground breaking his bones.

**The blood of mithras** - You will gain red tentacles and start piercing them and skin their back *alive* then after that you will pin them to the ground with your red tentacles and start eating them up alive.

**The dagger of Corax** - You will summon a dagger made up off darkness and slit their throat open then stab their stomach and kick them to the ground breaking their skull. 

**Illusion knife** -You will toss your target a knife and make them see illusions of them killing their loved ones and then they will commit suicide by stabbing themselves in the head and dying.

Anyways guy&#39;s this all i have for today.</description>

            <h2>Roundhouse kick execution</h2>
<p>The executioner (Accuser is better word?) will jump mid-air before launching their legs in the air as well kicking the suspect of the trial flies off-screen accompanied with window glass shattered on impact, yes the kick is so powerful you simply kick them off the throne room and the accused will die from falling to their death off the castle.</p>

            <p>Well my idea for illusion knife was that the target would only see the illusions aka by that i mean no one will ever see it and the target just stabs himself in the head falls down to his knees and then falls down and lies down  with a sad face of sadness   and burden</p>
