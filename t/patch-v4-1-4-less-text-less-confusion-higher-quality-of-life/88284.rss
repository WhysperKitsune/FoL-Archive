    <title>Patch v4.1.4: Less text, less confusion, higher-quality of life</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/patch-v4-1-4-less-text-less-confusion-higher-quality-of-life/88284</link>
    <description>:mega: We believe a solid foundation is important to build upon. This patch offers: 

1. Lower learning curve for new and returning players
2. Less bloaty text for everyone, when hopping through class cards, glossary, or guide texts trying to find &quot;that one thing&quot;.
3. Significantly-more accurate and less-confusing class cards, tips, glossary, guide, etc.
4. Legibility of text (since it&#39;s a text game!) with less &quot;weight&quot; and less homework to learn things.
5. Quality of life: Things can get overwhelming fast -- now, less so.

## Class Fixes

- Fixed nearly every reported inaccuracy within class cards (too many to list).
- Chronomancer&#39;s *Distort Reality* abil feedback text to the victim no longer shows the incorrect text in green, as if it was a good thing happening you.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed specific win conditions for quests.
- Suspended players will no longer get stuck at the login screen (and stuck &quot;Loading...&quot; from news): They should now properly see the popup and an explanation in the news area.

## QoL

- Clicking on an &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; link now has an animated arrow guide you to the exact term you are looking for:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/580380189079502868/860036095005425674/lerp-cc-glossary.gif
- Streamlined numerous class cards, abilities and tips to get the point across with shorter, to-the-point descriptions. In addition, wording should now feel more-similar and streamlined. There may be some new &quot;info passives&quot; that simply explain deeper mechanics better.
- Changed all class card tips to be short bullet points.
- Fixed class card glossary/class links - they should all be clickable and accuracy, now.
- Tutorial now initially hides most the UI, then slowly introduces elements.
- Some UI elements are now draggable, where you shouldn&#39;t be able to &quot;lose&quot; them off the screen:

- Glossary links now work (to other parts of the glossary, or class cards).
- Glossary/class card links are now clickable from the rotating tips.
- Updated and streamlined glossary to have less text and be more-legible.
    - Also added new clickable terms (that interact via clicks from other places, such as class cards), such as Poison, Intensify and several player-meta terms.
- Updated the Guide, similarly to above.
- Clickable neutral class links are sometimes **bolded** when seen with other white text. If you see other areas that have a good fit for this, treat it like a bug and toss it into Discord #bug-report (thanks!).
- Faction colors are now more-legible, dynamically changing based on the background: They are now brighter or darker, depending on what is more-legible to read. This should take effect throughout the game: Please report inconsistencies.
- All in-game class card links should now work — and added a few more acronyms for classes.
- Fixed in-game, automated mute system to be less confusing and more-informative; additionally, it now alerts you *how long* you&#39;ll be [temporarily] muted for and *when* the mute lifts (almost ported to lobby, too, but delayed due to hackers):

- Deathnote colors in the store no longer show a tier color, to prevent confusion:

We thought we may as well toss you what we were working on before moving to anti-hack (next patch) :+1:
