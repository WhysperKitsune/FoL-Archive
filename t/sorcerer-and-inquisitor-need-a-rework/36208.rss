    <title>Sorcerer and Inquisitor Need a Rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sorcerer-and-inquisitor-need-a-rework/36208</link>
    <description>Sorcerer, despite all the buffs it got, still gets so easily destroyed by the Blue Dragon, and I mean BLUE DRAGON, not even its main opponent, the Inquisitor. I feel as if both these classes need a bit of a rework so that Inquisitor becomes the best person to find and kill the Sorcerer, and not be handed free wins when the Blue Dragon lynches the NK. And I think that the Cult should be removed from the list of Magic Users to not make the Inquisitor have a harder time hunting the Sorcerer down in Cult Games, while being a major boon to the BD hunting down the Cult.

Inquisitor

Passives 

Holy Blessing: You are immune to death at night once.

Spanish Inquisition: Your visits will be hidden at night. Once the sorcerer is dead, you will not be able to use your abilities.

Abilities

Find Magic: (Unlimited) (Night)
Check two people. If neither player is a Sorcerer, Court Wizard, Priest (just in case it ever comes back), Psychic, or Paladin, or their converted forms, it will show as non-Magic. If one or both are of the classes above, it will show that at least one is a magic user. 

Ruthless Efficiency: (3) (Night)
Choose a player. If they are magic, you will visit them and kill them. Bypasses Sorcerer&#39;s night immunity.

<p>The sorcerer’s problem, like all the other NKs, is the king’s Allies, which (if you count the people who die in the first few nights, narrowing down the checks on nights 3, 4, and 5) has about a 1/3 chance of catching you with no real hope of escape.  Giving the Sorcerer protection from that is the wrong move - Allies itself needs to be changed, since it’s also a problem for all the other neutrals.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d also put it foward that sorcerer is even MORE vulnerable to this than other NKs. I don’t know about you, but for me when a king does a “all neuts whisper me”, as most NKs I whisper the king and claim alc or similar because of how rediculously probable it is to get caught by the king… In sorc/inq games as sorc I don’t whisper, but I do make sure to attack someone that does twice (generally speaking my goal as sorc is to outlive the inq… never made it even that far, but it’s a slightly more attainable goal for me). I’ve pretty much always been able to find the inq, get the first hit in on him before getting caught by the king and executed.</p>
<p>I’ve never been inq before, but I can tell you if I were, I’d be doing the same thing, RE on people stupid enough to whisper the king on the neut call. because that’s a darn good way to narrow down suspects, and worse case scenerio you kill an alc or something that distracts from BDs search for the sorc.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have to say I fully 100% disagree with the removal of immunity to knights claims, and I’ll further state it doesn’t go to mend it. Knight claims are auto execute because unless they get lucky or correctly predict the destination or identity of an evil… they are unverifiable. You want to fix knights kill on sight issue… the obvious first step is to not make knight one of like 3 classes that can’t self prove his category without luck or great scumreads. (by this I mean make more classes that can’t directly be confirmed for their category or make some classes that currently are obvious less obvious)</p>

</aside>
<p>Honestly this one is where I gotta disagree the heaviest. The inq has one job… one lousy job… You throw in these changes… and you’ll have succesfully made the inquisitioner worse at his job than a knight. As if the knight succesfully predicts the sorc’s target, he effectively autokills it.</p>
<p>To me I still hold that the biggest unsalvagable problem between the sorc/inq classes. is that the inq is the one the sorc can fool. I’d say the oposite should be the case… and you went a huge way foward witht that (IE sorc appears as bd passive, which I fully support).</p>
<p>Personally I think I’d preffer the appear bd to be an active button (only because people freak out if there isn’t a day button). But avoid any “hide from inq” abilities. IMO to entirely justify the existance of a cat and mouse combination… the sorcerer needs to be waaay better at hiding from BD than normal NKs, and the inquisitioner needs to be notably better than BD at hunting the sorc. Giving the sorc a “hide from inq” ability, undermines that balance… especially if we are making sure he stays vulnerable to many bd classes (from this proposal, his weaknesses would be, observer, knight, hunter, princess, butler, drunk)</p>

<p>No because then if the Sorcerer claims Alchemist/Physician then he’s kind of screwed. He is given that to stop Wolves from preventing the Sorc from claiming Physician/Alchemist and to stop Unseen/Cult killing their own allies.</p>

<p>Unfortunelty he doesn’t. Win cons said that the Sorcerer needs to survive to see the BD fall. Doesn’t mean that they should be immune to bleed and poison as the fact the Sorceror should remain hidden at all times.
