    <description>Hello guys and welcome to my Guide **„Help, i got converted“**, where I will talk detailed about how to behave after you got converted to the Unseen/Cult.

First of all, my name is Fenryll. I am a passionate gamer and fell in love with this community. As I continued playing the game I realized that a lot of players change their behavior and/or logs after being converted which outs them pretty easy if done wrong. To help you progress as a professional liar, I decided to write this guide.


 **1.  I am starting as Unseen/Cult. What do I claim?**

As a beginner it is sometimes incredibly hard to understand which claims work well and which will make you suspicious immediately. So I will create a short Tier list with claims that might work the best for you.

**~ The Mastermind ~**

**Tier 1:**

**Princess**  -&gt; _with your “Foresight” you can determine a player’s converted class type. This ability is similar to Princess’ “Flirt” and helps you to create a reasonable and easy log_

**Hunter** -&gt; _just as the Mastermind the Hunter is occupy immune and a good claim if someone did try to occupy you. Also executing a Hunter claim is always risky since his passive “Retribution” kills the first person to accuse the Hunter. People will think about it twice before deciding to execute or pardon._

**Sheriff** -&gt; _as the Mastermind is shown as a special / investigative class, so is Sheriff. You can easily fake logs and Members of the Blue Dragon will think twice before executing a potential Investigator._

**Tier 2:**

**Physician** -&gt; _it is super easy to fake logs of a healer. But if they actually need healing, you might be revealed pretty quick._

**Observer** -&gt; _this claim is only for experts on the game. Observer logs are really hard to fake but with the cooperation of an Aristocrat and his “Snoop” ability to read a player’s journal a solid log can be created and you will be rarely doubted._

**~ The Assassin ~**

**Tier 1:**

**Knight** -&gt; _this is probably the most used and easiest claim. But also the one people get suspicious about._ 

**Butler** -&gt; _as a offensive class you cannot be outed by a princess that easily. But Butler’s are occupy immune while Assassins are not. Once you got occupied, you might be in trouble._

**Tier 2:**

**Drunk** -&gt; _this is pretty much the same as a Butler claim. But as no one ever gets redirected by you, it is easy to spot the lies._

**~ The Cult ~**

There is no real Tier list for the Cult roles. 

It’s mostly safe to stay with the claim you were before you were converted or if you started as cult go with a role that has the same class as yours. 

_For example the Cult Leader is an investigative Class therefore it is safe to claim a role like Paladin or Princess._
_If you start as an Invoker who’s an offensive class, it is safe to claim a role like Butler or Knight._
_If you start as a Ritualist who’s a support class, it is safe to claim a role like Court Wizard or Physician._


**2. I got converted. When do I change my claim/log?**

First of all, if you have claimed your role to the Psychic, the Prince or the King, do not change it after being converted. This raises too much Suspicion.

If you did no claim a role before you got converted, there are a few things to consider.

**1. Are you occupy immune after your conversion?**
**2. Were you occupy immune before your conversion?**

Those 2 Questions are pretty important. 

Some classes might lose their Immunity after being converted.

Occupy immune classes are: _The Possessor, The King, The Mastermind, The Scorned, The Prince, The Butler, The Servant, The Drunk, The Alchoholic, The Fool, The Hunter, The Poacher, The Invoker and the Sorcerer._

**If your status on occupy immunity has changed, you might want to change your claim into a class, that fits to your immunity.** 


**3. I have become the Cult Leader. Do I change my Log to a special / investigative class?**

As said before, if you have claimed your role to the Psychic, the Prince or the King, it is rarely a clever idea to change your claim. Otherwise feel free to adjust your logs.

**~ Important ~**

Certain classes are considered Unique, meaning a maximum of one will appear in any given game. 

The Unique classes are: _The Assassin, The Cult Leader, The Hunter, The King, The Mastermind, The Poacher, The Possessor, The Prince, The Reaper, The Sage, The Scorned, The Inquisitor and The Sorcerer._

If you claimed one of these classes and the original Person with this class died, you should change your claim immediately.

Also most classes cannot appear more than 2 times at the same time in a game. So for example, if you claimed Sheriff and 2 Sheriffs are dead, you should change your claim as well.

Also, if you talked alot before you got converted, keep talking alot after you got converted. Alot of players suddenly get quite after being converted to not expose anything or anyone.


**TL;DR:**

_**•	If you have claimed your role to the Psychic, the Prince or the King, do not change it after being converted**_
_**•	Pay attention to Occupy Immunity.**_
_**•	Do not claim a unique Class if the actual Player is already outed/died.**_</description>
