    <description># Alright listen up all you wannabe faction creators, I&#39;m about to give your ass, and various other parts of your anatomy, a crash course in faction design

# Warning, some of the terminology I use here may be new to you, these terms are in no way official, but I will be using them, so get used to &#39;em, I&#39;ll be marking special terms in *italics*

# Step 1: Catalytic Converters
The first thing you want in your faction is a converting class, your faction&#39;s equivalent to the Mastermind or the Cult Leader, once you&#39;ve worked out how your converter works, that become the baseline for essentially every other class in your faction, remember that the conversion should be different to how the conversions to the Unseen and Cult work, as that makes them more original and perhaps more likely to be liked, you also need to work out whether or not the converter is replaceable as that should influence its secondary abilities and passives

# Step 2: Best Friends
Next, you need to pick whether or not your faction has a second special starting class(perhaps a Killer) and make that(unless you don&#39;t want one in which case skip to Step 3) make sure the abilities fill in the gaps that your Converter may not have, and you should probably make it so it can work well without a converter if your converter dies and can&#39;t be replaced or whatever

# Step 3: Lists
Make a list of every convertable class(for reference it&#39;s every BD except Prince, King and Your faction counter(see Step 5) and also Mercenary, then work out what each should convert into(depending on your method of conversion)

# Step 4: Classes
Make all the classes, if you need help with this step, consider consulting my [class creation guide](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/rubys-epic-guide-to-creating-a-class/2221)

# Step 5: Countering
Time to make a counter to your faction, you faction&#39;s equivalent to the Sheriff or Paladin, they do not have to be an Investigative class like those two, although it should generally have 2 abilities, one of which is used to find members of your faction, and the other is something else

# Step 6: Publish
Publish your finished faction and watch as people mercilessly tear it to shreds and point out all its flaws, or watch people gush over how good it is, or perhaps something in between</description>
