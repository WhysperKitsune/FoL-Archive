    <title>Community Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/community-suggestion/79163</link>
    <description>I think it&#39;s pretty agreed around the board (feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong) that this community could use with a tad bit more members.
I&#39;m planning on hosting a 36 player SFoL but I worry that creating so much classes and then it being canned not due to lack of interest but lack of players is a high probability.
WoW:BfA had a hard time launching.

Would it be best if, for the fifth annual Newbie NFoL5, we did something special to attract new players?
Just a suggestion. Feel free to leave your thoughts here.</description>
