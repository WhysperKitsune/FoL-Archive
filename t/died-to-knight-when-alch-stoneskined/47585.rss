    <title>Died to Knight when Alch Stoneskined</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/died-to-knight-when-alch-stoneskined/47585</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I bombed someone to prove I was alch (As requested by prince) and was killed by knight guarding that person, even though I stone skinned

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to either kill him, or fail to kill him. But I wasnt supposed to die as I had stone skinned

#### Steps to reproduce:
Use SS as alchemist, then bomb someone protected by knight

#### Comments:
Im assuming this is a bug. But if its not, Id like to know how that plays out.</description>

            <p>In general easiest way to think of it… night immunity protects you from all attacks targeting you individually. Night immunity never protects you from the consiquences of what you target (regardless of whether it is intentional or forced)</p>
<p>The one exception to that rule, is the reaper, which has both a unique form of night immunity that resurects it from anything other than being executed in the court if he has souls, and an ability that actually breaks through night immunity of the people he targets, and the prince’s execute, which can kill anything but a reaper with souls.</p>

            <p>Yeah while it may not be intuitive, it is in the description for the knights skill sacrifice</p>
<p>“Protect a player, giving your life to kill their attackers. Bypasses death immunity.”</p>

            <p>Most death immunity does not protect from “counter attack” kills. These kills include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunter Bear</li>
<li>Knight and Death Knight Sacrifice</li>
<li>Sorcerer Circle of Death</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not a bug, but it’s definitely not intuitive.</p>
