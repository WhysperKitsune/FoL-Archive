    <title>Possesor jump rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possesor-jump-rework/11298</link>
    <description>I mentioned this in another topic, but maybe it&#39;s own topic would be more merit for discussion.

Right now the possesors jump is mostly unusable, early game you create a dead bitter person who knows your identity, and is certainly going to out you to the first psychic or or death knight that comes along.

Late game you are fighting against all the private information that anyone you might posses has already shared, whether it be codewords or simple &quot;what did we whisper about n3&quot; etc....

What if instead of working against you, the person works for you. But at the cost of your own control.

Rework concept
When a possesor jumps into someone, he for all intents and purposes dies, but rather than going into dead chat, the possesor joins a possesor chat, that shows up as a new tab for the person he jumped into.

The person jumped into, keeps their identity, but becomes a possesor (without the jump ability already used of course). This is basically a conversion. The possesor can talk to and advise the person, but ultimately the newly converted person, has the steering wheel, but they are now on the goal of win as possesor.

They are  now pretty safe from codewords etc.. as they still know everything they knew before. There&#39;s no bitter dead guy trying to screw them over, and the only behavior change to watch for, is what happens from their goal being different now.

The big drawback of course is people being unhappy with their side being flipped at the last second... but that&#39;s kind of part of the game anyway with unseen/cult conversions.</description>

            <p>As I said I’ve never seen deliberate intentional codewords. I have seen a heck of a lot of “hey we whispered on day 3 about something, what was it”.</p>

            <p>Players can barely figure out who to lynch during the day with the time they’re given as it is. You expect BD to be THAT coordinated? Good luck <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
<p>I’ve seen code words work a couple times. They are a good deterrent against Possessor jumps.</p>

            <p>There is a system where a group of 3 people cannot have the code be compromised.</p>
<p>Everyone in a group of people (Labled A B and C) shares 2 code words with each other(for example something said in a psychic chat)</p>
<p>In order:<br>
1.A tells B code 1<br>
2.C tells A code 1</p>
<p>3.B tells A code 2<br>
4.C tells B code 2</p>
<p>If A was poss then they would fail to say code 1<br>
If B was poss then they would fail to say code 2<br>
If C was poss then they would fail to say code 1 and 2</p>
<p>To make it fool proof:</p>
<p>If B calls out A in step one then both of them send code 2 to C who then knows who is lying<br>
If A calls out C in step two then both of them send code 2 to B<br>
If A calls out B in step 3 then the same thing happens as with step 1. If they both send the same code then A is poss.</p>

            <p>Keeping them out of dead chat, doesn’t really fix the key weakness though of everyone having had some kind of private interaction with everyone else, of which the possessor cannot possibly answer. Even things as simple as what did you claim to the king and/or prince, are auto loss questions. Don’t want to bet on anyone else, don’t jump… same as it is now really.</p>
<p>The options could also be reversed, where the possesor does take the forefront of the body, the possesed is in the passanger seat, but still has the win condition of helping the possesor win. I personally like that idea less, as the possesor is the one making the choice, and I personally wouldn’t want to be put in the back seat due to someone elses decision.</p>

            <p>Exactly this. The person you jumped to is still the class they were. They don’t win with you, and they shouldn’t anyway. It’d be better if the jumped person never goes to dead chat.</p>

            <p>I kinda like this rework. I think I know what developers had in Mind when creating a Possessor, they wanted him to be very hard, but powerful class, but at the moment Possessor is miserable at best.</p>
