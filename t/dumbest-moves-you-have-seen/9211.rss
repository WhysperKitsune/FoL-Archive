    <title>Dumbest Moves you have seen</title>

    <description>Similar to other topic about your dumbest moves, but instead the dumbest move you have witnessed.

Here is mine:

Its day 3
One player is put on the stand. 4, because we suspect him.
He claims noble, but fails the tests we give him (maid test).
He acts in an extremely foolish way, and we decided to pardon because we think he is fool.

As usual, the prince is too stupid to actually jail/execute the fool as asked.

The days keep going and we kinda ignore the fool.
Eventually, our king dies.

I actually decide to push for the fool to be made king. My thought process was if we actually want to execute him, we can now freely do it (and a neut king can arguably be helpfull).

A bit later, i am put on the stand... and guess what people do... they all seek that &quot;fool&quot;&#39;s approval.
They all go &quot;King, do we execute?&quot;.

Then the game keep going where everyone just blindly sheep that &quot;king&quot;.

and he eventually flipped evil king.</description>

            <p>Heres what happens<br>
Im possessor its D6<br>
The MM decides to try and push on me for being an NK(They think im the fool)<br>
I know he is the MM.I get put on stand everyone guilties.<br>
The assassin is then jailed and executed.<br>
The MM gets hung the next day.<br>
And BD win.<br>
Dumbest play ever.You have to hope that either BD are smart on their own or don’t kill your guys.<br>
Bc as unseen you can just hang the Nk when you have majority.Like how would i have outed his immunity?<br>
I’m alch i poisoned him and he is immune.Then you would have to explain why the poison and how your not an NK claiming alch.</p>

            <p>Lol newarkinvaders</p>
<p>For some reasons, most people in this game LOVE to sheep the king no matter what. I have no idea why. They prefer sheeping the king over a resurected sheriff.</p>

            <p>Oh so many awful games .<br>
My worst was</p>
<p>I was an observer  this was my first 4 turns</p>
<p>night 1 watch someone of no consequence<br>
night 2 watch someone of no consequence . Meanwhile Assassin dies .<br>
night 3  12 visited 4<br>
night 4 peak 12 - 12 is unseen .</p>
<p>Me : guys 12 is unseen , just pulled it up , I am obs .</p>
<p>12 gets hung , yay he was mastermind</p>
<p>during the next night the king dies  and 4 goes upto be king</p>
<p>Me guys  :  I think 4  may have been converted night 3 , mastermind visisted him .</p>
<p>4 : umm he just visited me to check class</p>
<p>Everyone Else  : cool , lets make 4 king</p>
<p>Me : wtf ?</p>
<p>Next few turns is me trying to convince everyone that 4 is evil king .  While people execute randoms that the king keeps suggesting might be evil . One of them is  a possessor , so everyone thinks King is great .</p>
<p>I get executed about night 6 because “I kept voting for the king”</p>
<p>The king then continues to exe ransoms with the full backing of everyone , whilst I sit in the graveyard as Salty as Fuck .</p>
<p>Eventually evil king wins ,<br>
Turns out as well that he was the only member of unseen since turn 4 .</p>
