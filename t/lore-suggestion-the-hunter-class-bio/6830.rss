Lore Subject: 2 Lone wolves.

Lore:

It has often been argued whether the Hunter or the wolf is the more formidable of this pair. Most would say that both would be worthless without the other. In the case of the Hunter class these rumours should be regarded as false. Both man and wolf are formidable but together they form something far more dangerous. Their aptitude for teamwork so legendary that those who fell a large monster are given temporary residence at the castle as a reward. Their pride does not allow the use of butlers however the comfy bed is enough reason to stay. Quite often they redecorate with their own trophies. 

Their presence is an unwelcome one however as their paranoid temperament continually injures castle staff and the wolf is seen as an uncaged animal who howls in the dead of night upsetting various nobility.None would dare try to remove him however as they know without a decent way to politely ask him to leave the hunter will take down those who would deny him his deserved reward. 2 lone wolves in the lap of luxury.</description>
