    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Deceiver [Neutral Offensive]</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-deceiver-neutral-offensive/51816</link>
    <description>&gt;## [color=grey]Deceiver[/color]
&gt;[color=grey]Neutral Offensive [/color]
&gt;**Win Condition:** Survive to see 3 Blue Dragon to be executed during the day.
**Accurate: (Passive)** You are Immune to target changing. 
**Determination (Day):** Become Occupy and Death Immune tonight. (2 uses) 
**Mislead (Night):** Force a player to target someone. Cannot be used to target yourself or themselves.(Unlimited uses) 
**Frame (Night)** Frame a player. He will appear suspicious to Investigative abilities tonight. (3 uses) 

&gt;Conversion Immune.

&gt;LORE:
A Sheriff who once solved cases for the Blue Dragon. His wife was hanged for treason, even when there were no procuring evidence against her. In the light of her being wrongly accused, he decided that the Blue Dragon were no longer worthy of his services, seeking revenge against the Blue Dragon. They must suffer in the same way his wife died, he must have his revenge.

CLARIFICATION: Once 3 Blue Dragons have been executed during the day, this class wins even if he dies the day after. I may tone down the Win-Con to 4 if 3 is too easy.
Any thoughts on this? Was thinking of a neutral offensive. Hopefully this tilts in favour :D</description>

            <p>The name is what Im mainly pondering rn. And im on phone so sorry for the poor formatting.</p>
<p>I do feel that the win condition is ok, that is to survive to see 3 BDs executed. Because I feel that this class is actually pretty glaring, “If you were redirected randomly, its kinda obvious that there is a Vigilante in the game”. Its also neccessary for this class to survive through (Does not have perma death imm) which means this class cannot rest on its laurels.</p>
<p>Also it being offensive means that someone is going to shout occ imm! And it can’t really claim butler or drunk, can it? Drunks will claim Redir Imm while Butlers will claim not Occ Imm. Oh?</p>
<p>And the Passive works against it, making it easier for the Vigi to win. Since it has to survive to win, Death Imm twice seems fair imo.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/deathreaperrh">@DeathReaperRH</a> I didn’t choose the name correctly. Oops.</p>
<p>I understand that it feels a little like scorned, but scorned has specific targets, while this guy here has none. He has no idea who to frame, and has to deduce with the rest of the cast and hopefully get some BD. If you give him a killing ability, this will become a killer, which I believe we have enough on right now.</p>

            <p>I was thinking of a class with exactly this wincon that’s spooky. Yeah I love it, the idea of a neutral who just wants to cause unorganised chaos in the day-time is beautiful. Scorned has a similar premise behind it but it is more reliant on clinical lies as opposed to pure utter chaos which is more fun.</p>

            <p>Ok let me point this out. You want to see 3 BD executed during the day. This seems like scorned basically. It is slightly different in that any 3 BD will do and the scorned can only win if their target dies but the similarities are there. I like <a class="mention" href="/u/chocolate">@Chocolate</a>’s changes but in the end I feel like this class already exists with scorned being out there. Now if you changed it slightly and I think this would be interesting as a vigilante. I would change the win con to kill 3 people.(Execution or my new night ability)I would change Mislead with Vengeance(Night)-Shoot someone who has been on trial causing them to bleed .They will die in 1 day.Lorewise-The court thinks they’re innocent but you know better.You know what they did. You have come for vengeance. I feel like these changes would help cause chaos as someone would be bleeding and you would always be pushing for trials.Another 2 day abilities that would cause chaos is if you give him nightshade poison-4 uses and troll box-unlimited uses. I think it would also cause chaos if you give him a passive that A-Let them spam trollbox but B-Healed someone who is bleeding or poisoned that night. This would also somewhat stop the existence of vote for class which I do use frequently in games as it is such an effective way to get classes. This class’ existence would make Bd think-Do I want to put this guy on trial?<br>
and I think it would be interesting.</p>

<p>Name will definitely confuse ToS players<br>
Should be Neutral Social, as it is trying to hang BD players<br>
Goal is pretty easy. I’d go with 4 BD, or perhaps <em>Make the BD lose</em></p>
<p>I’d say Occupation immunity is a good passive, and Death immunity shouldn’t be much of a thing. Maybe give the Evil a shot of perception? or just a one time immunity.</p>
<p><strong>Determination,Passive: Immune to occupy and redirection.  immune to death one time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two Birds(Passive): Seeing a Scorned’s target executed counts as two. Seeing a fool executed counts as one. [Due to the limit on two Neutral Socials per game, this will not be abused]</strong></p>
<p>That frees room for two day abilities, and there’s still room for another night ability</p>
<p>Also encourages them not to go for the easy target, but rather to cooperate with other neutrals. Just a touch.</p>

            <p>I like it! The goal is to hinder BD, meaning it’s not something you would want to fake claim as, nor is it something the BD would want to let sit around (kind of like fool.)</p>

            <blockquote>
<h2><font color="grey">Deceiver</font></h2>
<p><font color="grey">Neutral Offensive </font><br>
<strong>Win Condition:</strong> Survive to see 3 Blue Dragon to be executed during the day.<br>
<strong>Accurate: (Passive)</strong> You are Immune to target changing.<br>
<strong>Determination (Day):</strong> Become Occupy and Death Immune tonight. (2 uses)<br>
<strong>Mislead (Night):</strong> Force a player to target someone. Cannot be used to target yourself or themselves.(Unlimited uses)<br>
<strong>Frame (Night)</strong> Frame a player. He will appear suspicious to Investigative abilities tonight. (3 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversion Immune.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LORE:<br>
A Sheriff who once solved cases for the Blue Dragon. His wife was hanged for treason, even when there were no procuring evidence against her. In the light of her being wrongly accused, he decided that the Blue Dragon were no longer worthy of his services, seeking revenge against the Blue Dragon. They must suffer in the same way his wife died, he must have his revenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CLARIFICATION: Once 3 Blue Dragons have been executed during the day, this class wins even if he dies the day after. I may tone down the Win-Con to 4 if 3 is too easy.<br>
Any thoughts on this? Was thinking of a neutral offensive. Hopefully this tilts in favour <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
