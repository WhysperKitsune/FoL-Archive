    <title>Suggestion of Neutral class: Impostor</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-of-neutral-class-impostor/18937</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I’m here to share an Idea of a class. It’s named Impostor. In my opinion, it could bring an interesting new gameplay to the table. Basically, all of its Idea revolves on the impossibility of existing more than 2 of each class.

Suggestion of Neutral class: Impostor

Passive: 
Camouflage – Get a random BD class. For all investigative classes, you will appear as that class. There will always be two other players using that class. You will never be camouflaged into a unique class. 

Day ability:
Stolen Notebook (1 use) – Erase your target’s log.

Night ability:
Mimic (2 uses) – Mimic a skill from your camouflaged class at the target.

Win condition: Get one of your targets formally executed.

I mean, I really think this could be fun. Having 3 drunk claims or 3 princesses and having to figure out which one is lying. It would not be an easy ride like most of scorned games are. You’d have to make a solid log and any Observer or even the person you pretended to target could make your whole strategy crumble. You could claim you Debbed 3 n2 and someone say they healed him that night. So in my opinion it could provide an interesting gameplay for the impostor and for all the other players on the table. Maybe he could even have a trollbox in his kit or something like that.</description>

            <p>Or you could just act like scorned and accuse your target as sheriff.</p>
