            <p>I don’t mean just to down it, but I think the premise is unworkable. A BD chill helps the BD in no way, so that can’t work. Unseen version might work with limited uses, but it still might be too powerful.</p>

            <p>Not gonna lie, I saw this and thought “Poor fellow? Vengeful fellow? Is this some kind of twist on the fool and masochist?”<br>

            <p>Even with that, still 2 problems</p>
<p>1: Not fun since it can’t engage in social play<br>
2: Not helpful for BD</p>

            <p>The reason for that ability is to silence people that threaten to vote you up. This also changes the “repeat” meta when someone thinks of a trollbox. This class is mostly strong at gaining information though the night and knowing when to share it.</p>

            <p>This can barely speak. This makes it almost impossible to work with your team as BD, which is not very fun. Show your pain is basically chill, which is too powerful to be used every night, which will be done by the evil variety. Not too powerful for BD, since you are limiting information, which is bad for you.</p>
