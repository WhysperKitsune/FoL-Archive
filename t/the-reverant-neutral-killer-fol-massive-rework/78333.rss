    <description># *&quot;The Unwanted has not yet died yet&quot;*

&gt; # The Reverant [Neutral Killer]
&gt; ## Passives
&gt; **Soul Bound** - Whoever you are currently soulbound with will have a private chat with you. They also only win if you win. You will commit suicide if you fail to use **New Binding** the night after they die. 
&gt; **Death is with Us** - You cannot vote, be voted for or be targetted.
&gt; ## Day Abilities
&gt; **Soul Protection** - Your current soulbound player will be *Death Immune* tonight. (1 use)
&gt; ## Night Abilities
&gt; **Spirit Attack** - Attack target player. If you would be counter-attacked, your soulbound player will be attacked instead, (Inf use)
&gt; **New Binding** - Kill your current soulbound player, bypassing everything. You will be soulbound with your new target. This counts as an *attack*. (1 use)
&gt; ## Goal: Defeat the [spoiler][color=lighblue]Blue Dragon[/color][/spoiler], the [color=darkred]Cult[/color]/[color=purple]Unseen[/color], and any **Neutrals** that stand in your way.

&gt; ## Notes:
&gt; This will not be included because of everyone&#39;s bad memories of Reverant.
&gt; When you leave your old binding, they will still win only if you win.
&gt; At the start, you will be paired with a random non-hunter non-knight convertable Blue Dragon Player.

<p>It still ends up making the Rev itself unreadable. Overall it’s just going to end up forcing the Rev to instantly inhabit any player that can look villagery as scum and it’s basically not going to factor in the Rev’s skill whatsoever.</p>

            <p>Disliked it for two reasons.</p>
<p>A) This would seriously mess up the wincon for the Unseen/Cult if one of their members ended up with the Rev inside them as they would not have enough numbers to safely hunt the Rev inside them.</p>
<p>B) This doesn’t fix the main problem of the Rev still being unreadable. They don’t need to post as long as their host doesn’t fuck up, so this pretty much turns the game into random lynching.</p>
