    <description>You can make your statement during the.. 20? Seconds you have, and have your lefthand side of your logbook visible for everyone. 

It would pop up like the logbook does for the noble but just the left hand side. Maybe even force it, it&#39;s.. Hard to make a obs log that people remotely try to understand if it&#39;s in text in the chat.. 

I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t be the only one who would want this change? Maybe a part of it is for ppl not to read the logs posted and miss out on details.. ?

Edit, logs wouldn&#39;t be forced untill your time is up and everyone can talk. So you do get SOME time to fake them..</description>

            <p>Oh yea, if your copy / paste actually broke the lines aswell it’d be great! Bad thing is we’d have to remove the spam protection we got… But I mean, if someone spams, he spams anyway, the spam protection isn’t really doing it’s job.</p>
<p>I’d fully support this actually instead of having logs presented in a window.</p>

<p>This.  On the stand, copy/paste from logs should format with line breaks, much like the old Marshal ability.</p>

            <p>I fully support any qol changes involving say expanding out how much can be copied and pasted at once etc… The big thing though is that a true log cannot be significantly faster than a fake log to retrieve and paste, and that includes whether you’ve got multiple logs in your main journal or one in your private notes.</p>

            <p>That would be good.  Right now selection and copy-pasting is a bit awkward (also, for some reason ‘end’ takes to the end of the next line sometime?  It’s weird.)</p>
<p>They could also increase the amount of text you can post to chat while you’re on the stand, talking to a psychic, or in jail.  And maybe add a ‘copy all to clipboard’ button to the logbook.</p>

<p>If you can’t swap your left side logs in 20-30 seconds I don’t see how you’re able to maintain 3 logs while still following the game…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>again the key point that I’m making is… if it’s a single button press… no one who’s actually BD and giving an honest log has any excuse for not having it up within 3 seconds of being on trial. Meaning if your log isn’t up in 7 seconds… well that’s proven guilty, who the fuck takes 5 seconds to hit a button.</p>
<p>You aren’t racing the end of the timer to get your logs up, you are racing what is the credible time it would take a real BD member from putting it up. When you make a single 1 second latency button for the BD… evils must also be able to get their claim up in that same one seconds… other wise it’s just blatently obvious.</p>
<p>Currently as is, it still takes the exact same amount of effort as BD or evil to open a log or private notes and copy and paste a log from it, even if you have 2 fake ones in your journal and 2 fake ones in private notes. There’s nothing new gleamed from the time it takes. If it’s a single second for BD, and 5 seconds to chose the right book/log… you create a disproportionate time difference and make it just auto execute if someone takes longer.</p>

            <p>Yeah, single button press. How much time do you have when you’re put up on trial to copy/paste your log in chat? 20 seconds? 30? Post your fake logs in chat, replace them in your actual log. Again, as soon the forum is open and everyone can talk you would have the option to present your left side of the logbook for everyone to view. Not your private notes, not your class card, not your right hand side of the logbook… Your left hand side of the logbook.</p>
<p>I’m suggesting this for it would be easier to read logs and understand them…</p>
<p>If you can’t swap your left side logs in 20-30 seconds I don’t see how you’re able to maintain 3 logs while still following the game…</p>

            <p>If this were added, I’d suggest also giving evils multiple logbooks and letting them pick which one they want to share (granted, maintaining that many could be a pain.)</p>
<p>Of course, we’d have to decide how to make that work with snoop, if it remains (maybe they can change what their “primary” logbook is.)  Only their primary logbook is revealed.</p>
<p>Maybe replace the scratchnote with a line of several logbooks, and let people drag and drop to replace which one is up top to be their “main” one.</p>

<p>The big thing here, is in the current form it takes roughly the exact amount of time to pull a log from private notes and paste it, as it does from the journal and post it. a 5 second delay would be a huge tell.</p>

Noble snooping is strong! Very strong. I always do it N1 just for the fact that someone, as you said, didn’t make a claim up yet or might change it mid-way through the game.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the logs should pop up the moment the last vote hits you, but rather once everyone can discuss the logs at all.</p>

<p>Uhu… You’d “only” have to keep it accurate on the left side tho. You could still if you want to risk it, keep “X is immune” on the right side if you’re… Say the assassin and tried to attack a scorned or something.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I believe the greater focus is on the difficulty in keeping liquid claims. Most classes have one or 2 weaknesses, and good players make multiple logs to compensate for that. You keep your claim liquid until you are put on the spot.</p>
<p>Hence why people like me and orange hate the noble’s snoop, before that ability you’d keep 2 or 3 fake journals going in your private notes, pull the one that’s appropriate for the accusation that just got thrown at you, when you are called out. But now you throw in snoop… well then you absolutely have to have a solid singular claim on n1, as if you are snooped and a noble see’s your blank logs, or multiple logs, he’s going to call it out, if say you are a MM, you had a princess log but were called out as occ immune on n4… you risk getting called out by a noble that may have snooped your logs n1-3, should you switch to the butler logs you had in your private notes.</p>
<p>Your version of change also adds to that. because while noble snoop is still rare enough that you can still keep a seperate claim in your private notes to be ready in a pinch… the time delay difference between just revealing your logs (or them automatically popping up when you hit the stand), means there is no chance to change those logs on the spot to handle the sort of accusation thrown at you.</p>
<p>In short, you are entirely down to “did you happen to guess what kind of investigation was going to hit you first on n1… if you did you are good, if you didn’t, well you lost”. Planning on the fly and adjusting to the situation, is a lost cause.</p>

            <p>I do like the idea.</p>

            <p>You can make your statement during the… 20? Seconds you have, and have your lefthand side of your logbook visible for everyone.</p>
<p>It would pop up like the logbook does for the noble but just the left hand side. Maybe even force it, it’s… Hard to make a obs log that people remotely try to understand if it’s in text in the chat…</p>
<p>I don’t know, I can’t be the only one who would want this change? Maybe a part of it is for ppl not to read the logs posted and miss out on details… ?</p>
<p>Edit, logs wouldn’t be forced untill your time is up and everyone can talk. So you do get SOME time to fake them…</p>
