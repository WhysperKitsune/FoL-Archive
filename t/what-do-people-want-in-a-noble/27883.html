          <p>People seem to like the maid spy version of noble the most. But that isn’t happening and that’s a problem for adding back the Noble. So the question is: What could he be?</p>
<p>A few questions that we know the answers to:</p>
<p>1: What class type is he? Social</p>
<p>2: What passives does he have? Royal blood (possibly another)</p>
<p>From listening to others speak this seems to be what we have so far</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble - Blue Dragon Social<br>
Passive: Royal Blood - Can step up to be king<br>
.<br>
Night ability 1: Private matter - Whispers to and from the noble are hidden the next day (Unlimited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously not enough to work into a class. There is however 1 version of the noble that might be fun in this meta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble - Blue Dragon Social<br>
Passive 1: Royal Blood - Can step up to be king<br>
Passive 2: Noble Twin - Meet with the other Noble at night. You can speak with each other and are both night immune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again not enough for a class but it has potential given a few changes to how it was in beta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble - Blue Dragon Social<br>
Passive 1: Royal Blood - Can step up to be king<br>
Passive 2: Noble Twin - Meet with the other Noble at night. You can speak with each other and are both night immune. You will never lose this passive under any circumstances other than losing night immunity if you become king. You cannot see what the other Noble does.<br>
.<br>
Day ability: Signal - Send a message to the other noble. No one else will be informed. (4 uses)<br>
.<br>
Night ability 1: Royal sway - It take 2 more votes to execute the other noble. If you target self it takes 1 more vote to execute you instead.(Unlimited)<br>
Night ability 2: Shared sources - The other noble can hear whispers to and from you and knows what happens to you tonight. (Unlimited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: If one noble is converted then the other stays BD. The Aristocrat is the same as noble except that the second night ability also lets the unseen hear whispers to and from each other and that the unseen will see the message sent from Signal.</p>
<p>If someone makes a suggestion that is better it will be placed here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble - Blue Dragon Social<br>
Passive: Royal Blood - Can step up to be King.<br>
Passive 2: Noble Twin - Meet with the other Noble at night. You can speak with each other and are both night immune. You will never lose this passive under any circumstances other than losing night immunity if you become king. You cannot see what the other Noble does.<br>
.<br>
Day ability 1: Signal - Send a message to the other noble. No one else will be informed. (4 uses)<br>
Day ability 2: Private Matter - All whispers to and from you will be hidden. (2 uses)<br>
.<br>
Night ability 1: Royal sway - It take 2 more votes to execute the other noble. If you target self it takes 1 more vote to execute you instead.(Unlimited)<br>
Night ability 2: Shared sources - The other noble can hear whispers to and from you and knows what happens to you tonight. (Unlimited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another idea for those who liked the vote manipulation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble - Blue Dragon Social<br>
Passive 1: Royal Blood - Can step up for king<br>
Passive 2: Bureaucracy - See’s all votes in real time<br>
.<br>
Day ability’s are the same but with 3 uses instead of 2<br>
.<br>
Night ability 1: Regroup - Check how many BD there are alive (3 uses)<br>
Night ability 2: Power Play - If less than half of the living players are BD then you gain 2 extra votes for the rest of the game in all votes and you cannot be voted.(1 use. Is consumed even if it fails)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Aristocrat is the same but he has order instead of regroup and doesn’t have Power Play.</p>

          <p>Sheepish here, ready to attempt to revive the Noble once agan! You’d think he’d have money enough to afford a good hospital and not a forum discussion to revive him but yeah, it’s on us!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, he is Social and has Royal Blood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Royal Twins? I honestly don’t like the name. What about Royal Chambers? Both Nobles would physically be there. Also, does that mean that there will always be two Nobles? Because if that’s not the case, half of this new noble’s abilities would be useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signal is ok. But I’d leave Private Matter there instead. The same applies to the Aristocrat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding Royal Sway, why limit it to the Nobles? Nobles can influence anyone. This would also solve the deal of not needing two Nobles every time. Make it a targetable ability. I like it overall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first part of Shared Sources make little sense. There are no whispers at night. Do you mean the next day? I’d also make this a targetable ability. You could target the king or even the prince. Aristocrats would target the unseen. If this was the case, I’d really like the ability!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you like my feedback! See you around!!</p>

          <p>1: Ikr</p>
<p>2: Royal Twins isn’t a name I came up with. They used to be an actual thing in beta and that was what it was called.<br>
And yes there will always be 2 nobles. Its kinda the point.</p>
<p>3: I could add in private matter as a second day ability like what psychic has now. It would definitely fit.</p>
<p>4: Because the point is to play off of your own lies and have a safety net. The idea of the class as written is that you can try crazy strategy’s and have someone to back you up. EX: Have one noble immediately out D2 to get whisper claims. The other noble claims merc on everyone. When people realizes what just happened he outs too. Because of royal sway he effectively has 3 extra pardons. They cross reference the info they got from whispers to get lots of info.</p>
<p>5: If you read it carefully it doesn’t actually work as a targetable ability. As it is right now the Nobles with my idea are difficult to pull off but possible to fake claim. Shared Sources being targetable would make that impossable. Also it auto targets the unseen for aristocrat if you noticed.</p>
<p>Remember the ability makes the other noble hear YOUR whispers.</p>

          <p>Noble with private matter, crier, and maid spy was best. It nerfed evil king (which many people now claim is too powerful), and allowed for a class that could gather information while keeping others from knowing that information was being gathered.</p>
<p>My games as noble usually got me to listen to king, find some allies (either in prince or alchs) and then from there find some more claim. Eventually, I would find prince early with my whisper detection and feed him my information.</p>
<p>I think if devs presented the maid spy being back as trying to nerf evil king, it would be accepted.</p>

          <p>I think a combination of <strong>Noble</strong> having:</p>
<p><strong>Royal Blood</strong> (Passive)<br>
<strong>Private Matters</strong> (Passive) <em>All whispers to and from the Noble/Aristocrat are hidden until Day 4.</em><br>
<strong>Maid Spy [Day]</strong> (3 uses) ~ <em>The Noble now can hear all whispers for that day.</em><br>
<strong>Noble Twin [Day]</strong> (2 uses)<br>
<strong>Order [Night]</strong> (3 uses)<br>
<strong>Inquiry [Night]</strong> (infinite uses) New ability. Deduces the targets social status, returning back one of three possible results: Royal, Vassal, Peasant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Royal</strong> - <em>Prince, Princess, Noble, Drunk</em><br>
<strong>Vassal</strong> - <em>Knight, Paladin, Sheriff, Mastermind, Court Wizard, Observer, Cult Leader, Inquisitor</em><br>
<strong>Peasant</strong> - <em>Butler, Hunter, Psychic, Physician, Alchemist, Mercenary, Apostle, Invoker, Ritualist, Seeker, Fool (Fool can frame themselves to be Royal), Possessor, Reaper, Sorcerer, Scorned</em></p>

<p>…would be a good mix to start with. Give <strong>Aristocrat</strong>:<br>
<strong>Political Pressure [Day]</strong> (2 uses) in place of Maid Spy<br>
<strong>Decree [Night]</strong> (2 uses) in place of Inquiry.</p>
<p>With this setup, Noble is something of an Investigator with guaranteed secrecy for relaying intel to the King early game - with a side of diplomatic power. Aristocrat, on the other hand, tosses out Noble’s investigative powers entirely and becomes even more fierce diplomatically.</p>

</aside>
<p>You just don’t understand how powerfull evil kings are. They are one extra evil player that doesn’t increase their capacity. I Think maid is one of the most powerfull days abilities. I had a game when I’ve found 1 unseen and an evil king with that.</p>
<p>Btw, right now I think evil kings have about 60-75% win rate in none reaper games. (reaper usully kill the king anyway)</p>
