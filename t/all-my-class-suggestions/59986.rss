    <title>All my class suggestions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/all-my-class-suggestions/59986</link>
    <description>Just putting all my class suggestions together in a single post, mainly so I can organize them better.

&lt;big&gt;[color=orange]The Golden Dragon[/color]&lt;/big&gt;

[details=&quot;Golden Dragon&quot;]
I was thinking about having a second &quot;Good&quot; faction, with different classes than the Blue Dragon to help make games more diverse. This class would be an alternative to the Blue Dragon, and games would have either Golden Dragon or Yellow Dragon. Here is a suggestion for the faction called &quot;The Golden Dragon&quot;.
The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:
- The Queen is a more &quot;Social&quot; version of the King.
- The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is &quot;The Bailiff&quot; which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin.
- There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.
- All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.
- Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.
- There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.
- The &quot;Healer&quot; of this faction can only heal poison or bleeding a limited number of times, but he can cure poison and protect someone else from attacks on the same night.

I would appreciate comments or feedback. Some of you may have noticed I reused some of my old class suggestions here. I also took some ideas from stuff others have suggested in the past, such as the Queen&#39;s hidden whispers or The Royal Guard&#39;s Dayvig ability.

&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]Neutrals (Non NK)[/color]&lt;/big&gt;


[details=&quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;]
**The Bounty Hunter**
_Unique Neutral, Offensive_

**Lore:** I&#39;m not good at writing proper lore, but basically the bounty hunter was a knight who accidentally killed an innocent person and lost his job. There was a trial but his actions were forgiven by the King himself. However, many people still hated him for what he did and wanted him dead, so he decided to become a bounty hunter in order to get enough money to leave the castle with his family and start a new life. 

**Victory condition**
Kill your target and collect the bounty.

**Passive Ability 1: Your last job**
You are immune to death at night. You will be given a random target at the beginning of the game. That target&#39;s exact class and faction will be revealed to you. If your target dies on trial or is killed by anyone else you will commit suicide the following night.

&gt;_**Notes**: Your target can be any class from any faction except for the following: the King, the Mastermind, the Inquisitor, the Scorned or a Neutral Killer). A message will appear in chat telling everyone that there is a bounty hunter trying to kill said player, and there will be a small symbol next to their name that everyone can see. (Example: &quot;There is a bounty for John Smith&#39;s [12] head!&quot;)_

**Passive Ability 2: A new life**
One day after you successfully kill your target you will collect your bounty. After you collect your bounty you will win and leave the castle along with your family.

&gt;_**Notes:** Your &quot;family&quot; will be two living players chosen at random (except the king), who will also leave the castle. Leaving the castle will make your name and number disappear, and It works similar to death with the difference that you cannot see or write in dead chat or be revived, and no one will be able to know your previous class or see your logs._
&gt;_Also, you do not immediately win after killing your target, you need to survive one more day before you can win, which means you need to take observers into account before killing your target._

**Day Ability 1: Intimidate**
Select a player. He will be unable to visit your target for the next two nights. You can use this ability on your target to prevent him from using any self-targeting abilities until tomorrow. 3 uses.

&gt;_**Notes:** If used on your target it will prevent any self-targeted abilities, even if they are day abilities and even if your target is occupy immune. Prevents things like &quot;Stoneskin potion&quot;, &quot;Concentrated wine&quot;, &quot;Bear Companion&quot; or &quot;Self Care&quot;._

**Night Ability 1: The Perfect Chance**
Attempt to kill your target. If your target is still alive after using this ability, you will commit suicide the following night. 1 use. 

**Night Ability 2: This is MY job**
Your target will be immune to death tonight and cannot be accused for treason tomorrow. You will also heal any poison or bleeding on them. 3 uses.
[/details]


[details=&quot;The Shaman&quot;]
T&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]The Shaman[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
Unique, Neutral, Offensive.
**Goal: Survive.**
**Meditation (Passive)** - Immune to death and occupation.
**Pact (Passive)** - You will commit suicide on Night 6.
**Soul Link (Day)** - Select two players. If one of them dies tonight, the other will die as well. 3 uses.
**The Evil Eye (Day)** - Can only be used during a trial. If the person on trial is pardoned, they will die tonight. 2 uses.
**Seance (Night)** - Discover if a player is able to kill at night. Unlimited uses. 
**Voodoo Ritual (Night)** - Force a player to target another. Bypasses occupy immunity. 3 uses.
[/details]


[details=&quot;The Cleric&quot;]
&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]The Cleric[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
**Neutral, Support.**
**Goal:** Survive
**Sanctuary (Passive)** - People trying to visit you cannot be occupied or redirected, and their visit will be hidden from investigators. If they are an attacker, their attack will bypass everything except visit prevention.
**Brotherhood (Passive)** - If you would be attacked at night, redirect the attack to one of your visitors except the attacker, bypassing redirection immunity. If only the attacker visits you, you will die.
**Blessing (Day)** - Select a player. If they visit you tonight they will get a blessing that lasts for two days. The blessing makes the player immune to conversion, hides their visits and makes them appear not suspicious to investigators. 2 uses. 
**Curse (Day)** - Select a player. If they don&#39;t visit you tonight they will get a curse that lasts for two days. The curse makes the player unable to talk or accuse anyone of treason. 2 uses.
**Circle of Healing (Night)** - Heal yourself and everyone that visits you tonight. Unlimited uses.

&gt; _Special mechanics and interactions:_
&gt; * _Your sanctuary passive only works on people that TRY to visit you. It will not work on people that are redirected into you by a court wizard or invoker. (Would be weird to make them redirect immune if they were already redirected into you...)_
&gt; * _However, brotherhood passive does work on all visitors, whether they try to visit you or are redirected by someone else._
&gt; * _While Circle of healing heals yourself as well, the Sanctuary passive makes attackers trying to visit you bypass everything including healing. This means you can only heal yourself from poison or bleeding with this ability._
&gt; * _Neither blessing or curse give a notification to the player when you use the ability. This makes cleric somewhat fake claimable (unless someone gets occupied while trying to visit you). This can also be used to convince people to visit you even if you didn&#39;t use any of your day abilities by making them think you did._
[/details]


[details=&quot;The Diseased&quot;]
&gt;**The Diseased**
&gt;Neutral, Offensive
&gt;
&gt; **Passive: Chronic disease**
&gt; At the beginning of each day (starting from day 2) if you are not poisoned or bleeding you will become poisoned/bleeding (depends on the evil faction). You will die in 2 days unless healed.
&gt;
&gt; **Passive 2: Sympathy**
&gt;Immune to death and occupation.
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 1: Insurance**
&gt;Anyone that tries to heal you tonight will be immune to death and occupation. 3 uses.
&gt;
&gt; **Night ability 1: Pity** 
&gt; Select a player. Anyone trying to visit said player will visit you instead, they will not know who they were forced to visit. Goes through redirection immunity. Unlimited uses. 
&gt;_(Anyone redirected by this ability will get a message saying &quot;You were forced to target The Diseased!&quot;)._
&gt;
&gt; **Night ability 2: Expunge**
&gt; Everyone who visits you tonight will die. If at least one person dies this way you will be healed of any poison/bleeding. 3 uses.
&gt;
&gt;**Goal:** Survive.
[/details]


[details=&quot;The Lawyer, The Prosecutor and The Accused&quot;]
Notes:
* Since all three classes always spawn together, there will not be any other neutrals besides the neutral killer in &quot;Accused&quot; games.
* For the same reason as above, Sorcerer will never spawn on &quot;Accused&quot; games, since there won&#39;t be space for the Inquisitor.
* After the Accused has died, neither the Lawyer nor the Prosecutor will be able to use their abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Accused** (Neutral/Offensive)
&gt; **Passive 1: Human Resources**
&gt; Immune to poison, bleeding, death and occupation.
&gt; **Passive 2: Missing record**

&gt; **Day ability 2: Bribe**
&gt; Make someone unable to talk or whisper for the rest of the day as long as they are not on trial. The ability cannot target the King or the prosecutor. 1 use.

&gt; **Goal:** Make sure the accused achieves their goal.

&gt; **Goal:** Make sure the accused is executed on trial or by the Prince.
[/details]



[details=&quot;The Masochist&quot;]
**Class type:** Neutral, social.
**Goal:** Be killed at night. (Being executed by the prince doesn&#39;t count).
**Passive 1**
Immune to death at night and occupation. _(Read his first night ability for context, this avoids the masochist winning by doing nothing, decreasing the chance of him dying from being attacked randomly)_
**Passive 2**
If you are killed at night, your assassin will die of guilt the next day. (Bypasses death immunity and cannot be healed.)
**Day ability 1**
The next message you send will be hidden from everyone except Special and Killing classes. Unlimited uses. _(Lets you claim an important role to bait killing roles into attacking you without fear of the BD thinking you are suspicious, however the prince and hunter can also see this message)._
**Night ability 1**
Lose your night immunity tonight. If someone tries to convert you tonight, you will die instead. 3 uses.
**Night ability 2**
Select a role from the list. You will appear to have that role and faction to everyone who investigates you tonight. 3 uses. _(This helps you hide from BD faction checks, and will also help you if the cult/unseen have a marshal/seeker/etc.)_
[/details]


&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]Neutral Killers[/color]&lt;/big&gt;

&gt;Select two players. Anyone trying to accuse the first player will instead accuse the second one. Can target yourself. 2 uses.

**Note:** If the Count steps up for king he will turn into a Psycho King, since he is technically a Neutral Killer.

            <p>Just putting all my class suggestions together in a single post, mainly so I can organize them better.</p>
<p><big><font color="orange">The Golden Dragon</font></big></p>
<details>
<summary>
Golden Dragon</summary>
<p>I was thinking about having a second “Good” faction, with different classes than the Blue Dragon to help make games more diverse. This class would be an alternative to the Blue Dragon, and games would have either Golden Dragon or Yellow Dragon. Here is a suggestion for the faction called “The Golden Dragon”.<br>
The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen is a more “Social” version of the King.</li>
<li>The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is “The Bailiff” which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin.</li>
<li>There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.</li>
<li>All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.</li>
<li>Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.</li>
<li>There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.</li>
<li>The “Healer” of this faction can only heal poison or bleeding a limited number of times, but he can cure poison and protect someone else from attacks on the same night.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would appreciate comments or feedback. Some of you may have noticed I reused some of my old class suggestions here. I also took some ideas from stuff others have suggested in the past, such as the Queen’s hidden whispers or The Royal Guard’s Dayvig ability.</p>

The Bounty Hunter</summary>
<p><strong>The Bounty Hunter</strong><br>
<em>Unique Neutral, Offensive</em></p>
<p><strong>Lore:</strong> I’m not good at writing proper lore, but basically the bounty hunter was a knight who accidentally killed an innocent person and lost his job. There was a trial but his actions were forgiven by the King himself. However, many people still hated him for what he did and wanted him dead, so he decided to become a bounty hunter in order to get enough money to leave the castle with his family and start a new life.</p>
<p><strong>Victory condition</strong><br>
Kill your target and collect the bounty.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Ability 1: Your last job</strong><br>
You are immune to death at night. You will be given a random target at the beginning of the game. That target’s exact class and faction will be revealed to you. If your target dies on trial or is killed by anyone else you will commit suicide the following night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Your target can be any class from any faction except for the following: the King, the Mastermind, the Inquisitor, the Scorned or a Neutral Killer). A message will appear in chat telling everyone that there is a bounty hunter trying to kill said player, and there will be a small symbol next to their name that everyone can see. (Example: “There is a bounty for John Smith’s [12] head!”)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Passive Ability 2: A new life</strong><br>
One day after you successfully kill your target you will collect your bounty. After you collect your bounty you will win and leave the castle along with your family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> Your “family” will be two living players chosen at random (except the king), who will also leave the castle. Leaving the castle will make your name and number disappear, and It works similar to death with the difference that you cannot see or write in dead chat or be revived, and no one will be able to know your previous class or see your logs.</em><br>
<em>Also, you do not immediately win after killing your target, you need to survive one more day before you can win, which means you need to take observers into account before killing your target.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: Intimidate</strong><br>
Select a player. He will be unable to visit your target for the next two nights. You can use this ability on your target to prevent him from using any self-targeting abilities until tomorrow. 3 uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> If used on your target it will prevent any self-targeted abilities, even if they are day abilities and even if your target is occupy immune. Prevents things like “Stoneskin potion”, “Concentrated wine”, “Bear Companion” or “Self Care”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: The Perfect Chance</strong><br>
Attempt to kill your target. If your target is still alive after using this ability, you will commit suicide the following night. 1 use.</p>

<strong>Circle of Healing (Night)</strong> - Heal yourself and everyone that visits you tonight. Unlimited uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Special mechanics and interactions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Your sanctuary passive only works on people that TRY to visit you. It will not work on people that are redirected into you by a court wizard or invoker. (Would be weird to make them redirect immune if they were already redirected into you…)</em></li>
<li><em>However, brotherhood passive does work on all visitors, whether they try to visit you or are redirected by someone else.</em></li>
<li><em>While Circle of healing heals yourself as well, the Sanctuary passive makes attackers trying to visit you bypass everything including healing. This means you can only heal yourself from poison or bleeding with this ability.</em></li>
<li><em>Neither blessing or curse give a notification to the player when you use the ability. This makes cleric somewhat fake claimable (unless someone gets occupied while trying to visit you). This can also be used to convince people to visit you even if you didn’t use any of your day abilities by making them think you did.</em></li>

Immune to death at night and occupation. <em>(Read his first night ability for context, this avoids the masochist winning by doing nothing, decreasing the chance of him dying from being attacked randomly)</em><br>
<strong>Passive 2</strong><br>
If you are killed at night, your assassin will die of guilt the next day. (Bypasses death immunity and cannot be healed.)<br>
<strong>Day ability 1</strong><br>
The next message you send will be hidden from everyone except Special and Killing classes. Unlimited uses. <em>(Lets you claim an important role to bait killing roles into attacking you without fear of the BD thinking you are suspicious, however the prince and hunter can also see this message).</em><br>
<strong>Night ability 1</strong><br>
Lose your night immunity tonight. If someone tries to convert you tonight, you will die instead. 3 uses.<br>
<strong>Night ability 2</strong><br>
Select a role from the list. You will appear to have that role and faction to everyone who investigates you tonight. 3 uses. <em>(This helps you hide from BD faction checks, and will also help you if the cult/unseen have a marshal/seeker/etc.)</em></p>
