Golden Dragon</summary>
<p>I was thinking about having a second ‚ÄúGood‚Äù faction, with different classes than the Blue Dragon to help make games more diverse. This class would be an alternative to the Blue Dragon, and games would have either Golden Dragon or Yellow Dragon. Here is a suggestion for the faction called ‚ÄúThe Golden Dragon‚Äù.<br>
The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen is a more ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù version of the King.</li>
<li>The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is ‚ÄúThe Bailiff‚Äù which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin.</li>
<li>There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.</li>
<li>All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.</li>
<li>Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.</li>
<li>There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúHealer‚Äù of this faction can only heal poison or bleeding a limited number of times, but he can cure poison and protect someone else from attacks on the same night.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would appreciate comments or feedback. Some of you may have noticed I reused some of my old class suggestions here. I also took some ideas from stuff others have suggested in the past, such as the Queen‚Äôs hidden whispers or The Royal Guard‚Äôs Dayvig ability.</p>

The Bounty Hunter</summary>
<p><strong>The Bounty Hunter</strong><br>
<em>Unique Neutral, Offensive</em></p>
<p><strong>Lore:</strong> I‚Äôm not good at writing proper lore, but basically the bounty hunter was a knight who accidentally killed an innocent person and lost his job. There was a trial but his actions were forgiven by the King himself. However, many people still hated him for what he did and wanted him dead, so he decided to become a bounty hunter in order to get enough money to leave the castle with his family and start a new life.</p>
<p><strong>Victory condition</strong><br>
Kill your target and collect the bounty.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Ability 1: Your last job</strong><br>
You are immune to death at night. You will be given a random target at the beginning of the game. That target‚Äôs exact class and faction will be revealed to you. If your target dies on trial or is killed by anyone else you will commit suicide the following night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes</strong>: Your target can be any class from any faction except for the following: the King, the Mastermind, the Inquisitor, the Scorned or a Neutral Killer). A message will appear in chat telling everyone that there is a bounty hunter trying to kill said player, and there will be a small symbol next to their name that everyone can see. (Example: ‚ÄúThere is a bounty for John Smith‚Äôs [12] head!‚Äù)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Passive Ability 2: A new life</strong><br>
One day after you successfully kill your target you will collect your bounty. After you collect your bounty you will win and leave the castle along with your family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> Your ‚Äúfamily‚Äù will be two living players chosen at random (except the king), who will also leave the castle. Leaving the castle will make your name and number disappear, and It works similar to death with the difference that you cannot see or write in dead chat or be revived, and no one will be able to know your previous class or see your logs.</em><br>
<em>Also, you do not immediately win after killing your target, you need to survive one more day before you can win, which means you need to take observers into account before killing your target.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: Intimidate</strong><br>
Select a player. He will be unable to visit your target for the next two nights. You can use this ability on your target to prevent him from using any self-targeting abilities until tomorrow. 3 uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> If used on your target it will prevent any self-targeted abilities, even if they are day abilities and even if your target is occupy immune. Prevents things like ‚ÄúStoneskin potion‚Äù, ‚ÄúConcentrated wine‚Äù, ‚ÄúBear Companion‚Äù or ‚ÄúSelf Care‚Äù.</em></p>

<p><strong>Night Ability 1: The Perfect Chance</strong><br>
Attempt to kill your target. If your target is still alive after using this ability, you will commit suicide the following night. 1 use.</p>

<strong>Blessing (Day)</strong> - Select a player. If they visit you tonight they will get a blessing that lasts for two days. The blessing makes the player immune to conversion, hides their visits and makes them appear not suspicious to investigators. 2 uses.<br>
<strong>Curse (Day)</strong> - Select a player. If they don‚Äôt visit you tonight they will get a curse that lasts for two days. The curse makes the player unable to talk or accuse anyone of treason. 2 uses.<br>
<strong>Circle of Healing (Night)</strong> - Heal yourself and everyone that visits you tonight. Unlimited uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Special mechanics and interactions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Your sanctuary passive only works on people that TRY to visit you. It will not work on people that are redirected into you by a court wizard or invoker. (Would be weird to make them redirect immune if they were already redirected into you‚Ä¶)</em></li>
<li><em>However, brotherhood passive does work on all visitors, whether they try to visit you or are redirected by someone else.</em></li>
<li><em>While Circle of healing heals yourself as well, the Sanctuary passive makes attackers trying to visit you bypass everything including healing. This means you can only heal yourself from poison or bleeding with this ability.</em></li>
<li><em>Neither blessing or curse give a notification to the player when you use the ability. This makes cleric somewhat fake claimable (unless someone gets occupied while trying to visit you). This can also be used to convince people to visit you even if you didn‚Äôt use any of your day abilities by making them think you did.</em></li>

          <p>I decided to listen to you guys and I‚Äôm going to make a SFoL with some of these classes. It has a small twist however, and all classes will be able to evolve like the reptilians.<br>
Its SFoL 33 so it will be a while before I host it, but Im going to need some help balancing it.</p>
