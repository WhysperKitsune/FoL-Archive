    <title>Multiple Bugs (Music, Animation, Death Messages)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/multiple-bugs-music-animation-death-messages/24749</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
1 - When all players load in at the round table, no Music plays. Instead, the music plays over the night music the following night (N1). This has happened many times to me while I&#39;ve played the game.
2. The bug which shows the same player died multiple times.
3. A player was executed but the animation was stuck. The screenshot is took after their class was revealed after death.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Pretty obvious.

#### Steps to reproduce:
They were random bugs while I was playing multiple games.

#### Comments:
Cannot screenshot bug #1 obviously

I did exit &amp; verify the game files, which turned up nothing.</description>
