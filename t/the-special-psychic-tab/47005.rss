    <title>The Special Psychic Tab</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-special-psychic-tab/47005</link>
    <description>It can sometimes being annoying to switch between the normal and the Psychic tab. Of course, if you&#39;re jailed, the Prince, or Unseen/Cult, it is crucial so it can work.

But for everyone else, it would make it much easier if the main tab became the Psychic tab (including for the Psychic), to avoid any unneeded switching.

It would be mechanically the same, but it would be a nice Quality of Life thing.</description>

            <p>Then you add in the new meta where if someone doesn’t answer you in 5 seconds, and they aren’t jailed, they be cult/unseen. If something is quick and in your face when you are good, but takes much longer to get to when you are evil, those delays are crazy powerful tests.</p>

            <p>I’m actually thinking the Psychic tab is actually Underutilized. For example it should work like that for the dead too. Yes even if they bring back Priest because evils might not want to inform DK’s of stuff.</p>

            <p>It would still be needed for Prince, Jailed, and Unseen/Cult. This would just be for everyone else.</p>

            <p>The QoL feature was actually making it it’s own tab, not just for the prince, but because it used to be the common flub up/dirty trick for the psychic to link people about 10 seconds in link the MM just before he says “Kill 9” or whatever.</p>
