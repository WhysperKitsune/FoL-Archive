    <description>It&#39;s so anoying when you don&#39;t even know if u were occupied **or** prevented,
I just had a game when i got prevented 5 times, 
I had zero info, and coudn&#39;t even know what and how it happened.


You wanted to change cw, to give him more feedback, so why make every other class more boring with this  merge?
Please revert this change</description>

            <p>The second one. Because there are more reasons for your occupation than just “got occupied”. Heck that day three prevention could be you getting occupied too so you don’t need to specify prince jail.</p>
<p>The first one gives me a lot simpler condition of “okay was a butler actually occupying you” or if I even have a living butler claim. If I have no confirmation of your occupation, that automatically puts you in a worse light.</p>

            <p>But combining them makes it harder and allows more claim space. You say “prevented” and because you don’t know, there are multiple options and you don’t have to just say occupied.</p>
<p>You’re also right that information can still be gathered together, but it’s more difficult now. Take into account sellsword, butlers, drunks, Prince jail, merc.</p>

            <p>Believe me, its much easier to write logs as evils when you can mixed between prevented, occupation, and info you have, this way your logs doesn’t looks like only prevented targets.</p>

            <p>It makes it slightly more frustrating for bd while evils now have more claim space. It became very common that evils would claim physician, and say they were occupied and couldn’t heal. This often didn’t work as butlers would reveal themselves and say they didn’t.</p>
<p>This gives more space for “doing nothing” one night, as there are more variations on prevention.</p>
