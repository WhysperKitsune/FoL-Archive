            <p><strong>Town has won</strong> (Apart from Pug because there slot was mod killed).<br>
Congrats to Orange, Shurian, Firekitten, Boss, Memesky, Celeste(Margret), Techwolves, Simon, eevee.</p>
<p><strong>Losers (Good try)</strong><br>
(Mafia) Max, Marluxion, Htm, Joker<br>
Sam the Snitch and Light the Survivor</p>
<p>I just want to say thankyou to everyone who played, I get this game was very bumpy and I should have been more active at the time I was going through a lot of real life problems also exams, so sorry for me being bad at hosting and thanks for being patient with me, next time (If I do host) I’ll make sure it’s at a time where I can host and be active thank you to <a class="mention" href="/u/Hippolytus">@Hippolytus</a> for co hosting I’m very grateful for all there help they have given.</p>
<p>Good try Mafia you guys had some really bad luck with Max being shot, making it so Marl couldn’t claim that the escort was framed I felt like town got some real good luck, but good try</p>
<p>I do feel like people should have been more active but I know there are sometimes a lot of problems that can happen IRL.</p>
<p>Thank you I had a great time hosting sorry that it was very bumpy, I’ve learnt a lot from hosting, I feel bad because I should have gave out more information also the role cards where formatted poorly.</p>
