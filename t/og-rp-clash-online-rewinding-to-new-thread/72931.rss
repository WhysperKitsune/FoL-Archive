    <description>## Clash Online&#39;s Youtube Channel is currently streaming live.

_You see a young woman in her 20s, waving at you from the video._

&quot;Heya! I&#39;m Liz Einzbern, &quot;Shurian&quot; here as we are about to launch our game, you can see our team being very excited for the launch of the game, oy! C&#39;mon C&#39;mon make sure everything is ready! Man, it&#39;s exhilarating I tell you! Years of hard work poured in here, come on guys, look here!&quot; _She turns the camera to the many people in a huge office, with several code screens on the computers._

&quot;Yeah man, we&#39;re very excited about this, it&#39;s time to show what we have after 7 years.&quot; _A bespectacled man said, putting his slipping glasses back snugly onto his nose._
&quot;JESUS CHRIST ITS GOING LIVE, WOOO!&quot; _Another employee shouted, and was followed by other shouts of excitement._

_The camera returns to Liz, who makes a brilliant smile._
&quot;Yeah, they&#39;re a bunch&#39;o madmen, but even I can&#39;t hide my excitement, I&#39;m so pumped! In another 11 minutes, we will launch and start-up the servers for public access. Umu, we&#39;re taking VR to a whole new level!&quot; 

_A small little 10 minutes counter appears in the video._
&quot;In the meantime, let us replay what we&#39;ve gone through. We hope you enjoy this little montage.&quot; 

_The video shows the original concept art, along with early impressions during the first year, with blocks for places and scenarios. They also show the conception team going through the VR personally to ensure their consciousness isn&#39;t transferred over machines._

_Year 2, the collaboration with various Ministries of Health around the world started. Doctors came by to give suggestions and psychologists often performed experiments on the game. The 3D Concept of VR was made possible with the contributions of various doctors around the world._ 

_Year 3, the first person in the team to move around in the VR world successfully was... Umu, me! Look at that young me, a teenager haha! And that was our major breakthrough to creating AI that freely moved around in the world! It wasn&#39;t easy, at first, the AI looked like robots and gave robotic, monotonous answers. &quot;Who are you?&quot; We asked it, it said &quot;I am (name)&quot;. It wasn&#39;t easy to give each and every NPC a humane complexion, with believable personalities and speech mannerism._

_Year 4, Our dear beloved poster girl, Jack! Was born, our very first successful NPC! Well, I won&#39;t post her personality in here, but she&#39;s part of our everything we put in, and boy does she look good. People complained about her small stature, but she is indeed old enough to retort snarkly at anyone! We call her Snarky. Haha! The scenarios we all know now grew from this point onwards, See those buildings? Those buildings are modelled after our imagined city, Camelot! Medieval and cool, huh?_ 

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460723811080208385/498756636463071232/Black.png
&lt;small&gt;Look at Jack! Her portrait done by one of our artists with great care and love! Role: Assassin&lt;/small&gt;

_Year 5, We had our artists take a trip to natural lands, free from spoils of mankind to picture the ruins. We have made a pretty broken wasteland... and more. Umu, you will be surprised._

_The starter forest shows up on the screen, showing the realism of it, in Year 6. You can see our whole team being immersed in this land, grabbing the leaves as if they were real! Regeneration of the map was difficult to do, as to prevent repeated picking of the stuff by the same people. What was this? The alpha testing phase known to only internal staff at VR Studios!_

_Then came the beta testing phase, we had many changes here, it was frantic. People came in and started breaking things here and there, we had our minds full, literally! Squashing a bug in VR was ten times more harder than a regular game, and I&#39;m glad we managed to squash all the ones we could find! Thank you beta testers!_

_And we&#39;re here now, our seventh year. This is our time to shine! All the things have been weedled out! We&#39;ll get to the best part!_

_2 Minutes remain._

&quot;Get ready your headsets, we hope to see you in the world of Clash Online, HEY, IS EVERYTHING READY TO BE SWITCHED? Yeah? Good!&quot;</description>
