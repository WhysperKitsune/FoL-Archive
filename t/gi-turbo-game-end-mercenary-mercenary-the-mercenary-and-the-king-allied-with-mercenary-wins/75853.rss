    <description># G! Turbo! - Wazza Edition

### Due to not enough classes yet. The thread for GI turbo is not yet being used. [Grand Idea FoL - Turbo Edition ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/grand-idea-fol-turbo-edition/75468/11).

# Average Rules.

* Game starts at [date=2019-03-16 time=21:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;]
* Days are 15 minutes. Twilight is 2 minutes. Nights are 5 minutes, unless I’m a failure and extend it.
* Early day actions will be processed during the day, late day actions will be processed during Twilight, due to me being a failure once more.
* There can be more than one King, but only a King election will take place once there are no Kings remaining.
* I’m on PC, so don’t have mercy, feel free to make me want to die.
* The amount of players are infinite but there must be at least 7 players.

1. GamerPoke
2. Meteoro 
4. Margaret
5. Priestess
6. Isaac
8. Mercenary
9. Hjasik
10. Luna

# There is no line for classes until the game begins.

Classes will be watered down if they are not able to be used in Turbo, if classes can not work in turbo situations like this, they will be re-rolled.</description>

            <p>A young man asked, "Grandpa, how did you live before?</p>
<ul>
<li>Without technology</li>
<li>No airplanes</li>
<li>Without Internet</li>
<li>Without computers</li>
<li>No Plasma or Led TVs</li>
<li>No air conditioners</li>
<li>Without cars</li>
<li>No cell phones, tablets, notebook and laptop"</li>
</ul>
<p>Grandpa replied:</p>
<p>“As your generation lives today:<br>
Without prayer,<br>
Without compassion,<br>
Without honor,<br>
Without respect,<br>
Shameless,<br>
Without effort,<br>
Without responsibilities,<br>
Without modesty”</p>
<p>We, the people born in the last century, are blessed.</p>
<p>Our life is living proof.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> While we play and ride a bike, we never wear helmets.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> After school, we played until dusk in the neighborhood without fear.<br>
We play with real friends, not with friends on the internet.<br>
If we were thirsty, we drank water from the hose, not bottled.<br>
There was no danger of sharing the same glass of juice with four friends.<br>
We do not gain weight by eating fast food.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> There was also nothing wrong with walking barefoot.<br>
We never use a supplement to stay healthy.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> We used to create our own toys and play with them.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> Our parents were not rich. They gave love, not material things.<br>
We do not own phones, cell phones, DVDs, Play Station, Xbox, video games, personal computers, internet, WhatsApp, we had real friends.<br>
<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> We visited the home of our friends without being invited and enjoyed the meal with them.<br>

<img src="/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> We are a unique and more understanding generation because we are the last generation to have heard their parents, grandparents and uncles. We also respect parents, teachers, older people, and even the church priest.</p>
<p>We are a LIMITED edition! We are less every day. Enjoy while you can.<br>
Learn with us.<br>
And keep in mind that, it took us a lot of work to build this country that is being destroyed today!</p>

            <p>Hi, Eliane, how are you? How are you? Good thing you see it! Because it is a pure reality, I have a northeaster who is purple and some known vagabonds who are also, but until then … do not know anything else, ask an argument do not know anything, just know that “gave” things , are so ignorant that they think that they fall from the çèu, and if you try to explain they do not understand and sulk easily, but they are all employed by those who have something, they are never the bosses, so you see. Socialism or naked communism never worked and would not work because it takes away from those who work and saves to treat vagabonds see on a world scale and it is only not to be hypocritical! Where this policy has misery, and where people are more civilized, they overthrow the system, in China there are still cracks, but the powerful country and the people live poor eating insects, and here at all costs have masquerading as a devious system. two decades have gone into the misery to take care of everything, but it is well-documented that the opposition has its share of blame for this is the dispute, there are even people who seem understood or more intelligent than those who support the genocidal system! But seeing is so well known but it has nothing, the maximum a small house and an old car, sd for new devd benefits, are generally teachers, and dependent on the governmental system, the rest are the northeastern burraiada in weight with the southern leach. Worldly systems are flawed but socialism communism and worst, I tried to expose what we understand, in a simple language that everyone understands, and by the examples we see what works and what does not work and not by theories.</p>
