My initial thoughts are: sweeeeet.

Very happy they made the Inquisitor basically unconfirmable so he cannot claim to BD and expect to survive the entire game. The Inquisitor can almost be a 2nd Neutral Killer in the game by himself.

I&#39;ve always wondered where that splash art of the Sorcerer was going to go. Now we know.

So we have an investigative Executioner and a neutral killer who can win with Unseen or Cult. 

Verrry excited to see these in action :smiley:</description>

            <p>Sorcerer seems like it would be fairly hard to pull off, but it’s such a powerhouse it might not matter.</p>
<p>Since Inquisitor is out there and can one shot you without you even knowing he’s on to you, it probably balances out the power level though.</p>
<p>Biggest issue for BD will be executing Inquisitors I would think.  They have basically no way to prove who they are other than murdering a CW/Psychic and it’s not like the Sorc is going to call out that an Inquisitor exists or anything.</p>

            <p>Well in cult game the sorcerer will hide In amongst a see of cultest .<br>
lots of false positives for the inquisitor to wade through</p>
<p>In unseen game the inquisitor will get a lot more negative results . But those it gets are more likely to be blue dragon classes .</p>
<p>With an unseen game you are more likely to pull the trigger yourself I would think . With cult you would probably try and get the lynch train going.</p>
<p>Also cult are far more likely to have an eradicate and empower . Than say an Assasin and frenzy</p>

            <p>I’m not a fan of neutral killers in general since they create too much luck, but this one feels really interesting. And since its cult/unseen sided, it arguably seems less luck based. I like this idea.</p>

            <p>Without trying to balance it. Balance is fragile. I think there is a serious risk here, that we might have less balanced games for a while.<br>
Reason:<br>
The Sorcerer isn’t in every game.<br>
The Sorcerer doesnt know who is Cult and is more likely to kill them(because there could be more!) while any Magic User result will be met with Inquisitor KILLS, bad for Cult.</p>

            <p>Heres my problem with this.The inquisitor is harder in cult games as there is all the cult members and the paladin are magic users.That means its easier for the sorcerer to hide in cult games and SO much harder in unseen games.Seriously the only other magic users you will ever find in unseen games are the CW,Sage,Psychic,and illusionist.(Which may not be there.)</p>
