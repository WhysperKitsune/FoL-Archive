    <description>Right now here are sorcerer&#39;s problem.1-No one has any incentive to let you live except evils in some very fringe scenarios.2-You can only fool the inquisitor 3 times and how unlikely is the scenario where magic dust actually works.3-You don&#39;t know who evil is so you may kill them.
Now here is the solution-Make magic dust have infinite uses.I don&#39;t think this would be too OP honestly because if you magic dust someone inquis still might kill them.Also make it so sorcerer meets up with the evils just like they are evil so they don&#39;t kill their own allies.(This one isn&#39;t necessary as it may make unseen too powerful as they get 2 kills every night)Also could we please make the kills as sorcerer non visiting.This mean they wont be killed by knights,seen by observers,killed by hunter,or outed by wisping princess.(This may be too strong)(Just implement one of these changes.)Also make COD kill the initial target as well as visiting plz.</description>

            <p>If I was Sorcerer and I could see the evil faction, I would out one every few days when I know the day before they convert and misdirect the people who trust me. I would out them to prove myself as the hard counter of that team. I would also slowly be killing each and every Blue Dragon when they think I’m a good girl. Easy game. Unseen would figure out that Im Sorcerer because they cant convert/kill. In the possible scenario that two hard counters(Sheriff/Paladin) die, I would claim that they were Herbalist’d. I would have to get someone to kill the Inquisitor by that time as by then, I would be semi-outted.</p>

            <p>I have seen sorcerer win only when inquisitor is found very early and then attacked again.</p>
<p>The problem is not the inquisitor’strength, it is that sorcerer can also die by other means, such as observer and king. The answer is not to make inquisitor worse, but rather to make the other means of finding NK not work.</p>

            <p>Still haven’t gotten to play a game with new classes, but from hearing others, I wonder if a partial solution may be to let the sorc SEE the evil team, but not let them see him, and don’t let them meet at night.  No sorc won’t accidentally target allies, but it’s up to them if they want to risk whispers to evil. It also adds a layer of uncertainty to evil side, not knowing if it’s actually sorc or just someone fishing.</p>

            <p>Actually, Sorcerer is less likely to be pursued to death by evil factions, as they can win with it.</p>

            <p>Right now here are sorcerer’s problem.1-No one has any incentive to let you live except evils in some very fringe scenarios.2-You can only fool the inquisitor 3 times and how unlikely is the scenario where magic dust actually works.3-You don’t know who evil is so you may kill them.<br>
Now here is the solution-Make magic dust have infinite uses.I don’t think this would be too OP honestly because if you magic dust someone inquis still might kill them.Also make it so sorcerer meets up with the evils just like they are evil so they don’t kill their own allies.(This one isn’t necessary as it may make unseen too powerful as they get 2 kills every night)Also could we please make the kills as sorcerer non visiting.This mean they wont be killed by knights,seen by observers,killed by hunter,or outed by wisping princess.(This may be too strong)(Just implement one of these changes.)Also make COD kill the initial target as well as visiting plz.</p>
