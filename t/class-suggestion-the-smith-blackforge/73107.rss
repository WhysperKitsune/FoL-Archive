<p>When you are alive, your Assassin attack will be unhealable. You keep this passive even if your class changed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Enforce is a 2 time use night ability. Wall of fire is a 2 time use night ability.</p>
<p>In comparison, this ability despite having reduced effectiveness in killing power, makes the assassin (including yourself) into a reaper permanently.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s just busted. Given that Blackforge can do several other things per night, something has to be removed on it (maybe no keeping it when class changing)</p>

            <p>Ok, hereâ€™s my proposition for a day ability to replace flame smoke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don Armor (Day)</strong> - You will be night immune tonight. <em>(Single Use)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or alternatively,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I have no idea what to name this (Day)</strong> - You will receive feedback for if your occupation was successful or not tonight. <em>(Single Use)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Day abilities that are almost solely used to confirm people (noble twin) are inherently bad design as mechanical confirmation should be limited.</p>
