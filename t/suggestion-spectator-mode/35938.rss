    <title>[Suggestion] Spectator Mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-spectator-mode/35938</link>
    <description>Hi peeps,

with the upcoming tournament i got reminded that a spectator mode would be pretty awesome.

But of course restrictions would be needed:

* Spectators can see everyone&#39;s class &amp; faction in the player list as well as their logs.

* Spectators can only present during a custom lobby, not in public games.

* Limited to 2 Spectators a game, Spectators can&#39;t join randomly, they have to be invited to be a spectator by the Lobby-Host.

This would make streaming &amp; commentating as well as watching a tournament alot more fun in the future.</description>

            <p>Less Spectators means less possible sniping. 2 should be enough for Caster &amp; Co-Caster of Tournaments or streams.</p>

            <p>Spectator is fine on custom lobbies I think. Everyone knows each other there, so cheating is something the lobby can socially handle.</p>
<p>I don’t see the need to limit it to 2 spectators  though. What’s the reasoning?</p>

            <p>I would love a spectaror mode too not for just tournament but in general. Needless to say the spectators ofc wouldnt be able to talk or interact in any way just like watching a stream but instead, watching a friend playing when u want to eat or u dont feel like playing yourself etc etc like in hs!</p>

            <p>It would make cheating easier imo, I’d put it so they just watch as a dead person. Otherwise it could be exploited.</p>
