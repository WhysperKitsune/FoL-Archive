    <description>This will probably not even get to the place I want to, but I will state what will happen here

## This is an active discussion, meaning all opinions are respected

### The purpose of this is to get other&#39;s opinions on the state of casual vs the state of competitive Tol

## All posts will be read by me and important posts whether posts I agree or disagree with will be posted on the front of this post. 

### I will start with my opinions but later on, I will remove them.

# Casual/Classic

Brakuren: &quot;The state of casual is horrid. Casual is supposed to be fun for all players but has led to me and many others not having fun in it. I am not talking about the meta but am instead talking about how the number of players who have played the game for a while are not playing the game because it lacks excitement (E.I Me)

# Competitive

Competitive (ToL esports) is a joke. Going off a point system is making it so that luck comes first and points come second.</description>

            <p>Ranked is hard to do well in a Mafia game.</p>
<p>The only reason I would remotely consider as good is a way to avoid playing with new players, as it can be infuriating to play with as they may not have understanding of the game.</p>
<p>But even with that, these players do need to learn to acheive that understanding, and more experienced players can help with that.</p>
<p>Overall I see it as bringing very little reward.</p>

            <p>I don’t have a opinion on that. That was the reason I created this thread is because I don’t know why exactly I dislike the current state of ToL. It is not the Meta because I was like this before the prince meta</p>

            <p>Oooo, I’ll take the bait.<br>
Unranked right now is the entire game, if you boot up ToL your option is unranked.<br>
If the game is becoming stale for you, there is a chance that’s got nothing to do with the players you’re playing against and more it’s just stale.<br>
Could you elaborate why you’re not a fan of the current modes, and what <em>you think</em> should change?</p>
