          <p>I strongly dislike these proposed changes.  As you know I love Snoop and vote manipulation, and definitely don’t want to lose these.  I prefer the current Psychic and Illusionist (although Mental Blur needs to be replaced because it’s worse than useless, maybe make it inform the target that they are unable to know the results of their abilities that night and in fact get no feedback at all except that they were the target of Mental Blur).</p>
<p>Lure seems interesting, I’m all for giving day abilities to people who don’t have them although I question how useful it would be.  The risk of outing the Poacher seems to outweigh any possible benefits.</p>
<p>I also rather Merc remain as is.</p>

          <p>I personally think for noble/aristocrat either give it a passive of private matter or not give it all, also I’m kind of confused with the second ability</p>
<p>Psychic not being able to talk to the dead is awful, also how is prince gonna claim to psychic? If he does then he will claim it to some random people which is not good</p>
<p>I’m not against the hunter changes as long as he get isolation and the ability to kill who ever accused him I’m good</p>
<p>I disagree with the merc changes a lot, it makes sense for them being able to convert it and if it is convert immune that would just make unseen and cult games harder which i don’t like, and not being able to confirm a merc is like an auto kill, I’m not sure this should be in the game tbh</p>

<p>We really don’t need noble twin. Political pressure is just better. Noble twin is only ever really used for proving and rarely overturns a trial. Political can flip majority (making the noble count for 2 votes) and can also be used for framing and the like by evils. Replacing Noble twins with Private Matters is not a problem. Especially when you are specifically trying to make a class more focused (and you should never have a class who’s focus is pure vote manipulation).</p>
