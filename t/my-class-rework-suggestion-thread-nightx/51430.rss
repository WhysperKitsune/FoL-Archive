            <p>Like I said people are going to be attached to snoop not as much as private note, also I like both</p>
<p>How in the world would people use paper? How are you going to copy and paste? Also people getting a notepad app just because they don’t want people to see their logs is pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>Also before private notes were added I’m pretty sure at least 80% of people weren’t doing that</p>

<p>Honestly I would make it reveal all of the whispers that player sent and then make it 2-3 uses.</p>
<p>Basically what I had posted in my 4 social classes thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>Can’t be done. Private notes are not just that one in-game place where you can write things, but rather a place where the mechanics won’t interact with what you write. If it doesn’t exist in game then all you have done is made it inconvenient to use. However you need to remember that Private Notes is just the in game equivalent of pen and paper in the real world. If you remove it then they can just actualy use pen and paper or use a notepad app instead.</p>
<p>Since you can’t remove notepad you cannot remove private notes.</p>

            <p>Well they are the same classes but slightly different, to spruce things up a bit!</p>
<p>Ranked mode would just have more experienced players so it wouldn’t really be that much different.</p>
<p>Plus it would make all the snoop supporters happy and all the replace snoop supporters happy</p>
<p>Also you could make classes slightly simpler in casual mode because newer players would be playing it</p>

            <p>We shouldn’t have different mechanics for the same classes in different gamemodes.</p>
<p>Because then they aren’t the same class.</p>

            <p>That may be the case, by the way this conversation has gave me an idea!</p>
<p>I heard there will be like a ranked mode and casual mode</p>
<p>Maybe some classes can be slightly different depending on the mode</p>
<p>Casual: Noble has the ability to snoop<br>
Ranked: Noble has a different ability</p>

            <p>Good BD check logs.</p>
<p>May some of the people you played with are new, but most experienced players do check logs, since they are a crucial source of information.</p>

            <p>like i said before you’re probably going to be already giving them you’re info, also BD barely check logs anyway, at least all the ones i played with seriously though</p>
<p>One time i was phys and i noticed in sheriff’s logs it said 8 is unseen i told the BD and they killed me because they apparently thought i was scorned</p>

            <p>If I had to choose to remove private notes or snoop, I’d choose to remove private notes ,  imo old things are better to stay because people get attached to it, also again why would you not want the players to see you’re logs when you’re dead? You’re probably going to eventually copy  it to the prince, psychic, king, and/or all the players in game</p>
