    <title>[Suggestion] The new Allies! For king</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-the-new-allies-for-king/34491</link>
    <description>Hi! Here is my Allies rework for king, hope you like it!

Allies! Night ability for king, **infinite/4 uses (needs to be checked)**, all kings has this ability

Scout 2 players, if they are of the same faction, you got no information. If they are from different factions, you get the confirmed faction of 1 of them, you dont know which one is it.

Not that much to say, this can fix the SuperSherrifPally King meta.

Have a nice day!</description>
