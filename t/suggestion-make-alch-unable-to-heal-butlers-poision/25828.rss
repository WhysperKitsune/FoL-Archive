    <title>Suggestion: make alch unable to heal butler&#39;s poision</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-make-alch-unable-to-heal-butlers-poision/25828</link>
    <description>Right now, BD have no way to kill an evil king.
Executing him after day 4 is way too late, because those are the days you have to start finding the MM. prince, knights, hunter can&#39;t kill him, and butler poision can&#39;t do anything because alchs always loyal to the king.

I suggest that only physician will be able to heal the king from butler poision.

I think its important because right now evil kings win like 70-80% of the games IMO,
And they lose only if they get reaped early or play extremly bad.</description>

            <p>going to be honest now I agree with OP but not for their reasons. Butler is very useless because if they poison before all alchs and phys are dead, the poison is wasted (a phys will still heal an obvious evil king because some are dense - I was once phys and healed three bleeding people back when only hunter caused bleed and they all turned out to be cult), and butler has a two use survival ability (party) which is terrible (poss, sorc, etc. go through) while alch has a 4 use one that is better. Very frustrating to have your coolest ability have no effect.</p>

            <p>Because that confirms the King’s alignment which is not supposed to happen. It is meant to be a mystery which you can only solve through scum-reading. This is why noone can invest him.</p>

            <p>i never understood why the butler poison can’t be like knights or princes ability. if king is good then the butler immediately dies instead of waiting for king to die from poison. the king just doesnt get poisoned.</p>

            <p>Absolutely not; this is a completely awful suggestion.  Alchemists are vital because they provide a neutral that the king has a reason to want to keep alive; taking away their ability to heal kings would make them even more execute-on-sight, and encouraging an execute-on-sight mentality defeats the entire purpose of having non-evil neutral roles like that.  Giving a neutral or evil king in particular a reason to keep Alchemists alive is good for the game, and making it have a big impact on how things go adds strategic depth.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the BD should generally lynch the king if he’s evil.  If they’ve reached the late game (and therefore don’t have enough of a majority to do it), <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> the Alchemist is still alive, <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> they’re depending on the Butler to save them…  well, they’ve screwed up and deserve to lose.  BDs need to pressure unhelpful kings more aggressively.</p>
<p>I get that you’re pissed about the high impact that evil kings have, but butler poison isn’t a solution, and nerfing Alchemists isn’t going to help.  If you feel the king is too powerful, <span class="bbcode-i">nerf the king</span>, don’t make the interactions surrounding him more simplistic and boring.  Alchemists being able to heal kings is interesting and adds depth to the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Think</span> before you suggest things.  Think about all the various ways mechanics are interconnected and how they will influence each other if changed.  Don’t just randomly hammer unrelated stuff in order to hurt or help one role in particular.  If you think evil kings are overpowered, the answer is obviously to tweak the specific powers that make kings so powerful (like Allies), not to break a major aspect of alchemists.</p>
<p>(I’m also very much not convinced that evil kings are powerful at all.  Obviously an evil king helps evils, but in practice the impact is blunted by the fact that they don’t know the king is on their side, while the king doesn’t know his allies.  In my experience, evil kings often end up ineffectual rather than carrying the game - they have a big impact, but it’s mostly by denying the BD the absolutely massive benefits of an active and aggressive BD king, not by doing anything particularly important themselves.  Or, in other words, the issue isn’t that evil kings are overpowered, it’s that <span class="bbcode-i">BD kings</span> are overpowered and that losing this advantage therefore hurts the BD a lot.  Whether the king gets poisoned or not makes no difference - you’re focusing on the wrong thing.)</p>

<li>Well a physician can still heal him.</li>
<li>I’m not talking about finding evil, im talking about acting good:<br>
a) ask for leads/random stuff in wishpers (so important class won’t get killed)<br>
b) Compare logs and look for false claims.</li>

<p>By your logic. Evil kings shoudn’t be executed/killed unlsess they force exe the prince. By the time they force exe the prince BD already lost.</p>

            <p>The stupidity with this is that king is considered evil by d4 because he hasnt found evil and butler poisons him or he gets executed. That is dumb logic. Statistically do you know how hard itnisnfir a king to find evil out of 15 people the first 3 nights??? Alch needs to heal king for that exact reason.</p>

            <p>nightshade is a secondary ability. It does not need a buff, it shouldn’t be easy to assassinate king</p>

            <p>Well, I don’t think the reason of this is butler’s poision. maybe assasian’s nightshade or just random attacks (they increased the number of healers in this patch)</p>

            <p>King can prove himself by finding evil people, If it was a game that every character can prove herself then the game wont be played.<br>
I gave psychic just for example.</p>
<p>Btw, alchemist coudn’t cure nightshade poision in the past. They are now able to because the devs wanted to make them valuable to BD.<br>
In the same patch, assasian nightshade increased to 4 from 1, cult leader’s bleeding increased to 4.<br>
Butler’s poision stayed the same.</p>
<p>My point is that alchemist got this buff to heal assasian’s nightshade and not to heal the butler’s.<br>
And also, the king could handle without alchs nightshade heal in the past, so he I don’t see any reason that it will be different in the future.</p>

            <p>Well if the king is good, a physician can heal him.</p>
<p>Also, I dont see your point.<br>
You can say at the same breath that prince might be stupid and kill a psychic, so lets remove prince’s exe.</p>
