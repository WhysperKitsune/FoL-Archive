    <description>
I see a lot of folk getting real angry with  king from about turn 2 if he hasn&#39;t got a solid lead yet ...


In a typical game the chances of the King getting an unseen turn 1 is between 1 in 14 and 1 in 7 depending on if there is a t1 conversion

turn 2 , assuming perhaps 1 kill again you are looking between 1 in 12 and 1 in 6 . 

turn 3 , assuming perhaps 2 furtehr kills you are now looking at 1 in 10 and 1 in 4/5 . 

turn 4 , with a total of 5 players dead and the mastermind now discoverable you are looking at about 3 in 8 maybe

turn 5 , under the normal rule of use all your abilities as fast as possible you are now out of investigates and can just guard yourself . Although at this stage if you have saved a peek , you will probably be looking at a solid 50/50 chance of getting an unseen and within that you can get the important chance of discovering the mm .

The trouble  is if you are a good king at about this time you will be getting hanged because you haven&#39;t given any info yet .Although in my mind it seems that at this later stages your investigates are far more worthwhile .</description>

            <p>Keep in mind: King is one of the most brutal roles for new players and can be overwhelming to be hit with a barrage of whispers.</p>

            <p>Those stats are assuming the king is the only one investigating. If you have the king, observer, princess, and 2 sheriffs in a game, those odds change a little bit. However, nobody should be calling king evil D3 unless it’s blatantly obvious that he is. the life of a good king is rough man. The BD want unseen dead now. And if it is taking too long, they’ll even go as far as “even if he’s a good king, he’s incompetent, we should exe him regardless.” I’m glad I’m rarely king.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t matter if NK’s are the only finds that matter. You can’t distinguish between them so you would out ALL neuts as non-BD.</p>

            <p>neutral killers are the only finds of consequence though.<br>
my hypothesis is that good king shouldn’t star looking til after turn 3 when he has a chance to find mm . finding mm is worth finding 3 assassins</p>

            <p>Your forgetting something. The king finds neuts as Not Allied so they can be found by king too. That makes the initial probability up to 1/3 if there is 4 neuts and 1/5 if there is only 2.</p>

            <p>Generally, King should have results by Day 5, or they are evil IMO</p>
