    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Courtesan (Neutral Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-courtesan-neutral-social/56480</link>
    <description>_You win if you become elected king, or if all of the other nobles are killed in a game._

**Exiled Royal; Passive.** 
As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. 

**Imposter; Passive.** 
If you become elected King, you will not gain any of the Kingly abilities, and will instead retain your original Day/Night functions. Your class card will change to Imposter King, and you will be King only in name.

_Day:_
**Ephemeral Prison; 4 uses.** 
Mimic prince Prison ability with one target that night, and open a new chat tab with your target where you are mentioned as Prince. Does not grant immunities to your target of which they would gain while under standard prison sentence (They only *think* they are in prison). Your target cannot take any actions while in an Ephemeral Prison. (shows up as Occupied). Ephemeral Prison does not show up as visiting your target. Cannot target the King. If this ability targets the Prince or his Imprisoned target, then it will instead show you the chat logs from the prince and his imprisoned target that night. If this ability targets the Prince, and he imprisons nobody that night, a failure message will be displayed (This ability did not seem to work properly...).

**Deaf and Dumb; 4 uses.**
For the remainder of the day, anything your target says will not show up publically in chat. The target will still see themselves saying it. Additionally, all whispers your target sends will not be received, and whispers sent to your target will not be displayed in their chat box. Cannot target the same person two days in a row (will show as X is immune to your spell today).

_Night:_
**Snoop; Infinite uses.**
Read a player&#39;s journal.

**Control; 3 uses.**
Choose two targets. The next day, 5 seconds after the first time your second target speaks the next day, the first target will accuse the second target of treason, and prevent them from voting further. If one of your targets becomes invalid to speak the next day (death, Chilled, etc), then this will display a message (you were unable to gain control over your targets).</description>

            <p>Edited Control! Now it will trigger 5 seconds after your second target speaks, with a caveat that both targets must be “valid” to speak in the daytime.</p>

            <p>Tweak suggestions encouraged. I’d like the ability to fake “prove” as a noble, while still feeling that you are using your night ability “offensively”. I agree that 5 sec is predictable.</p>
