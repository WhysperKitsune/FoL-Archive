    <title>Fixing the Servant</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fixing-the-servant/46106</link>
    <description>Butler claims are always asked to poison the king to confirm their identities (if there is a physician or alchemist). This might help Servants not be stuck in that rut. 

-Butler changes: The Butler will not commit suicide if he poisons a Blue Dragon King. The Butler will not see if his target was occupy immune
-King changes: Poison notification for the King is changed to &quot;You were poisoned!&quot;



&gt; # [color=purple]Servant[/color]
&gt; Goal: Unseen Win Con
&gt; Passive: Dutiful: Immune to Occupy and Target Changing
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Assassin&#39;s Favor 1 use: Silently ask the Assassin to poison the King with a special mix ,taking one use of Nightshade. This causes the King to die in one night if not healed by a Physician or an Alchemist. [If the Assassin already poisoned the King, this can still be used to make them die faster]
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Notifications for the Assassin&quot;]
&gt; Pop-Up: &quot;The Servant asked to borrow one use of nightshade, in order to deliver a powerful poisoning to the King. Will you do it?                       Yes/No 
&gt; 
&gt; [/details]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [details=&quot;Servant Notifications&quot;]
&gt; You asked the Assassin to borrow some Nightshade
&gt; 
&gt; The Assassin gave you his Nightshade. The King is poisoned and will die in one day!
&gt; 
&gt; The Assassin declined to give you his nightshade. 
&gt; 
&gt; Pop-Up: The Assassin poisoned the King! You can use your charge of _Assassin&#39;s favor_ to make the King die sooner! Will you do it?                          Yes/No
&gt; [/details]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments: yes, this also can be used to empower the Assassin&#39;s nightshade wine for use on the King. Basically like the Enforcer&#39;s frenzy. I like that it can be used to both prevent confirming Butlers AND this.**
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 2: Off-Brand Wine 1 use: Give the King wine that tastes &quot;funny&quot;. He will believe he was poisoned by the Butler. Potential Healers and the King will get heal notifications if they interact. If the King is NOT healed, he will still receive a heal notification
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments: (just as a loose end. Basically a form of the Herbalist&#39;s drug. an Option. Might not work without a willing partner to play along, but it is a last resort if the Assassin is out of nightshade.)**
&gt; 
&gt; Night  Ability 1: Serve Wine: Occupy a target player by getting them drunk.
&gt; Night Ability 2: Concentrated Wine: Throw a party at your house, occupying all visitors</description>

            <p>Just a question, should there be a passive making it so the Servant can only use one of these two abilities?</p>

            <p>Even if that’s true and they’re willing to let the King die, that’s still a <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> more complicated and costly way to prove a Butler.  It takes at least a night, and if the King dies to anything else, the court will have no way of knowing.  It’s certainly much better than the current system where the king is instantly informed of if it was a Butler or an Assassin the moment they’re poisoned.</p>

            <p>In my experience, whenever someone has a hint of suspicion towards a Butler, it is always “poison King now”</p>
<p>Or if a Butler is put up, it is always “put me down I can poison right now”</p>

<p>All we have to do to fix this is make it so that Butler poison and Assassin poison use the same message again.  Why were they changed to be different?  There’s no reason the King <span class="bbcode-i">needs</span> to know if they’re dying in 2 nights or 1 night.</p>

            <p>How about just giving Servant this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hallucinogenic Wine: Make your target think they were poisoned by the Butler. They will not die tonight. A Physician will think they healed the King if they try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, assassin poison is different from Butler poison.</p>
<p>Why rename the abilities? Current names are good.</p>
<p>Also Butler should commit suicide as punishment.</p>

            <p>Butler claims are always asked to poison the king to confirm their identities (if there is a physician or alchemist). This might help Servants not be stuck in that rut.</p>
<p>-Butler changes: The Butler will not commit suicide if he poisons a Blue Dragon King. The Butler will not see if his target was occupy immune<br>
-King changes: Poison notification for the King is changed to “You were poisoned!”</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="purple">Servant</font></h1>
<p>Goal: Unseen Win Con<br>
Passive: Dutiful: Immune to Occupy and Target Changing</p>
<p>Day Ability: Assassin’s Favor 1 use: Silently ask the Assassin to poison the King with a special mix ,taking one use of Nightshade. This causes the King to die in one night if not healed by a Physician or an Alchemist. [If the Assassin already poisoned the King, this can still be used to make them die faster]</p>
<details>
<summary>
Notifications for the Assassin</summary>
<p>Pop-Up: "The Servant asked to borrow one use of nightshade, in order to deliver a powerful poisoning to the King. Will you do it?                       Yes/No</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Servant Notifications</summary>
<p>You asked the Assassin to borrow some Nightshade</p>
<p>The Assassin gave you his Nightshade. The King is poisoned and will die in one day!</p>
<p>The Assassin declined to give you his nightshade.</p>
<p>Pop-Up: The Assassin poisoned the King! You can use your charge of <em>Assassin’s favor</em> to make the King die sooner! Will you do it?                          Yes/No</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Comments: yes, this also can be used to empower the Assassin’s nightshade wine for use on the King. Basically like the Enforcer’s frenzy. I like that it can be used to both prevent confirming Butlers AND this.</strong></p>
<p>Day Ability 2: Off-Brand Wine 1 use: Give the King wine that tastes “funny”. He will believe he was poisoned by the Butler. Potential Healers and the King will get heal notifications if they interact. If the King is NOT healed, he will still receive a heal notification</p>
<p><strong>Comments: (just as a loose end. Basically a form of the Herbalist’s drug. an Option. Might not work without a willing partner to play along, but it is a last resort if the Assassin is out of nightshade.)</strong></p>
<p>Night  Ability 1: Serve Wine: Occupy a target player by getting them drunk.<br>
Night Ability 2: Concentrated Wine: Throw a party at your house, occupying all visitors</p>
