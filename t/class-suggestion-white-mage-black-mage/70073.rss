    <description>&gt; # [color=steblue]The White Mage[/color]
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Support[/color]**
**Arcane Aura (Passive)** - Starts with 2 mana points and gains one mana point at the end of the day. Can hold up to 5 mana points. Getting healed when you don&#39;t require it gives you one extra mana point. (Still gives a &quot;did not require&quot; prompt for the healers.)
**Doublecast (Day)** - Costs 3 mana points. Your next night ability use has two targets instead of one. Does not alter the mana cost of said ability. Doublecast lasts until you cast a night ability, but can not be stacked. - Infinite uses
**Lesser Heal (Night)** - Costs 2 mana points. Heals the target, preventing them from dying and cures poison/bleed. Can target self.  - Infinite uses
**Holy Missile (Night)** - Costs 5 mana points. Bleeds the target, making them die the next night if not healed (just like Hunter wolf). If the target is a magic user, kills them instead. - Infinite uses
*Defeat the Unseen/Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

&gt; # [color=purple]The Black Mage[/color]
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Offensive[/color]**
**Arcane Aura (Passive)** - Retains your mana points on conversion and gains one mana point at the end of the day. Can hold up to 5 mana points. Getting healed when you don&#39;t require it gives you one extra mana point. (Still gives a &quot;did not require&quot; prompt.)
**Doublecast (Day)** - Costs 3 mana points. Your next night ability use has two targets instead of one. Does not alter the mana cost of said ability. Doublecast lasts until you cast a night ability, but can not be stacked. - Infinite uses
**Frostbite (Night)** - Costs 3 mana points. Target can not talk, vote or edit his logbook the next day. When attempting to send a message or vote a person, he will get a notification similar to Icy Touch. The logbook edits will not be visible until the next day (so if the target dies the next day or night, their logs look like they were reaped). - Infinite uses
**Arcane Missile (Night)** - Costs 5 mana points. Kills the target. If the target is a magic user, bleeds them instead, making them die the next night if not healed (just like Hunter wolf). - Infinite uses
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

            <p>I do want to remind that this is an initial concept: the mana costs and abilities have a ton of tweakability. There’s a huge difference between initial design and final balancing. The mechanics the classes offer have a lot to change about them. For example: originally Lesser Heal was a 3 mana Healing Blast, which would heal the target and everyone who visits them (except the WM himself). If you have thoughts that the class is either too weak or too strong, don’t be afraid to suggest tweaks.</p>

            <p>You realize that this class is very weak? Even if you get DNR every night you need 3 nights before you are able to cast Doublecast and HMissile<br>
Without DNR you can only heal every other day.</p>

            <p>I think if lesser heal didn’t cure bleeding/poison or attacks then it wouldn’t be too bad imo.</p>

            <p>I feel like Physician right now is rather weak, heavily undermined by the existence of Alchemists. I think Physician needs a little rework on that department (Anstreim already covered a possible rework for the two them, but I’d rather just make Physician a weaker Alchemist and remove Alchemist entirely). However, with WM having mana issues (you could balance it out by having Lesser Heal cost 3, for example), I don’t think he’s outranking Physician, he’s merely a hybrid sidegrade.</p>
<p>I might’ve gone a bit too far with the theme when it comes to magic users being weak to Holy attacks but strong against Arcane attacks. Originally I was just going to have them kill all types regardless. However, I don’t think “being confirmable” isn’t a problem with this class, since you’re expected to heal poisons/bleeds: it’s not reasonable to expect every WM to have 5 mana at their disposal for class confirming.</p>
<p>However, do you think I should switch Holy Missile to kill non-magics and bleeding magic users, or should it just outright kill everyone along with Arcane Missile?</p>

            <p>Absolutely love this flavor!</p>
<p>However, I’m not sure I really see the utility of a Physician/Hunter hybrid. It seems that this is a stronger Physician but with less coverage?</p>
<p>Also the whole reverse killing power of Holy and Arcane missile seems like a very confirmable power.</p>
