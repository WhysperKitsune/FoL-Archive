    <title>Mastermind Foresight on n1?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mastermind-foresight-on-n1/9587</link>
    <description>I just played a Mastermind game, and couldn&#39;t use Foresight n1 (or n2, though I had to Convert by then anyway). The skill was disabled and wouldn&#39;t pop a grid at all, so I don&#39;t think it was due to an offensive class but could be wrong. Once I lost an US member I could use it.

Is that normal?</description>
