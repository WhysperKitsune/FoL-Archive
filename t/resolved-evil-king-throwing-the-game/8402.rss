            <p>Bad Gameplay, yes. New Player, perhaps. Profit, I dunno what you mean.</p>
<p>I’m not angry or anything, but I still need to prove a point.<br>
A MasterMind is NS for the first 3 days, so I dunno how that would come out for the Evil King if he investigated me. Tell me, if you were Evil King, would you randomly vote someone up? I wouldn’t, cause if that person turned out to be a BD, they’ll kill Evil King. It’s just a bad action.<br>
And if you get lucky by finding out that you executed an Unseen, would you say you’re Evil King?<br>
Do you see how that’s a throw? Regardless if Evil King thinks if there’s no Unseen left or not, the Rule states that you must go through with it till the end.</p>

            <p>Plus, I can see Evil King bussing Unseen so long it’s not Mastermind executed, this is beneficial.</p>
<p>Why? Because that allow them to expend with converting. It is up to Unseen to figure out king’s allegiance just like everyone else, they are suppose to represent “Informed minority”</p>
