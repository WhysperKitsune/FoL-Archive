    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-quack-blue-dragon-killing/59101</link>
    <description>&gt;**The Quack**(BD Killing)
**Passive 1:No remedies:** Your poisoning effects can not be healed, except by Possess and Consume Soul.
**Passive 2:Poisonous Killing:** Your kills do not leave a death note. Blue Dragon kills frame yourself permanently.
**Day Ability 1:Overdose**(1 use) Give someone a silent lethal poison that kills the next night. The Possessor will be aware of being poisoned at the start of the night.
**Night Ability 1:Dangerous Medicine**(unlimited Uses):The target is healed from attacks. If you target someone with this twice without having healed them they will die by poison. If you target someone with this thrice they will die by poison.
**Night Ability 2:Antidotes and Bandages**(4 Uses): Remove Poisoning and Bleeding from your target; you may target yourself.

Converts into:

&gt;**The Poisoner(Unseen Killing)**
**Passive 1:Killer:** You do not replace The Assassin. As long as you are alive the Assassin will not be replaced.
**Day Ability 1:I will kill now**:(2 uses): The Assassin reverts to their original class. The Assassin may reject this proposal.
**Night Ability 1:Apply Poison**(Unlimited Uses) Kill someone with Poison. Cannot be used if an Assassin is alive.
**Night Ability 2:Antidotes and Bandages**(2 Uses): Remove Poisoning and Bleeding from your target; you may target yourself.

There needs to be a healer beyond the Physician, and the Alchemist generates a ton of problems.
This would be more suitable.</description>

            <p>Right.<br>
Reaper would simply lose a soul.<br>
Possessor would be highly susceptible to Overdose, but not when jumping.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is effectively Butler poison, but usable on everyone. When used right, it can take out a Mastermind or NK in a single night. Noting that it can’t be healed, nor would anyone know to heal it due to being silent, means that it’s an almost guaranteed kill. If you target the wrong person, the drawback is appearing suspicious, but otherwise, it’s really powerful. Not sure if that’s a good thing or not.</p>

</aside>
<p>Assuming this also heals poison and bleeding (which it might not, I’m unclear), it can be used to disprove fake poisoned claims, and kill the scum claiming to be poisoned in the process, which doesn’t really sound too fun. If it doesn’t, it’s an interesting mechanic, but I’m not sure how often it would see use beyond a Physician that can only heal the same person once.</p>

            <p>I have mixed feelings about the Quack, <s>but the Poisoner doubles the Unseen’s kills per night. That’s way too strong for a conversion in my opinion.</s></p>
<p>Edit: Didn’t see “Cannot be used if an Assassin is alive” lol</p>
