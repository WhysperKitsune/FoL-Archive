    <description>Cheerio in-game here, suspended for trying to up prince after he told butler to kill me

look, imma try to kill prince every time he tells butler to poison me when I&#39;m BD King.

I don&#39;t sit in lobbies for 30 minutes to get killed by my own team because players don&#39;t understand that not pointing or actually using your day ability isn&#39;t suspicious

And dying to an irrestible giant gold button is usually unavoidable no matter what you do.  

Essentially I was reported because players are butthurt they got a penalty for executing GK.  Getting punished for idiocy is how the game should work, but obviously the pently for butlering GK isn&#39;t nearly big enough to thwart it, and it&#39;s understandable because the option is either A) click the giant button and show off your artwork, or B) do nothing.

Prince wanted to kill someone with impunity but got butthurt I forced him to accept the consequences lmao ... But I get punished for it.

Ban me or fix the game because like I said I&#39;ll do it again</description>

<p>(Day) Day 3<br>
(Alive) No Quise [1] (Cheerio - BD King): tomorrow we kill prince<br>
(Day) Day 4<br>
(Alive) No Quise [1] (Cheerio - BD King): ya kill this moron prince today<br>
(Announcement) The King has pointed the finger at Barnie Soonders [15]!<br>

<p>You knew the Prince was Prince, then tried to exe him. That goes against your objective against BD King (see Code of Conduct @ top of lobby).</p>
<p>Either way, no ban discussions here. Please DM a mod in Discord @ <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a></p>

            <p>yes i knew prince was prince</p>
<p>im not appealing a ban</p>
<p>im literally asking for a ban</p>
<p>because if another prince ever exploits this loophole of killing me by some cheap poison</p>
<p>so he only has to convince one person i’m evil</p>
<p>and won’t suffer the consequences if he’s wrong</p>
<p>i’ll try to kill him again, i don’t care if he’s confirmed prince or not</p>
<p>he’s ruining my game</p>
<p>but the blame mostly goes toward the cheap poison which has insufficient incentive to not be pressed</p>
