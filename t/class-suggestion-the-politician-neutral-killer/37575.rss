</aside>
<p>This is entirely correct. The idea is that if you are worried about N1 deaths or whatever they you use Cunning Strike. If think you are safe (you have a knight on you for example) then you can safely use poison and asset block to quickly kill others. If you think there are no healers in play you can also use Asset block on yourself while you let poison kill everyone until it gets to late game.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to let Cunning Strike and Poison be used in the same day/night cycle because that would make the KPN be greater than 1. I also didn’t want to make either of them limited because Poison is supposed to be an important part of using the class (if you think you are safe then poison everyone to death) but I don’t want to limit Cunning Strike either because it could cause problems if left with just a healer.</p>
<p>I also feel like Asset block is inherently a good enough ability when paired with poison to be worth the loss of passive night immunity.</p>

            <p>This class needs permentant Night Immunity. It seems very weak. I feel like Cunning Strike is only there to provide Night Immunity and killing vs Healers.</p>
<p>The poison aspect of it is very different, along with that it is a Royal Blood. It means that there is never 100% a BD RB King. I support this but I believe there should be either some empowerment to the kills he makes and remove Cunning Strike or rework it because Night Immunity is much better than guarranteee kills. Maybe allow Cunning Strike to work even when you poison or something? I don’t know, but this is your idea. I’d like to see what your response to this feedback is. Good class idea tho. Having a royal Blood Evil would balance RBs out a lot.</p>
<p>I’m gonna go and create myself a checklist for future ideas of what to look in an NK</p>
