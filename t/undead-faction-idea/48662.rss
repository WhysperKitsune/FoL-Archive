            <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Also if any other Undead lose the Undead passive (via Possess or Ritual) they can also become the Necromancer.</p>

            <p>Starting Evil King works.</p>
<p>If Apprentice steps up, you can have Revenant.</p>
<p>If Necromancer steps up, all existing Undead also remain, so kills continue.</p>
<p>Or you can just not step up.</p>

<p>Why did the deaths stop for three days<br>
Kill him</p>

<summary>
Necromancer becomes King</summary>
<p>No more necromancer whatsoever, making the entire faction basically a two-man psycho-king.Just an EK but also 1KPN</p>

            <p>It would be an interesting twist, making it so the BD would try not to execute a King.</p>
<p>Also, in an Undead game, The Evil faction just can’t afford to put any of their shills in as a King.</p>
<p>Because then the Necromancer would lose his Acolyte.</p>
<p>It’s better to raise one from the dead, even if it’s temporary.</p>
<p>(BD are wary of killing a king because an Unseen King can be made to exist. But in an Undead game it’s all fine and dandy, nobody would care)</p>

<p>They don’t.  If a faction is powerful then that should be fixed by balancing them, not giving them a soft counter.<br>
That’s bad balance.  And it’s not uncommon for the BD to win after the sheriffs/paladins are dead.  They’re not needed.  I’d prefer it if sheriff was changed so it affects all evil  factions and paladin was reworked into a support class.</p>

            <p>That’s the main problem with the current paladin and sheriff though.  And there’s still no risk to it.  Omniscient abilities are never good.  That’s mainly why it should affect anyone.</p>
