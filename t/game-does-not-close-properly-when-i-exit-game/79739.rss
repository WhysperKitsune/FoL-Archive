    <title>Game does not close properly when I exit game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-does-not-close-properly-when-i-exit-game/79739</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Nearly every time I quit the game, it still shows the game is running in my Steam library. I have to quit steam, wait for it to try and close Throne of lies, then force close it. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Game should just exit, and steam should know its exited. 

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Steam
2. Run ToL from the Library menu
3. Exit game

#### Comments:

I can jump on discord if necessary to help debug.</description>
