            <p>Honestly, I like the idea of different types of CW so you never know which CW you’re going to get(essentially making it different classes) but some of your abilities are too powerful or confirmability imo.</p>

            <p>The frozen literally just sounds awful. All the abilities are basically negative BD since the main attraction is stopping players from talking during the day. I can see many miss lynched for this ability.</p>
<p>Just going over the psychic, all of the abilities are long and confusing and extremely niche. None of them sound fun and the second night ability just sounds like it will run bd.</p>
<p>The great overall just sounds over powered. Reverse is okay. I think it is far too overpower to be an infinite ability. Throw that on prince and he’s basically immortal. At least don’t let it redirect immune players like butler and drunk. They other two abilities are just insanely strong and assure that you and another bd are safe for at least 3 night.</p>

<p>The problem is I don’t see this court wizard’s <strong>MAIN</strong> ability that has unlimited uses. I feel that after 5 nights of using these abilities. The court wizard will feel boring. Solution: Make the stop abilities a day ability to stop day abilites or take that out and add in another night ability that has infinite uses.</p>
