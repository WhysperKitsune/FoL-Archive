    <title>Reaper chilling with 1 soul</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/reaper-chilling-with-1-soul/35510</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I had two souls as reaper, I got attacked and lost one and the message said &quot;You have 1 souls left&quot;. I was occupied that night and couldnt reap so I didnt get any extra souls. The next day I was able to chill someone even though I only had 1 soul.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I shouldn&#39;t have been able to chill anyone with only 1 soul.

#### Steps to reproduce:
I guess you should get attacked and lose one soul and then try to chill someone? Idk what caused this to be honest

#### Comments:
On a related note, what are the numbers that appear above Chill and the other day ability? I thought it was the number of souls you currently have, but several times I&#39;ve seen different numbers on each ability. It is kind of confusing.</description>

            <p>I thought that the chill did not require any souls to use. Souls will be consumed when you are attacked and when you wish to use the other ability (can never remember the name of it, but isn’t it Cloak of Darkness?).</p>
<p>Might be wrong since I haven’t played for a bit but when I used to play the game as Reaper, that wasn’t the case.</p>

            <p>Looks like the game thought you had 2 souls because you reaped by were occupied.</p>
