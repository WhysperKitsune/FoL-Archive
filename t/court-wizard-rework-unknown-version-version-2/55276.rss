    <title>Court Wizard rework(Unknown version; Version 2)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework-unknown-version-version-2/55276</link>
    <description>Alright here is my rework:

**Court Wizard(Blue Dragon Support)**

&gt;**Day ability 1:Spell of Truth(unlimited Uses):** Your target will get correct results tonight. They will ignore anything that would cause their results to be wrong.(Occupy, target changing do NOT get prevented)
**Day Ability 2:Spell of Focus(1 use)** You are silently immune against Occupy and target changing tonight.
**Night Ability 1:Protective Barrier(4 uses)** Your target is immune to attacks if it does not visit; or is in Prison. This excludes poison attacks by the Alchemist. Cannot be used on the King.
**Night Ability 2:Mind Shield(Unlimited uses, 1 day cooldown)** Your target cannot be possessed tonight. Your target drops dead when reaped instead, without giving any souls. Runes do not work on it. Conversions are prevented. 

**The Sage(Unseen Support)**
**Strengthen Poison Spell(Day)(1 use)** The next usage of Nightshade by the Assassin is unhealable.
**Spell of Focus(Day)**(see above)
**Moving Protective Barrier(Night)(2 Uses)** Your target is immune to attacks. This excludes poison attacks by the Alchemist. Cannot be used on the King.
**Invisiblity Mind Shield(Unlimited Uses, 1 day Cooldown)**:Your target ignores the Guards of the King, the protection of the Knight and the Mercenary. They cannot be possessed and drop dead when reaped, without giving any souls.</description>

<p>Protective Barrier is interesting, since it doesn’t work if they leave, but that seems like something that perpetuates the Prince meta since any CW can assure Prince is alive for 4 nights in a row, since Prince doesn’t visit.

<p>Whoops.<br>
Everybody in Prison is now unaffected.<br>
A night of Immunity allows CW to bypass any BS their enemies try to do to throw him off(Invoker, Servant, Poacher)</p>

            <p>So I’m having a very hard time understanding how this whole thing makes the CW more fun than the current iteration. Spell of truth is okay ish, but it only works on investigative. And being unlimited, it’s very mindless. Just find the first Invest claim and pump this into them.</p>
<p>Spell of Focus Just doesn’t do anything. Why does he just get a night of immunity? How does it help his kit? Yes you can guarantee your night ability goes off, but it doesn’t add anything other than giving him 4 abilities.</p>
<p>Protective Barrier is interesting, since it doesn’t work if they leave, but that seems like something that perpetuates the Prince meta since any CW can assure Prince is alive for 4 nights in a row, since Prince doesn’t visit. It also is oddly restrictive. Why does Alch get to attack through for free?</p>
<p>Mind Shield just doesn’t sound fun at all. It’s a counter to NKs somewhat, but Knight and Phys already do that. Something else just feels off about this ability, but I’m not sure how to word it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m just real tired of every single CW suggestion being “Change everything but make sure he has 4 abilities” 4 abilities will make him “fun” but it also complicates him far more and tips him into the overpowered side. And even if it doesn’t make him overpowered, that fundamentally means all the abilities are weak and are in turn going to be boring anyway.</p>

            <p>My consern here is not power. Anti-conversion alone is strong. The problem is that it can be borring due to the optimal usage of Anti-Conversion is to stay on one person the whole game and never do anything else at night. Because it’s primary strength is lost the second you miss a night.</p>
<p>However if it is a day Ability then you can do that and then do other things anyway.</p>

<p>Night Ability 1:Protective Barrier(4 uses) Your target is immune to attacks if it does not visit. This excludes poison attacks. Cannot be used on the King.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So a nerfed heal basically? Can’t tell if it only give the target night immunity if they don’t visit or if it only gives immunity to non-visiting attacks.</p>
<p>Also poison already bypasses immunity, you specifying it just make it seem like bleed does NOT bypass it when it does.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel like these should be combined into a single day ability. Then you could have a more interesting primary night ability.</p>

<p>You have no idea how many games you’re going to see a CW just say<br>
“Yolo”<br>
and do this n1 so they can leave and get another game, making the NK or Assassin ignore death immunities.</p>

            <p>Let’s see. In orer for it to trigger, a few conditions have to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The converter has been netted</li>
<li>The convertee has been netted</li>
<li>Neither of them have died</li>
</ul>
<p>If these 3 conditions are triggered, which are hard conditons to predict all at once, bearing in mind, this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convertee becomes convert immune</li>
<li>A smart CW can figure out that this happened and catch the converter</li>
</ul>
<p>Except by then the converter’s probably dead and the convertee’s probably been stabbed because of how long it took you to set up and make the net. So it’s probably not going to make much diffference most of the time, except in that 1 in 10 case when  you figure all of this out before the rest of the BD does and the kills fail, you’ve got a confirmed BD permanently and a confirmed evil.</p>
<p>QED: It’s swingy,<br>
Now, I have to go right now. I’ll get on with reviewing all the reworks when I get back.</p>
