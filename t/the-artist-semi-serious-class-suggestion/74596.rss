    <description>Who has time to paint a pretty picture when you&#39;re busy hunting Prince?

Enter, the Artist!

&gt; # [color = &quot;grey&quot;]The Artist[/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;grey&quot;]Neutral Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Passionate (Passive) -** Immune to death once.
&gt;
&gt;**Contract (Night Ability) -** Visit a player.  If they die, your deathnote will appear on them.
&gt;
&gt;**Provenance (Day Ability)  -** Learn who drew the deathnote on a player.
&gt;
&gt;*You win if you contract 4 deathnotes.*

The number of deathnotes required to win should force the Artist to communicate directly with killers.</description>

            <p>I don’t foresee it being prohibitively difficult to bypass nobles by using references to shared secrets disguised as innoccous whispers</p>

<p>Evils also have not very much incentive to work with this person.</p>

<p>blackmail? lol</p>
<p>However I do admit it is a half-baked concept</p>

            <p>With nobles and “why does this guy whisper that one?” existing? I just don’t see 4 happening. Why should it be Pretender style difficulty?</p>
<p>Evils also have not very much incentive to work with this person.</p>

<p>Basically a guaranteed evil vote in that case.</p>
<hr>
<p>Eh. Looking over this I see a lot of inherent problems, especially with its day ability being able to find evils making the difficult part incredibly easy (predicting who dies).</p>
