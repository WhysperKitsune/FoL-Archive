    <title>Fool is a problem when he Wins, and Scorned not</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fool-is-a-problem-when-he-wins-and-scorned-not/22182</link>
    <description>The game has a really big problem with this (In my opinion).

BD really needs to not execute any Fool, because if they do so, They cant exe the next day.. but, ¿What if Scorned wins?

Scorned is not a really big problem for Blue Dragon if he win, because the Scorned Target can be a converted BD, or a Drunk/Butler.

My suggestion is: If you let the Scorned get his objective, he got a silence on the Night ability, but he gets 2 trollboxes per day

That would make the Scorned a super dangerous class for BD and not only a Neutral with Night Immunity.</description>

            <p>Scorned harms BD is several ways.  The most obvious is that scorned targets are always at least BD to start with. True, they might be converted, but they’re more likely to not be.</p>
<p>However, the biggest damage they do is by merely existing, even when they aren’t in a game.  If a Sheriff comes out day 2 and says he’s found an unseen, his claim is less trustworthy because Scorned exists.  You can either roll the dice and execute, or waste time confirming the claim.</p>

</aside>
<p>you know what situation butlers and drunks are good in? When a fool stops trials, and an unseen is found and the prince is dead. Butler can prevent them from capitalizing on that, as can drunk</p>
<p>butler is one of the best classes. it can find poss and prince, test if occupying someone causes there to be no kills, etc.</p>

</aside>
<p>why are 2 of the most powerful bd roles listed as not a problem for bd to accidentally execute?</p>
<p>I’d still have to say the cost is about the same for falling for either. If anything the fool is the lighter one. You execute the fool, you buy the unseen one uncontested trial date in which they get an extra kill in, BD can still investigate and knight/hunter/prince/alcs may still use what they learned in the discussion phase to eliminate the threat anyway.</p>
<p>Now while a scorned might once in a blue moon get lucky and his target actually was converted. Most of the time his target is BD, and it actually does kill one BD when he succeeds.</p>
<p>The fool burns 2-3 executions (if you consider his own execution a waste of one)</p>
<p>Now where scorned hurts bd even worse IMO, is the question left afterwards… is that a won scorned, or is that an unseen/cult/NK pretending to be a won scorned. If he’s legitimate, he’s still a pretty scary swing vote, but it’s the big ?? that’s still left of is he really a won scorned, that to me is the kicker. I mean nights alive are a very valuable resource for the prince… and executions are also a pretty valuable resource.<br>
The executioner burns 1-2 executions… and takes out one almost certainly BD.</p>
<p>Sure he could keep trollboxing to cause harm, but it’s pretty difficult to do an effective trollbox to begin with, and again he’s pretty disincentivezed to actually do much with them. However they would be very effective tools for “oh yeah I’m a won scorned” Here I’ll prove it<br>
7: Yeah he’s proven scorned<br>
9: no question he’s scorned</p>
<p>See!, while I did cost you a member, I’m now an immune unconvertable proven vote for your side!</p>
