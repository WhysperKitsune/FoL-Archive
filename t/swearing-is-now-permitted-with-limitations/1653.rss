    <title>Swearing is now permitted (with limitations)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/swearing-is-now-permitted-with-limitations/1653</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;í42-Xblade, post:1, topic:244&quot;]
Swearing is permitted. However, keep it classy -- don&#39;t overdo it and no targeting people. Some BOTs will automod &quot;heavy swear words&quot;. Feel free to &quot;word around&quot; the filter (to censor your words). No racial slurs, etc.
[/quote]

**Rule #1** was recently updated for several reasons:

1. Swearing used as an adjective (99% of the use) should not offend anyone. It simply supercharges the word. For example, &quot;_fcking awesome!_&quot;

2. We mods and devs swear. We&#39;re bad examples and we apologize for being hypocritical.

a reminder: **Just because you CAN swear, doesn&#39;t mean you should**. Overdoing it or using it as personal/directed insults (f YOU) will still result in disciplinary action. **Keep it classy.** The Discord BOT will still automod f words and racial slurs. However, minor swearing was removed from automod and the forum won&#39;t be modded for swearing **unless it&#39;s directed or crossing lines, like racial slurs.**
