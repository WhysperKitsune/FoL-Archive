<p>It doesn’t matter. Sometimes you get killed night one. It’s important for the game that it works like this. It should not be changed.</p>

<p>Sure, it’s annoying to die night one. Mastermind is hard to replace, so needs immunity. Cult Leader is replaceable, so giving it immunity is an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>Why? Cult are meant to be easily replaced, and there is no reason why it should have it. Teleportation can already work if you’re clever enough.</p>
