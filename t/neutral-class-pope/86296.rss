    <title>Neutral class: pope</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-class-pope/86296</link>
    <description>the pope needs order restored to the kingdom, he wants the game to end within 7 turns. if it doesnt then there will be an outbreak of protestantism. the pope cannot be in the same game as the caliph.

passive: gout - the pope will die if the game isnt over in time for victory from obesity/syphilis

day: excommunicate (3) - target player cannot speak to other players or see what they say for the remainder of the day, can only communicate through whispers. anyone who whispers to an excommunicated person will also become excommunicated

day: call crusade (2) - target player will lose death immunity the following night, if they have it. all non-bd classes with the ability to kill we be informed of this.

night: heresy trial (2) - the following day, after bodies are revealed there will be a trial of the target, before normal voting. if they are executed, the court will still be able to execute someone else.

night: call swiss guards) (2) - you will be death immune tonight, and will attack the target</description>

            <p>Neutral Class: Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Jesus needs to cleanse every living player of sin before the game ends or he’ll die on a cross in the post game</p>
<p>Passive: Probably based - Jesus is immune to occupies and redirection.<br>
Passive 2: Raptor Mount - Due to Jesus’ best friend and raptor companion, he cannot be killed. So don’t even try, heathen.</p>
<p>Day: Save - Jesus removes the sin from 2 players. If that player votes to execute a member of the blue dragon or kills a member of the blue dragon they will have sinned again.</p>
<p>Night: Wine time - Occupy a player.</p>

</aside>
<p>This feels unnecessary. Why would a class that needs the game to end early want to blot out communication and make solving harder? If BD solves early, the game ends early.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a hard no as it allows for a second execution with the target decided by a neutral. Which basically means the BD can utterly melt through their suspicious people, which is very, very strong.</p>

</aside>
<p>And also two kills. This neut can get a total of 4 people killed on its own. That’s crazy. And also means he swings the game super rapidly towards the side he isn’t melting through.</p>
