    <title>Court Wizard Buff ideas</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-buff-ideas/3078</link>
    <description>The Court Wizard is very boring to play as. His main ability rarely does anything and it&#39;s almost impossible to have a meaningful impact on the game. 

I suggest that the Magic Barrier should work until the next night. Meaning it is still active during the day. I also would say that you should be notified if you actually block anything with Ice ward/Magic Barrier</description>

            <p>I agree with you being notified of blocking something;</p>
<p>without it, even if you did something meaningful, you fell useless.</p>
