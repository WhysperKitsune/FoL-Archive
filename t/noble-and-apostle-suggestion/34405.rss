    <description>Noble: Remove either noble twin or political pressure. Which ever one is removed can be kept on the aristocrat. The remaining Ability can have more uses. I would suggest keeping political pressure over noble twin

Apostle: Whichever day Ability is removed from noble should be replaced with telepathy. Dark words should be readded.</description>
