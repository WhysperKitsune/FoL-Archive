    <description>Warning, these are not the only changes needed for these classes, but they are necessary on their own. 

Failure to emulate kills correctly will immediately result in a Psycho/Evil King&#39;s death. Change is necessary to ensure that Kings are not executed on technicality alone.

Good King has no way to protect people from being taken from him.
These changes will benefit every faction in a fair way.

# Good King
**Guards** (Night) - The King can summon a guard to protect a player. The guard will sacrifice himself for that player if an attempt is made on his life. If you are the starting Good King, your guards will also protect against conversions. Whether the guard actually saves the player or not, the guard is spent. (4 uses)

 # Reaper
Passive 2: **Gilded Bones**: You can now step up as King as though you had Royal Blood. You will keep Reap as a secondary ability if you become psycho king. As king it will no longer give you souls however.
_
[Psycho King crowned from Reaper only] 
Night Ability 2: **Reap:** Send a guard to kill someone using your old Scythe, bypassing healing. This will leave an empty body for a day (Unlimited Uses)
Thanks to @NuclearBurrito

# Mastermind
Passive 2: **In the Shadows**: Does not appear as Unseen to all Investigative abilities for the first 3 nights. Also, you may step up as King as though you had Royal Blood. The Assassin will have the option to become the Mastermind if you become a King.
_
# Any Unseen Member
Evil King: If you are the final member of your faction, your Guards! ability will be replaced with this.
**Shadow Guards** (unlimited uses): Send a guard to kill someone.

# Any Cultist
Evil King: If you are the final member of your faction, your Guards! ability will be replaced with this.
**Clots**: (unlimited uses): Send a guard to kill someone.

You also gain a second night ability if you are the final member of your faction

(Night) **Eradicate** (1 use): Choose two targets, and send guards to attack both of them. For any reason (doing nothing/attacking jailed target, etc), failing to kill a target with _Clots_ will grant you an extra use of this ability.

# Possessor 
(Passive 1): **Driven**: Immune to occupation at night and immune to target changing. Possessing a King will make you a Psycho King.
 _
[Psycho King crowned from Possessor only]:
(Night Ability 2)**Possess**: You will take over a person’s body, leaving your old one behind. The old body will keep the class and logbook you had before. You will get the logbook of the player you possess, and be able to edit it as normal. You will no longer be a Psycho King if you possess someone else. You inherit the amount of uses you had as a possessor (failing to successfully possess someone will NOT use an ability use)

[/quote]

# Sorcerer
[Evil King crowned from Sorcerer only]
**Omniscient Guards**: Send a guard to kill a player. If for any reason, doing this action would kill you, or if the attack would be prevented, the action will be canceled. Killing an Unseen or Cultist will fail. 
If the attack is canceled, you will receive the message &quot;Something was off.&quot;

            <p>That, for the most part, is accounted for.</p>
<p>The problem with Evil King is that if he happens to be the last person (whether starting or not), he will just die because there are no kills.(And the game is stuck, so there is no way to win unless there are no confirmed BD and everyone hangs one another without questioning the lack of kills. Rare.)  That’s the main issue.</p>

            <p>I think you missed the point of evil king.</p>
<p>Evil king doesn’t count against the evil cap, so when the converted noble step up, the MM can convert a fourth unseen.</p>
<p>If the MM is dead don’t step up as king is a better play for you.</p>
<p>Also, I can see the sense of giving MM royal blood (it is crazy strong late game so im not sure), but no way that you give the assasin the option to become the mm.</p>

            <p>Just checked and it seems you copied it from the wiki so disregard the comment about the keeping the logbook it seems it is included and experienced players would know it. (Different discussion if you want to discuss putting it in to benefit new players)</p>

</aside>
<p>I do like the change that psycho king instead of possessor when you posses king, but it does not say that you get the logbook of the person you posses which I think is not good for the poss. And also getting the deathnote will cause metagaming,</p>

<p>He kills 2 people in one night, similar to eradicate.<br>
He only has one use.<br>
Doing nothing replenishes the use</p>
<p>So he has to wait to use it again. If he uses his Fatal Guards variant ability, he cannot use Eradicate.</p>

            <p>Warning, these are not the only changes needed for these classes, but they are necessary on their own.</p>
<p>Failure to emulate kills correctly will immediately result in a Psycho/Evil King’s death. Change is necessary to ensure that Kings are not executed on technicality alone.</p>
<p>Good King has no way to protect people from being taken from him.<br>
These changes will benefit every faction in a fair way.</p>
