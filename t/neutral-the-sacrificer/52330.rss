    <title>(neutral) The Sacrificer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/neutral-the-sacrificer/52330</link>
    <description>What this class does is it needs to kill 4 bd and it will learn the identities/roles of all the unseen and will need to kill 3 unssen/cult to learn the identities/roles of all the bd

This class is unique 

Passive 1: See it through: Your victioms are so badly attacked that only the alch has the knowledge to heal the wounds.

Passive 2: Determined: Immune to occupied/target change
 
Night Ability 1: Sacrifices: Kill your target player and collect there &quot;knowledge?&quot;

Night ability 2: ToDo

This class is strange cause Bd can use it to learn who all the cult/unseen are but there need to loss some of there members to do so.Same with unseen/cult.

The goal of this class is to just survive but it can become a big target due to its powers</description>

            <p>neutral chaos?  There’s nothing in this game called that, are you referring to TOS?</p>
<p>BG? I’m pretty sure there is nothing in the game called that</p>
<p>I like the abilities and the passives but is it unique? What type is it? Also I can’t really understand it’s goal</p>
