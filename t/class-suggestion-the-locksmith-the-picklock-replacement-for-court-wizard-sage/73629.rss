&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;


&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt; I am proposing this class to replace the Court Wizard / Sage. My main goal in making this class was to stick close enough to the current CW so that the game&#39;s balance isn&#39;t too significantly impacted while still adding enough changes to make the class more engaging to play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color =#1e84cc&gt; The Locksmith&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;   (Class type: Support)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Passives: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Day Ability: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skeleton Key:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Selected player is guaranteed to visit their target tonight. (3 uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Night Abilities: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinforce Lock:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Prevent all players who are not &lt;font color =#1e84cc&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/font&gt; from visiting the target. [Cannot target the same player two nights in a row] (Infinite uses) &lt;i&gt;(Notifies player when ability successful blocks someone)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swap Locks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity (3 uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color =&quot;#8e7cc3&quot;&gt;The Picklock&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;   (Class type: Support)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Passives: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Day Ability: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pickpocket:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Prevent all players that are not &lt;font color=#8e7cc3&gt;Unseen&lt;/font&gt; from visiting the target tonight. (2 uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Night Abilities: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plant Evidence:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Make target appear suspicious to &lt;font color=#1e84cc&gt;Investigative&lt;/font&gt; classes. (Infinite uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Edit: As RHCube pointed out, this is basically just a worse version of Aristocrat&#39;s Intrigue. Maybe instead this ability could be the same as the Scorned&#39;s Disguise, changing the players class if he is executed the next day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swap Locks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Bypasses redirection immunity (3 uses)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt;The Locksmith stays close to the CW in many important ways. He keeps CW&#39;s swap, and between Skeleton Key and Reinforce, the Locksmith can perform many of the same functions as CW. Namely, where CW would empower a phys to make sure he was able to heal his target, the Locksmith can use Skeleton Key on the phys during the day. Also, where the CW would use Clear Mind on an outted investigative class to stop a conversion, the Locksmith would use Reinforce Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt;I think that replacing Empower + Clear Mind with Reinforce Locks + Skeleton Key will make this class more enjoyable to play than the current CW. For one, Empower is not a very intuitive ability since it has a different effect on each class type. Even after playing the CW many many times, I still have to check back to remember what it does for each class. Reinforce is much more straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt;Also, on the rare occasion that Empower does aid the target, it&#39;s usually not very satisfying since you don&#39;t know whether you just helped the phys heal their target or helped the reaper reap the prince. With Reinforce, you can be much more confident that you had a positive impact on the BD when your ability is successful. There is still a possibility that the ability will be counterproductive (e.g. preventing an alch from truthing an unseen; preventing the NK from killing assassin; preventing pretender from blood testing the MM; etc.) but it will still yield positive results much more frequently than Empower does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt;The Picklock also stays fairly close to Sage, keeping the swap and the ability to &quot;firewall&quot; a target. The main difference as far as the firewall is concerned is that it is now a day ability (Pickpocket). This means that the first night the Locksmith is converted, he doesn&#39;t have the benefit of talking to the other unseen to pick a valuable firewall target. This is especially important now that Mastermind has Little Birds, I think. However, if all unseen are able to survive long enough, then they will be able to confer to pick a Pickpocket target, but this will require a little more luck and cooperation than it does for the Sage. I think Frame is also a good addition here since it is a fun, low-impact ability that works well with the class&#39;s lore.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 40px&quot;&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;

<p>The idea is that Illusionist is easily outed because of how mystic works. So having insanely powerful night ability’s is more of a counterbalancing tool</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My thinking was that this would function as a slightly less powerful firewall. It does the same thing as firewall, but is weaker because the Picklock isn’t able to talk with other unseen the night he’s converted to figure out who’s Prince or whatever. This means if MM knows who prince is and Locksmith is converted N3, then MM, assa, and Picklock must all survive until D5 in order for the ability to be used on prince.</p>
<p>Of course, if such a powerful day ability was added, I think the power of the night abilities would probably have to be lower to compensate.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes I would agree to make it only one use. It would virtually confirm the MM as BD investigative if played right, so I don’t think unseen deserves a second shot at it if they fail the first one.</p>

</aside>
<p>I would certainly make sense on illusionist as well. However, illusionist already has mindwarp, which is an extremely powerful ability on its own. Adding disguise as well might make illusionist OP. Also, if Locksmith/Picklock were implimented, the disguise ability would make sense lore-wise for picklock as he can break into the players room and plant evidence to make them look like anything.</p>

<p>oh yeah. Alternatively just keep Picklock as a reskinned Sage with no mechanical difference</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Definitely could work. Especially because I feel like no one is really dissatisfied with Sage itself, just CW.</p>

<p>It’s actually slightly more confirmable than the current CW. Swap Locks is identical to Tornado, which is the main confirmation for CWs, and Reinforce Locks could technically be confirmed by an outted alch since it blocks both neuts and evils.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes this is definitely a possibility. As I said to RHCube above, I lean towards blocking only evils and neuts so that the ability is more useful for BD and thus would make the class more enjoyable, but I’m sure I haven’t thought through all the implications of that and it would certainly shift the game’s balance in the BD’s direction somewhat.</p>

<p><b><font>Comments:</font></b></p>
<p>The Locksmith stays close to the CW in many important ways. He keeps CW's swap, and between Skeleton Key and Reinforce, the Locksmith can perform many of the same functions as CW. Namely, where CW would empower a phys to make sure he was able to heal his target, the Locksmith can use Skeleton Key on the phys during the day. Also, where the CW would use Clear Mind on an outted investigative class to stop a conversion, the Locksmith would use Reinforce Lock.</p>
<p>I think that replacing Empower + Clear Mind with Reinforce Locks + Skeleton Key will make this class more enjoyable to play than the current CW. For one, Empower is not a very intuitive ability since it has a different effect on each class type. Even after playing the CW many many times, I still have to check back to remember what it does for each class. Reinforce is much more straightforward. </p>
<p>Also, on the rare occasion that Empower does aid the target, it's usually not very satisfying since you don't know whether you just helped the phys heal their target or helped the reaper reap the prince. With Reinforce, you can be much more confident that you had a positive impact on the BD when your ability is successful. There is still a possibility that the ability will be counterproductive (e.g. preventing an alch from truthing an unseen; preventing the NK from killing assassin; preventing pretender from blood testing the MM; etc.) but it will still yield positive results much more frequently than Empower does.</p>
<p>The Picklock also stays fairly close to Sage, keeping the swap and the ability to "firewall" a target. The main difference as far as the firewall is concerned is that it is now a day ability (Pickpocket). This means that the first night the Locksmith is converted, he doesn't have the benefit of talking to the other unseen to pick a valuable firewall target. This is especially important now that Mastermind has Little Birds, I think. However, if all unseen are able to survive long enough, then they will be able to confer to pick a Pickpocket target, but this will require a little more luck and cooperation than it does for the Sage. I think Frame is also a good addition here since it is a fun, low-impact ability that works well with the class's lore.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
