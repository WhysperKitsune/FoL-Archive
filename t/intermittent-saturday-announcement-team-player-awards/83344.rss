    <title>Intermittent Saturday Announcement [Team Player awards]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/intermittent-saturday-announcement-team-player-awards/83344</link>
    <description># Welcome to the Weekly Monday Discussion studio, we interrupt your regular daily broadcasting with a special announcement! I&#39;m your host, AreteBird, joining you with DatBird and ChlebBird.

**Audience:** It&#39;s not Saturday *or* Monday!!!

**AreteBird:** In any case, you&#39;re probably wondering why we&#39;re interrupting your regularly scheduled programming. Well, we have a special announcement to make! This announcement is on the subject of awards.

We know this topic is important to you, which is why we polled you on it.

![Awardspoll1|690x336](upload://6fdAfSM0WU66qfEBgwd2Mt4ICac.png) 

Now as you can see, there was general support for the idea, but some players still opposed it.

**DatBird:** Won&#39;t creating awards just lead to the same players getting awards every time? 

**AreteBird:** We know a lot of you had concerns about that, which is why we&#39;ve decided to listen to the general trend of feedback and create an award for the Best Team Player.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730855777354514494/743588694132392036/unknown.png

Since anyone, regardless of skill or experience level, can be a good team player, this should ensure that everyone has a fair chance at winning such an award. We know that not everyone is happy with this solution, but we&#39;ve been trying our best to come up with a compromise that will satisfy people. Of course, if this ends up causing more problems than it solves, we can always go back to not having awards.

**ChlebBird:** How many awards will be given out, and what are the criteria for selection?

**AreteBird:** Well, based on the results of our pulling, the data suggests that two awards -- one for town and one for scum -- is the most popular option.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730855777354514494/743588832867254343/unknown.png

Each award seeks to recognize the player who did the best job cooperating with their team and working with other players. We know that with scum this can sometimes be more complicated, but plays such as bussing and distancing do *not* disqualify someone for this award, as long as the scum who bussed was working with their partners to pursue their mutual goals.

**DatBird:** How will the winners of each award be selected?

**AreteBird:** After a game concludes, all players may submit a vote in their role card (or through PM, if scum) for the best team player for both town and scum. Players who fail to submit a vote in a timely manner will have two votes deducted from their score. Each host may likewise submit a vote. Host votes and votes by scum for the best scum team player will count double. Ties will be broken by the hosts; additionally, players who violated the rules or acted in an unsportsmanlike manner during the game may be disqualified at the discretion of the hosts or moderators.

**ChlebBird:** What if someone is doing a really good job of working with their team as town, and then gets converted the night before the game ends?

**AreteBird:** We know that conversion games are popular on this site. When voting, if a player was a member of multiple alignments during the game, try to consider their teamwork *as each alignment* -- for instance, consider the portion of the game when they were town when voting for the town teamwork award. However, you may only vote a given player for *one* award, and each player may only win a teamwork award for one alignment in a given game; if they would win both teamwork awards, they will receive the award for which they had a higher percentage of votes, and the other award will go to the player with the second most votes.

**DatBird:** Where are winners announced?

**AreteBird:** There will be a special thread that announces winners, and records all previous winners.</description>

–technically everyone can have -2 points for not voting, but I’d rather find the <em>possible</em> worthless results like “all zero”.</p>

<p>Oh, so this was what it meant.<br>

<li>Player 1 and 2 do not vote.</li>
<li>Player 3 and 4 vote Player 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>–wouldn’t this give 0 points for all of them?</p>

            <p>You’re going to have to try harder and be more proactive to improve sitewide play than trying to find a catch all<br>
If there was a catch all that worked, wouldn’t we have found it by now with multitudes upon multitudes of people all trying to find a solution</p>
<p>your problem comes from 3 areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>people don’t care to improve for whatever reason</li>
<li>people aren’t interested in the games they join for whatever reason</li>
<li>you have unrealistic expectations of how much effort people are going to put into a recreational activity</li>

<p>And the other part is because MVP awards never stood a chance of reducing toxicity. If anything, they’d cause more.</p>
<p>Highlighting and encouraging teamplay is probably more likely to succeed at achieving its desired result (improving the level of play) than crowning MVPs was at reducing toxicity, but I still believe the downsides will outweigh the perceived benefits in the long term and I honestly still can’t see this as a positive change overall. <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
<p>I feel like I’ve already <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/weekly-monday-discussion-4/83184/199?u=orangeandblack5">explained</a> why I feel this way well enough considering I’m not <em>super</em> active in FM atm, and yes, it is revert-able, but I feel like we’ve been here before and I really don’t think you “throwing a fit” had much to do with the outcome (perhaps beside hastening it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, you may only vote a given player for <em>one</em> award</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I dont really think this is necessary. yeah some people might just tend to be magnets, but i think that really wont happen often enough to be a problem, (and so when it does happen it would hopefully be deserved), and the part where they can only win 1 award should be fine in preventing it from being a problem.</p>
<hr>
<p>as for future suggestion: most improved award, not for those who played <em>the best</em> in any particular regard, but for those who’ve improved upon their previous play the most. can either be since previous game, or across their games in general. in a tie both players would receive the award maybe<br>
if not this specifically, i think something like this would still be good, a reward which can more easily go to almost any player, as opposed to a small-ish pool of players which would be a good bit more likely to receive the other award/s in a game by their presence (not to say that they wouldn’t deserve those awards, just that they are more likely to be the ones deserving of the awards if that makes sense).<br>
also  this would make it not a participation trophy. it would still be something to work for.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/arete">@Arete</a> I’d suggest to add a clause that disqualifies players from the system completely if they mention it during the game as well. Players could  use their vote in the MVP system as leverage otherwise.</p>
<p>For instance 1 NK against 3 groupscum in some standoff where town decides the victor. 3 groupscum have more votes than the lone NK and could bribe the town in voting their way.</p>

<p>This changes it to an opt-out instead of an opt-in. People will be less likely to actively engage in behaviour than passively let things happen and I think the above point applies as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>true but if you are willing to opt out you are most likely not going to vote who you think did the best even if you dont vote for worst option</p>
<p>not to say it’s gonna pressure ppl who have no opinion or dont know to vote in which case they will probably vote player who they read most or player who they consider to be best outside of that game</p>
