            <p>This seems very simialar to this idea below. The idea below was posted 12 days ago from when this comment was posted.</p>
<p><strong>Name - Bishop or priest</strong></p>
<p>Class - BD support/investigative<br>
<strong>Passive 1</strong> - Angel’s Guidance - can’t be converted after day 5</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - Family Reunion - The Bishop Invites the King to join him in conference that night. {3 uses} (if the king denies the invitation then it will not count as a uses)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2</strong> - Confession Meeting - invite a player with royal blood to confession tonight (Similar to a merc offering you a contract).<br>
• If the player has royal blood then they are given the option to accept or deny the invitation. The Bishop would know what decision the player has made.<br>
• if the player does not have royal blood then the Bishop is given the message that “[player name] is not worthy of a confession”<br>
• unlimited uses<br>
• only one time per day<br>
• if prince picks the player that you want to go to confession with, then the prince brings that player to jail</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 1</strong> - Locked with your sins - The Bishop locks the player in the room with him. This occupies the player</p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2</strong> - Guardian Angel - The Bishop calls upon a living angle that helps keep the player alive tomorrow. Can only be used in the people you’re having a confession with (the next day the player you casted the angle upon can not be voted up for treason and can not die that night.){2 uses}</p>
<p>What happens during confession:<br>
• Confession is similar to the prince jailing someone with a couple different mechanics<br>
• anyone who wants to do a night ability on one of the people in confession(healing,occu,killing, etc…) the night ability will effect both the Bishop and the other player visiting the Bishop for confession.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think. Also if anyone can think of an idea for a converted Bishop please tell me.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I meant that in combination with not having BD on your side and no occupy/night immunity, it is very hard to survive.</p>
<p>That penalty still only limits the number of kills to 4 and will only be a penalty to the Bishop, if it actually happens. What I mean by that is that it doesn’t matter to the bishop if he has killed 3 people, but still wins at the end. The most a non-NK can now commonly kill is 2 as alchemist. Inquisitor is a bit more of a fringe case.<br>
I think at 3 people, it’d be balanced, but that is up to you.</p>
<p>Except BD has little incentive to coordinate with the Bishop and as I understand it he only can have 1 person in his church during nighttime? Or is, as soon as an invitation is accepted, the night tab “Church” open to these particular players? Scum/NK has a large incentive not to cross kills with the Bishop.</p>
<p>No dead person has a large incentive to help the Bishop though. This is more of a social ability and at best I can see it getting back the last night result of a sheriff/princess or so, similar to the psychic, if they are willing to help. I think such a deep class does not need two abilities, as his main ability already requires a lot of thought regarding target selection.</p>
<p>Lastly, how does it interact with the king? Can it purge the king and become neutral king?</p>

            <p>Zero surviveability skills and not occupy immune? This currently looks like a way way harder inquisitor that BD has no incentive to keep alive. It also kills a lot more than any other neutral classes. A game with 2 bishops and a NK will be over really fast. This usually will aid scum if you look at the distribution of holy classes, so the most redeeming factor I can see is that advanced BD players might fakeclaim being scum in the church to sabotage him and possible obtain his identity. BD fakeclaiming as scum would be a new mechanic that hasn’t been explored that much except in exceptional endgame situations with an evil king, who doesn’t know for sure who is evil.</p>
<p>I see no great use for Prophecy either.</p>
