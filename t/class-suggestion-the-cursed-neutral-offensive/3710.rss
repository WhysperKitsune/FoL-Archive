    <description>The Cursed [Neutral Offensive] [Unique]
Immune to conversion.
Objective: Curse all living players.

**Passive:** Never Die
Your curse gives you night death immunity.

**Passive:** Dread
Every three nights (so 3, 6, 9 etc) your curse will become unbearable, occupying you. Dread occupation can&#39;t be seen by the Observer.

**Day Ability:** Transfer Curse [2 uses]
Transfer a curse you&#39;ve placed on a dead player to a living player.

**Night Ability 1:** Curse [Infinite Uses]
The targeted player will be cursed (a status, not the class), occupying them on **Dread** nights. They will not be notified that they have been cursed at any point. Occupy immune classes will not be occupied, only being notified that someone tried to occupy them on **Dread** nights, but still count as cursed for the purposes of your objective.

**Night Ability 2:** Dread Transfer [2 uses, can only be used on Dread nights]
Occupy a target player by transferring your dread to them.</description>

            <p>Imagine the curse effecting occupy-immune classes, and (after the cursed has won) every 3 nights there’s just this <em>lull</em> where nobody can do anything, and nobody even knows</p>
