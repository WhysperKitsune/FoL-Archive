    <title>Suspended for 30 days</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suspended-for-30-days/75712</link>
    <description>What happened: Logged on to TOL to play and was met with a message that I was suspended for &quot;Ban Evasion + You were suspended for using the word &quot;fag&quot; 3 days ago&quot;.

I&#39;m actually very confused. I don&#39;t ever remember trying to evade a ban or calling someone else a &quot;fag&quot;. I really believe that there was a mistake in my ban. Also, the account name is DetectiveDeadpool. I don&#39;t actually remember doing anything that the ban accused me of.

The reason I&#39;m confused: I just don&#39;t call people a &quot;fag&quot;. Sure I get frustrated and call people dumb but I don&#39;t go any further. Also with the ban evasion thing, idk what i did.</description>

            <p>Looks like you were mistakenly caught by the system as an alt. Might be a result of using a vpn. Users have reported it happens a lot with vpn in Universities (don’t play at school, I guess). Locking the topic since Rezid has unbanned you.</p>
