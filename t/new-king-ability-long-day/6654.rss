    <title>New king ability &quot;Long day&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-king-ability-long-day/6654</link>
    <description>One of the thing that annoy me the most is that in alot of games you don&#39;t have the time to make the right decision such as who to vote out in the critical rounds of 3-9 players

When you don&#39;t execute on those rounds, alot of time you lose the majority of blue dragon and the game.

Anyone who plays Mafia, resistance or werewolf know how hard it to find a bad guy from a group of people that you can actully see, so guessing with 1 minute is almost impossible,


My suggestion, add a new option for the king for a long day,like 2-3 minutes longer, few charges, can only used when there are 10 or less players.

Then players will be able to use their brain and make the right decision, and not a random decision.</description>
