Chosen target will be pacified, occupying them if they tried to kill. You **will not** know if they were occupied. Infinite uses.

Night Ability 2: Song of Silence

Night Ability 2: Peaceful Resolution
Anyone who tries to kill a member of the Unseen will be occupied, ignoring immunity. (This includes Prince, or is that too op?) You **won&#39;t** know who visited, but you **will** know if someone was occupied for visiting. 1 use.</description>
