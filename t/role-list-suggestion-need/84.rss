    <title>Role list suggestion/need</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/role-list-suggestion-need/84</link>
    <description>I&#39;m unsure what the &quot;role list&quot; is, but here&#39;s one thing that should happen. 

Starters (can add more if needed, but three is good)

Mastermind 
Assassin 
Random Black Rose 


New thing being &quot;Random Black Rose&quot; . 

Random Black Rose will spawn a Black Rose member that is anything BESIDES a converted neutral. 

Converted Blue Dragon members can spawn in &quot;Random Black Rose&quot;. 

Random Black Rose will add suspicion as the Dragon members could be Black Rose. 

Also add Random Blue Dragon 

As it helps with claim space.</description>

            <p>Most of the time in ToS, unless you’re calling someone out on day 1/2 or they have another lead, the town is going to believe you as Sheriff. The only defense people have is that the accuser is lying or that they got framed. Honestly I think the ability is kinda pointless. If they execute the person and you’re right, then you’re pretty much revealed anyways. The odds of someone being framed early on are pretty slim, since the BR has to convert the Psychic. So we’ll probably end up replacing it with an ability that’s more useful.</p>

            <p>I still don’t think that’s a good idea that the sheriff can reveal himself as the sheriff. 1 of the things in ToS is that the mafia is able to lie about their role and have a chance to get to town to trust them. with throne of lies, there is no chance in hell that they can convince the blue dragon they are ino because sheriff is able to reveal</p>

            <p>Cult members can become King.</p>
<p>The Sheriff is a bit different from the Mayor in ToS, he actually has the ability to investigate people. I imagine that would cut down on people just making wild accusations once they reveal. Just in case, we could put a system in place so you can’t reveal until you find a BR member, or if X number of days have passed</p>

            <p>would it be possible for cult members to become the king in cult games. so if the king dies a cult member can take his place. and speaking of people leading the town the sheriff can also fall into that place with his Reveal Mustache people likely do what they have done in tos with mayor games</p>

            <p>The King is always revealed. Making it so he has the possibility of being neutral or BR prevents the issue ToS has, where the Mayor can control the game. I’ve had too many games ruined by troll Mayors and the people that follow them blindly. Also it will prevent the BR from having to focus on killing the King right off the bat, since he can be one of them.</p>

            <p>That sounds good. Speaking of which, there’s a point I’d like to clarfiy: is the King automatically revealed as the King whenever a game starts? And if there’s a chance of the King being Corrupt, won’t that make him unable to control the B.D., since nobody will trust him? (Of course he has other abilities but his leader power is weakened.)</p>

            <p>At the moment the King, Mastermind, Assassin, and Sheriff will be in every game. Also the Paladin will appear if the Cult spawns. In a full game of 15, there would likely be 2-4 neutrals, and the rest would be Blue Dragon. We haven’t decided on how exactly we’re going to do the class assignment.<br>
It might be pseudo-random, where at least one of every class type in the Blue Dragon exists, but there would be a cap on how many of a specific type show up. I’m not a big fan of Classic in ToS, I feel like it gives too much information to the Town. All Any is just too random, and it’s usually pretty hard to win as Town. I’d like to strike a balance between the two, so that you’re not seeing the same thing every game, but still have it so every faction has a good chance of winning.</p>

            <p>I’m curious about that also.<br>
Will the role list be something very random like:<br>
-King<br>
-Mastermind<br>
-Assassin<br>
-Random Blue Dragon or Neutral x8</p>
<p>or will it be more structured, like</p>
<p>-King<br>
-Offensive Blue Dragon<br>
-protective Blue Dragon<br>
etc…</p>
