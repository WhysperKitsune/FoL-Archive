    <title>Mindwarp - How does it work on different abilities?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mindwarp-how-does-it-work-on-different-abilities/51023</link>
    <description>How does mindwarp affect all abilities?  I was debd by a Drunk while trying to mindwarp a Sheriff, and the Drunk never complained so I assume my mindwarp didn&#39;t do anything?  I would like a table showing how Mindwarp affects all abilities so I know how to use it.</description>

            <p>would be most interesting to test things like, drunk redirecting an assasain into himself etc… be sure that gets covered in the test.</p>

            <p>I would think so. I haven’t actually tested it. We could try and setup a test game later though.</p>

            <p>Pretty sure that it inverts results for Drunk and Butler. It should if it doesn’t. I don’t think it effects phys though.</p>
