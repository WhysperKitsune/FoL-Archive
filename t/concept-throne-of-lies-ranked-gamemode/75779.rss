    <title>[CONCEPT] Throne of Lies Ranked Gamemode</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/concept-throne-of-lies-ranked-gamemode/75779</link>
    <description>_This is just a concept, if you dont like it, I would appreciate feedback on it_

**Ranked Gamemode**

I will not be talking about the &quot;Placement Matches&quot; or &quot;MMR Win/Loss&quot; because thats pretty much the programming side of it and thats the devs job, not mine.

**How gameplay changes in Ranked Mode**

**- Cult never spawns.** The main reason behind this, is to not get sacrifaced during a Ranked Match.
**- There is no Conversions.** As Unseen always spawns, the new composition works like this:

_1 King (Same Good-Evil Ratio)_
_1 Prince_
_2 Sheriffs_
_6 Random Blue Dragon, with at least 1 Healer (Physician or Chronomancer)_
_3 Unseen_
_1 Neutral Killer_
_2 Neutrals_

Unseen changes during Ranked Mode

- Assassin recieves no changes
- There is a 3rd Unseen spawn with a random Unseen member
- Mastermind loses both current night abilities, and wins another 2 supportive abilities. Mastermind keeps the Special/Investigative class pool.
- The replacement system for Unseen works the same as normal

*Mastermind New Abilities*

Darkness: Make a Unseen member not suspicious tonight. 2 Uses
Empower: Make a Unseen member occupy and redirect immune tonight. 2 Uses

Explanation: Since the Mastermind does not convert anyone on this gamemode, he takes the &quot;Support&quot; side of the team. His job is to help the Assassin and the Random 3rd member to win the game. Mastermind does not lose any of the passives or day abilities

*Neutrals, Neutral Killers, and others*

- All Neutral and Neutral Killers can spawn in this gamemode as normal.

Hope you like the concept, if you think it needs some changes, please let me know.</description>

            <p>Ok so first of all remember this. The Unseen is balanced around both A: Gaining members as you lose them. And B: 2 KPN</p>
<p>That first one makes the mastermind critical to the Unseen’s survival. The second puts a limitation on the how long the BD has before they lose, their ability’s work quickly and efficiently because the Scum are even faster.</p>
<p>Not to mention the effects conversion has on balance outside of the mathematical aspect. For example sheriff and court wizard have ability’s that only make sense given conversion. Not to mention that there is a difference between a Nightwatch and an Observer turned into a Nightwatch later. The observer is impossible to scumread early and is NS up to when he’s conversion.</p>
<p>And if you are trying to eliminate a player who is being protective then conversion is a viable plan B to bypass the protective’s.</p>
<p>So much of the game is balanced around Conversion. So if you remove it then whatever you are left with is NOT throne of lies</p>

            <p>Problems<br>
Every class would be so overpowered for example assassin gets killed by a knight defend and doesn’t even kill the knight like BG. Just imagine each clas interacting with this game mode<br>
Then imagine mass claim</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think something like this could work, although it would be a very different game without conversion, so much so that none of the strategies and metas from normal play would really work.</p>
<p>Side note, if competitive was ever implemented, I think elo/mmr should be calculated from the dynamic game-wide win-rate of the class you played as. Not perfect, but I think it’d be the most straightforward way to adapt to changing metas.</p>

            <p><em>This is just a concept, if you dont like it, I would appreciate feedback on it</em></p>
<p><strong>Ranked Gamemode</strong></p>
<p>I will not be talking about the “Placement Matches” or “MMR Win/Loss” because thats pretty much the programming side of it and thats the devs job, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>How gameplay changes in Ranked Mode</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Cult never spawns.</strong> The main reason behind this, is to not get sacrifaced during a Ranked Match.<br>
<strong>- There is no Conversions.</strong> As Unseen always spawns, the new composition works like this:</p>
<p><em>1 King (Same Good-Evil Ratio)</em><br>
<em>1 Prince</em><br>
<em>2 Sheriffs</em><br>
<em>6 Random Blue Dragon, with at least 1 Healer (Physician or Chronomancer)</em><br>
<em>3 Unseen</em><br>
<em>1 Neutral Killer</em><br>
<em>2 Neutrals</em></p>
<p>Unseen changes during Ranked Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin recieves no changes</li>
<li>There is a 3rd Unseen spawn with a random Unseen member</li>
<li>Mastermind loses both current night abilities, and wins another 2 supportive abilities. Mastermind keeps the Special/Investigative class pool.</li>
<li>The replacement system for Unseen works the same as normal</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mastermind New Abilities</em></p>
<p>Darkness: Make a Unseen member not suspicious tonight. 2 Uses<br>
Empower: Make a Unseen member occupy and redirect immune tonight. 2 Uses</p>
<p>Explanation: Since the Mastermind does not convert anyone on this gamemode, he takes the “Support” side of the team. His job is to help the Assassin and the Random 3rd member to win the game. Mastermind does not lose any of the passives or day abilities</p>
<p><em>Neutrals, Neutral Killers, and others</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All Neutral and Neutral Killers can spawn in this gamemode as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you like the concept, if you think it needs some changes, please let me know.</p>
