    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Physician</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-physician/38042</link>
    <description>_Dressed in his plague doctor garb, the Physician is a necessary part of life in Castle Adiart. While most organisations would have turned out him ages ago, the King is seemingly stuck in his debt._

_For one who dresses so darkly and recommends such strange things,his loyalty has been remarked upon as exemplary, and ever since he was hired none have died of disease, but whenever he stares at you with those inky black little holes in his mask, you get the vague impression that there&#39;s something more to him._

This is the first and last lore suggestion you&#39;ll ever get from me. Enjoy.</description>
