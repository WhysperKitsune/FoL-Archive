    <description>it&#39;s usually the case that if the Prince gets ring killed in the first few turns that 22nd will go onto lose . 
Unseen have protection against this with step up a season to mm .

Maybe if Prince dies in first 3 turns a random noble could take over his role . 
would also reduce the likelihood of Sir Gamedropper of the boring class .</description>
