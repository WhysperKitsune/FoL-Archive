    <title>Cult Buff Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cult-buff-suggestion/1469</link>
    <description>I posted this in discord and someone mentioned posting it here

If Cult hit a conversion immune target:

**1st instance:** Day ability disabled for target
**2nd instance:** Target dies (shows they suicide)

_**EDIT: &gt;(Hitting the same person twice does nothing)&lt;**_

If they hit **Prince**, prevents any jailing so that there is no chance of any Cult being jailed the following night.

If they hit **Paladin**, prevents any chance of their next target from receiving a blessing.

If they hit **Reaper**, prevents him from being able to use souls for Icy Touch or Gather Darkness.

If they hit **Fool**, can&#39;t Troll Box.

If they hit **Alchemist**, can&#39;t use Drug the Wine.

If they hit **Possessor**... well that just sucks.

To explain what happened:

1st Instance:

Prince:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams. You are too afraid to go to the cells tonight.&quot;_

Paladin:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams. Your blessing means nothing today.&quot;_

Reaper:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your thoughts. Corax ordered you to stand down today.&quot;_

Fool:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams but you laughed at him.&quot;_

Alch:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams and you forgot your Tar Potion.&quot;_

Possessor:
_&quot;Mithras attempted to convert you.&quot;_

2nd Instance:

Prince/Paladin:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams. You were scared to death.&quot;_

Reaper (with soul):
_&quot;Corax fought off Mithras.. for now.&quot;_

Reaper (without soul):
_&quot;Corax was unable to fight off Mithras.&quot;_

Fool:
_&quot;Mithras grew tired of your tricks.&quot;_

Alch:
_&quot;Mithras invaded your dreams and forced you to drink a Crimson Potion.&quot;_

Possessor:
_&quot;Mithras attempted to convert you.&quot;_

EDIT:
I would also suggest that the hitting of the immune would be reset if you convert the next night.

For example:

_N1: Hit Prince and disable day ability_
_N2: Convert successful_
_N3: Sacrifice to kill the first immune to conversion_
_N4: Hit Paladin and disable day ability_
_N5: Hit Alchemist and kill_

EDIT2:

Could possibly change the class name from

            <p>Yes, support this</p>
<p>The thing with the Cult at the moment is that if you can’t convert someone, you can’t kill them too and from a game I’ve seen where 2 Cult members were against the Prince, Paladin and King it was impossible for the Cult to do anything, even sacrifice the Cult to kill</p>
<p>Also if you look back on everything, BR have been given all of these buffs to its faction however it’s killing ability is even more powerful and effective than the Cult’s. Physician when converted to the Cult is figured out immediately, Princess can’t slap anymore to prove herself and yes even though they don’t have to survive that long with them being sacrificed to kill someone else, it doesn’t promote the strategy of converting lots of people into the Cult since the Cult members can be easily figured out</p>
<p>The Cult deserves this buff compared to BR since they are super weak and I wouldn’t mind buffing the faction even more</p>

            <p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>The way I see it, you need to be converting consistently, to be able to sacrifice. I would also suggest that the hitting of the immune would be reset if you convert the next night.</p>
<p>(Missed the part out of my post about not being able to hit the same person twice)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>N1: Hit Prince and disable day ability<br>
N2: Convert successful<br>
N3: Sacrifice to kill the first immune to conversion<br>
N4: Hit Paladin and disable day ability<br>
N5: Hit Alchemist and kill</p>
