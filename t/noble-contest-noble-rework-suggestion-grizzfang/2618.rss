    <description>## The Noble (Blue Dragon social)

**Day Ability 1:**
&quot;How dare you!&quot; - When you are accused and have to defend yourself, you can reveal yourself as the Noble. (1 use)

**Day Ability 2:**
Royal Blood (Passive) - You may step up as King.

**Night Ability 1:**
Secret messages - Tell your servant to relay your messages to your target. The next day you can whisper to your target without being detected by others and your target will not know who you are. (unlimited uses)

**Night Ability 2:**
Bodyguard - Prevent anyone from visiting you. (1-night cooldown, 2 uses)

## The Aristocrat (Unseen social)

**Day Ability 1:**
&quot;How dare you!&quot; - When you are accused and have to defend yourself, you can reveal yourself as the Noble. (1 use)

**Day Ability 2:**
Royal Blood (Passive) - You may step up as King.

**Night Ability 1:**
Secret messages - Tell your servant to relay your messages to your target. The next day you can whisper to your target without being detected by others and your target will not know who you are. (unlimited uses)

**Night Ability 2:**
Royal inquire - Have your servants spy on the king, revealing to you the king&#39;s allegiance. (1 use)

## The Lord (Cult social)

**Day Ability 1:**
&quot;How dare you!&quot; - When you are accused and have to defend yourself, you can reveal yourself as the Noble. (1 use)

**Day Ability 2:**
Royal Blood (Passive) - You may step up as King.

**Night Ability 1:**
Secret messages - Tell your servant to relay your messages to your target. The next day you can whisper to your target without being detected by others and your target will not know who you are. (unlimited uses)

**Night Ability 2:**
Coerce - Use your guard to &#39;gently&#39; force someone into the cult, converting them. (1 use)

## Notes:
**Lord** - The use of Coerce will be wasted if the target is unconvertable, but will not be wasted if you were occupied or your target could not be visited. 
**Lord** - You cannot Coerce above the four member cap that the cult has. If you and the cult leader both try to convert someone in the same night while having three cult members, then your target will not be converted if the cult leader&#39;s attempt is succesful. This wastes the use of Coerce, but in certain scenarios you might still want to do this.
**Genera**l - Because you let your servants do all the work, you will not be seen visiting others.
**General** - This class is now unique. (Multiple nobles plus roleblockers could make converting very hard for evil, a second aristocrat wouldn&#39;t be very helpful and two counts with coerce would probably be too strong.)

I think noble is just better off if there&#39;s no focus on multiple ones interacting with eachother and instead should simply be a social class that is different enough from psychic.</description>
