            <p>As the person said above, is there really any point in using “rise”? The only real upside to this is that you are able to heal yourself from bleeding. Also, most of the deaths will be investigatives, and how would the interaction with them go? Will you get their night results? Additionally, how would the prince or classes with 2 night abilities, including limited ones such as conduit/eradicate/2-for-1 be used/interact?</p>

            <p>Necromancer from Town Of Salem but now as Neutral Killer.</p>

<p>Conversion immunity isn’t considered as passive per se</p>

<p>Okay “Rise” is a cool ability but the question is: How often it’s going to be used and why would somebody use it more often than “Necromancy”?</p>

            <p>As far as I can see theres no reason not to use necromancy instead, seems very much like a serial killer. Pretty solid on the flavour though <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
