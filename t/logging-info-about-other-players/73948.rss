    <title>Logging Info About Other Players</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/logging-info-about-other-players/73948</link>
    <description>What kind of information about other players do you guys record in your logs? 

Here are the sorts of things I keep track of, in a format more or less like this:

- 2 - HUNTER wolfed n4
- 5 - occ imm
- 6 - ALCH confirmed by occ n2
- 7 - not prince
- 8 - KNIGHT cured n2
- 10 - NOBLE twinned d2
- 11 - not occ imm

I feel keeping track of players who cannot be Prince based on things they&#39;ve said or done (or things other players have said or done about them) is very useful since it often helps me figure out who Prince is before he actually claims.  And this is good info to have regardless of faction.

After watching SmoothTV I began erasing players from my logbook when they die, since it&#39;s redundant clutter.

Often you will see the court arguing over things that should not be up for debate (because publicly-available information has already settled the matter) and this is because people aren&#39;t keeping track of information as well as they could be.

Of course, at a certain point you run into diminishing returns by recording more info, but this is a balance that works for me.</description>

            <p>Sample of what my logs could look like at mid game or something<br>
(i delete the numbers of anyone dead, which is why some may be missing)</p>
<p>Page 1(Left side):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ErrorPlant | Butler<br>
N1: SW 2 | Success<br>
N2: SW 4 | Unable<br>
N3: SW 14 | Success<br>
D4: Poisoned<br>
N4: Party!<br>
N5:<br>
N6:<br>
N7:</p>
<p>King seems kinda passive and I find 14 suspicious<br>
Up 14 for logs if I die</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 2(Right side):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: King (Seems evil)<br>
2:<br>
4: Occ Imm – Prince?<br>
5:<br>
6: Sheriff<br>
7: Alchemist (5 BD)<br>
8:<br>
9: Me<br>
12:<br>
13: Pois D3<br>
14: --suspicious</p>

            <p>I generally put down stuff like that in a non abbreviated form, I also generally include a small note if I have found their content worthy of being read, and whether it pings me as town or scum motivated, <strong>particularly in regards to the kings reaction on day 1</strong></p>
<p>As a specific example, if a king says “I hate my life and this class.” or something pessimistic like that day one, you are more likely to have a GK on the stand.</p>
<p>Its small things like that that immediately make me note in my logs “BD lean on king, he didnt want to be his role so he’s probably GK.”</p>
<p>That tell was a lot more common in WKM than nowadays. I think a fair amount of people disagree with king’s night ability going back to allies. I thought safeguard was a very reasonable thing from GK, and it functioning as allies on EK served to let EK find his buddies as well as provide a way of scumreading king if they seem to be acting “informed”</p>

            <p>I have experimented with abbreviations like that, but in absence of a universally agreed-upon standard I feel it’s not worth teaching myself to use them since they would be useless to everyone else.</p>
<p>Maybe the community could come up with a standard.  I’m not aware that one exists.</p>

            <p>Try making a code in your logs for extra info<br>
Example:<br>
O = Occ immune<br>
6 - Hunter (O)</p>

            <p>What kind of information about other players do you guys record in your logs?</p>
<p>Here are the sorts of things I keep track of, in a format more or less like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 - HUNTER wolfed n4</li>
<li>5 - occ imm</li>
<li>6 - ALCH confirmed by occ n2</li>
<li>7 - not prince</li>
<li>8 - KNIGHT cured n2</li>
<li>10 - NOBLE twinned d2</li>
<li>11 - not occ imm</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel keeping track of players who cannot be Prince based on things they’ve said or done (or things other players have said or done about them) is very useful since it often helps me figure out who Prince is before he actually claims.  And this is good info to have regardless of faction.</p>
<p>After watching SmoothTV I began erasing players from my logbook when they die, since it’s redundant clutter.</p>
<p>Often you will see the court arguing over things that should not be up for debate (because publicly-available information has already settled the matter) and this is because people aren’t keeping track of information as well as they could be.</p>
<p>Of course, at a certain point you run into diminishing returns by recording more info, but this is a balance that works for me.</p>
