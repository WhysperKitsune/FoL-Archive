    <title>[Misc] [Interest Check] Two Rooms and a Boom</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/misc-interest-check-two-rooms-and-a-boom/82346</link>
    <description>Title. I&#39;m considering queueing this as it&#39;s one of my favorites, but i want to try to gauge interest first.

There are something like 110 possible roles in the game, and the game plays anywhere between 11 and 30 players. The roles that are in the game at the start will be public knowledge, but who gets what will be randomized.

I&#39;m also seeking a co-host, as usual.

Please let me know if you have any questions / if this might seem interesting / what roles you might want to play. Thank you!

Here is the relevant documentation:

            <p>Despite that it seems there was opposition…<br>
I have played this game online and in person before and find it to be very enjoyable.<br>
I have also played mafia / FM irl too and find it to be <em>quite</em> different to say the least.</p>

<p>sorry<br>
You never said this verbally before, that is true<br>
But the way you started the misc queue by leaving things as they were implied that things were still as they were</p>
<p>and that description is how things have been and still are</p>

            <ol>
<li>this game is a good deal more complicated than airlock so i figured it was probably a good idea to give players a month plus before signups will post for this thing for me to help explain how it works and gather interest (since although it plays 11-30, it’s kind of better the more players it has).</li>
<li>i didn’t know until after i created this thread that each user may only have one misc in the queue max at a time</li>

<p>if hosting miscs becomes more popular / iffy, then a review process maybe should be added for them</p>

            <p>I have my own problems with it, and that’s why I’m not saying it should be taken down<br>
because they’re my problems</p>
<p>it just seems disingenuous</p>

            <p>i mean</p>
<p>it was dat’s decision to make all deathless / flipless and deductive / adventure but distinctively not FoL / SFoL / Standard / Vanilla games into miscs that did not have to be reviewed because of the low interest level in hosting them.</p>
<p>I imagine things might change if hosting miscs became more popular, but for now I agree with him</p>
<p>miscs have never been hindered by the hosting status of FM games here, only each other</p>

            <p>I just wanted to say no</p>
<p>But actual answer<br>
All these games feel like basically fm that doesn’t have to go through main queue<br>
that feels…a bit unreasonable?</p>

            <p>Title. I’m considering queueing this as it’s one of my favorites, but i want to try to gauge interest first.</p>
<p>There are something like 110 possible roles in the game, and the game plays anywhere between 11 and 30 players. The roles that are in the game at the start will be public knowledge, but who gets what will be randomized.</p>
<p>I’m also seeking a co-host, as usual.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions / if this might seem interesting / what roles you might want to play. Thank you!</p>
<p>Here is the relevant documentation:</p>
