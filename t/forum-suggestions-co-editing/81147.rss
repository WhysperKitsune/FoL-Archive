    <description>Well clearly I see a good use for this, making it so you can enable certain people to edit topics would be great so you can make people like Co-Hosts edit the OP for your FM game or something. Just a suggestion.</description>

            <p>it can probably be changed but i’d imagine there’s a good chance that the mods+ don’t really want everybody to make their posts wikis?</p>
<p>like i just edited into my last reply, i think giving out TL3 to hosts would be a good solution</p>

            <p>if people vandalize a wiki it’ll be obvious who it was, since it shows who edited what in them</p>
<p>the main problem with wikis is that only trust level 3 people can wiki their own posts, so if you’re not TR3 (which is rarely, if ever given out nowadays) you need to ask a forum mod. luckily we have some pretty active forum mods so it’s only a minor inconvenience</p>
<p>i think giving people who semi regularly host games TR3 would be good, making the OP for FoL26 and SFoL58 (games i cohosted) a wiki made both games significantly easier for me and the main host to work together on</p>

            <p>Turning OPs into Wiki works. I don’t think there is much risk for vandalism on this site to make it not viable.</p>
