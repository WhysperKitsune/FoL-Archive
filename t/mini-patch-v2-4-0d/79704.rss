____________________

## v2.4.0d

&gt; Hotfixes

* Neutrals should now win without NK and display properly as winning (preventing stalemates, causing the game to never end - and losses that should be wins).
* Chinese region is now split when you select the locale (Chinese friends may now queue up normally -- no need for private games! Use Discord for initial population gathering since it will start low).
* Fixed some awkward English&lt;&gt;Chinese swapping button bugs that would sometimes only *partially* switch the locale.
* Fixed weirdness with day abilities when you have 2 abilities (such as being able to still use Reaper abils after using them which would only drain the # of charges). Probably fixed more than just Reaper.
* Should no longer display Neuts being Psycho King when they&#39;re not when revealed as dead.

&gt; Quality of Life

* Discord rich presence now shows your final class name and the portrait of that class when you&#39;re at the end screen.
* Added memo regarding King&#39;s Decide Fate about eating Hunter Retribution arrow. This may change later. I added it @ Decide Fate, but will probably move it to Retribution next patch.
* You can now see which region the room is hosting at the top of lobby rooms.</description>
