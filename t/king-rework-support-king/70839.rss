    <title>King rework (support King)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-rework-support-king/70839</link>
    <description>I made a King rework earlier today and people didn’t seem to like having oe ability with the king. People also didn’t understand the concept. So this concept is much simpler 


&gt;# [color=Grey]King[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Passive: tenacity** - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing.**[same passive as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Passive: loyalty** - if you are the starting good king and is executed by the court then the court will not be able to vote anyone up for treason tomorrow. **[same passive as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 1: Decide fate -** instantly exe or pardon the player on trial, this will veto any votes that have been made. **(_1 use_)** **[same ability as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 2: Double duty** - have a player work two shifts tonight, allowing them to target up the two players with any night ability that allows them to visit a player (Meaning classes like Noble can’t use _maid spy_ on two people, because that doesn’t make sense). **(_4 uses_**)
&gt;
&gt; Note: 
&gt;- This ability does not effect ANY unique classes. The King will not know if this has effected them or not. _
&gt;
&gt;- _the player effected by this can also choose to only pick one person that night if they choose so_
&gt;
&gt;- If the player is unique, he will get a message saying  _“The King has requested you to do a double shift but you denied it”_ 
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 1:Royal finger** - The King&#39;s next vote for treason will count twice._**(infinite uses)**_ **[same ability as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2 - Royal Guards** - send a guard to protect a player, can protect yourself. (Starting king has 5 and any other king has 3)</description>

            <p>The main (only?) difference is Double Duty, which is both highly confirmable and quite useless for Evil King. You can never use it on evils either, because BD will be like, who did you empower? Owhhh EXE KING!</p>

            <p>Yes if you’re evil king and know who assassin is but if you’re good king you wouldn’t just randomly use this</p>
