    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Arsonist</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-arsonist/69520</link>
    <description>Here is my totally original class suggestion :yum:  Just buffed though. 

&gt; # [color=gray] The Pyromaniac [/color]
&gt; **[color=gray] Neutral Killer [/color]**  
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Resolve)** You are immune to death, occupation and target changing at night.
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Douse)** - Douse someone in gasoline. (3 Uses)
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (Douse)** - Douse someone in gasoline. (Infinite Uses) 
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (Ignite)** - Select any or all doused players you want, and kill them.  Bypasses everything. (Infinite Uses) 
&gt;
&gt; **Goal:** *Defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen/Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

For quality of life, doused players will be marked from your perspective similar to how the targets of a Scorned are (with an X by their name).</description>

            <p>Wow I’m glad you put so much time into critiquing my class suggestion <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I will try to summarize your criticisms.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Marksman’s investigative ability is intended to narrow a player’s class type over 3 days, but in effect does it in merely 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is interesting, I did not realize that.  Passing classes through these 3 filters works as intended for some classes, but for other classes it reveals the exact class type on the 2nd day.  I will have to rework this ability big time!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Scope Out is overpowered.</li>
</ol>
<p>I agree.  I don’t know what to replace it with at the moment though.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Track is basically a “Tell Unseen which player is the Neutral Killer” ability.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re completely right.  I will have to replace this also haha.</p>
<p>Thanks for your very helpful post, I will have to edit the thread I made for these classes tomorrow <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>What I think of Marksmen:</p>
<p>I feel like marksmen could be potentially (a bit) overpowered. The reason I think this is as stated…the ability Scrutinize. As said in the mentioned ability, it is a unique ability that tracks down info about the player it’s on. So, according to the “1 Day: Narrow down their class type to one of three possibilities (Killer/Offensive/Support or Special/Investigative/Social).”…you would be able to shorten the classes to three options, correct? Ok, now what if that class came to be either Support/Social? They would show up in one or the other, but you wouldn’t know that yet, right? Now, let’s say 2 Days come around. “2 Days: Narrow down their class type to one of two possibilities.” (for reference, likely similar to princess, could be wrong). This is what worries me. If the person was support/social, the class would already be found due to the fact if the first night, making the third day relatively useless as you know the exact class type. So, let’s say (for the sake of an example), the person you decided to track was a physician. After day one, it would be done to Killer/Offensive/Support, right? After day 2, following the investigative, similar to the princess, it would show up as Support/Social. Huh, how can that be possible only after two nights worth. It can be easily deduced that person’s class is Support. How is this a bit OP, you may ask. Well, evil normally have to either stick to their role or change their claim after being converted. The latter will have a much more difficult time as this role will pick up on the bullshit very easily for specifically Support/Social classes (seems legit). Those stuck in the former will likely not be found out immediately but can be screwed late game. The Night Ability (Headshot) seems somewhat situational. Somewhat. It can easily be a game changer as using this ability would be extremely good for mid/late game when everyone’s actions are more predictable and there are claims to be known (or you could scumread). However, at the cost of disabling your passive, which I find very interesting (idk how that would work out). The passive Ghillie Suit seems very interesting as it basically makes the class appear like an alch, very interesting and could even try pulling off a bullshit alch claim in the late game if claim wasn’t given already to try (unlikely) and use the headshot ability. The fact that you seem unconvertable will A.Make Unseen attack you. (Cause unconverted seems like NK) or B.Make Unseen think you are an alch. (Cause NK dead or some other reason).</p>
<p>What I think of The Scout:</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the Unseen converted. The passive camoflauge seems very good overall, making it very good for a early game convert. The day scope out, oh dear…XD. It seems extremely good for claiming other classes if they don’t want to claim marksmen. (Can claim princess and be close to confirmed, can claim sheriff and bs surv someone to stir chaos.) Scope Out just seems like a better version of the Probe from sheriff and has infinite uses (pls debuff to certain amount).  As for the Night Ability Track…idk how this can be put into practice due to people dead, then logs, it just doesn’t seem that useful to use on past nights as it just misses out on more important things in mind (unless someone got attack my NK or something, in that case winning as NK is several times more difficult.) I would probably use it as if it were observer to claim obs to BD if not claimed princess/sheriff already. As for, may be used on dead players, a majority of dead players logs will be true, especially for BD, I would find this useful only on reaper games, which in that case reaper is 100% fucked or for some sort of strange event.</p>
<p>I would say marksmen would be a good claim for mastermind (100% easier to claim then straight-out obs) but not as good as other potential claims, though I can see this working. Overall, a solid BD role that gets results over time and very good for mid/late game.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a mess sorry.</p>

<p>I think Marksman would be a great fake claim for Mastermind.  What do you think?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>This is a bit overpowered as a day ability. replace it with something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I don’t think it’s overpowered is because if you ignite that night, it’s just a single kill that night.  And if you douse that night, you have to wait until the next night to attack, which is risking killing someone who’s already getting killed anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a bit weak. It should occupy them as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand how you can call night douse too weak but day douse too strong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is still a bit weak. It should bypass everything. It should also not count as visiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiding visits is Sorcerer’s niche, disguising visits is Possessor’s gimmick.  If someone is going to call out Pyro for suspicious visits then he should burn them.</p>

            <p>Oh lol.  I meant that it was overpowered as both a day and night ability, but it’s weak by itself</p>
