    <description>**[Throne of Lies (ToL)](http://www.ThroneOfLies.com) is the online game of deceit** inspired by the [Werewolf/Mafia](http://throneofli.es/mafia-werewolf) - a game genre that may seem new to you, but has actually been around since 1986! Use intuition and deduction to determine friend from foe and rise your alliance to the throne!

**ABOUT**
With 8 to 16 players per match, each round has only a short duration of time to make split-second decisions, based on deductive clues obtained from both abilities and the social aspect of the game, where anytime within this period, players may vote to determine if a player is guilty of treason, a crime generally punishable by death, executed by the accuser, with execution abilities tied to the player&#39;s equipped weapon. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szqc5ZRSNwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1

Players, including a king (randomly selected, that can be either good or evil), all having anonymous class roles and alliances, will have limited time to gather and share evidence and decide who is or is not suspicious, ultimately deciding who to slay or defend at night when you are alone. 

During the day, you can spread hearsay that x player is x role, inspiring others to believe you for the greater good or evil. During this time, players can be executed for treason by the accusing player via vote or thrown in the dungeon by order of the King. There are also neutral alliances to act as wildcards during these efforts. When a king is slain, a new King rises, based off a nomination effort. 

At night, the good faction will use defensive and investigative skills to gain insight on who may be what role, while the bad faction will murder others and use skills to twist the truth to make the good guys look guilty.

The players’ ultimate goal for your alliance (good or evil), is to eliminate all opposing alliances, with the exception of neutral alliances, that may have their own goals or bottom-feed off the weaker alliance. 

**UNIQUE POINTS** 
+ Full 3D, DirectX 11 graphics, 64-bit
+ Individual rooms at night, customized to your role.
+ We believe death shouldn&#39;t be boring! Unique Death/ghost system. 
+ Unique social interactions. 
+ Your deduction skills are just as useful as skills and abilities. 
+ Unlock and equip components: not just full skins.
+ 16 players online interrogation system. 
+ Trial and Treason system. 
+ Players found guilty of treason will be executed by accuser.
+ Weapon components are directly tied to execution abilities.
+ Think-Outside-of-the-Box gameplay.
