    <title>Throne of lies Survey For the state of the game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/throne-of-lies-survey-for-the-state-of-the-game/73804</link>
    <description>Just a quick survey to see what players think about the current state of the game, will add more if you want?

P.S. Do not put your results in the comments I want players to choose based on their own opinion alone, but if you want to say how bad the survey is then you can ;)
