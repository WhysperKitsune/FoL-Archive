    <title>The Witch BD Special, The Conjurer Unseen Special</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-witch-bd-special-the-conjurer-unseen-special/76414</link>
    <description>I kinda had a strange idea, maybe I just love old alch, with 4 potions. 
A reason why I suggest some class, Is Because, I believe the only I think multiple evil need more claim space, especially Mastermind. 

So here my idea
&gt; # [color=Blue]Witch[/color]
&gt; **[color=Blue]Blue Dragon Special[/color]**
** (Day)** -   Magic Shield. You will be protected from attacks tonight, you won&#39;t be notified someone tried to attack you (2 uses)
** (Night)** - Cast Spell. Choose a spell to cast on your target
Cast Spell - Paralysis-  Occupy a player (2 uses) 
Cast Spell - Revelation - Reveal a player&#39;s class type, Specials will appear as Invest (2 uses) 
Cast Spell - Protection -  Make a player immune to death  (2 uses) 
Cast Spell - Revitalize -  heal a player  (2 uses) 

Defeat the Unseen, the Cult, along with any neutrals who seek to harm you. 

Become 
&gt; # [color=Purple]Conjurer[/color]
&gt; **[color=Purple]Unseen Special[/color]**
** (Night)** - Cast Spell. Choose a spell to cast on your target
Cast Spell - Dark protection- Make an unseen member, immune to death and investigation tonight (2 use) 
Cast Spell - Revelation-  Reveal a player class (2 use) 
Cast Spell - Illusion-  Occupy a Player (2 use) 
Cast Spell - Death Curse - Make a player&#39;s death unhealable tonight. (1 use) 

Defeat the Blue Dragon along with any neutrals who seek to harm you. 

For cult game, become the Apostle. 
So, what do you guys, think ? 
yeah, I know its probably a bad idea.</description>

            <p>Updated<br>
I Gave the Conjurer the ability to occupy someone.<br>

            <p>Change it as bit… As I believe the observer logs can be a bit too hard to fake for anyone who wish to fake claim it.<br>
Remove conversion immunity<br>
And yeah, its supposed to be a jack of all trades. someone who can do anything. . But unlike the Alch, they aint neutral.<br>
Well. except killing</p>

</aside>
<p>This is also unnecessarily making it confirmable, whereas the rest could still be fakeclaimed to a degree. It’s also strong enough that it doesn’t need the added confirmability. For the rest it’s a solid Jack of All Trades.</p>

            <p>I’d say protection is the only solid objection I have with it. Bottom line is we are already at capacity for conversion immunity. We’ve seen what happens when it gets raised a while ago. (long and short of it, failing to convert many nights in a row, isn’t fun).</p>
