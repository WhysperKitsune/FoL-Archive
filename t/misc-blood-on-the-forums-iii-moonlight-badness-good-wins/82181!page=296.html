          <p>Oh yeah</p>
<p>With it being revealed now that <a class="mention" href="../../u/tangeld.html">@Tangeld</a>  is stepping down as head host of the Blood on the Forums Franchise, I want to offer the following heartfelt gratitude to her.</p>
<p>I’m unimaginably grateful that you brought BotF here last November. That alerted me to the existence of clocktower (which I wasn’t aware of before), which in turn led me to 1) Pre-order the official game, which I’m excited for, 2) Learn about DeceptaCon, which was affiliated with Clocktower and in the same city that I was living in at the time, helping me to develop a bunch of new friendships I never would have had without clocktower, 3) Learn about the existence of Airlock, which was run at DeceptaCon and I never would have known about without that event, and 4) Inspired me to spend ~50 hours designing elements for and crafting a comprehensive homebrewed grimoire (including all released scripts / roles and all unreleased roles that were known in early March of this year) to give to a great friend from marching band in a sub-group of the marching band that loved social deduction games, that will hopefully help me to stay connected to that group for a very long time.</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for deciding to bring clocktower here to the forums. I never would have otherwise known about it, or several other really positive things that resulted from the knowledge of its existence, and I’m really, really happy about that.</p>

          <p>few notes coming from the Demon - kinda want to explain what ive been thinking through the game</p>
<details>
<summary>
Theres no scumchat to look at, gonna walk through some of my thoughts through the game. I mainly am rewriting what I wrote in my classcard</summary>
<details>
<summary>
Early game</summary>
<p>D1/N1/N2 - got my card, was hyped, and I was thinking that i would be able to fake perspective well but not tone. I believe I was wrong, I think I got my tone well but perspective worse</p>
<p>I had my plan to single kill -&gt; no kill -&gt; triple kill all the way back this earlier to avoid courtiers. I, unfortunately, did not hit Amelia during any of this. I also(to go with my Sailor claim) intended to push whoever I claimed to occ because I was gonna say ‘there was a nokill, mustve been a malfunction’</p>
<p>Also, when i looked back at myself even ~2h in I considered myself incredibly scummy. As I put it in classcard - I felt boxed in, and nobody even remotely SRd me.</p>
<p>I did some planning with numbers, but then ditched them when I felt like I wanted to bus Magnus. Magnus was only whispering scum and I was afraid to get caught in that web, and there were a few posts I knew I could push on. I just kinda have an urge to bus and Magnus was the perfect candidate for me. I never did this till later. though.</p>
<p>I killed App n2 because he was really obviously town and I feared his reads. I tried to signal to oB to kill N so then we could take his read on Amelia and push it, but oB feared protectives and went to SDA, which still got us a mislynch.</p>
<p>also I actually didnt know how the voting system worked and alot of the game worked - that was legit</p>

<summary>
Full N2 thought process and where from there</summary>
<p>During the first half of the game but kinda in, I intended to make a readslist. I then wondered where Id put the people I knew were town and the people that I knew were scum</p>
<p>Turns out thats a bit of a problem when I want to pocket a mass amount of people at the same time as bussing scum - my reads are probably better when Im scum</p>
<p>Winterfall was MM though, so I wanted them around. oB I would rather to be with, but I could more or less go either way and Magnus wouldnt be a bad bus, particularly if they targeted themself</p>
<p>there was an absurd amount of lowposters aswell, so it would be gamer if I just kept pushing those and pocketing everyone that posts alot</p>
<p>So here we had it. Lets make a PoE of people to push. Just put it together and let it do the work for you.</p>
<p>Amelia/gorta/Magnus</p>
<p>I woulda actually went through with it if it wasnt for Arete - SFoL 61.5, Arete said CRich did ‘the rule of threes’ and I was about to walk into that trap. So gamer plan? Just make the 3 man PoE all town</p>
<p>gorta/Amelia/SDA(this particularly was N2), my plan was to take a card out of Ans’ book - push alot of town, claim to not like PoE, push it anyway, win</p>
<p>thanks to SDA nothing went like that but w/e</p>
<p>I wanted to pocket N and Amelia both aswell so I was gonna call em TvT at one point</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I was around when thread was dead. I let it stay that way. At first I would revive it, thinking like Marshal in ToS 2 but then I decided ‘ya know what, im not doing this’ and made the conscious choice to deepwolf instead of powerwolf.</p>
<p>This was the single worst strategic decision I made all game, though it made the game easier for me.</p>
<p>its why I was top of Po PoE, not Amelia. Because if I had that thread control I very well mightve been able to shove my way out of it.</p>
<p>besides that, I wanted to tunnel Italy. If they claimed literally anything besides Innkeeper, I wouldve really pushed for their death, but I think most people just kinda accepted it, so bruh. I literally - here lemme grab this</p>
<details>
<summary>
Perfect foolproof way to win</summary>
<p>nom Italy tomorrow and we that good</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>alright</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinker</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Demon</li>
</ul>
<p>Gossip kill tonight -&gt; mislynch -&gt; triple kill -&gt; Grandmother dies</p>
<ul>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Minion</li>
<li>Demon</li>
</ul>
<p>gg, perfect game</p>
<p>this assumes Tinker doesnt die(which would also trigger GF), nobody is successfully protected, Gossip kills a Good, Good is lynched tomorrow and I dont malfunction.</p>
</details>
<p>See, almost every gossip statement was false so I expected a nightkill. Unfortunately, I happened to kill the gossip n1, so that went wrong and so did alot of the rest of it.</p>

<summary>
From Leafia's death till the end</summary>
<p>I didn’t realize Leafia would actually die, so it was a hard hitter for me</p>
<p>like, I legitimately thought we had game in the bag there and then it started slipping, getting farther from just out of reach…</p>
<p>So now time to pick who to kill. Since a minion died, I effectively have to decide whether I want to prove oB or not. I was thinking ‘just no action and triple the night after’ but that wasnt an option. I could kill 3 dead players and make it look like that, but it would still take another night of charging.</p>
<p>so I made a few more gamer plans that the courtier messed up - I wont keep going into those</p>
<p>I killed Italy, obviously, but my other two targets were legitimately unsure for me. I guessed Italy would sit on the same people again(I was right) so I attacked N(Nobody bothered to look back on their read on Amelia, and turned out not to matter) and gorta because who else(also chance of being a power role)</p>
<p>Then Arete whispers me - see, to support my Sailor claim, I claimed Professor to Arete. Now I went to claim Sailor - only to not realize Sailor acts n1. So then I scumslip p hard, my chest beats at the speed of light, I then whisper Zone, <em>claim that I told him my n1 action earlier when I didnt, so if he went back and checked it woulda been gg right there,</em> and then Zone and Arete whisper a bunch and I thought Zone really checked</p>
<p>he didnt</p>
<p>At this point, or maybe a bit earlier, I forget, Zone calls me a sheep. Thats not my normal playstyle at all though - im usually tunneling towncore. So there I was, knowing I had to flip my reads, but, uh, there was no towncore to tunnel. N was more or less out of towncore at this point, Zone was obvious town and so I didnt think I had any good tunnel targets, so I just kinda dropped this, but I was hyper aware</p>
<p>Anyway I wanted to hard bus Magnus, wrote up a big wallpost, then all the sudden everyone just kinda wants Magnus dead. Like, nobody needed any convincing this game, alot of people just kinda accepted lynches</p>
<p>Anyway, the Leafia death meant I was going to have to make it to endgame and Magnus’ meant that I wasnt going anywhere but to kil off minions</p>
<p>then the game got mech solved so that wasnt great(nearly mech solved, only me/amelia were the only non-proven). What I didnt realize is that when the courtier dies I can attack again. This fact is literally why I didnt just throw everything on the floor right there. I thought Id have to survive 3 days, which would be p much impossible, but when I realized if they got lynched I won <em>that</em> was pog.</p>
<p>then oB killed Amelia</p>
<p>I kinda died inside when that happened. Like, enough time was wearing on me and that really nailed the coffin. Not much to say about it, the game ended how it did.</p>
</details>
<hr>
<p>also shoutout to oB for being a pog teamate</p>
<p>MVP of scum</p>
<p>(that isnt meant to be ironic, besides that kill at the end he was legitimately the best of us)</p>
</details>
<p>I think thats all I wanted to say</p>
