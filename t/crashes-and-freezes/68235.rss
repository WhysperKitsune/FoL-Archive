    <title>Crashes and Freezes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/crashes-and-freezes/68235</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Game keeps freezing and crashing in my laptop. I have lowered the specs and checked if everything was up to date and it is. But the game just chooses a moment to freeze or crash and I cant play anymore.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I need a solution, either a way to get back or a way to stop this from happening, worst part is that I cant upload the proofs of it, other than this image, cause I&#39;m new at the forum.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Join a Lobby
2. Choose a Name
3. Start Game
4. Play 
5. Crashes or Freezes at a random moment or I can play the whole game, its one or the other

            <p>Also maybe the devs don’t want you to play the game. Or maybe it is just “Nature’s Power” (your name).</p>
<p>Real Note: maybe your laptop is not strong enough to handle the game. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/question.png?v=9" title=":question:" class="emoji" alt=":question:"></p>
