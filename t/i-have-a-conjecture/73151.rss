    <title>I have a conjecture</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-have-a-conjecture/73151</link>
    <description>For every situation where someone is lynched for being scum where the proof is confirmed by 3 or less players (meaning not a scum read) there is a corresponding situation where a BD is misslynched as a result of tampering or fake claiming

Examples

Initial:

Assassin&#39;s butler fake claim fails to occupy player X and gets lynched.

Corresponding:

Butler occupies player X who claims he wasn&#39;t occupied and the butler is lynched

Initial:

Sheriff finds X as Unseen and they lynch him

Corresponding:

Unseen claims sheriff who found X as unseen and they lynch him

Initial:

There are 3 dead Hunter&#39;s (2 defiles and a real one) and a Hunter fake claim is lynched

Corresponding:

There are 3 dead Hunter&#39;s (2 possessor jumps and a defile) and a real Hunter is lynched

If there is 4 or more people accusing the same person then there are situations where that person MUST be scum. Not every example of 4 or more people mean they are scum but 4 is the minimum for someone uninvolved to potentially be 100% sure depending on the situation. 

This only applies to a lynch and not to vig kills such as Knight&#39;s, Hunter&#39;s and Prince&#39;s</description>

            <p>Also the corresponding situation does not always benefit scum although it usually does.</p>
<p>Scum reads don’t qualify because everyone has access to them (when that isn’t true this applies) meaning it’s more than 3 people. Policy lynches usually mean no one has proof and thus have a corresponding mislynch</p>
