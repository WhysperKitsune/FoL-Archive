    <title>Buff for the king</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/buff-for-the-king/2836</link>
    <description>The king isn&#39;t really that important of a class. He isn&#39;t hard to kill, he only gets 2 votes in one trial per day, etc.

The following buffs would give king the power he needed to actually feel like a menace.

---------------------------
**Butler poison**
Unless the neutral king has voted guilty on a blue dragon member that was subsequently executed (or decided the fate of a cult/unseen member who died later) butler should die from guilt after poisoning the neutral king.

**Royal finger**
It becomes a passive

If whoever the king is accusing is only one vote away from being on trial, the player will be put on trial. This only works if the king was the first accuser (similar to how it is determined with hunter&#39;s retribution). This will only activate once per day.

this is a sub of royal finger. King would have a 2 use night ability that made _all_ his/her accusations count as 2 the next day.

**Death immunity**
death immunity nights 1-3. This would make it harder to be killed later on in the game, as you wouldn&#39;t have wasted any guards.


----------------

The king should be a class that has more vote power and is harder to assassinate. Keep in mind that unseen can still poison him if the physician is dead, so it not impossible.</description>

<p>King shouldn’t be immune to death at any point, there’s a reason he has the ability to guard himself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason he would be immune is so he can save his guards. This way, killing the king becomes more of a big deal, as it should. The king should be a large part of the game, seeing as he is a <em>king</em> but it just isn’t.</p>

<p>okay, maybe it could be changed so that, if a neutral king directly causes the death of, lets say 2 evils via trial and royal finger/decide fate, and that way the neutral king is a king that helped bd.</p>

<p>it was already a mechanic for butler to die from poisoning good <strong>or</strong> neutral king, he was only improving so that the butler doesnt die from guilt from a neutral king if the neutral king directly causes a bd’s death, or directly causes the survival of an evil</p>

<p>I like this too! It just makes sense and promotes smart gameplay. If you are evil or BD you shouldn’t kill the king the first 3 nights… would be a waste and a shot in the dark on what his faction is, and if you REALLY want to kill him… then go for it on night 4.<br>
It feels right that you cant vote up the king the first 3 days… AND cant poison him as a Butler… so it would only make sense that you cant kill him till then either.</p>

<p>This is great too! I am going to start brainstorming on what things you could do for this… but I agree, it would have to be VERY subtle… so that people couldn’t find out their alignment and lead to his lynching.</p>
<p>The king is one of the bigger concepts that makes this game unique and I’d love to see these implemented in whatever way the Devs see fit. I dont know what changes would make the king “too strong”.</p>

            <p>My suggestion would be to give a different buff to good/evil king and neutral king. Because their goals are a little bit different.</p>
<p>I suggest to remove the 1-day cooldown from Royal finger for good/evil kings and give neutral king 1 more guard.</p>
<p>These changes are subtle and will it’s unlikely that someone will deduce which king the first king is based on this.</p>

            <p>The king isn’t really that important of a class. He isn’t hard to kill, he only gets 2 votes in one trial per day, etc.</p>
<p>The following buffs would give king the power he needed to actually feel like a menace.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Butler poison</strong><br>
Unless the neutral king has voted guilty on a blue dragon member that was subsequently executed (or decided the fate of a cult/unseen member who died later) butler should die from guilt after poisoning the neutral king.</p>
<p><strong>Royal finger</strong><br>
It becomes a passive</p>
<p>If whoever the king is accusing is only one vote away from being on trial, the player will be put on trial. This only works if the king was the first accuser (similar to how it is determined with hunter’s retribution). This will only activate once per day.</p>
<p>this is a sub of royal finger. King would have a 2 use night ability that made <em>all</em> his/her accusations count as 2 the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Death immunity</strong><br>
death immunity nights 1-3. This would make it harder to be killed later on in the game, as you wouldn’t have wasted any guards.</p>
<hr>
<p>The king should be a class that has more vote power and is harder to assassinate. Keep in mind that unseen can still poison him if the physician is dead, so it not impossible.</p>
