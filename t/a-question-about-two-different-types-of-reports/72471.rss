    <title>A question about two different types of reports?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-question-about-two-different-types-of-reports/72471</link>
    <description>In my GDPR log, I read the thing and I spotted two different things. (Apologies if this was already asked.)

&quot;JusticeNumReportsRecieved and statsReportsReceivedDeprecated&quot;

What is the difference between those two?

            <p>reports received = whether guilty or not. We can then calculate your games to reports ratio. While doing reports, we’ll eventually use this to raise priority levels based on one’s “troll potential” (<strong>games:reports</strong> ratio)</p>
<p>Anything that says deprecated = doesn’t matter, it’s not tracked anymore. We switched the way we tracked this type of stat (technical crap - we count from arr[] instead of aggregation++)</p>

            <p>I’m going to guess total reports and reports you were found guilty in based on the definitions but <a class="mention" href="/u/%C3%AD42-xblade">@í42-Xblade</a> can likely give a definitive answer.</p>
