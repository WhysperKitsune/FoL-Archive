my n1 thoughts</summary>
<p>I have to say I am far too used to the 48/24 format. If I knew it was 36 I would have been here (I was off in youtube land thinking I had extra time). It is a relief seeing a wolf flip and I know I will likely be on the chopping block tomorrow, but I won’t let that happen. I likely get death tunneled by Alice tomorrow, but it is what it is. I am certain that Arete is town here (don’t let me down) from the CFD. I also think at the same time that Alice acting like she wanted Wazza dead, voting Wazza, moving to Troch, not pushing Wazza harder, barely pushing Troch, and then saying she wanted to wagon me d2 over Wazza is kind of sus. I know I had no interaction with Wazza, but quite frankley I had no idea Wazza was playing besides seeing his name on the playerlist. I also don’t like how Troch hesitated on the vote (same with Mole), but I will have to give them both an independent ISO. It does kind of look like Wazza was coaching Troch a bit during d1 and it also kind of looks like Wazza was signaling to Alice, which makes me think she might not be a wolf. This interaction could be planned, but I don’t know. I won’t clear Alice for the Wazza’s posting and I won’t clear her if Trochi flips wolf. Call me unreasonable, but in SFoL 63 she had the most wolf pelts and still won because everyone trusted her for just being “towny”. I do think her bussing is less likely here because it would be suicide (there is no conversion), but if we are looking for wolves and she has a few pelts she could easily mislead us into mislynching until parity and then claim the reason that she is alive is because “wolves won’t kill a neutral” and nobody will lynch her because “lol!noot”.</p>

<p><strong>Conduit</strong><br>
90% of Conduit’s ISO is just townreading Arete. The other 10% is townreading Eli and reluctantly vote Wazza. Their tone isn’t terrible, but the lack of content is something I hate from them. They don’t have any disagreements and just follow Arete. They don’t even ask why they should be voting Wazza and don’t make any visible effort to read Wazza. I also don’t see many meaningful questions asked and some things do look overly performative.  I put this as a scum lean</p>

<p><strong>Light</strong><br>
I get light (no pun intended) town vibes from Light. I don’t know quite how they play as scum, but I like their tone and they seem to be doing a decent job with the solve. Nothing also really stands out to me, but I put this as a light town read<br>
<strong>Eli</strong><br>
I still say this slot is towny just for the fact that they seem comfortable in thread, they are posting, and nothing seems forced. Eli has massive problems with being frozen and making forced content as a wolf. In SFoL 64 I feel bad for saying I wouldn’t bus him, but that’s what I had to do because Eli was only making forced ISOs and slanking hard. He’s actually posting here and is comfortable in thread, even if he doesn’t have many posts that contain sustenance I still think he’s town in a Seth way.<br>
<strong>Mole</strong><br>
I have failed to read Mole several times, but I want to put this a town lean. In the past I have seen scum Mole a bit more memey and I don’t want to quite read Mole based on meta alone, so I think they are making an effort to solve. My only caveat is that some of Mole’s post looks like bussing attempts and that’s the primary reason this isn’t higher (I also don’t have much confidence in this read)</p>

<p><strong>Leafia</strong><br>
I don’t know how I quite feel about Leafia. Maybe it’s that I haven’t played a game with Leafia in a while, but the whole “if Wazza flips scum Light will look even more sus” thing kind of gives me bad pings and Leafia has also been sheepy. I don’t have a super high SR here, but it’s at least a scum lean.<br>
<strong>Cheese</strong><br>
It kind of feels like Cheese is pushing agenda on d1 here. They primarily try to push Arete out d1 without any questions, try to save Wazza d1, and then keep trying pushing against Arete to only go “lol I was joking”. This one is kind of rushed, but there isn’t much to say (this is a SR)<br>
<strong>PKR</strong><br>
Lazy read <span class="hashtag">#3</span> here, but I kind of like PKR tonally and I will give them a better look tomorrow</p>

<p><strong>SDA</strong><br>
I want to say that SDA is town here. I like that SDA tries to explain his reads and posts at times and there isn’t much else to read him on other than tone for me. The only thing that gives me caution is that I miscleared him twice in a row before. I would put SDA a townlean for now<br>
<strong>PKR</strong><br>
I get mixed feelings on this slot. Like on one hand they are semi solvey, but on the other they didn’t buy the triple vote d1. They claim they bought it last night, but we can’t confirm until the EoD. I will put this a very light town lean because the solving seems genuine. His reads are kind of a hit or miss and some have very poor reasoning. This is only a light town lean because I don’t quite know how to read PKR<br>
<strong>Cheese v2</strong><br>
Cheese is one of my higher scum reads. They spend most of d1 and most of d2 going after Arete only to back off later in d2. They then move to push me because “haha RT goes brrrrrrrrrrr”. I think they also have weird interactions with Wazza. They also seem to try jumping on Troch after the Arete push, but they wait to try and flip Arete before flipping Troch, which is a  semi decent look in my opinion. It looks less opportunistic, which is a decent look, but that’s one decent thing out of a crap ton of bad.The only caveat to this read is that there are moments that it looks like he is trying and putting effort in. Correct me if I am wrong, but I don’t remember scum!Cloned putting that extra effort in. That’s the only caveat, like it’s still a scum read, but I am less confident in this read.<br>
<strong>Dat (subbed in for Troch)</strong><br>
I get generally good vibes from Dat this game. They sub into  a dead slot in a dead thread and start solving. The solving quality also seems decent. Like they are asking good questions, they are honest about the previous slots actions, and I just like their tone. Trochi had weird interactions with Wazza, but they had a genuine tone and I put them as a town lean for that. I think Dat is probably higher up, but still not lock town for me</p>

<p>so before I get into the details of my read on him I’m going to talk a bit about how he was in <a href="../../sfol-64-anonymous-fol-day-6-the-possessor-inquisitor-and-fool-are-victorious/83777.html">SFoL 64</a> which I cohosted, I know I shouldn’t be using meta as the basis for my read on people but I do actually think it’s relevant here</p>
<p>so in SFoL 64 some things that I noticed about his play were:</p>
<ul>
<li>he blatantly TMI’d Helen as scum, like, he basically deathtunnelled her to an extent not really fitting with the strength of the logic behind it and then spent the rest of the game being like ‘well I pushed Helen so I can’t be scum.’ this has been pretty consistent across his wolf games.</li>
<li>his reads that game … lacked nuance? I’m not really sure how to explain it, but they weren’t very “sophisticated” in reasoning, it was basically like ‘this person is solving so they are town’.</li>
<li>he was really worried about appearances, and specifically about appearing consistent. example of what I mean:</li>

<p>I know I kind of SR’d Sarah, but that slot started to trend up at the EoD and thus I would believe Sarah in an Sarah vs Thomas thunderdome.</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>he spent a lot of his posts on being performative in ways that didn’t actually advance the threadstate (tbf I’m pretty sure he does this as every alignment)</li>
</ul>
<p>based on analyzing his play this game I think he is <em><strong>probably</strong></em> town (<span class="mention">@spec</span> chat: please do not roast me if this is wrong, I am <em>trying my best</em> this game).</p>
<p>the first couple reasons for this have to do with his general accuracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>He completely ignored Wazza on D1, even when Wazza came under suspicion (bear in mind, that didn’t happen <em>only</em> at EoD, it happened in midday some too); based on how I’ve seen him as scum before I think that as scum he would have distanced more heavily from Wazza</li>
<li>his scumreads more generally this game have been <em>awful</em>, like depending on the alignment of the unflipped people they might actually be worse than just RNGing his reads. if you read through the dropdown, he expresses a scumread at some point on all of Moleland, Conduit, me, Leafia, and cheese. <em>Every single person but cheese</em> is 100 percent a villager from my PoV, and cheese is one of my stronger village reads. Gorta is <em>not this inaccurate</em> as scum, he’s the sort of person as scum who’s scared to be wrong about people because he thinks it will make him look bad.
<ul>
<li>‘but what if he’s powerwolfing’ - I think it’s really unlikely that he would decide to change his playstyle so significantly from all of his previous games, for no real reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also more generally think he would be more worried about consistency as scum – like, thinking back to the Moleland thing, he made literally no effort at the time to justify calling Moleland town and then voting him, this is a weak point but it’s very dissimilar to how he treated his reads in the SFoL, where he felt like he had to justify anything vaguely inconsistent</li>
<li>another random small point (I’m pulling this one out separately from the quotewall because it’s short)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is very likely to be true because … why would you make that up … and I think it points slightly to him being town because unless all of the wolves randomly forgot that it was 36/12 a wolf probably would have known he was town</p>
<p>overall, I think Gorta is probably town, definitely would not vote there today</p>

<p>Light D1 seems fine, not really overextending at all and nothing too sus stands out. The chart was made in a different game, so cannot use that to read this slot either way but I like it at least due to it being nice.</p>
<p>Light accepted misreading posts made by Moleland which was a good look but they did not follow it up by saying how it changes their read</p>
<p><a href="1283.html">This</a> was a fair post and I do not think it is really pushing agenda because otherwise they would have likely pushed on SDA more, I think. IDK whether I am misinterpreting it a bit.</p>

<p>like, the closest thing we get to his treatment of the Wazza wagon, is his treatment of the <em>Trochi</em> wagon (which obviously can’t have been defending a partner, because Trochi is a dead villager):</p>

<p>where he does unvote, bring up the lack of resistance, and say that there not being much resistance points to Trochi being town</p>
<p>however, he brings a <em>lot</em> more resistance to the Wazza wagon (despite not, as far as I can tell, townreading Wazza?) than he does to the Trochi wagon, and additionally he <em>doesn’t</em> bring this resistance to other wagons – like, the cloned wagon was the top wagon for ?a while? (I don’t remember how long exactly) and yet he seemed basically unconcerned with that wagon and never brings up the possibility that it could be DADV</p>
<p>he also brings up low-content, mechposting, and not explaining reads as reasons to scumread Moleland:</p>

</aside>
<p>two out of three of these reasons were … basically the case against Wazza (the last one wasn’t really a point against Wazza because Wazza just didn’t have reads period)</p>
<p>yet when these were brought up as points against Wazza he was super resistant to the wagon</p>
<p><strong>important note (a.k.a. reasons why I’m not totally certain of this read):</strong></p>
<p>to Light’s credit he did … have a reason … for defending Wazza like this and not defending other people like this (that is, it was Wazza’s birthday and that can explain the lack of content)</p>
<p>and there’s a part of my brain that’s like ‘ok but would Light <em>really</em> harddefend a partner like that <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png!v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:">’</p>
<p>but I’m not totally sure that applies? because most of the reasons he gives aren’t … about Wazza’s alignment … like as far as I can tell he doesn’t even townread Wazza, he never says ‘I don’t want to vote Wazza because Wazza is town’</p>
<p>the <em>third</em> thought I had is ‘maybe this makes him a wolf because no one has tried to push him on this blatantly sus progression’ but … I don’t actually think the wolves are really pushing people this game … so …</p>

<p>the thing I’m noticing is that he has a <em>lot</em> of reads like this, where he shades someone but doesn’t really call them a wolf.

<p>this set of posts are more ‘shading people without ever really pushing them’ – like, as far as I can tell he never e.g. votes cloned, and basically just drops the subject</p>

<p>Sorry, this is getting too off-topic. Anyway, I haven’t seen much out of Conduit, and now that the wagon has been more fleshed out, I’m willing to go for it.

<p>then we have these three posts on Conduit, I said earlier that I wanted to bring up inconsistencies with how he treated Wazza and everyone else – this is what I was talking about</p>
<p>when Wazza was getting wagoned the lack of resistance was evidence that he was town, and meant that he needed to try as hard as possible to stop him from getting wagoned</p>
<p>here when Conduit is getting wagoned he’s basically like ‘I didn’t like that there were so many people going for it beforehand for what I saw as minute evidence, but it makes a bit more sense now’ and leaves it at that</p>
<p>he also never really did anything to try to prevent the Conduit wagon, despite saying here that he hadn’t liked that there were so many people going for it beforehand – like, the most he did was ask why people are pushing Conduit and say that he thought Conduit was probably newbtown, he never tried to actively shift the wagon</p>

</aside>
<p>this is literally the only post I found notable on D3 at all</p>
<p>I’m trying to be charitable to him because the forum maintenance messed things up for everyone, but I’m pretty sure that wolves just did not care what was happening the last couple days, and we have Light … not caring what was happening the last couple days …</p>
<p>additionally, his treatment of the Mole wagon is <em>super sketchy</em> – he says he doesn’t agree with the wagon, but the extent of his attempt to change the wagon consists of dropping a vote on Derps and saying he doesn’t agree with the wagon</p>
<p>like, it’s not like Mole being the wagon was a weird flashwagon at the end of the day that he couldn’t have ever anticipated, and he tragically got dragged away from the game by IRL commitments before he could intervene</p>
<p>Mole was the top wagon for nearly the entire day. obviously different people have different playstyles but I’m pretty sure most people … care if their village reads are being voted out … and I find it suspicious that Light didn’t care at all, and just let the wagon on Mole happen, even though he allegedly disagreed with it</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>this is probably a wolf</p>

          <p>summarized version of my points on Light, if you don’t want to read my entire wall:</p>
<ul>
<li>he spent the entirety of EoD1 trying to shift the wagon off of Wazza despite not expressing a townread on Wazza. obviously villagers can be wrong/defend wolves but the extent to which he defended Wazza doesn’t make sense given that he never actually called Wazza town</li>
<li>his treatment of Wazza is inconsistent with how he treated literally everyone else this game that he supposedly townread, he tried as hard as he could to defend Wazza but did basically nothing to defend Mole when Mole was getting voted out despite allegedly disagreeing with the wagon</li>
<li>most of his reads aren’t real pushes, he just shades someone without really going anywhere with it. this is <em>usually</em> a sign of a wolf that wants to make villagers look bad but doesn’t want the responsibility of actually pushing for misexes</li>
