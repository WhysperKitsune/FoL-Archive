    <description>#[color=brown]The Groundskeeper - Neutral Killing[/color]

**Passive Abilities:** Immune to Occupy | Immune to Conversion

**Day Ability:** Stalk
Find out who your target is targetting at the beginning of  the night and get some idea of what their class is.

**Night Ability:** Bury Alive
Bury your target alive and take thier place. They will vanish from court. Their class will show as &quot;Unknown&quot; and Physician cannot exhume the player. You will know their class and journal.

**Goal:** Win with Surviving Neutrals

**Lore:**

_For a long time, Castle Adiart&#39;s gardens remained a beautiful sight, all thanks to the Groundskeeper. But when members of the court trample on his finely cut grass or his freshly grown flowers, his temper gets the better of him._

_The Groundskeeper was never one for killing, he simply only ever wanted to tend the gardens and keep everything tidy but it was a hard task when they constantly had people running all over the place at night._

_The only thing that he could do was ensure they could not. He would stalk somebody at night to find out what they were doing. Sometimes would bury them alive only to take their place at the court to find out what else is going on._</description>
