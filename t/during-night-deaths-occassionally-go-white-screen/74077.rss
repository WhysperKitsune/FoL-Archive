    <title>During night deaths occassionally go white screen</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/during-night-deaths-occassionally-go-white-screen/74077</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
While night deaths are being processed, both my monitors shut off, restart and then the game window is just a white screen.  I can still hear the game underneath the white, but can&#39;t see anything.  Closing the window and restarting the game doesn&#39;t allow me to rejoin the game.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Not that.

#### Steps to reproduce:
No idea, I&#39;ve only seen it twice, but it started with the patch previous to this one.  Last game I died as a Knight in slot 16 to an assassin I think.

#### Comments:
Wonky bug that appeared in the patch before this one and is pretty rare, but not being able to rejoin makes it especially crappy if you don&#39;t die in the process since you can&#39;t rejoin.

EDIT:  It literally just happened again the very next game.  I was MM in slot 16, went to convert and white screened.  Guess I&#39;m taking a break for a bit.</description>

            <p>Happened to me yet again.</p>
<p>Apparently we don’t care about this?  Can we at least get it to where you can rejoin?</p>
