&lt;big&gt;[color=LightBlue]**General Information**[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
-Only 1-2 **Neutral** in 15 players game.
-There is at least one healer per game. ([color=Blue]**Physician, Chronomancer**[/color], **Alchemist**).
-There is a maximum of 3 of the same non-unique **BD** classes in a game.
And a max of 2 non-unique **Neutral**.
-Some unique classes are the **NK**, [color=Blue]**Mystic, Prince**[/color], **Pretender**, **Sellsword**, **Scorned**, **Inquisitor**.
If there are three or more people claiming the same class, they are generally seen as suspicious due to the low odds for three of the same class to spawn.

&lt;big&gt;[color=LightBlue]**General Evils Claim**[/color]&lt;/big&gt;

-**Weak Claim:** [color=Blue]**CW, Knight, Physician, Chronomancer**[/color] or even the **Alchemist**.
+These claims are easy to fake logs, as well as easy to prove. Court will also start to searching Evils from these claims. So only claim if you cant think of a good claim.

**-Decent Claim:** [color=Blue]**Princess, Sheirff/Paladin, Butler, Maid**[/color]
+These claims are pretty safe and only get upped when you got poorly info or the **Weak Claim** all been confirmed/killed.
+Most of these claim are Investigator, in early game you can give out info/false info to King to cause chaos or confirm yourself. In middle/late game, you can &quot;bus&quot; your fellow members to gain trustworthy as well as clear up a space convert. Or giving false info to get BD mislynched.

**-Strong Claim:** [color=Blue]**Drunk, Observer**[/color]
+These claim is very hard to fake unless you are them but converted.  But if you are confident in faking logs, these claim will likely never draw attention from BD to you unless all other claims are cleared.

**-Avoid to Claim:** 
+Any class that are unique are the one you should never wanted to claim, except claiming [color=blue]**Hunter**[/color] as **SellSword** or **Fool** to cause chaos.
+These claim are : [color=blue]**Prince, Mystic, Hunter**[/color]


&lt;big&gt;[color=LightBlue]**Claim as certain Class**[/color]&lt;/big&gt;

[color=darkviolet]**MasterMind**[/color]
-Claim with confirmed [color=blue]**Princess**[/color]/**Pretender** in game : 
+[color=blue]**Maid, Sheriff, Princess**[/color] or even the [color=blue]**Observer**[/color] (Only if you confident in your faking logs skill).

-Claim normally : 
+You should claim avoid the S/I as much as possible, so the court wont target you to find MM. But it is risky without confirming any [color=blue]**Princess**[/color]/**Pretender** in the game, and you also may get found by **The King**. 
+Claim [color=blue]**Drunk**[/color] as the [color=darkviolet]**MasterMind**[/color] could give you the trustworthy if you claimed to &quot;Deb&quot; your [color=darkviolet]**Assassin**[/color] into someone. But that will require a lot of teamworks.
+One of the more viable options is to claim your converted&#39;s class. Such as if you converted a [color=blue]**Sheriff**[/color] and he didnt claim yet, you may want him to claim something else and you will claim his space. This is even better in the game with only 1 [color=blue]**Sheriff**[/color] since the [color=blue]**BD**[/color] likely never target you.


[color=darkviolet]**Assassin**[/color]
-Claim with confirmed [color=blue]**Princess**[/color]/**Pretender** in game : 
+K/O class, and if you claimed [color=Blue]**Hunter**[/color], be prepare to counterclaim the real one.
+Your most painful things is having a [color=blue]**Princess**[/color]/**Pretender** in game. Get rid of [color=blue]**Princess**[/color] as fast as possible, and then convince **Pretender** not to checked you.

-Claim normally : 
(Insert suggestions here).

[color=darkviolet]**Converted Unseen**[/color]
-As [color=darkviolet]**Converted Unseen**[/color], you may want to claim your previous class before got converted. But if you are [color=blue]**Mystic**[/color] or [color=blue]**Knight**[/color] didnt claimed yet and got converted early. It is best for you to claim somethings else than your previous claim. Its because [color=darkviolet]**Illusionist**[/color] dont have ability to link and can be found easy. And the [color=darkviolet]**Enforcer**[/color] will be upped if they found [color=blue]**Prince**[/color], **The King**, or [color=blue]**Mystic**[/color] die with all the protections on them.</description>

            <p>There is no badwrongfun. Anyone who doesn’t like guides doesn’t have to read them.<br>
If you watch streamers or read guides or ask for tips for improving your gameplay, there is nothing wrong with that. If you personally prefer to learn by trial, that’s your own decision (and totally legit, but the other methods are legit too).</p>

            <p>The good side on claiming Drunk or Obs (as <em>any</em> evil) is that you often don’t get asked for your logs - and when you have to post them, often enough BD won’t read them carefully enough. You are living from the unsuspiciousness of your class, and when you manage to “find” the NK with it, you can manage to get confirmed for the rest of the game.<br>
Some of my best wins where were I was OG Assa, being a confirmed Drunk, since I “debbed” the NK; or reaper, being a confirmed Obs who is finding all the unseen.</p>

            <p>This isn’t really a useful guide.</p>
<p>It’s miss leading to say you should claim drunk or butler when your new, you should go for someonthing non social or offensive especially if you are new.</p>
<p>Butler isn’t easy like sheriff invests generally are as easy to claim as chrono or phys and are as suspicious as them, Observer would be a advance claim yes but it wouldn’t be <em>Super hard</em></p>
<p>It also depends on what evil class you are generally</p>

<p><big><font color="LightBlue"><strong>General Information</strong></font></big><br>
-Only 1-2 <strong>Neutral</strong> in 15 players game.<br>
-There is at least one healer per game. (<font color="Blue"><strong>Physician, Chronomancer</strong></font>, <strong>Alchemist</strong>).<br>
-There is a maximum of 3 of the same non-unique <strong>BD</strong> classes in a game.<br>
And a max of 2 non-unique <strong>Neutral</strong>.<br>
-Some unique classes are the <strong>NK</strong>, <font color="Blue"><strong>Mystic, Prince</strong></font>, <strong>Pretender</strong>, <strong>Sellsword</strong>, <strong>Scorned</strong>, <strong>Inquisitor</strong>.<br>
If there are three or more people claiming the same class, they are generally seen as suspicious due to the low odds for three of the same class to spawn.</p>
<p><big><font color="LightBlue"><strong>General Evils Claim</strong></font></big></p>
<p>-<strong>Weak Claim:</strong> <font color="Blue"><strong>CW, Knight, Physician, Chronomancer</strong></font> or even the <strong>Alchemist</strong>.<br>
+These claims are easy to fake logs, as well as easy to prove. Court will also start to searching Evils from these claims. So only claim if you cant think of a good claim.</p>
<p><strong>-Decent Claim:</strong> <font color="Blue"><strong>Princess, Sheirff/Paladin, Butler, Maid</strong></font><br>
+These claims are pretty safe and only get upped when you got poorly info or the <strong>Weak Claim</strong> all been confirmed/killed.<br>
+Most of these claim are Investigator, in early game you can give out info/false info to King to cause chaos or confirm yourself. In middle/late game, you can “bus” your fellow members to gain trustworthy as well as clear up a space convert. Or giving false info to get BD mislynched.</p>
<p><strong>-Strong Claim:</strong> <font color="Blue"><strong>Drunk, Observer</strong></font><br>
+These claim is very hard to fake unless you are them but converted.  But if you are confident in faking logs, these claim will likely never draw attention from BD to you unless all other claims are cleared.</p>
<p><strong>-Avoid to Claim:</strong><br>
+Any class that are unique are the one you should never wanted to claim, except claiming <font color="blue"><strong>Hunter</strong></font> as <strong>SellSword</strong> or <strong>Fool</strong> to cause chaos.<br>
+These claim are : <font color="blue"><strong>Prince, Mystic, Hunter</strong></font></p>
<p><big><font color="LightBlue"><strong>Claim as certain Class</strong></font></big></p>
<p><font color="darkviolet"><strong>MasterMind</strong></font><br>
-Claim with confirmed <font color="blue"><strong>Princess</strong></font>/<strong>Pretender</strong> in game :<br>
+<font color="blue"><strong>Maid, Sheriff, Princess</strong></font> or even the <font color="blue"><strong>Observer</strong></font> (Only if you confident in your faking logs skill).</p>
<p>-Claim normally :<br>
+You should claim avoid the S/I as much as possible, so the court wont target you to find MM. But it is risky without confirming any <font color="blue"><strong>Princess</strong></font>/<strong>Pretender</strong> in the game, and you also may get found by <strong>The King</strong>.<br>
+Claim <font color="blue"><strong>Drunk</strong></font> as the <font color="darkviolet"><strong>MasterMind</strong></font> could give you the trustworthy if you claimed to “Deb” your <font color="darkviolet"><strong>Assassin</strong></font> into someone. But that will require a lot of teamworks.<br>
+One of the more viable options is to claim your converted’s class. Such as if you converted a <font color="blue"><strong>Sheriff</strong></font> and he didnt claim yet, you may want him to claim something else and you will claim his space. This is even better in the game with only 1 <font color="blue"><strong>Sheriff</strong></font> since the <font color="blue"><strong>BD</strong></font> likely never target you.</p>
<p><font color="darkviolet"><strong>Assassin</strong></font><br>
-Claim with confirmed <font color="blue"><strong>Princess</strong></font>/<strong>Pretender</strong> in game :<br>
+K/O class, and if you claimed <font color="Blue"><strong>Hunter</strong></font>, be prepare to counterclaim the real one.<br>
+Your most painful things is having a <font color="blue"><strong>Princess</strong></font>/<strong>Pretender</strong> in game. Get rid of <font color="blue"><strong>Princess</strong></font> as fast as possible, and then convince <strong>Pretender</strong> not to checked you.</p>
<p>-Claim normally :<br>
(Insert suggestions here).</p>
<p><font color="darkviolet"><strong>Converted Unseen</strong></font><br>
-As <font color="darkviolet"><strong>Converted Unseen</strong></font>, you may want to claim your previous class before got converted. But if you are <font color="blue"><strong>Mystic</strong></font> or <font color="blue"><strong>Knight</strong></font> didnt claimed yet and got converted early. It is best for you to claim somethings else than your previous claim. Its because <font color="darkviolet"><strong>Illusionist</strong></font> dont have ability to link and can be found easy. And the <font color="darkviolet"><strong>Enforcer</strong></font> will be upped if they found <font color="blue"><strong>Prince</strong></font>, <strong>The King</strong>, or <font color="blue"><strong>Mystic</strong></font> die with all the protections on them.</p>
