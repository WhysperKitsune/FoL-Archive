    <title>Word &quot;town&quot; is replaced by word &quot;BD&quot; in chat</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/word-town-is-replaced-by-word-bd-in-chat/62628</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Look the title. For example, if you type &quot;screw that town&quot; it will be replaced by &quot;screw that BD&quot;.

#### Comments:

Looks really strange.</description>

            <p>New players to the genre won’t know any of those ToS or mafia terms, so because players didn’t care about making those people’s lives easier, we did and added this.</p>
<p>Not a bug.</p>

            <p>I’d much rather see them just make it a soft rule that you don’t call things by their corresponding names in other games, but stick to in-game terms. Give people a soft warning if they keep saying “i’m town check my will” etc. Mangling the chat just so those people can keep saying Town forever and not have it affect the game seems like an odd solution.</p>

            <p>This seems like a really hamfisted implementation to me, and I don’t know why it’s in the game. There are a few examples like this.</p>
<p>“A guy in my town got a role in the doctor strange movie.” Nope sorry you’re not allowed to say that.</p>

<p>At least they stopped on the one that did cause the most problems IMO. (town of salem called what we call journal/logs a “will”, obviously autocorrecting “will” to journal caused quite a bit of confusion “Journal you just be quiet!”.</p>

<p>Nice explanation, thank you. I personally have never played Town of Salem, only heard about it. “I’m town” would really confuse me, but “will” is pretty understandable.</p>
