    <title>(Class Suggestion)-Death Reaper-Neutral Special</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-death-reaper-neutral-special/26370</link>
    <description>Death Reaper-Neutral Special(This class is basically the king of reapers)
Passive 1-Vile tongue-You can talk to the dead at night(You appear as the psychic talking to one of the reapers)
Passive 2-King of Death-Immune to Death and occupy
Day ability 1-Soul Tap-Trap someone’s soul making them a reaper(Doesn’t work on prince and any unseen/cult)
Day ability 2-Unearthly Scream-All your reapers will get one kill guaranteed-1 or 2 uses
Night ability 1-Hollow-Convert someone into a reaper(Doesn’t work on prince or any evils.)
Night ability 2-Reap-Reap someone bypasses healing
This class spawns with 1 reaper and basically makes a reaper faction or army.
Probably overpowered as shit but I couldn’t help making myself the king of reapers.
This class would take over the NK spot.
The oldest reaper would become Death Reaper.
I was told by plex to move my topic sorry for posting in the wrong section.Also I didn&#39;t reply because I was hunting.Sorry -_-.</description>

<p>That would just be a disaster waiting to happen. As well as that, you basically making Reapers into their own faction. What has been said by Boslof will be said by me (well, interpreted by me)…</p>
<p>“We do not need anymore factions, and they will never happen.” Why do you think Plex’s Brotherhood faction which (is pretty damn good in the art of FOL) has never appeared?</p>
