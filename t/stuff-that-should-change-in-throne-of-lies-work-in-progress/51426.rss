    <description>**_Stuff That SHOULD Be In Throne Of Lies_** 
_NOTICE: This is still in progress!_

**Illusionist**
[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
Illusionist

Night Ability Mental Blur should be replaced with Link Minds. Exactly like Psychic. So if a Psychic gets converted, it doesn&#39;t completely screw over the Psychic.
[/details]

**Fool &amp; Scorned**
[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
The Fool/Scorned change should be similar to Mastermind. If you get occupied, it will not tell the Drunk/Butler that you are indeed occupy immune. So it doesn&#39;t screw you over.
[/details]

**Mercenary**
[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
A New Passive should be added called: &quot;Immunity Throughout&quot;

Immunity Throughout - Your guard can protect from Knight, and etc.. Even King and Prince.
[/details]
**Spectate Feature**
[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
This should be a feature where you can spectate your friends game. This could be used for watching the friends game. Could be for watching your favorite youtubers game while watching. Nothing will displayed to you, not even dead chat. Only Alive chat. And what people see. Except at night.

</aside>
<p>Mental Blur should be replaced but not by Link Minds, else nobody’s going to claim to Psychic.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Agree 100%.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It already protects from King.  It should not protect from Prince though.</p>

            <p>Illusionist: There are even currently players who won’t claim to Psychic, because they MAY get converted. This change will make that much much worse. Simply change your claim if you haven’t changed publicly to something like knight/physician and use telepathy during the day to cause a mislynch. If you have claimed simply say you linked whoever assassin killed or you “linked” assassin. It is also good to eventually get killed as unseen are at 3 members, so that MM can convert again. You don’t need to live to win, you need to get your faction to win.</p>
<p>Fool/Scorned: Possible, but your motivation just sounds like you made too bad of a claim that you were recognized as a fool. You can simply claim Butler/Drunk with only dead people for instance. Scorned’s: The Drunk, deb 5, attacked but immune!!! are infamous.</p>
<p>Mercenary: It does? Except from Prince, but nothing should stop Prince execution. Prince should be the most powerful BD or there is no reason to hide him and for the evils to apply social deduction themselves. Mercenary is already a random bonus at the start to whoever happens to have his contract. No reason to make it way stronger. She gets 2 contracts for a reason and she is subject to balancing changes soon anyways.</p>

</aside>
<p>They already tried to do this. It was a shit show where no one listened to the psychic ever and it made everyone far too paranoid. If you can convert a psychic then you are probably going to win fairly soon anyways so using link minds isn’t that important at most points where you would still be an illusionist rather than an assassin.</p>

            <p>Prince Kill is still practically guaranteed.</p>
<p>I personally think the BD relying on the Prince is unhealthy, and I’d like it significantly nerfed, but that’s besides the point.</p>
<p>If the Mercenary guards an evil and they are jailed by Prince, there is no meaningful action they can take. It’s a pretty edge case, but I think it’s worth giving the Merc this</p>
