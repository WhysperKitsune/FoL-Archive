    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Horde</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-horde/71071</link>
    <description>So I came up with an idea for a faction without conversion and would like to know what everyone thinks!  It was fun to design even if nothing like it ever gets implemented. :stuck_out_tongue: 

&gt;All [color=orange]**Horde**[/color] games begin with **1** [color=orange]**Chieftain**[/color] and **3** [color=orange]**Barbarians**[/color].  There is no conversion and the starting King is always [color=steblue]**Blue Dragon**[/color], who&#39;s  trying to defend his kingdom from a barbarian invasion.
&gt;
&gt;There are no Sheriffs or Paladins, nor any class designed specifically to counter [color=orange]**The Horde**[/color].  Observer&#39;s **Peek** is the only ability that can determine if someone&#39;s faction is [color=orange]**Horde**[/color].

&gt;# [color=orange]**The Chieftain**[/color]
&gt;[color=orange]**Horde Killer**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Brutal (Passive)** - You are immune to death, occupation, and target-changing.
&gt;**Noble Savage (Passive)** - You may step up during the Royal Blood phase.  You will become [color=orange]**The Barbarian King**[/color].
&gt;
&gt;**Slay (Night ability)** - Use a Barbarian to attack a player. (Infinite uses) 
&gt;**Slaughter (Night ability)** - Attack someone, bypassing death immunity.  Additionally, force every Barbarian to attack their target. (1 use) 
&gt;
&gt;**Rabble-Rouse (Day ability)** - Change all abstain votes to execute if you voted execute, or pardon if you voted pardon. (1 use) 

&gt;# [color=orange]**The Barbarian**[/color]
&gt;[color=orange]**Horde Offensive**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Uncivilized (Passive)** - You will be demoted to [color=orange]**The Brute**[/color] if [color=orange]**The Chieftain**[/color] or [color=orange]**The Barbarian King**[/color] dies.  If you become King, you will become [color=orange]**The Brute King**[/color].
&gt;
&gt;**Brute Force (Night ability)** - Occupy a player. (2 uses)
&gt;**Wreak Havoc (Night ability)** - Redirect a player. (2 uses) 
&gt;
&gt;**Stun (Day ability)** - Prevent a player from speaking or even reading chat for 10 seconds.  (1 use)

&gt;# [color=orange]**The Brute**[/color]
&gt;[color=orange]**Horde Killer**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Uncivilized (Passive)** - If you become King, you will become [color=orange]**The Brute King**[/color].
&gt;
&gt;**Raid (Night ability)** - Vote to attack a player.  All Brutes will attack the target with the most votes.  If no consensus is reached, one of the voted targets will be chosen at random.  Bypasses death immunity if multiple Brutes successfully attack the same target. (Infinite uses)

&gt;# [color=orange]**The Barbarian King**[/color]
&gt;[color=orange]**Horde Killer**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Brutal (Passive)** - You are immune to death, occupation, and target-changing.
&gt;
&gt;**Slay (Night ability)** - Attack a player. (Infinite uses) 
&gt;**Slaughter (Night ability)** - Attack someone, bypassing death immunity.  Additionally, force every Barbarian to attack their target. (1 use unless you already used it before becoming King)
&gt;
&gt;**Royal Finger (Day ability)** - Your next vote for treason will count twice. 
&gt;**Decide Fate (Day ability)** - Pardon or execute the player on trial, ignoring all votes.

&gt;# [color=orange]**The Brute King**[/color]
&gt;[color=orange]**Horde Special**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Royal Finger (Day ability)** - Your next vote for treason will count twice. 
&gt;**Decide Fate (Day ability)** - Pardon or execute the player on trial, ignoring all votes.</description>

            <p>You have essentially made Princess factional cop now, eliminating the potential to fakeclaim Paladin/Sheriff. Nothing this faction does can even discredit Princess checks. No frames/tailors, Imagine a game with 3 Princesses and the horde.</p>

            <p>Can’t this just be solved by letting Slaughter bypass everything including healing?</p>
<p>Also I think Day 1 mass claims would be optimal strategy in current game state.  Not necessarily honest claims, but something specific.</p>

            <p>All Princess checks yielding support/social or special/investigative are now confirmed Blue Dragon, giving none off these Horde roles the claimspace to really claim those.</p>
<p>This means they can claim Knight/Butler/Drunk/Hunter safely. Butler and Drunk claims don’t hold up for longer than 2 nights. Knights will be forced to CS. Hunters are unique retribution monsters. Simultaneously it will never be fun to roll these classes anymore, because optimal strategy for town is to just lynch those immediately. Every game should be massclaiming day 2, because there is no ultimate bypassing mechanic  that could kill Prince for instance.</p>
<p>The problem with no conversion is that once you’re confirmed, you’re confirmed for the rest of the game. This faction is nowhere near OP enough to deal with that.</p>
<p>Note: This was linked, hence the necro.</p>
