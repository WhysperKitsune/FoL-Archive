    <title>&quot;Learn to Play&quot; button no longer working? [1.0.6]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/learn-to-play-button-no-longer-working-1-0-6/7250</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Clicking the &quot;Learn to Play&quot; button at the top of the main screen makes a noise and highlights, but the tutorial slides do not appear.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Tutorial slides should appear.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Latest patch, am relatively new player (starting just this week in previous patch) and have played at least 50 games. Button worked when I first started playing and times since then, but has stopped working since latest patch.
Playing on 1920x1080 resolution, high quality settings and without a second screen. Have not changed any options since previous patch.

#### Comments:

Have tried reopening game twice. Restarting computer does not solve the problem.</description>
