    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Berserker (NK)</title>

    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;Crimson&quot;] The Berserker [/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer [/color]** 
**Untamed (Passive)** - The Berserker is immune to occupation, target changing, and death at night, including against the Hunter’s Bear Companion and the Knight’s Defend, or even the Enforcer’s Frenzy. If the Berserker is attacked or jailed, then they will automatically use Bloody Swings on their attackers or the Prince at the end of the night. If the Berserker is jailed, poisoned, bled, or attacked, they gain two charges of Rampage and empowers Bloody Swings for the next night.
**Unchained (Passive)** - If a player attempts and fails to occupy or redirect the Berserker, then he will gain a charge of Rampage.
**Quarrelsome Banter (Day)** - In the coming night, the Berserker will redirect any night actions used by the target onto himself. - 3 uses 
**Wild Leeches (Day)** - If the Berserker is poisoned or bleeding then he can transfer the condition to another player during the day. - 3 uses 
**Bloody Swings (Night)** - Kills a player. If Bloody Swings is empowered then it bypasses Night Immunity and healing. - Infinite uses 
**Rampage (Night)** - Kills the target. If another player visited the target and the Berserker has more than one charge, then Rampage will chain to the next player until a player has not been visited or the Berserker runs out of Rampage charges. - 0 uses 
*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.*

Theme: A neutral killer with the idea of becoming stronger as he is attacked/occupied.
Survivability: Wild Leeches allows him to pass on poisoning/bleeding on other players meanwhile Untamed is essentially impenetrable night immunity
Late-game: Essentially needs to be lynched to die and an end-game charged Rampage should essentially wipe out much of the court.

            <p>I <em>really</em> like this idea but I want to propose some more modifications with explanations for why I think they make this class even better.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="gray"> The Berserker </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray"> Neutral Killer </font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Untamed (Passive)</strong> - The Berserker is immune to occupation, target changing, and death at night (even Bear Companion, Defend, and Frenzy - but NOT Prince’s Execute).</p>
<p><font color="gray"><s>If the Berserker is attacked or jailed, then they will automatically use Bloody Swings on their attackers or the Prince at the end of the night.</s></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think automatically killing anyone who attacks you is overpowered, like a permanent Bear Companion.  And automatically killing Prince while imprisoned is worse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Berserker is jailed, poisoned, bled, or attacked, they gain <font color="gray"><s>two</s></font> one charge of Rage. <font color="gray"><s>Rampage and empowers Bloody Swings for the next night.</s></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve combined Rampage and Bloody Swings down below.  I reduced the quantity of Rage you get since it will be significantly more useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unchained (Passive)</strong> - If a player attempts and fails to occupy or redirect the Berserker, then he will gain a charge of Rampage.</p>
<p><font color="gray"><s><strong>Quarrelsome Banter (Day)</strong> - In the coming night, the Berserker will redirect any night actions used by the target onto himself. - 3 uses</s></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems unnecessary.  If you’re trying to get attacked, occupied, or redirected for Rage points, can’t you just bait like Hunter does?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="gray"><s><strong>Wild Leeches (Day)</strong> - If the Berserker is poisoned or bleeding then he can transfer the condition to another player during the day. - 3 uses</s></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since you already get buffed by poison and bleed, it seems overpowered to be able to transfer them also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rampage (Night)</strong> - Attack a player. Additionally, attack up to as many players as you have Rage points.  Selecting the same target twice (like you can with Eradicate) will cost an extra Rage point but will bypass death immunity. <font color="gray"><s>If Bloody Swings is empowered then it bypasses death immunity and healing.</s></font> (Infinite uses)</p>
<p><font color="gray"><s><strong>Rampage (Night)</strong> - Kills the target. If another player visited the target and the Berserker has more than one charge, then Rampage will chain to the next player until a player has not been visited or the Berserker runs out of Rampage charges. - 0 uses</s></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought the original Rampage was too similar to Circle of Death. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>I like Rampage.  I think Unchained should also recharge upon getting coldsteeled, poisoned, bled, etc.</p>
<p>Untamed protecting against Frenzy seems overpowered and Wild Leeches seems out of place in my opinion (trying to reply to all of your classes <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">)</p>
