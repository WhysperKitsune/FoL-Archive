&gt;
&gt;**[color = &quot;gray&quot;]Neutral Support [/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Cursed Bread (Passive)** - If you die, the Blue Dragon will lose in 3 days. You are seen as a member of the evil faction, but you are immune to death at night. You cannot be converted.
&gt;
&gt;**Bake Bread (Day)** - Grant an extra charge of another player&#39;s night abilities. That player will die in 3 days.
&gt;
&gt;**Give Cursed Bread (Night)** - Bleed a player. You must use this every night.
&gt;
&gt;**Win Condition** - See the Blue Dragon win at any cost

&gt;**Lore** - It was rare to find a good baker in Adiart. Even rarer for one to mill his own grain, and even rarer for him to know about the cult of Mithras. For one such baker had once made a forbidden deal with the Blood God - to add craving to the bread. But craving is craving , and those used to craving cannot stand craving being taken away from them, so all who smell the bread will wither away at the withdrawal.
&gt;
&gt;Yet for someone to eat the bread, he would gain craving beyond measure. For a single taste was not enough - he must have more. Yet more would not satisfy him, until his craving was so great as to consume his life.
&gt;
&gt;The curse of the bread may yet be removed, though. The priests of the Blue Dragon knew how to get rid of the curse, and the Baker knew that they must remain intact for his curse to be lifted, for the other factions would never rid him of the curse.</description>
