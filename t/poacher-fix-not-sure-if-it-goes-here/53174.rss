    <title>Poacher fix(not sure if it goes here)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/poacher-fix-not-sure-if-it-goes-here/53174</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a glaring problem with poacher. He occupys. And guess why that is a problem. 1. He can&#39;t occupy people who are occupy immune. That&#39;s okay. But what isn&#39;t okay is when someone who wasn&#39;t occupy immune at the start of the game. Say a sheriff got occupied 3 times. Now you put a trap outside his door so when he investigates he gets occupyied But wait.... he&#39;s occupy immune. I feel as if poacher should go through GAINED occupy immunity. Meaning he can&#39;t occupy a drunk but he can occupy a sheriff who&#39;s been occupied three times.
Would make poacher a lot more useful

Now I haven&#39;t played poacher so if he already goes through occupy immunity okay ignore everything but if not please?</description>

<p>Poacher wants to occupy the sheriff. He can’t because he is occupy immune. Question I know they did that for a reason but why?</p>

</aside>
<p>Doesn’t this apply to all occupying roles?  Why do you think the Poacher should be treated differently?</p>
<p>(I’m open to the idea that maybe there is a reason, but I’m not seeing it right now.)</p>

            <p>Doesn’t this apply to anyone who Occupys? Poacher is actually better here because he can spike trap the guy the sheriff is about to check and stop him anyway.</p>
