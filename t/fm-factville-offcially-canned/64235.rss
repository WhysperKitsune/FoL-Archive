Hello folks and welcome to !!Factville!!

3. No private messaging others in the game about the game.
4. Do not screenshot private host messages
5. Don’t throw the game. This includes any form of intent to make you or your faction lose
6. Do not use me or Nerbins big boi letters or me colorz 
7. Editing is allowed if you are correcting grammar mistakes other than that you need me permission. Also no deleting posts.

[color=lightgreen]Executions[/color]

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
When someone is on Trial they will be able to post a 1000 character defense through me, during this time no-one should post, everyone will then vote Guilty or innocent by messaging me
After the votes are revealed a player will be decided as innocent or guilty, Executions end the Day
Trials pause the counter

[color=lightgreen]Broadcasts[/color]

Everyday there will be things called broadcasts. The first 3 people at day to **/broadcast** in their **PM** will talk through me. There will be special effects from a player depending on their class. This effect only lasts for the day and night after you do the broadcast. You may choose to activate it when your broadcasting **but it is only 1 use, though there maybe a way to get an extra one..**. There is also another broadcast event that I shall not reveal.
