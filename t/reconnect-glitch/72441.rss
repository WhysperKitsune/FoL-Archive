    <description>When I left a game this morning and returned only 10 minutes later, I was greeted with the &quot;Reconnect Button&quot; which is standard I am well aware, but when clicked it said you were disconnected, I left and tried to join a game once more but I joined again, I then restarted the game and joined back but it still said reconnect I tried to join again about 4 times, and I then clicked it for the 6th time and instead of taking me to the game again it just kept loading for about 3 minutes and still hasn&#39;t joined I have restarted the game and It seemed to have done the trick  but this was a big annoyance for about 10 minutes.</description>
