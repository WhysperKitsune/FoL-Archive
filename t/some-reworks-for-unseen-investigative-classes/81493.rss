    <title>Some reworks for Unseen Investigative Classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/some-reworks-for-unseen-investigative-classes/81493</link>
    <description>Currently, the Investigative Unseen classes in the game are the most boring set of converts. They serve no real purpose at all and don&#39;t do very much. They also usually become assassin anyways after being converted, so even if they were the slightest bit of fun, it wouldn&#39;t last long which is why I made a rework or a buff for these classes.

Marshal Rework/Buff
New Passive - Detective-Like
You will appear as an Investigative class for investigation result. (Passive
kept on during class change)

New Passive - Royal Work Ethic
You and Unseen will know who is imprisoned every night

New Day Ability - Stalker|AKA Ripoff Scout
Select target A and target B (targets cannot be Unseen). If target A visits 
target B, occupy target A and everyone else visiting target B except for 
Unseen members. Stays on target until deselected or activated. You may not 
select the same Target A twice if they have activated Stalker yet. (infinite uses)

New Day Ability - Personal Disguise 
Choose a member of the Unseen (including yourself) to disguise as sheriff 
or MM. If they are executed, they will appear as that class. (infinite uses)

Probe Buff
Determine and frame a player’s class, if they are part of the Blue Dragon. 

Snoop Buff
2 charges ------&gt; 3 charges

Duchess Rework/Buff
New Passive - Detective-Like
You will appear as an Investigative class for investigation result. (Passive
kept on during class change)

New Passive - Guidance
If OG Assassin dies before they become MM, you will gain Apprenticeship

New Day Ability - Royal Disguise 
Choose a member of the Unseen (including yourself) to disguise as princess 
or MM. If they are executed, they will appear as that class. (infinite uses)

New Day Ability - Royal Decree
Choose a person. All of the day abilities the Assassin uses on that person
will not be notified to them. (2 uses)

Bat Eyelashes Buff
Entrance target player with your eyes into revealing their class type and 
framing them.

Handmaiden Rework/Buff
New Passive - Detective-Like
You will appear as an Investigative class for investigation result. (Passive
kept on during class change)

New Day Ability - Loyal Disguise 
Choose a member of the Unseen (including yourself) to disguise as Maid 
or MM. If they are executed, they will appear as that class. (infinite uses)

New Day Ability - Dissappearing Ink
Replace a person&#39;s ink with some dissapearing ink, making every change 
they make to their logbooks not be displayed today and tonight to everyone
if they are executed. They will still see the changes but everyone else 
won&#39;t. (3 uses)

Analyze Rework
Test and frame 2 players, if they win together, discover their classes. If 
they don&#39;t, silence them tomorrow for the entire day, they will stay be able
to use day abilities. 

Replace Prying Servant with Feather Duster 
Hide a player&#39;s logbook tonight if they are slain tonight. (2 uses)</description>

            <p>This is for the duchess, but having Private Notes available just means you can put logs there. Granted, if you die then, too bad, but the next day they would just write and keep logs</p>

<hr>
<p>tldr: there’s a few very okay ideas here, and a lot of flawed ones imo</p>
<p>making every invest convert nearly identical just sounds more boring than their current “weak” state</p>
<p>for the record, i think duchess and marshal aren’t <em>that</em> bad. duchess is easy to get kinged and marshal gets very decent info while removing a sheriff</p>
<p>handmaiden is weak though</p>

            <p>Changing the class type of certain Investigatives converts could make the game more fun. For example, right now Duchess is a weaker Marshal and could be fixed by making their class type change. But I think you looked at what would make the classes more useful, instead of looking at how these solutions would affect the game.</p>
<p>Princess Claims, Sheriffs, and Maid are all going to become untrusted. That is way too much flip changing to where it makes it so certain flips pretty much become “meh, could be unseen anyway ignore the fact they flip”</p>
<p>Like changing Duchess to more of a support type for the unseen could work, right now they are in a weird spot where they are investigative but their flirt is just a weaker marshal.</p>

            <p>Detective like passive is just a counter to princess only while disguise is a unlimited day ability so you can just use it at the moment the unseen is getting voted instead of predicting it so it’s too powerful</p>
<p>Marshal is too powerful due to having potential unlimited firewall of sage however having frame on probe is nice since aristocrat have that ability on intrigue</p>
<p>For Princess, dark wisp was useful for unseen with escaping from assassin getting found so I don’t think it need  change.</p>
<p>For maid, the change for analyze is better since finding two of the same class types is much harder to the point of impossible than finding two of the same win condition. Having both disappearing ink and feather duster on the same person seems to against each other as you can stop from writing their logs or just remove it if you kill them so keeping prying servant instead of replacing it is fine since it was a useful ability to finding NK quickly.</p>
<p>Overall at least the classes have a reason to live longer but they are just too over buffed.</p>

            <p>They are mechanically weak indeed.<br>
Marshal has no active ability<br>
Duchess can hide Unseen at least<br>
Handmaiden is utterly bad<br>
Nightwatch is purely passive as well</p>

            <p>im going to say the same thing - I like the buffs to the others, but I don’t like how strong the new marshal is. 3 probes, disguised, effectively can wall of fire with Stalker(unlimited use day abil). Also a hidden bleed would be nice, but does that mean they wouldn’t know if if they got silenced?</p>
