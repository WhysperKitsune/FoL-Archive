    <title>Psychic shouldn&#39;t be a target for Scorned</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/psychic-shouldnt-be-a-target-for-scorned/18105</link>
    <description>It&#39;s so easy to prove as psychic with the day ability, rendering any framing / scorned plays that the scorned makes useless. The only possible way scorned could win in this situation is convince the others that the psychic is converted. If its a cult game, however, and the psychic proves himself, then the game is over for the scorned. The game shouldn&#39;t punish the scorned for something thats out of his control, and he shouldn&#39;t have to completely avoid one of his targets until hes converted.</description>

            <p>We were discussing this in another thread.  I like the idea of giving the Scorned the ability to disable Day abilities, as I mentioned before, since it gives evils an excuse for not using their day abilities to confirm in general.</p>
<p>Of course, in this <span class="bbcode-i">specific</span> case, Psychics can usually confirm by posting a list of who they linked anyway, but at least they could still be accused of being converted.</p>

<p>Well it is still just as relevant as before. This way we don’t have to make a whole new post and go over what is already said.</p>

            <p>Woah, necromancy. Anyways, it is a good point. I’d personally replace Psychic and Telepathy, but it is pretty easy to confirm. I wouldn’t give Scorned any more powers.</p>

            <p>I agree, with <a class="mention" href="/u/sketch">@Sketch</a> Scorned should indeed get their classes. but maybe just “BD” or “NK” or something that doesn’t allow for a scorned to throw?</p>

            <p>I think the Scorned should be given the EXACT classes of their targets so they know how to frame their targets best.</p>

            <p>This can be compared with the prince. Hypothetically, if prince were a target for scorned, and scorned framed him/called him out, he would be dead within a day. Prince is easily proven due to the prince executing any prince claims, much like how the psychic is easily proven with day &amp; night abilities. The only difference is that prince is guaranteed to not be converted.<br>
Since psychic can prove by linking with king and using day abilities, hes not that far off from a non-converted guarantee. This is especially true in cult games. It would be rough and statistically rare if scorned had a prince target, yet the exception exists because it would naturally be near impossible for the scorned to pull it off with a decent bd. Same with the psychic.</p>

            <p>It can be a bit rough, but Scorned usually get two targets so if one is Psychic, try to get the other one?</p>
<p>Statistically it doesn’t come up much and let’s be honest, Scorned is mostly there just to keep Investigators from running roughshod over evil.  It’s more a necessary evil than anything.</p>

            <p>Right, but it would be late game when that happened. 4 uses of day abilities, plus being able to prove themselves every night makes it overall much easier to prove a psychic compared to other bd, like the knight or sheriff.</p>
