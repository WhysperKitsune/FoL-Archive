    <title>New Reaper Ability - &quot;Ghostwrite&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-reaper-ability-ghostwrite/52249</link>
    <description>I propose we give Reaper a new night ability that&#39;s actually along the lines of what&#39;s been requested already, &quot;Ghostwrite&quot;.  It allows the Reaper to edit the logs of a target that&#39;s already been reaped (at the cost of not being able to reap that night).  It&#39;s a &quot;Forge&quot; ability but renamed to fit the theme of Reaper :yum:

How it would work is when the night starts, you click the Ghostwrite button and the reaped guy&#39;s logs pop up for you to edit.  As soon as night ends they are saved as you&#39;ve left them and that&#39;s what BD sees tomorrow.

Also since we&#39;re talking about Reaper I would like to get a refund on the souls I&#39;ve lost when getting jailed after using Gather Darkness.  It hurts too much</description>

            <p>I like this, but I don’t think it should be instead of killing (it would rarely be used.)  And I would add something else on top of it:</p>
<p>When you successfully reap someone, you learn their role and get to see their will immediately, <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> you decide whether you want to pay to edit it.  That way you’ll know if they’re worth fiddling with.</p>
<p>I like giving NKs lots of information, since it helps make up for them being outnumbered 14-1 and encourages more interesting strategies (rather than just giving them raw power.)</p>
<p>Although honestly I think that letting reapers edit every will on someone they reap for free wouldn’t be a bad idea.  They could use the buff, and generally they’re encouraged to go with more minor and subtle tweaks to avoid outing the existence of a reaper.</p>

            <p>This is cool and all, but here’s one that would be better:</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Rider</strong> (night ability, infinite souls): Your head bursts into flames. That’s it.</p>

            <p>My suggestion, including this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="grey">Reaper</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="grey">Neutral Killer</font></strong></p>
<p>Passive: Consume Soul</p>
<p>Day Ability: Ghostwrite: Edit the reaped person’s logs. Costs one soul.</p>
<p>Night Ability: Reap</p>
<p>Night Ability: Gather Darkness: Reap + Gather Darkness, just in one action.</p>
</blockquote>
