<p>I like Alice’s opening for sure.<br>
The serious tone she has going and has set in full is imo townie but I know she’s a very good player so it’s a tentative read atm.</p>
<p>I am unsure how to feel about the Marshal attempt to ITA Vul straight away without discussion but since I’m going to try and avoid mechanical talk (Since that’s what made me make town lose JJBA Mash) I’ll just keep an eye on it for now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alice - Opening was by far the best out of everyone I’ve seen. She has started very seriously and is taking no prisoners. I believe that she is genuine townie atm who is trying to make sure everything runs smoothly<br>
You - I think your frustration with me and Kyo feels quite legitimate, no sort of wolf theatrics being played. Only reason you’re not higher is I dislike that you’re refusing me to be able to use meta, but the point you used of just using this game as is, is valid.<br>
Vul - Started off with a fairly early vote which is fine, backing up what they say early on which is good as they’re trying to promote discussion this way<br>
Sulit - Sulit is starting off really weakly and I think as scum they’d be putting more effort into early game to avoid being put in PoE.<br>
Mode - Seth is someone that I just don’t know how to properly read. He is often lacklustre (but much to my surprise did well last game). I believe this game his reactions have been genuine and that is why I think he is slight town.<br>
TBE - Blue is someone that did not act serious early on. However slowly evolved to take things more seriously and I believe Blue therefore has acted genuinely.</p>
<p>I realise I included Seth twice and EVO hadn’t even talked. I think I mixed EVO and Evil up but then that means I would’ve included EVO twice. Idk, I’ll read up from there and try to do so again.</p>
<p>Chloe - Chloe started off a bit quiet but then seemed to get more into things when I made the list. She made sure not to jump to conclusions too fast which I like tonally as well.<br>
Evil - Evil just didn’t seem to care at all. I think TWTBAW so far but I’ll be watching this slot in particular to see how it develops.</p>
<hr>
<p>SDA - Derps literally couldn’t make their mind up when I was posting going from serious to joking and back and forth. I think if Derps was town that they would attempt to actually just be one or the other as instead it feels like they’re trying to seem like they’re doing more (by posting a fair bit) while not contributing much.<br>
Kyo - I didn’t like the Kyo/Ici interactions looking back on it after all. I think that Ici is more townie though so Kyo is the likelier of the two to be scum. Kyo also kept trying to draw discussion back to the ‘types of PoE’ constantly.<br>
Cloned - Cloned, like Seth, is someone I admit to not be able to read easily. I believe that they some of their more recent posts are trying to seem like they’re contributing while not actually producing anything new<br>
Marshal - Marshal had by far the worst opening in my opinion. Their shot is the thing I keep harping back to but it is a focal point for this read. I believe that Marshal actually <em>knew</em> there weren’t any D1 shots but did this on purpose as wolf theatrics because people would quickly assume that they would be paying more attention as wolf and therefore would use this to slide under the radar. I also hate how when Alice was making her tentative town reads how Marshal was like “You’re missing me” which feels like LAMIST.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have not read anything recently that has happened due to making this though so I do hope that I’m not interrupting anything or posting at a bad time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I mean I don’t really have anything to add towards his reads.<br>
It has good content but it is PKR making them.</p>

<p>I’m trying hard not to claim.<br>
But since you’re obviously not being serious, just, please try SDA.<br>
I want to be able to re-evaluate my reads like 2-3 times today before day end.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He seems to maybe be hinting at something.</p>
<p>I’m pretty confident to just Town Read this slot for now and maybe Re-evaluate Day 3 after ITA’s.</p>

<p>Go through my ISO. I think it will be helpful solving some of the slots lower down on the list. I can’t be w/w with Chloe and I don’t think Seth can either. Either Seth is a wolf or Chloe is a wolf, unless Seth has this in his wolf range.</p>
