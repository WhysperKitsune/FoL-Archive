    <title>Guys...we need TO STOP WITH CW SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE CONFIRMABLE</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/guys-we-need-to-stop-with-cw-suggestions-that-are-confirmable/55285</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a big problem we are having

Confirmability.

And the problem with that is scum rely on some claims that are unconfirmable. Because unless you are a god and can fake mystic without ever using telepathy
I think you may experience this.

Court wizards claim lul 2018. Physician who hasn&#39;t confirmed them as a healer in 3 days? Lul. Knight claim? Princess claim? These are problems we are having right now.

And the main reason why it&#39;s hard to get classes that are not confirmable. Is the fact that the most fun abilties, telepathy noble making a prince vote a hunter, are all confirmable

And i keep seeing suggestions for court wizard like , making a person not be able to appear in court. And you know what that is . CONFIRMABLE!!! 

When making classes keep in mind that confirmablty is the problem we are having right now. They don&#39;t want court wizard to be confirmable.

And this is a tip to keep in mind for ANY CLASS YOU MAKE IN THE FUTURE.</description>
