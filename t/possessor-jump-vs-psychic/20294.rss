    <title>Possessor jump vs psychic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-jump-vs-psychic/20294</link>
    <description>If possessor jumps, the one who got jumped can easily tell psychic, and psychic can use day ability and get him killed literally the very next day. Seems a little unbalanced for an ability thats supposed to make possessor less suspicious actually get him killed in one day. If a psychic is known to exist, possessor would only be able to jump to the psychic, and even then that would be a terrible move since he cant prove with night or day abilities. Better than a guaranteed death a day letter I guess, should he jump to anyone else.
Perhaps make the one who got jumped unable to talk?
What do you guys think?</description>

            <p>I agree.</p>
<p>Your logic applies to other neutral killers as well: the mechanic of talking to the dead is problematic and punishes good plays.</p>
<p>If I chill the Sheriff because I don’t want him to out me as Reaper, they kill him and I should be fine. But if there’s a Psychic (and in a lot of games there are <strong>two</strong>) then I’m fucked regardless because he’ll just talk to them and tell them everything.  I would have wasted my abilities and efforts trying to make a good play when I’m already playing the hardest role in the game as a neutral killer.</p>
