    <title>Possessor passive in day abilities on class info</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-passive-in-day-abilities-on-class-info/34108</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
On the class info for Poss, the passive &#39;Driven&#39; was also in the day abilities as the only day ability.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Ability for facelift should be there instead
#### Steps to reproduce:
1) Click class portrait in a game.
2) Change to possessor.
3) Look at day abilities 
#### Comments:

Only appears in a game, not in the main menu
EDIT: Update 1.0.15 has changed the original image, I have also found that noble has similar issues. The following link will be updated if I find new classes with this.
