    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/in-game-mods-and-admins/1947</link>
    <description>Not sure what or if you have decided anything already
but here are my views

**for Release of tol**
**In game Roles**

#mods
 **muting -**  calm a situation down
 **kicking -**stop any further involvement in that current game(reconnect disable for that game)
 **temp ban -** a set number of days entered 1-14 days and you use your discretion on this developers would give you a recommend list upon getting mod

* Upon entering the sub menu you can select a option talk as a mod or admin in chat so if you happened to be playing that game it would not show your current game name just Admin or Mod.

* 2nd option in the sub menu would be take actions so next time you talk in chat until you delselect the option you could do 
/mute&gt;6 
/kick&gt;8
/tempban&gt;12&gt;8day
/permaban&gt;3 (if your a mod this is given the maximum time of 14 days while admin review evidence)

#Admins
same as mods

 **Permanent ban -** Permanent ban is placed of course they can appeal


#Admin Privilages

*  admins can see everyone&#39;s wills and death notes including there roles
_(Accessed by sub menu)_

*  they can also see all whispers and chats day and night nothing is hidden
_(Accessed by sub menu)_

*  admins can choose a game room to join whenever they want from sub menu, 
for instance if a report is filed they can follow that report up and join that room
**_(this could be applied to mods aswell if a report is filed they can choose the room to join)_**


**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**1.** The developers are obviously the people that choose who gets/does what,

**2.** i recommend that all mods in discord are given the recognition of admin status in game if they choose to accept this mission.
(god help anyone who gets fade as there admin-**Love you fade xxx**)

**3.** I Personally think people who played tol and fol that have showed there dedication to the game for instance:
Hippo
Plex
Pkr
Frost
ect. to name a few
_(mods/admins currently, know what i mean by certain people who have had dedication to the game and would report to the devs on this)_
These people would also be given admin status.

**4.** mods will be added later game release, these will be selected by developers/admins by way of open recruitment on the forum,
taking into consideration there history shows on activity in the forums and any marks upon themselves in game.


**Sub Menu Would contain:**

1. talk as mod/admin (activate button)

1. Take Actions (activate button)

3.  Reveal All - (activate button) - (this would be roles - chat/whispers/nighttime chat from all - wills and death notes - to gather any evidence needed)
4. report logs  - (would open a separate window) - (you would see all reports given, in take actions tab you could select /id478&gt;accept to accept that report so only one person works on the case)

5. Current Active Rooms - (opens a seperate window) - (In Take action you could do /Port&gt;6 to jump to room 6 for instance and the report id would obviously show who reported this and what room they were in anyway - its just a way to see what rooms are currently active if you just go on a lookout to check on different games basically a database to see where you want to go)



Anyone&#39;s thoughts welcome i&#39;m always looking forward to the future.

**edit**
In reference to gold as people may be worried about admins or mods cheating, but it has to be in place for evidence.
Mods and admins
1. They get 0 gold for that game if they access there ability.
Or
2. Admins/mods never get gold in game, 
But are given a monthly amount deposited to there account by developers for keeping there community in good order.</description>

            <p>I would say euro truck simulator 2 has mods and admins on 24/7.<br>
And God knows how many years down there line the multiplayer server still fills up.<br>
That game cost allot more and 10’s of thousands have been banned there.</p>

            <p>No offence if they want to do something that will be against tos in the first place.<br>
Then they chose that when they agreed to the tos.<br>
If they just play then there’s no issue personally.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t show yourself ever as a mod/admin as any actions taken by said mod/admin shouldn’t show your name it would say a admin is talking to you ect.<br>
If you don’t use any actions they would never know your in the game as your either be a viewer they can’t see or a game player that looks like everyone else.</p>

            <p>Precisely my point - BMG has not trusted more than a small handful of individuals to have any sort of power in their community, and they don’t even trust their own long-time moderators with any substantial power.</p>
<p>This is a detriment to their game.</p>
