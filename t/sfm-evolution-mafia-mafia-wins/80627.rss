    <description># [color=0AB74B]Evolution Mafia[/color]
&lt;small&gt; Hosted by sulit. Cohosted by Geyde. Setup originally created and hosted by Nz_Slimeables and azmine_king&lt;/small&gt;

### Rules
1) Follow all global forum rules.
2) Folow the Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies rules
3) If you haven&#39;t posted in 48 hours you will be prodded for activity. If you don&#39;t respond to that prod you will be force replaced or modkilled.
4) Gamethrowing is a no.
5) Memeposting is fine, but please refrain from excessive spamming, so much as it clogs the thread and makes it extremely hard for people to read up.
6) Players cannot use big text that uses less than 2 hashtags.
7) I will not tolerate any personal bashing and/or extreme toxicity towards players. If I find players doing this, I will give you a warning via PM. Doing it multiple times in the game will  warrant a replacement or modkill.
8) No editing or deleting posts.
9) Do not like posts in the thread if you are not able to post in it originally.

### The Evolution Mechanic
This game is different from regular FMs, and for a specific reason. In this game, I am introducing a special mechanic, the Evolution Mechanic.
[details=Evolution Mechanic: IMPORTANT]
Throughout the game, different events will pop up, which will give you the opportunity to earn [color=0AB74B]**Evolution Points**[/color]. These points can be used to upgrade your role. All players will start as vanilla, and their first [color=0AB74B]**Evolution Point**[/color] will allow them to evolve into a power role. Their second point will allow them to evolve into a stronger version of their previous role. Players can hold onto their evolve points for later nights, or downgrade from a role and pursue a different path.

All players, both mafia and town, are assigned a different role type, which corresponds with the following categories: Universal, Protective, Killing, Investigative, and Support.

Universal: These players are essentially wildcards. They can receive any variety of roles to evolve into. They can evolve into any of the roles of the other role types.
Protective: These players prevent others from dying or protect them from the actions of other roles.
Investigative: These players can gather and confirm information about the setup, the game, and the players.
Killing: These players can kill other players outside of the lynch.
Support: Roles that support the other 4 types.

Keep in mind that all role types will recieve the same evolution paths as other roles.

As an example, say you start as a Protective type. You receive an [color=0AB74B]**Evolution Point**[/color] and you can choose between a 1-shot Roleblocker or a Bodyguard. You choose Bodyguard, and you can use the abilities of that role until you die, devolve, or gain another point and evolve. If you get another point, you could evolve into a Rolestopper or a Doctor. Please note that this is an example and none of these roles are confirmed to be in the game.
[/details]
### Gameplay
Days are 48 hours long. Nights are 24
Role repeats are possible.
Lynch is plurality and majority.
There are no logs.
Feedback is limited. Investigators will be told results and if they were blocked. Players will be told if they were attacked but survived. 
To vote someone, use **/vote (player).** All other commands will be specified in PMs.
No player will be lied to. This includes changing win-conditions and changing flips.
Mafia has day and night chat.
Flavor, if I decide not to be lazy and write it, will always be not alignment indicative.
Scum has a factional.

**Evolution Specific:**
If a player gains an evolve point during the day, then they can evolve the following night and use their new roles ability. If they receive an evolve point at night, they won&#39;t be able to evolve until the next night.
Players can keep and save evolve points for later use. All evolve points are lost when you die. You cannot trade or give other players evolve points.
All players of the same role type will have access to the same roles.
Most day and night starts will come with an event that gives evolve points. Events can be anything ranging from a game to a voting system.
Any further questions about mechanics can be asked below in the thread or in role PMs

            <p>I mean it took 3 mislynches + 3 misvigs, games with town KP require fewer mislynches to win in most cases for obvious reasons</p>
<p>I don’t disagree that 12v5 is scumsided but on that metric it’s fairly close to balanced</p>

<p>Fair number of mislynches is number of mafia + 1</p>

            <p>Town had two kill classes, one that evolved into a Prince basically. It was 4 uninformed mafia to LW; if we didn’t pick up on Arete that could has been a misfire.</p>
<p>Is 5 starting scum in a 17 player fair? Not fully, but its not terrible either.</p>
<p>And that town player list literally had us crapping our pants. Most of you guys are good readers and obvious town when town players.</p>

            <p>imo when its not mountainous like this game was, i think it was fine. Maybe 4 would have been more balanced, but its a learning process</p>

            <p>For mashes the rule is 20-25% scum but for effectively vfm like this its not fair to have 5/17 imo</p>
