    <title>[Class Rework] Psychic Rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-rework-psychic-rework/43367</link>
    <description>Psychic (Blue Dragon Support)

Passive:
Call of the Dead: Speak to the dead at night

Day Ability 1:
Wisdom of the Dead: Send a message to all players. Can only be used while dead, 2 uses.

Night Ability 1:
Reanimate: Resurrect one dead Blue Dragon member as a Death Knight

Comments:
Psychic is a confused class, with abilities with no relation to each other. This will focus it on the dead, instead having interrogation powers like the prince, having private whispers (maybe better for Noble), and speaking to the dead. Wisdom of the Dead as replacement for Telepathy prevents Psychic from proving self while alive, and allows dead a couple messages with the living, even after Psychic is dead. Physician would need another ability in place of reanimate.</description>

            <p>Also. I would just keep reanimate on phys. Spreading out the dead Ability’s means you can think less about keeping them consistently in play.</p>

            <p>I suppose. But speaking to the dead should get its own class, since Psychic is ill suited to the ability. If the other abilities were the Psychic but speaking to the dead was another, that would work well.</p>

<p>Psychic is a confused class, with abilities with no relation to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Under the defenision of anonymous communication I’m going to show how all of this classes Ability’s work towards that end (exept talking to the dead)</p>
<p>Link minds: Its a secret night chat. Much like the prince no one knows who you are when you are talking. Far more useful in coordinating compared to Prince’s imprison which is better for interagation.</p>
<p>Telepathy: An anonymous message to everyone is definitely anonymous communication. It make any information more useful to the Psychic than any other class because you can out scum with none of the downsides associated with outing.</p>
<p>Private matter: Hiding your whispers may not make the communication hidden to your target but it does to everyone else. They don’t see any communication at all which makes it as anonymous as possible.</p>

            <p>I feel like Prince covers Link well enough. Sure imprison occupies, but that gives the Prince a lot of options. Even if Psychic stays mostly the same, there should be a class that can talk to the dead effectively, unlike Psychic, who is busy interrogating.</p>

            <p>Well ya. Why do you think they even bothered to slap the ability on there? Doesn’t mean we need to rework the class entirely. Unlike ToS classes can do thing outside of just 1 mechanic.</p>
<p>Noble, Hunter, Knight, CW, Drunk, Princess and Observer to name a few examples of other classes with Ability’s that don’t neciccaraly match with their main one.</p>

            <p>I’m reworking it on talking to the dead, because that makes the game more fun for the entire dead Blue Dragon. A secondary ability might help make the class more fun, but I think there needs to be a class that keeps the Blue Dragon engaged. Why do you think Medium is in ToS, or why Priest was made in the first place?</p>

            <p>Perhaps there is an ability that would suit Psychic better. But the current version is pretty bad as I see it. Link is basically a much weaker imprison, while Telepathy confirms itself. Wisdom of the Dead is much stronger because it announces to everybody, which means you are not screwed if you target evil.</p>
<p>Also, can you clarify which ability was slapped on after the fact?</p>

            <p>Remember. The Preist could do all of this and was STILL considered borring.</p>

            <p>Wisdom of the dead is a power that is only a bit stronger than what the medium has.</p>
<p>Also what about the illusionist?</p>
<p>ALSO WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE CLASS NOT BEING FOCUSED BY REWORKING IT AROUND AN ABILITY THAT WAS SLAPPED ON AFTER THE FACT.</p>

            <p>ToS medium is weak, but this has advantages. The reanimate is small I suppose, but the Wisdom of the Dead is a massive power.</p>
<p>The ability to know the results people had when they died is pretty powerful. It isn’t weak by any means, especially when you can out Possessor.</p>

            <p>Talking to the dead and reanimate are secondary Ability’s for a reason. They don’t hold up on its own.</p>

            <p>That’s weak and borring. Look and Toss medium. This is already nearly as weak as that. In other words this class is so weak that even in ToS it would be considered weak.</p>

<p>To fix THAT they tried making her revive also suicide kill herself. However this made the class basically: Wait for Prince to die, revive him, Sit out the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Reanimate would res as DK, as Physician does now.</p>
<p>I also imagine it would be guaranteed, so dead Blue Dragon can always send information to the living.</p>
