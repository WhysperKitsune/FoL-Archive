    <title>Class that robs Royal Blood passive</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-that-robs-royal-blood-passive/55428</link>
    <description>There have been some Vampire and Bastard classes proposed, I like this idea and I think the game could be made funner and &#39;deeper&#39; by the introduction of a Neutral Social class who&#39;s goal is to steal someone&#39;s Royal Blood passive and become King.  It would also introduce plausible deniability for fake royalty claims not being able to step up.

For example:

&gt; **The Bastard** (Neutral Social)
&gt; 
&gt; Passives
&gt; **Determination:**  Immune to death at night.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Abilities
&gt; **DÃ©rogeance:**  Visit a player.  If they have Royal Blood you will steal it.  Can only be used if you haven&#39;t stolen Royal Blood already, and will fail if target is barriered by Court Wizard.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Abilities
&gt; **Royal Trollbox:**  Trollbox the King.
&gt; 
&gt; Goals
&gt; Become King.</description>

<p>Imo itâ€™s not. Firstly, you need to try to hunt for a royal blood which is hard, then you need to try to get king either hung or convince the alch that are on him to be not on him or hope that there is a reaper that will use gather darkness on him, then you need to convince people to vote you for</p>
<p>I mean you could make him immune to death once instead of being perma immune, I could see how it might be easy</p>

<p>It could be made more difficult by requiring that in order to steal someoneâ€™s royal blood, that player must visit you the same night you visit them.  So you would have to bait your target into visiting you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Bastard steals royal blood, there may not be any other royal blood to contest him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is true, but maybe okay if we make his goal harder to achieve like just described.  You could also simply spawn an extra Royal Blood in Bastard games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a player armed with trollbox could quite easily get king killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then simply donâ€™t let Bastard have trollbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I claim some Bastard stole my royal blood, then the only possibility is that one of the people who stepped up is the Bastard. If only one person steps forward, they will know they arenâ€™t the bastard, and it is implausible that the bastard wouldnâ€™t step up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let the Bastard win only if he survives the day he is elected.  That way someone who steps up and automatically becomes King because they are the only one with Royal Blood can be accused of being the Bastard, and the motive for hanging them immediately is so they canâ€™t order execute someone that night.</p>
<p>So if you lie and say the new King is the Bastard who stole your Royal Blood, Blue Dragon would have to take your accusation seriously for fear of a yolo order exe that night.  Or whatever punishment to BD is found fit to make people scared of allowing a Bastard King to survive the day</p>

            <p>A fun idea, but I think this is a bit too easy.  There are only so many royal blood players in each game.  If the Bastard steals royal blood, there may not be any other royal blood to contest him.  So this is somewhat of a scorned for king (although king need not be hung) with an additional goal of identifying a living drunk/princess/noble/prince.  King is so powerful (and more likely than any other specific player to be evil) that a player armed with trollbox could quite easily get king killed.</p>
<p>As far as creating space for fake royal claims, Iâ€™m not sure this does much.  If I claim some Bastard stole my royal blood, then the only possibility is that one of the people who stepped up is the Bastard.  If only one person steps forward, they will know they arenâ€™t the bastard, and it is implausible that the bastard wouldnâ€™t step up.</p>

            <p>There have been some Vampire and Bastard classes proposed, I like this idea and I think the game could be made funner and â€˜deeperâ€™ by the introduction of a Neutral Social class whoâ€™s goal is to steal someoneâ€™s Royal Blood passive and become King.  It would also introduce plausible deniability for fake royalty claims not being able to step up.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Bastard</strong> (Neutral Social)</p>
<p>Passives<br>
<strong>Determination:</strong>  Immune to death at night.</p>
<p>Night Abilities<br>
<strong>DÃ©rogeance:</strong>  Visit a player.  If they have Royal Blood you will steal it.  Can only be used if you havenâ€™t stolen Royal Blood already, and will fail if target is barriered by Court Wizard.</p>
<p>Day Abilities<br>
<strong>Royal Trollbox:</strong>  Trollbox the King.</p>
<p>Goals<br>
Become King.</p>
</blockquote>
