    <title>The Count[Neutral Offensive]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-count-neutral-offensive/2193</link>
    <description>Lore: The King&#39;s lesser known second son was cast out from the royal family at an early age for being a &quot;monster&quot;, or an &quot;aberration&quot;, The King, however, pitied his son, and so left him a title and an estate,  but now The Count has returned, and cares not for his father&#39;s pity, he simply wants the throne for himself

**Passive:** Barely Human - The Count is immune to Death at Night
**Passive:** Corrupted Blood - The Count may step up to become The King, however if anyone with Royal Blood steps up, he will be forced to step down
**Night Ability 1:** Bloodsucker - Occupy a player, discovering whether they are a Royal - Infinite Uses
**Night Ability 2:** Fratricide - Kill a player, if they are not a Royal this attack will fail - 3 uses(cannot be used on The King)
**Day Ability 1:** Haunting Whispers - Your next whisper will be completely anonymous

**Objective:** Become the King(you win if this happens and do not have to survive like the neutral king)</description>

</aside>
<p>so essentially if any other royals step up he is screwed, as they know he is the count?</p>

</aside>
<p>so he can’t do anything about the nobles, seeing as they are immune to death at night?</p>

            <p>Thing is, when Count becomes King, what would happen? He becomes Neutral King with wincon of The Count? Could you explain that a bit more for me?</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a good Class, almost like Greedy but Throne of Lies friendly</p>
