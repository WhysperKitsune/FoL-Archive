    <description>Copycat
BD Support

Duplicate (Day): Choose a player, you will become their class tonight if they are BD, this lasts until the end of the night, if they were converted you will become their original class and if they started as non-BD you will get a random BD class - Infinite Uses, cannot be used on the same person twice, cannot be used on the King

Changeling
Unseen Support

Mimic (Day): Choose a non-unseen player, become the Unseen version of their class tonight if they can be converted, if they can&#39;t the ability will fail, effect wears off at the end of the night - Same restrictions as Duplicate

Notes:
Might work better as a Neutral idk</description>
