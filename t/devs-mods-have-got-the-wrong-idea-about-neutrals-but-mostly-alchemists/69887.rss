    <title>Devs/Mods have got the wrong idea about Neutrals (but mostly Alchemists)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/devs-mods-have-got-the-wrong-idea-about-neutrals-but-mostly-alchemists/69887</link>
    <description>Felt compelled to write this after reading this thread: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/gamethrowing-neutrals/69827/35

It&#39;s probably misguided to call it &quot;gamethrowing&quot;, but there&#39;s a certain type of behaviour that neuts engage in that needs to be discouraged (_not banned_) for the good of the game. It&#39;s hard to define so I will preface it with a scenario that is sure to jog memories of a game you&#39;ve played, because it&#39;s very common.
___________________________________

**Remaining players:** Alch (0 stoneskins remaining, 0 bombs remaining), Possessor (no jumps left), Assassin (no poison charges remaining), Herbalist
**Votes required for a trial:** 3
______________
**Day 7**
Everyone at this point is aware of who&#39;s what. Assassin and Herbalist accuse the Possessor of treason and ask the alchemist to vote with them.

The Alchemist, knowing they are out of resources and have only the ability to heal, has two choices.

1. Accuse the Possessor of treason, thus securing your win 100% of the time and ending the game that day.
2. Side with the Possessor, putting your win at risk and prolonging the game by up to 2 additional days, forcing dead players to wait 4 extra minutes to get full game gold or report a player who broke a rule earlier in the game.

The Alchemist decides they are going to side with the Neutral killer.

**Night 7**
Unable to kill the Possessor with abilities, the Assassin attacks the Alchemist and kills them. Possessor kills the Herbalist.

**Day 8**
2 players remain. Nothing can be done.

**Night 8**
Possessor kills assassin.

**Day 9**
Possessor wins!
______
Now in this scenario the Alchemist has an option whereby they vote with Unseen and the game immediately ends, 100% of the time. They chose not to pursue this option for their own reasons. The consequences of one player making this choice means all remaining players, living or dead, have to sit through the extra theatrics this choice generates, often needlessly, because the Alchemist wants to side with a specific person instead of guaranteeing their win condition. I pose this question: **_Why is this behaviour not discouraged?_**

The mantra expressed by the Mods and Devs is like that of a hippie who&#39;s smoked too much doobie: _&quot;You just be yourself man, side with whoever you want man it&#39;s a free world! &#39;Other players&#39; is just a social construct man they&#39;re not real!&quot;_

Statements like the ones below are incredibly naive to the negative experiences behavior like the scenario above generates.

[quote=&quot;í42-Xblade, post:33, topic:69827&quot;]
Alchemists choosing a side is **not** going against their own objective.
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;í42-Xblade, post:33, topic:69827&quot;]
If they want to choose and they still aim to win, that’s not going against their objective – just a perk of being neutral.
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;í42-Xblade, post:28, topic:69827&quot;]
You’re NK - that is, **neutral** killer. You can side with whoever you want. If it doesn’t work out, you can blow them off at the last second. It’s not troll – it’s **[neutral](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neutral)** .
[/quote]

There&#39;s a reason Alchs get a bad reputation despite everyone loving it when they play as them, it&#39;s because this sort of behavior is not discouraged and consequently happens often. 

The Alch win condition is described quite clearly: **&quot;Survive&quot;**. When you have an option where you have a 100% chance to survive and win the game, and you then choose a significantly worse option not only for you, but every other player that just wants the game to end so they can cast their MVP votes, collect their full gold, report a player, etc; why is there no rule, statement, or gameplay design that discourages players from doing that?

Pseudo-Kingmaker Alchs (Alchs that give their life to decide the victor) make every game objectively worse. It is honestly baffling that it has been allowed to happen for so long, and I am disappointed that the rules haven&#39;t been changed to at the very least acknowledge this behavior creates no positive experiences ingame (with the exception of who Alch sides with).</description>

            <p>Generally Neutrals throwing is very debatable alch can play risky and side with evils I do that a lot more then being a bd Helper, I generally yolo and try to help nk or unseen as alch</p>
<p>Heck as Mercenary you still don’t objectively have to help bd you can side with Nk if they are alive.</p>

            <p>Agreed, but it should be punishable for NKs, fools, scorned, mercs, and sellsword at least. Unlike alchs, they have a win con other than survive. It wouldn’t be fair for the unseen/cult if the NK decided to side with BD and allowed themselves to be killed</p>

            <p>So after all’s said and done, would a tip such as “You want to end the game as fast as possible to stop any of the factions from being able to kill you.

            <p>If your condition was merely “defeat the NK” then yes, you went against it.  But your condition also states to defeat Cult.  Pardoning the NK is an attempt at fulfilling the entirety of your condition.  So it’s not going against it.</p>

            <p>I’m of the opinion that Alch can pretty much side with who they want, as even in the King vs 2 unseen vs Alch example, there are reasons why an alch might want to side with a king, regardless of whether it helps him win or not.</p>

<p>Actually no. Pardoning Neutral Killer as Good King in order to prevent Cult from reaching majority is an attempt at fulfilling your win condition.</p>

<p>I pardoned someone I believed to be the Neutral Killer. My win condition states I must defeat neutrals that seek to do me harm. I am going against what the game instructs me to do.</p>

            <p>Put another way, if Alchemist believes Hunter is bearing and attacks him anyway with the intent of dying to bear, he’s gamethrowing.</p>
<p>It’s just a hypothetical to prove the statement, “<strong>Alchemist can’t gamethrow</strong>” is false.</p>

            <p>People trying to come up with specifics are missing the point that if we just <em>don’t encourage this behavior</em> everybody is happy</p>
<p>It doesn’t need to be super-reportable and clog the reporting system as long as a strong message is sent that you should always try to win, even as a Neutral. That’s it.</p>
