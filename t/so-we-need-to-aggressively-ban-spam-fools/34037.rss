    <title>So, we need to aggressively ban Spam Fools</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/so-we-need-to-aggressively-ban-spam-fools/34037</link>
    <description>Because I&#39;m seeing it A LOT now.

They ignore everything and spam the chat so no one else can play, get executed and are of course, Fools.
