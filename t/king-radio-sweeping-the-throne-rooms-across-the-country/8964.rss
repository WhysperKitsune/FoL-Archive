    <title>King Radio! Sweeping the throne rooms across the country</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-radio-sweeping-the-throne-rooms-across-the-country/8964</link>
    <description>Most psychic link the king and 1 more every night. And I don&#39;t know why I find myself playing king more times then not but (including evil king). Anytime I&#39;m linked I try and put thoes on the other side at ease by shouting &quot;YOUR ON KING RADIO!!!&quot; &quot;CLASS AND LOGS PLEASE&quot; the goal of any king is to be charismatic and make BD want to follow him (even if your evil) soon enough after 2 nights i jad the phychic saying king radio then I found someone else saying it a few games later. 

Spread the word King Radio is coming to a throne near you!</description>

            <p>Yea but it make people feel more at ease if the king is asking for all of the information and the phyc hangs back.  Some kings may like that but some kings are meant to out the burden on their shoulders. It’s a hard road at the too but thoes who lead but do so by example</p>

            <p>If you’re the psychic, it’s best to do as much of the talking in that chat as possible. The King has a lot to do and jot down. Having to type “I’m the king, class and log please” every night is tiring. It’s a big help if the psychic does that part. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
