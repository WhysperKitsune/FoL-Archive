    <title>What did the Court Wizard use to be?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-did-the-court-wizard-use-to-be/46071</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve only been playing for a couple months, so I am ignorant about what a lot of the classes used to be.

I&#39;ve heard a lot of the names of the Court Wizard&#39;s old abilities, so I am curious as to what they did.

If their are any other classes that have changed a lot, I would like to know about those too.</description>

            <p>Here’s a history of the CW from the patch notes on the forums. I was only around from 1.0.5 onwards, so I can’t really comment much about on the patches before that. Each patches changes from the previous are bolded. (Sorry that this post is so big, wanted to cover everything. Let me know if you know anything that’s missing.)</p>
<p>0.8.28 (I’m very unsure about this one, there’s no notes before this one to base the changes on)<br>
Non-Unique<br>
Day Abilities: Unsure of effect.<br>
Night Ability 1: Magic Barrier (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Unsure of effect. (Blocks day abilities?)<br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (? uses) - Single target occupy (not King or self). If succeeds with occupying, also prevent all visitors to the target.</p>
<p>0.9.4<br>
Non-Unique<br>
Day Abilities unchanged, unsure of effect.<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: <strong>Magic Barrier</strong> (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevents all negative effects except for kills and conversions.<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2</strong>: Ice Ward (<strong>2</strong> uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target. <strong>(does not occupy anymore)</strong></p>
<p>0.9.8<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Day Abilities removed.</strong><br>
Night Ability 1: Magic Barrier (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevents all negative effects except for kills and conversions.<br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (2 uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target.</p>
<p>0.9.16<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: Magic Barrier (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevents all negative effects <strong>and conversions</strong>, but not kills. <strong>(added occupy immune notification for occupier if blocks their occupy)</strong><br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (2 uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target.</p>
<p>1.0.2<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: Magic Barrier (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevents all negative effects and conversions, but not kills. <strong>(added notification for CW if barrier blocks an effect)</strong><br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (2 uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target.</p>
<p>1.0.5<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: Magic Barrier (infinite uses) - <strong>Two targets</strong>. Prevents all negative effects and conversions, but not kills.<br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (2 uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double magic barrier was capable of keeping two BD unconverted for as long as the CW lived, and even when used randomly often led to games where the unseen/cult got no converts early in the game, making it harder for them to win late game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0.8<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: <strong>Ice Ward</strong> (infinite uses) - Single target (not King or self). Prevent all visitors to the target. Can only be used on each target twice a game.<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2</strong>: <strong>Recharge</strong> (1 use) - Single target (not King or self). Grants an extra use of all limited use abilities to the target. Doesn’t work on Physician Reanimate or Prince that has executed a BD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The forced limit on how many times each player could be warded often led to court wizards having nothing to do early game, since using wards late game was often more useful. Recharge was only ever used to confirm the Court Wizard, since the only classes that found the extra charges useful was the Hunter and Alchemists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0.9<br>
Non-Unique<br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: <strong>Tornado</strong> (infinite uses) - Two targets (not King). All players targeting one of the targets will instead be redirected to the other target.<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2</strong>: <strong>Ice Ward</strong> (2 uses) - Prevent all visits to you tonight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was one of the least fun times I’ve had playing this game. Oftentimes you’d get redirected two or more times a night, leading all invest and limited use abilities to go astray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0.10<br>
<strong>Unique</strong><br>
Night Ability 1: Tornado (infinite uses) - Two targets (not King). All players targeting one of the targets will instead be redirected to the other target.<br>
Night Ability 2: Ice Ward (2 uses) - Prevent all visits to you tonight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making the tornado heavy court wizard unique reduced the amount of randomness in the game, but made it near impossible for evil to claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0.14<br>
<strong>Non-Unique</strong><br>
<strong>Night Ability 1</strong>: <strong>Magic Barrier</strong> (infinite uses) - One target (not King or self). Prevents all negative effects and conversions, but not kills.<br>
Night Ability 2: Tornado (<strong>3</strong> uses) - Two targets (not King). All players targeting one of the targets will instead be redirected to the other target. <strong>No longer redirects occupy immune players</strong></p>

            <p>I also remember there being a version of barrier that blocked day Ability’s the next day and a version of ice ward that was infinite but occupied the target. There was also a version of ice ward that was infinite but could only be used twice per target.</p>

            <p>CW went through tons of changes.The last one I can remember was that CW ha an ability called Ice Ward which was basically fool’s hide and Magic Barrier targeted 2 players,told you if you blocked something,didn’t stop death but stopped conversions.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>It seems having Tornado be the main thing must have been much more interesting than magic barrier. It might have been a better focus for the class.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t want to imagine Unseen/Cult dealing with double magic barrier.</p>

            <p>If I am correct:</p>
<p>They used to have a ability called “recharge” that can recharge 1 person’s ability for 1 uses.</p>
<p>And before tornado was introduced, it have a ability called “Ice Ward”, it occupied someone, but in exchange for making that one person immune to be visited.</p>
<p>Also, magic barrier used to target two people.</p>
