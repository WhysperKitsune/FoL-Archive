<p>The man walked through the gallery feeling the objects at his hands. He knew that they had history, memories, and feelings all locked within. The world was more than what we saw and the items he held were proof of that. While others couldn’t feel the emotions coming off of an old dagger, a talisman or book, he could and every day it was his strength and his burden. Hearing the trouble in Castle Aldiart, the Occultist found some of his favourite items and went into the castle, for he alone could find the evil lurking within.</p>
<p><strong>The Occultist - Blue Dragon Social</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Passives</strong><br>
None</p>
<p><strong>Day Abilities</strong><br>
Aura Reading (2 Uses)<br>
For the rest of the day, when a player is Pardoned or Executed after being on trial, you will learn how many Unseen, Cult and Neutral players Pardoned them (if they were Executed) or Executed them (if they were Pardoned). You will not learn who.</p>
<p>Scrying (1 Use)<br>
Tonight you will be able to hear the messages of the Unseen and Cult to each other. Their names and actions will be hidden. The Unseen and Cult will be given a message that they are being <em>Scryed Upon by an Occultist</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Night Abilities</strong><br>
Psychometry (Unlimited)<br>
Target a dead or living player other than a King. You see the results of their final night’s actions if they are dead or die this night. If targeting a body that was switched with a Possessor you will instead become prevented.</p>
<p>Prognostication (2 Uses)<br>
You become immune to death tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Day Abilities</strong><br>
Aura Sense (1 Use)<br>
For the rest of the day, when a player is Pardoned or Executed after being on trial, you will learn which Pardons are Neutral players (if they were Executed) and which Executions are Neutral players (if they were Pardoned).</p>
<p>Shared Seance (2 Uses)<br>
Today all Unseen members will be able to whisper each other without their whispers being seen by others.</p>

Tonight and tomorrow you will be able to hear messages between a target and whoever they talk to or whisper. You cannot target the King.</p>

<p>The Occultist fills a Social Role with a splash of Investigation with their <strong>Psychometry</strong> and <strong>Aura Reading</strong> abilities. They gain only snippets of information, though with clever thinking one can easily start to narrow down where the Unseen, Cult and Neutrals are located. Through their <strong>Scrying</strong> they can also see the Unseen and Cult night chats, or force them to talk less openly once they are warned about a scryer. This allows them to have a unique source of information that many other classes are not privy to.</p>
<p>The existence of the Curator also allows the Unseen to talk during the day using <strong>Shared Seance</strong>, letting them plan new strategies during a time when many people wouldn’t think they are capable. This allows them to escape not being able to plan due to the Prince and their Jail, or even set up fake claims during the day on the fly.</p>
<p>Due to the Occultist existing, the Scum factions must play smart with executions, though due to the Occultist having no provable abilities, it grants Scum another role to claim and hide in. The presence of the Occultist’s <strong>Prognostication</strong> can explain away the lack of dying from Masterminds or for classes like Alchemists, Scorned and Night Killers.</p>
<p>Ultimately while the role has some power it provides more claimspace for Scum players and provides Blue Dragon with a strange, yet usable source of information.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and any comments! I mostly do this for myself as a creative outlet but figured its fun to post them up anyway. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png!v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Change Log</summary>
<p>v1.1 - Changed Prognostication so that it functions properly. Changed Aura Reading (Curator) to Aura Sense (Allowing them to find Neutrals). Moved Ghastly Scrying (Curator) so that it is a Night Ability and can now target a player and see all whispers they have that night and the next Day. Shared Seance (Curator) is now a Day Ability.</p>
<p>v1.0 - Created</p>

          <p>Aura reading is too strong on Occultist, and useless on Curator. Might make for a decent Scorned claim.</p>
<p>I like Psychometry as a skill, Scrying is either useless or really strong since it effectively prevents the unseen from talking that night.</p>

          <p>I’m still in the air for the Curators day ability. It’s really a placeholder until I come up with something better.</p>
<p>Aura Reading might make stray Abstains susp though it misses the mark on Mass Exe and Mass Pardons.</p>
<p>Scry has some power but you still need to judge the intentions of what they say. Might even create new codes as a work around and it’s own mini metagame.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<p>I’d swap this with Ghastly Scrying (make this a day ability), and change Scrying to eavesdrop on ANY conversation one may be having (mystic or prince).</p>

<p>Currently liking the unconfirmability of Occultist! That’s a major plus in my book.</p>
<p>Psychometry is really interesting, and I wouldn’t change it.<br>
Prognostication needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Curator needs some additions though to start being more useful.</p>

<p>v1.1 - Changed Prognostication so that it functions properly. Changed Aura Reading (Curator) to Aura Sense (Allowing them to find Neutrals). Moved Ghastly Scrying (Curator) so that it is a Night Ability and can now target a player and see all whispers they have that night and the next Day. Shared Seance (Curator) is now a Day Ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked a lot of the changes that you recommended. While Prognostication isn’t a Social ability, its more just there to allow for other classes to have another Claim to work with.</p>
<p>I thought about making the Curator Unique, but I’m going to think on it some more. With how uncomfirmable it is, making it Unique shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
