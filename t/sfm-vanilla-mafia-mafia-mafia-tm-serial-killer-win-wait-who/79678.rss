*Or how to overcomplicate game with very basic roles*

## General rules:
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926
 
## Game rules:
&gt; **Phases:** 48/24
&gt; **Lynch:** Plurality on deadline. Ties equal no lynch.
&gt; **Night actions:** RAR. 
&gt; All actions to be submited 1 hour before night ends.
&gt; 
&gt; ALL ALIGMENTS, ROLES AND MODIFIERS ARE ROLLED SEPERATLY.
&gt; Yes, that means (nearly) each role can be of any aligment.
&gt;
&gt; Each non-vanilla role has 20% chance to receive random modifier.
&gt; If they received modifier, roll repeats (another 20% roll to get 2nd if they got the first ect.)
&gt; 
&gt; Each time mafia is rolled, 20% chance it will create NEW mafia faction instead of joining one of the old ones.

## Aligment distribution:
&gt; [color]Town
&gt; Town
&gt; Town

&gt; [color=ligblue]Scum (NK or Mafia)
&gt; Scum[/color]
&gt; Any (Town, Mafia, Any Neutral)
