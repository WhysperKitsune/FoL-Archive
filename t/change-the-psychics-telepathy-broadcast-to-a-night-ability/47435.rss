    <title>Change the Psychic&#39;s Telepathy broadcast to a night ability</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-the-psychics-telepathy-broadcast-to-a-night-ability/47435</link>
    <description>The Psychic&#39;s telepathy allows them to trivially prove that they haven&#39;t been converted.  While the Psychic already has several ways to prove, Telepathy is unique in that it&#39;s instant, mid-day, relies on nobody else and cannot be duplicated by any evil in any way.  There&#39;s no [i]reason[/i] why the Psychic needs such a powerful way to prove, since there&#39;s several alternative designs for Telepathy that could limit its effectiveness for proving while still serving what I think its key purpose is (anonymously outing people who refuse to claim.)

I suggest making it a night ability that displays your chosen message the next morning.

Alternatively, it could send the message in the middle of the night, which would change it in several ways and could potentially be a buff - eg. a Psychic could learn something from someone during their link, then immediately use Telepathy to inform all the BD so they can take it into account for their actions that night.  I don&#39;t think that buff is necessary, though; having Telepathy be a Night ability that sends the message the next morning works fine.

Another alternative would be to have it be a Day ability that sends the message at the start of the night.  Either way, this would mean that Psychics who want to irrefutably prove that they haven&#39;t been converted would have to wait a day to do so (and, of course, they could be converted in the intervening night), which would make it more possible to mislynch a Psychic and wouldn&#39;t allow them to automatically remove themselves from consideration when BD is trying to figure out who the last evil is.</description>
