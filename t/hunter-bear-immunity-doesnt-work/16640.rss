    <title>Hunter bear immunity doesnt work</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/hunter-bear-immunity-doesnt-work/16640</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Was in a game as hunter, and used my bear n1. Cult leader attacked me n1, and we both died

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Bear should of made me Immune and killed the CL. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
use bear as hunter, and have someone attack him that night. both players will die. 
#### Comments:

i also was in a game where this happened to someone else. Once it happened to me I came here to submit this report.
Edit:
it did not say he was empowered on my end to bypass immunity</description>

            <p>Just saw it.</p>
<p>Night 1.  Hunter bears.<br>
Hunter and Sorcerer both die.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t Sorc be immune to that and shouldn’t Hunter have lived?<br>
Everyone was confused to say the least.</p>
<p>Edit: Random Theory: Bear is stripping immunities of everyone who visits instead of giving them to Hunter?</p>

            <p>It did happen today, just 20 minutes ago to be exact. The other game was also today but a few hours earlier. Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>Well if it happened after today’s patch, empower no longer exists. However if it happened before today you would not be informed of the empower. There’s no special message for something that overcomes immunity. Just as today I redirected a reaper that was using his bypass immunity ability, the only message I got was “your soul was reaped”.</p>
