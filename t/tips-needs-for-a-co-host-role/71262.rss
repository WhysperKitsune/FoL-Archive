            <p>pro tip: all your scumreads are 100% more accurate than normal if you sub into a slot, so be sure that if me or marl is subbing in to turn the role you subbed out into an Ascetic Miller to counteract this possbility</p>

            <p>Most co-hosts don’t usually do replacements but in case you have to, be sure to not replace anyone at night. Hippo replaced in during Poker Mafia and got killed by mafia immediately since they know he is a good player, didn’t even get the chance to play.</p>

            <p>I know and I get that. I just feel like it might work slightly better like ToL in the tournment style though. As I said, still retweking, so not necessarily will use traditional, but I’m still leaning that way slightly</p>

            <p>Mehhhh, could have been better tbh. This is why I need to improve if I do run it again in the future. I still may include keys as prizes again, but kinda wish we had newer people to join than vets. But with plyers like Solic and what have you, who knows? Hopefully if perfected next time (might try a different co-host this time and may stick with the traditional night results), it may be a three part game which I wished to do last time. Time will tell</p>

            <p>Wasn’t only you. We had a much earlier Cult Leader who never even confirmed, so I don’t really blame you. I just kinda had a bit of a panic when you went inactive and didn’t warn me you went on holiday</p>

            <p>I would recommend much longer than 10 minutes, as players can still angleshoot.</p>
<p>Ngl, the dirtiest angleshoot used was in Ashe’s Cult in the Jungle game, where she first announced a replacement. Then there was a very long delay when the thread should have opened and lo and behold, we had an inactive maf kill suddenly active. It was an insta lynch that point. The way that could have been prevented, rng kill, open thread for a bit, about four/five hours after, announce the new player. None would be any wiser and will not suspect a replacement.</p>
<p>Same with Ici’s game. He kinda had no tolerance, which was fair I guess as it was a bigger game and someone said that Hip not being modkilled should hve pointed them as maf.</p>
<p>In FolT (when I did a tournament game), I had an inactive Cult member and got no replacement. I modkilled the slot and didn’t reveal the flip to make things fair. People were kinda upset since if it was an important class, they thought I wouldn’t replace them. I’m not that crazy in games. If they were important. I’d keep the flip secret still, but give the card to someone else (but obviously not to a scum member or nk, that would be stupid). Always think far ahead like this as I did have a feeling we would not get one.</p>
