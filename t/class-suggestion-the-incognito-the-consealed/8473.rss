    <description>The incognito - BD Social
Passive: Royal blood - You can step up to be king
Passive: Renowned - The prince will learn you are the incognito the first time you are jailed

Day ability 1: Disguise - Choose a class to disguise as tonight. If you are investigated then you will appear as this class. (unlimited)
Day ability 2: Reveal - Everyone will be told your class. You cannot be voted up this day or the next. You cannot be converted next night. You can no longer use your ability&#39;s. Unless they are an investigative class or occupy immune they will not receive other feedback if you fake occupy them.(1 use)

Night ability: Sweet talk - Your target will receive the message they would have gotten from being targeted by your disguised class. If you are not disguised then the target will be told your class. (unlimited)

The Consealed - Unseen Social

Passive: Royal blood - You can step up to be king

Day ability 1: Disguise - Choose a class to disguise as tonight. If you are investigated then you will appear as this class. If you die before the next day you will flip as the disguised class. (unlimited)

Night ability: Sweet talk - Your target will receive the message they would have gotten from being targeted by your disguised class. (unlimited)

Note: You may be wondering what the point of the Incognito is (the Concealed is basically a ToS disg+hypno). The idea is that because you can easily prove to anyone at anytime your class it means that you can afford to lie and use fake claims to get more info. If you need to you can check how someone reacts to getting targeted by specific classes to get an idea of their class (how do they react to being attacked for example).</description>

            <p>That would be a death sentence anyways because he can just make you reveal. Luckily I came up with a different solution!</p>

            <p>I think the concealed should have the renowned passive just so if he was jailed once before the prince got the message but if he is converted and jailed again prince would instantly know he is evil and exe him</p>
