    <title>WHat does everyone think about the reaper</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-does-everyone-think-about-the-reaper/717</link>
    <description>I could honestly see this role getting out of hand if not controlled in game. Its ability to survive if it has at least one soul is devastating. I&#39;ll have to wait until i see it in game but i think it may be a bit Op, what&#39;s everyones opinion on it?</description>

            <p>Reapers eating souls when attacked is just a worse version of night immunity, that can stay.</p>
<p>I do like the idea of two reapers being their own faction… We’d have to flesh them out a bit but it’s certainly possible.</p>

            <p>I even recalled I was in match with two reapers, I was one of two reapers that can’t be even voted against because I am invalid number and stays on the corner being the Blair Witch and nothing can be done to kill me while I collect more souls.</p>
<p>Yes, two reapers should be faction of their own without BR or Cult but since we’re making this role Unique, which will balance things out in Beta.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>NO matter the number of players, I think there should be only 1 Reaper per game.</strong>  It’s currently the strongest of the Neutral killers based on multiple factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Target doesn’t show dead until 2 days later.  This allows 2 days in hiding with no knowledge of an NK at all.  If two reapers in a game, this gets crazy, as they can potentially kill <strong>6 People</strong> before anyone knows that they exist!</li>
<li>Reaped players are unable to be revived by the Priest.  While this does help the Reaper’s end-goal, his ability to go undetected and even survive death by consuming souls means that this ability is literally a cherry on top of a 6 layer chocolate cake with icing.  Also, for those unfamiliar with the game, this just makes playing the Priest frustrating.  I’ve seen numerous players already confused why they couldn’t resurrect someone who had been Reaped.</li>

            <p>everything is op and that coming back from the dead feature is weaker than just having death immunity. also unlike possessor reaper can’t occupy other people and can be occupied the only up thing reaper has is killing those who are immune and that is more likely to miss than be a hit so it’s balanced as far as I see it</p>
