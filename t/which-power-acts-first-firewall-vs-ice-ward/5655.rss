    <title>Which power acts first? (Firewall vs Ice Ward)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/which-power-acts-first-firewall-vs-ice-ward/5655</link>
    <description>So, I was looking at CW, and its not unique. What would happen if a converted CW (Sage) and a CW both tried to fire wall and ice ward the same target? Ice ward prevents all other visitors, firewall prevents all visitors except the assassin. So would firewall prevent the CW from ice warding, or would the ice ward prevent the sage from firewalling? Do powers resolve in some kind of order?</description>

            <p>I would think that would only be like that when it’s the same class. This kind of thing can have an consistent answer since its 2 different classes.</p>

            <p>I knew enough that it had to be in an order, programs cant just do a whole bunch of stuff at same time like that far as I know. I just wasnt sure what the order would be, and figured trying to test it would be breaking several rules, as id need to get everyone involved in the game to basically throw, out themselves, and coordinate to test it, plus hope i had a game with two CW.</p>

            <p>Yeah they resolve in order obviously <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> You can’t code something like this to happen simultaneously. I think CW’s ability would go first. Not 100% sure though.</p>
