    <title>Kept getting assassin after 1.0.14</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/kept-getting-assassin-after-1-0-14/34290</link>
    <description>Supposedly there was an update to help prevent players from getting the same class, however after getting assassin for the fourth time after playing five games I can protest that this seems to not be the case. If others are experiencing the same as me in regards to class selection, then it would be my assumption there is a bug in the randomizer.

Apart from that, I love the game. Keep up the good work!</description>
