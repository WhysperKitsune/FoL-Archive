Spend a soul to bet on two player&#39;s deaths; you will gain two souls when they die.

Night ability two: **Resuscitate**

Order a dead player to do something to a live player of your choice tonight:

-Killer: If your target is immune to death, they won&#39;t be tonight 
-Offensive: Occupy the target
-Investigative: Reveal your targets class type
-social: your target cannot whisper tomorrow

-wildcard/special: nothing

E.x.: you order a dead physician to target the assassin; the assassin will be immune to death tonight.

Day ability 1: **Medium**
costs one soul
you will be able to hear the dead tonight, and speak to them (they will think you are the priest)
