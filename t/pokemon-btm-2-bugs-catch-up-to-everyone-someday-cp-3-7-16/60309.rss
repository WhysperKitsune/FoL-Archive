[details=&quot;Rolecards&quot;]
&gt; # **Absol** (Peasant)
&gt;*Every time Absol appears before people, it is followed by a disaster such as an earthquake or a tidal wave. As a result, it came to be known as the disaster Pokémon.*
Your chosen Pokémon Absol!
Using your predictive powers, you are able to forsee hidden actions.
&gt; - You will know who the Rotom is preparing to glitch
&gt; - You will be aware of the activities of the Farfetch&#39;d and Chatot
&gt; - You will know who was intimidated
&gt; - You will know who  the Delibird is interacting with
&gt; - You will know who the Gengar tricks.


&gt; # **Alakazam** (Professor)
&gt;*It is said to have an IQ of approximately 5000. Its overflowing psychokinetic powers cause headaches to anyone nearby*
Your chosen Pokémon is Alakazam!
Whenever you guess a Trainer&#39;s pokemon, you may also submit a secondary guess to the moderator for the same player. If the secondary guess is correct, it will be displayed as your submitted guess, otherwise, your primary guess, whether correct or incorrect, will be displayed. Whenever you win a challenge, you may submit a third guess the following Pokémon Centre Phase.

&gt; # **Chatot** (Musician)
&gt; *It keeps rhythm by flicking its tail feathers like a metronome. It imitates human speech.*
Your chosen pokemon is Chatot!
At the beginning of the Action Phase, you will be notified of the intended winner(s) of the accepted Contest(s).
Three times per game, during the Action Phase, you may change the winner of a contest. PM the Moderator to use this power. You may use this ability once on yourself.

&gt; # **Delibird** (Pharmacist)
&gt; *It has a generous habit of sharing its food with people and Pokémon, so it&#39;s always scrounging around for more food.*
Your chosen pokemon is Delibird!
Each voting phase, you may give someone a bomb. It will explode at the end of the Pokémon Centre phase and their position on the lists will be lowered to a position 2 - 4 spots lower (If possible) for the next challenge phase. They may switch places and have someone else suffer this fate though.
Each voting phase, you may give out a present. This will bring the target to the top of both lists for one phase(above everything), but they will suffer by being on the bottom of both lists for two phases. Cannot be stopped by being monitored by Nurse Joy. You may only give 2 presents a game.

&gt; # **Ditto** (Disguiser)
&gt; *It can reorganise the its cells to make itself a duplicate of anything it sees. The quality of the duplicate depends on the individual*
Your chosen Pokémon is Ditto!
At the end of each Pokémon Centre Phase, you will transform into another Pokémon from the game rolelist chosen at random (You can turn back into regular ditto)
You may perform actions as though you were the role you transformed into. 
You will lose any challenge to the pokemon you are copying.
You can be guessed as Ditto and the pokemon you are copying.

&gt; # **Farfetch&#39;d** (Blacksmith)
&gt; *Farfetch&#39;d is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks*
Your chosen Pokémon is a Farfetch&#39;d!
At the beginning of the Action Phase, you will be notified of the intended winner(s) of the accepted battle(s).
Three times per game, during the Action Phase, you may change the winner of a battle. PM the Moderator to use this power. You may use this ability once on yourself.

&gt; # **Gengar** (Deceiver)
&gt; *It hides in shadows. It is said if Gengar is hiding, it cools the area by nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit*
Your chosen Pokémon is Gengar!
Your location does not appear on the battle or contest list
3 times per game you can choose a player who can receive a gift and change it to whatever you want them to have
**Credit to SpiritofSpirits**

&gt; # **Gyarados** (Barbarian)
&gt;*A tale is told of a town that angered Gyarados. Before the sun rose the next day, flames utterly consumed the town, leaving not a trace behind.*
Your chosen Pokémon is Gyarados!
During the Pokémon Centre Phase, you may intimidate one player, preventing them from acting (challenging), however they must accept all challenges made against them. PM the Moderator to use this power.
Everytime you win a duel against someone not intimidated, you gain a charge. You may store 3 charges.
Using this ability requires a charge. You start the game with no charges
Only you and your target will know that the intimidation took place

&gt; # **Heracross** (Underdog)
&gt;*It is usually docile, but if it is disturbed while sipping honey, it chases off the intruder with its horn.*
Your chosen Pokemon is Heracross! 
Whenever you are in a challenge, if your opponent has won 2 or more cumulative challenges of that type than you, you will win instead of them. (If they or yourself are in multiple challenges during the current phase, challenges this phase do not count towards the result). A musician or blacksmith etc. can still tamper with the result however
It takes a brave man/woman to steal the crowd favourite publicly, however (No one can guess anyone as &#39;Heracross&#39; using a free tip-off to Team Rocket - it can only be done using Giovanni (making a death stake guess).


&gt; # **Magmortar**(Man At Arms)
&gt; *From its arm, it launches fireballs hotter than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its arm starts to melt when it fires a whole barrage.*
You&#39;re chosen pokemon is Magmortar!
Once per voting phase, you may shoot one trainer&#39;s Pokeball. The ball will be melted, and they will be out of the competition.
You can only shoot losers of battles/contests.
Additionally, you also gain an additional shooting every time you defeat a player in a battle or contest.
The shooting is silent, meaning it does not reveal your role.
You cannot store more than 1 shot at a time.
You start off with one shot.

&gt; # **Oricorio** (Court Jester)
&gt; *It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames*
Your chosen pokemon is Oricorio!
When a trainer is eliminated by a non-judging means, your position on the battle/contest list is randomized (Credit to Blackajack for this one)
Once per game you may choose to entertain your fellow guests and force a skip of the current voting phase and preventing the Magmortar&#39;s shot or Rotom Glitching etc. and the Current Vote from taking place.

&gt; # **Regigigas** (Student)
&gt; *There is an enduring legend that states this Pokémon towed continents with ropes.*
Your chosen pokemon is Regigigas!
Each time you participate in a battle or contest and lose, you move up two slots on the corresponding list. Dead players count as being on the lists.

&gt; # **Rotom** (Poisoner)
&gt; *Its body is composed of plasma. It is known to infiltrate electronic devices and wreak havoc.* 
Your chosen pokemon is Rotom
During the action phase, you may cause someone&#39;s spot in the healing machine to glitch out. If they remain in that spot, it will cause the pokeball to overload - eliminating the trainer who owns it. PM the Moderator to use this power.

&gt; # **Tsareena** (Royal)
&gt; *Its long, striking legs aren&#39;t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously.*
Your chosen pokemon is Tsareena! 
Your vote counts as two during the Voting Phase. PM the moderators to cast your second vote secretly. 
Once per game, during the Voting Phase, you may force a vote. PM the Moderator to use this power.

&gt; # Wobbuffet (Solider)
&gt; *If two or more Wobbuffet meet, they will turn competitive and try to outdo the other&#39;s endurance. However, they may try to see which one can endure the longest without food. Trainers need to beware of this habit.* 
Your chosen Pokémon is Wobbuffet!
You are extremely durable, and can use that to your advantage!
&gt; - You are immune to the Rotom&#39;s glitch
&gt; - If the Magmaortar attempts to kill you, you will mirror coat the attack back and kill them instead.

&gt; # **Zoroark** (Thespian)
&gt; *Each has the ability to fool a large group of people simultaneously. They protect their lair with illusory scenery.*
Your chosen Pokémon is Zoroark!
3 times per game, during the Pokémon Centre Phase, you can change your spot on the duel or dance list to wherever you want for the next challenge phase (You will return to your original spot for the following challenge phase)
You will also know the roles of everyone who dies, providing you beat them in at least one challenge.

[details=&quot;Signup Rules&quot;]
- The number of players is equal to the number of roles.
- Once signups open, players may “/join” the game and provide a Trainer name to be referred to as (From Anime or a Game).
- After all available slots have been filled, the roles will be randomly distributed among players via PM, with no repeated roles.
- Players may still join a backup queue once the game begins
[/details]

[details=&quot;Game Basics&quot;]
- The last player standing is the victor.
- In the event all remaining players die during the same phase, winner(s) will be decided at my discretion 
- A player’s role is not revealed when they die (of course, if their Pokemon is stolen by Team Rocket you will know it).
- Players may PM other players during the game as long as the moderator is included. Discord chats are also permitted as long as I am added to the conversation (Moleland#0879)
- Dead players cannot post until the game ends.
- Players who aren&#39;t an actual role may not post until the game ends (this includes you, Chubby!)
- There are no last words/Wills
- Actions, gifts, and guesses are sent to the moderator.
- No quoting/fake quoting mod messages
- I do not tolerate gamethrowing or hateful language. No racial/homophoic/sexist/etc remarks. I want a good, clean game.
- I will start a Dead Chat Server on here.
[/details]



[details=&quot;Game Phases&quot;]
Phases:
- The game itself has four phases.
- Discussion is permitted and encouraged throughout all phases.

Challenge Phase:
- The Challenge Phase lasts 72 hours, or until all players have challenged or no challenged and all pending challenges are resolved. All unresolved challenges are accepted, and all those who haven&#39;t declared a challenge, no challenge
- At my discretion, I may extend the phase if people try to &#39;cheese&#39; the game by making a challenge at the last moment
- The game begins on this phase.
- Players may “/challenge” other players to Battles or Contests.
- Once issued, the challenged player must choose whether to “/accept” the challenge or use a “/deny” (all players begin the game with a deny).
- For the first Challenge Phase, the deny may be used as many times as you wish. (Known as &#39;Elusive&#39;s infinite Deny Idea&#39;) In any following Challenge Phases, the deny may only be used once to deny one challenge 
- Each player may only challenge once per Challenge Phase (even if the challenge is denied), but can be challenged multiple times.
- If a player does not wish to challenge, they may instead “/nochallenge”. This allows the phase to end earlier. Players must still choose whether to accept or deny challenges.
- The results of the challenges will be posted at the end of the Action Phase (see Action Phase).
- The victors of battles and contests are determined by which player’s roles are higher on the respective list (see below), plus any interfering abilities.
- All challenges are final - You may not change your mind
- Unless a specific challenge is quoted or referred to, all &#39;/Accept&#39; or suchlike will be assumed to mean a blanket acceptance of all current challenges.
- Phase will end early if all challenges have been declared and accepted at my discretion

Action Phase
- Roles with abilities that are used during the Action Phase can PM me to use them.
- The results for Battles and Contests will be posted at the end of the Action Phase.
- This phase will last 48 hours or, at my discretion, until all roles with relevant abilities have made their choices.

Voting Phase:
- The Voting Phase will still occur during the first round, but no players will be voted and no judgement will occur.
- Any player who lost a battle or contest during the past Challenge Phase is a valid vote target.
- The player with the most votes at the end of the phase will be eliminated.
- In the event of a tie, the first player who reached the tie amount is eliminated
- The Magmortar, Tsareena and Delibird may act during this phase 
- Players may also select gifts during this phase.
- For each challenge participated in (no matter if won or lost) the player earns one gift. Gifts are revealed at the end of the Voting Phase.
- This phase will last 72 hours or until a majority vote is reached and all gifts have been claimed. The first voting phase, at my discretion, may end early if all gifts have been claimed.

Gifts:
Extra Deny- grants an extra deny to deny a challenge (see Challenge Phase) (each player starts with one deny)
Extra Switch- grants an extra pokeball switch (see Pokemon centre phase) (each player starts with one switch)
Fishing Rod- grants the player an extra fishing rod. You may use this during the Pokémon Centre Phase to have 3 attempts to guess a players role. If any of those guesses are correct, you are told you have a &#39;bite&#39; otherwise you get nothing. (You can use fishing rods on players and roles that have guess immunity or are otherwise unguessable. You start with one fishing rod)
Free Tip off to Team Rocket. - during the upcoming Pokémon Centre Phase, you may make a guess as to a player’s Pokemon. If you are correct, they will have it stolen by Team Rocket and eliminated. You may only choose one of this gift per round.
Visit from Officer Jenny - The presence of this Police Woman will stop Team Rocket stealing your Pokémon during the next Pokémon Centre phase.
Visit from Nurse Joy- you are not a valid Rotom or Delibird target during the Voting Phase - Nurse Joy will also prevent anyone switching with your ball
Gift Reserve - This gift can be redeemed at any point later in the game for a gift of your choosing. You can only hold up to 3 of this gift at a time.
Lotto ticket- if you are the only player to select this gift, you receive double gifts this round.

Pokemon Centre phase:
- This phase will last 72 hours or until all players have explicitly said they do not wish to make any (further) guesses/actions
- Each Pokemon is returned to their ball to rest.
- You may “/switch” your own Pokeball with another player&#39;s, consuming a switch (each player begins with one switch). You may not switch with someone who switched with you.
- At the end of the phase, each Pokemon is exposed to whatever was aimed at your ball.
- Pokemon targeted by Rotom will be eliminated (excluding Wobbuffet)
- The Gyarados and Zoroark may act during this phase.
- In addition, if you received a free Tip off to Team Rocket as a gift, you must use it during the Pokémon Centre Phase. If you are correct, that player will be eliminated at the end of the Pokémon Centre Phase. All attempted guesses are revealed at the end of the Pokémon Centre Phase.
-If you do not have a free Tip off, you may still call Giovanni in and get him to steal the pokemon by making a guess as to another player’s role as normal. However, if you are incorrect, you will be eliminated. Giovanni has no patience for failure.
- You may also use a fishing rod during this phase. The outcome of your use and who you used it on will be revealed, but not which roles you fished for.
- You may make a guess or use a fishing rod - you may not do both.
- Gaining last minute immunity or taking out a Free Tip off to Team Rocket will, at my discretion, extend the phase to give players time to react to this change of events.
- If someone has previous declared &#39;No switch&#39; but are subsequently swapped with, they will have the option of changing their mind or sticking with their original option.
[/details]


[details=&quot;Other Rule Quirks&quot;]
- The gift reserve can be exchanged for whatever other item you wish, providing it is before the start of the phase where it would needed. EG:
Deny = any time
Switch = Any time
Nurse Joy = Before Dinner phase starts/Voting phase ends
Officer Jenny = Before Dinner phase ends (Would add in any reasonable reaction time)
Tip off to Team Rocket = Before dinner phase ends (Would add in any reasonable reaction time)
- If Alakazam correctly guesses Ditto as either itself or the role it is copying, it will be announced correctly for whichever was the first Pokémon &#39;correctly&#39; guessed.
- If multiple roles try to put themselves top of either list (IE: Zoroark and someone given a Delibird present) then I will RNG who actually is top of the list
- Any time a player is told their position on any list (For example, Regigigas or someone affected by a Delibird bomb) they will be reminded that Gengar is invisible and could be affecting their true position on the list.
- If the Ditto copies a role with charges, it starts with the number that role has when it starts. If it becomes the same role again, it will remember if it used/gained any charges from the previous time. 
- If Ditto copies Tsareena, and they both use the force vote on the same target; both will use the charge
- If Ditto copies Tsareena, and they both use the force vote on different targets, then the Tsareena&#39;s choice will go through. The Ditto will still keep its charge.
- If the Ditto copies a position mover like Regigias, it will remember it&#39;s new position if it returns to that role.
- The Ditto will lose to the role it copies, even if higher than it on the relevant list (However, any abilities can still reverse the result)
- If Ditto copies Heracross, it will lose to it even if it has won 2 less of the relevant challenge type (IE: The Overturn ability will not apply). A Farfetched or Chatot could affect the result however
- If Ditto copies Gengar, it will be told what position Gengar occupies in the relevant list.
- If Ditto copies Gengar and both try to switch a item being received by the same player, the Ditto&#39;s action will be carried out first, then the Gengar will affect a different present if possible - otherwise at least one present must be of the type the Gengar wanted.
- If Ditto copies Gyardos and they both intimidate the same player it will have no notable affect
- If Ditto copies Magmorter or Rotom and they both target the same player it will have no notable affect.
- If Farfetch&#39;d or Chatot are copied by Ditto, and they both use their ability on the same challenge then both Pokemon will use a charge.
- If Ditto copies a Delibird and they both use a bomb on the same player, the affects of the bombs are cumulative
- If Ditto copies a Delibird and they both use a present on the same player, it will have no notable affect
- If Ditto copies a Delibird and one uses present and the other uses a bomb on the same player, the affects of the present will be applied before the bomb affects.
- If a fishing Rod is used on the Ditto, it will only get a bite if the user names &#39;Ditto&#39; as one of the choices
- If Gengar swaps a gift choice of a target, then it will swap a gift at random that is not of that type. (EG: If a player is claiming 2 gift reserves and a deny, and a Gengar tries to swap something for a deny, the target will receive 1 reserve and 2 denys)
- If Gengar makes a player take second of a single phase item (A second Officer Jenny, Nurse Joy or Lotto Ticket) then the duplicate will be wasted. In the event of a second lotto ticket being given, it will not affect whether a player wins the prize or not
- If a Gengar makes a player take a 4th gift reserve, the additional reserve will be wasted
- Oricorio will prevent the following actions taking place with it&#39;s skip phase ability: Delibird bomb/present, Magmortar shot, Tsareena force vote, Rotom Glitch

            <p>Sorry to say this guys, but can the dead stay dead and not talk until Mole has actually decided to officially can the game? As far as we are concerned, the game is still running and the dead are still… well, dead.</p>
<p>Just give Mole the time he needs is what I’m saying.</p>

            <p>I’ve seen this attitude in another BtM game with the player pushing on the host which made him lose motivation as well. Here’s a rule of thumb…</p>
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> push the hosts. Do <strong>NOT</strong> insult them. Believe it or not, most of the mods and game hosts happpen to be our friends, so respect them at all times, otherwise, they might lose respect for you. Mole is a friend of mine. Sure I had a quick talk with him to make sure if he was ok because that’s what friends do! They check on one another and are patient with one another. I haven’t pushed him because I respect him not only as a friend, but someone who has had more experience.</p>

            <p>Regardless, pushing for other people to can their games just so you can start yours (WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOR A WHILE) just makes you look like a jerk. Leave it up to the hosts to prod inactives and such m’dude. If the host cans it, he cans it.</p>
