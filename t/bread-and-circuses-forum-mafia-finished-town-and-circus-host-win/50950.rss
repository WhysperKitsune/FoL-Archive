    <description># Welcome to [color=green]Bread[/color] and [color=purple]Circuses[/color]!
## An interesting custom game designed purely for fun!
### Information:
This is a custom setup I&#39;ve come up with recently, and wanted to test out! I would love to hear your feedback at the end of the game. For now, lets get right into the rolelist!

### Rolelist:
[color=Green] Jailkeeper
Doctor
Doctor
Doctor
Bodyguard
Baker 
Baker
Baker
Baker
Baker [/color]
[color=purple] Circus Freak
Circus Freak
Circus Freak [/color]
[color=grey]Circus Host[/color]

&gt; # [color=green] Jailkeeper [/color]
&gt; **Jail (Day)** - Choose a player to Jail. They will be prevented from taking any action. That night. You may freely talk to your jailed target. All actions targeting the jailed player, will be redirected to you.
&gt; **Execute (Night)** - Kill your jailed target. Bypasses night immunity. 3 uses.

&gt; # [color=green] Doctor [/color]
&gt; **Separation Anxiety (Passive)** - If you are the last remaining [color=green]Doctor[/color], you will become a [color=purple]Circus Freak[/color]. This will be announced to the Town (The  [color=green]Doctor[/color] is now a [color=purple]Circus Freak[/color]!)
&gt; **Heal (Night)** - Heal a player, preventing them from dying.

&gt; # [color=green] Bodyguard [/color]
&gt; **Protect (Night)** - Protect a player. If the player is attacked, you will kill their attacker. Infinite Uses, 1 night cooldown after a successful guard.

&gt; # [color=green] Baker [/color]
&gt; **Bake (Night)** - Bake some bread. Gain night immunity tonight. 1 use

&gt; # [color=Purple] Circus Freak [/color]
&gt; **Chains (Passive)** - Immune to death at night
&gt; **Poor Luck (Passive)** - 10% chance to have your target changed
&gt; **Stab (Night)** - Kill a player

&gt; # [color=grey] Circus Host [/color]
&gt; **Showmanship (Passive)** - When Lynched, you will reveal the roles of your first two accusers.
&gt; **Sold out! (Night)** - Prevent anyone from visiting you. 3 uses.

### Mechanics:
The game is made up of 2 phases. The Day phase, and the Night phase.
The Day phase lasts for 60 hours, whilst the Night phase only lasts 36 hours.
During the Day, the players will vote for someone to kill. (/vote username)
If Majority is reached before the end of the Day, the player will be killed, and Night will begin immediately.
There will be no chats available to anyone outside of the forums. The [color=green]Jailkeeper[/color] and their target will communicate through the host.
**This is a no flip gamemode. A player&#39;s role will not be revealed upon death.**
### Win Conditions:
[color=green]The Town[/color] wins when there are no [color=purple]Circus Freaks[/color] remaining.
[color=purple]The Circus Freaks[/color] win when there are no [color=green]Town[/color] remaining.
[color=grey]The Circus Host[/color] wins when he is lynched.

            <p>Considering too that statistically is Renegade decides to kill N1-2.<br>
Statistically, he’ll hit bakers more, as there are more of them.<br>
Meaning that Bakers will be more readily eliminated.</p>

            <p>3 doctors who each have 2 heals = At least 2 nights of survival if not 3 guaranteed if outed early (Due to BG and Doc being able to cover them when they’ve used all heals on each other) which will lead to a huge advantage of time and confirmation PoE.</p>
<p>Bakers start off as majority but only get 1 immunity so can be killed any time except that time.<br>
Docs and BGs would be much less likely to waste their resources on them.</p>

            <p>I might actually look at reworking the host, so the doctors aren’t as easily confirmable. Considering there is 1 Bg, and uses for heals are limited now, this might be a bit better.</p>

            <p>If anything, it’d be more useful to the Circus freaks if the Bakers were the ones who gained the convertible passive instead.<br>
Don’t know how that would be worked, but to me it makes more sense since Baker’s are far less likely to be protected once docs/bgs out</p>

            <p>Fair enough, whatever works.<br>
Just thought there should be some way to convert other things too.<br>
As docs could out, have BGs on them.<br>
Then once BG uses are done, they can heal each other.<br>
The third doc and just heal one of the other 2 as well after that to significantly decrease chances of docs being converted</p>

            <p>Conversion in addition to 3KPN is too much imo.<br>
It’s also a no if it were to replace the nightkills. I feel like there wouldn’t be too much making this different from SFoL in that case.</p>
