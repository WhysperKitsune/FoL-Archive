            <p>I like these class ideas in all honesty. Sure it has a couple of weird abilities (like the magician being an investigative capable of bleeding someone) for certain types of classes. But in all honesty, not a whole lot if issues. But I’m no class expert regarding reviews with this stuff and I can’t rant about a lot of stuff without losing myself in the middle of it, but I still like it.</p>
<p>Also regarding The Traveler, doesn’t the Night Ability Curiosity seem a little off? Like sure you can occupy someone, but if you get the feedback it will just say they got prevented, so it’s not very helpful? Unless I’ve read it wrong and it has what they would originally do or I’m not understanding it right. But if the 1st thing I said is true then this makes them a powerful investigative, since they can see if someone wanted to attack, convert, investigate, heal, etc.</p>
<p>Just my opinion anyway, I still like the classes.</p>
