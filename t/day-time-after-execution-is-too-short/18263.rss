    <title>Day time after execution is too short</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/day-time-after-execution-is-too-short/18263</link>
    <description>There&#39;s so much going on in a game and once the results of an execution show, we only have like 5 or 7 seconds to decide if we want to change what to do that night if we have day-&gt;night abilities (like Prince jail). If I have to relook at my log real quick and then change my night target, I usually don&#39;t have enough time. I think we should get at least 15 seconds (preferrably a little more) after an execution to use/change our abilities/targets.</description>

            <p>Personally i like day/night cycle. It’s good to have a breather and even though it might be short, it’s enough to vote someone else up / OR Edit your Logbooks accordingly<br>
EXAMPLE-------</p>
<p>Player Accused Player B of treason (in this scenario, everyone voted him up)</p>
<p>Player B Claimed to be psychic<br>
Player said that he should connect and say a code “3141592653589”<br>
Next day they can confirm this or get him up.<br>
If you’d  be allowed too much time it’ll be too easy</p>

            <p>Yeah but the classes that can have very little time to change if the execution target turns out to be something other than they expected.</p>

            <p>You can’t use day ability during accusation and the execution &amp; aftermath except for few classes.</p>

            <p>8 more seconds per execution for 8 days of executions would only add about a minute more. That’s pretty much nothing, and people usually don’t get executed every single day. A more reasonable time would be if 5 people get executed in a 9 day game. That would be 5*8 = 40 seconds more for a whole game. Barely anything, but you get a little bit more time to make your decisions for the night.</p>
