    <title>Night powers: Order of occurance and being converted</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/night-powers-order-of-occurance-and-being-converted/8114</link>
    <description>Hi All,

Currently when you are converted and investigated the same night, you will appear as evil to the investigator. This is obviously very frustrating to the newly converted as they will likely be outed right away and die. 

As the game been tested if the order happens the other way? So that you appear as the allignment you started the night as rather than ended? This would be a boost to the evil side for sure. Would it be too much?</description>

            <p>I am sure it happened last night, I was a merc and got converted then instantly outted as “unseen”. Maybe the player said “unseen” but really meant “not ally”. There was no scorned in game.</p>
<p>Either way, I would like to know the order on this, if it can be confirmed <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
