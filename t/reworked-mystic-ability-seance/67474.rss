    <title>Reworked Mystic Ability, Seance</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/reworked-mystic-ability-seance/67474</link>
    <description>I think Mystic could use a new ability, &quot;Seance&quot;, which would encourage the dead to stay in the game.  It would replace Conduit, which seems weak, with a 1 or 2 use Night Ability that allows one OTHER person to Commune with the Dead, Mystic cannot see what the dead say, only the person he links with.  This means he has to be careful who he chooses.

Just an idea on how to make it more interesting for the dead peeps.</description>

<p>The devs have explicitly said that they don’t want to pressure people to stay in games when they’ve already died. Plus, there’s no reason why dead interaction should even be a thing as a role like my proposed <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/saru-s-classes-bd-social-and-converts/67403">Coroner</a> would easily fill in its niche without requiring dead players to stay and without screwing over the Possessor.</p>

            <p>Dead interactions have been permanently removed, for a number of reasons. Firstly, their only purpose in existing in the first place was making sure people stuck around while dead.</p>
<p>However, xblade implemented the system where you still get gold if you leave after dying, so that dosen’t matter any more. Because of this, a lot of people will leave the dead chat.</p>
<p>With people leaving dead chat, it means that all dead interaction abilities inherrently get weaker, and so dead interactions were  all removed because they’d just be extra swinginess that is no longer needed (because dead players no longer need retention)</p>
