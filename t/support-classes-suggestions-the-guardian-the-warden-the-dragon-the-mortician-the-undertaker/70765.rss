</aside>
<p>I like this concept but there is nothing present in his abilities that suggest he’s a support class. Blue Dragon variant is more geared as an investigative class and Unseen variant is more geared as an offensive class. Being an investigative weakens the ability for scorned to claim it and strengthens the ability for Mastermind to claim it. Mastermind currently struggles forming a safe claim. This would certainly help out on that front.</p>
<p>There are two solutions to this: Add some kind of supportive ability (be it protecting a player of your choosing through some means or empowering a user of your choosing) to justify its label of Support, or simply to make it an Investigative class.</p>
<p>Also, does Undertaker’s facelift apply if executed during the day? Would be a very interesting ability if so.</p>

            <p>Gaurdian/Warden: I’d personally just remove it. It’s not really a fun idea as tthe CW wars have shwon.</p>
<p>Dragon: Fire Breath should be a 1-shot Strongman (unstoppable) kill on a single person.</p>
<p>Hopefully the overhaul is better.</p>

</aside>
<p>CW barrier 2: It’s still an unfun ability boogaloo. It may be a good “low-power” ability in terms of impact but the problems with it lie in how it’s much harder to use it in an interesting way compared to heal.</p>

<p>This is just a rephrasing of the day ability. The only class this would actually affect badly is Reaper, making the class a blatant Reaper hardcounter.</p>
<p>Overall: It’s just old CW but without the potential to use a fun ability like Tornado that utterly fucks over Reaper sometimes instead.</p>
<p>Solution: The night ability needs to be replaced with something much more interesting and non-confirmable.</p>

<p>Pro-tip: Giving the Unseen extra kill power, even if potenitally outs the entire Unseen, is reeeeallly dumb. This could have a potential 7KPN at maximum, which is utterly ludircrous as a mere possiblity (2 obs, 2 princess, 2 sheriffs, 1 inquisitor).</p>

<p>if we’re going to have an ability like this I’d muuch rather just remove Assassin altogether and make the Unseen kill factional. Not that that should ever actually happen.</p>
<p>It’s a decent ability but feels a bit off.</p>
<p>Overall: Not a very good convert, extremely swingy abilities and hard to use interestingly at all.</p>
<p>Solutions: A complete rework, I’m afraid. Do it yourself is the only ability I’d keep.</p>
<hr>
<p>believe it or not, I actually kinda like the Dragon. If Fire Breath was removed and replaced with something different it’d be a pretty decent class.</p>

Night Ability (Monster Eyes) - Disable a player’s day abilities tomorrow.(2 Uses)<br>

<p>note: fire breath is a little bit over the top. limit to maybe 2-3 uses.<br>
monster eyes is good to fk up people in the day. make it so it has unlimited use and able to affect king’s ability. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Day Ability (Facelift) - If you die , you will appear as the chosen class.(Infinite Uses)</p>
<p>Note: does the passive contradict the day ability? remove the passive and its fine.<br>
