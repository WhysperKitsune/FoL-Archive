    <description>Investigative

Day Ability 1: Concentrate (1 Use)
Reveal the number of evil players left in the game

Player must weigh out holding on to use at the risk of dying early. May need to pair with other players abilities to avoid being blocked

Day Ability 2 (Optional):
N/A

Night Ability 1: Clairvoyance - (3 Uses) 
Hear what targeted player said last night, the following day. If too powerful, make it so the target is random

All players can be selected. Visionary would only see what that player said, not both sides of conversation. Will likely result in some interesting changes

1. Unseen/Cult may have to be careful of how they say things/pretend linked at night or talk during the day. 
2. Can tap into mystic target to help confirm BD/call out evil
3. Can tap into mystic who targeted two players, revealing nothing
4. Can tap into Prince or jailed player
5. Silence may translate to a false positive as BD/Neutral

Night Ability 2 (Optional)
Get rid of CW and make this magic
