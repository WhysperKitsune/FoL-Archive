    <title>Make the interaction between Puppet Strings and Exhume more interesting</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-the-interaction-between-puppet-strings-and-exhume-more-interesting/71784</link>
    <description>If Possessor uses Puppet Strings to force X to kill Y, I propose that Exhume on Y identifies the killer as (the class of)  X.

This way, Possessor has room to counter Exhume, which at the moment is infallible.

This would also make sense lore-wise.</description>
