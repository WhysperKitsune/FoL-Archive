    <title>Inq/Sorc Cat and Mouse</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inq-sorc-cat-and-mouse/26817</link>
    <description>There&#39;s still a lot of dissatisfaction here, so here&#39;s a random thought. How about Inq and Sorc are both death-immune from anyone except each other, until one of them dies. People attempting to kill them would be told they were occupied or prevented.  Could even make it so if they target each other on the same night, it results in a catastrophic magical explosion that also kills anyone visiting them.  Now that I&#39;ve written it down, it seems to still be missing something, but I feel like it would move them to slightly more equal footing.  I also have mentioned before, but perhaps let sorc see who unseen are, but not meet with them at night, and don&#39;t let unseen see who sorc is.</description>

            <p>Personally, my problem with the Sorcerer/Inquisitor interaction is how little each of them effects the other. The Inquisitor feels a little useless with the Sorcerer being able to mislead them easily. More often than not, the Sorcerer dies to BD instead of the Inquisitor from what I’ve seen (I don’t know what others’ experiences are with this).</p>
<p>I feel like the best way to improve this is too buff both of them.Make it so the Sorcerer appears as BD to any checks that are made on them. This makes it extremely difficult for the BD to discover the Sorcerer without an Observer, Princess, or maybe Psychic proving they have misleading logs. Then to counter act this allow the Inquisitor to check 2 people each night for magical ability. By letting the Inquisitor check more people, it accelerates his search in finding the Sorcerer and helps him identify when Magic Dust is used.</p>
<p>Given the recent buffs to the Sorcerer, however, this idea may not be as good as it would’ve been otherwise.</p>
