    <title>Allow evil spy effects to be used on the king</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/allow-evil-spy-effects-to-be-used-on-the-king/52266</link>
    <description>Nobles can&#39;t use Maid Spy on the king, since that would give them too much free info and would make whisper games even stronger for BD.  That makes sense.

However, I suggest giving Aristocrats and Apostles the ability to spy on the king.  That would add another reason to be cautious about whispers.  I don&#39;t feel it&#39;d be overpowered - it&#39;d come at a serious risk.  Since Nobles still can&#39;t spy on the king, you could get caught if someone asks you who you&#39;re spying (you won&#39;t be able to report whispers from / to them, and obviously you can&#39;t admit you spied on the king.)

Naturally, they could still spy on anyone else, too, so it&#39;d be up to them if they want to take that risk on any given night (you could always claim to have spied on whoever died, even if that might make the court suspicious.)

EDIT:  A more dramatic change would be to just give them the ability to hear [i]all[/i] whispers.</description>

            <p>Not quite. While you wouldn’t get explicit “I am Prince” you’d get investigative results which are effectively as good.</p>

            <p>Hmm.  Maybe a power that lets you read someone’s entire whisper logs.</p>
<p>(It has to still show you all their current ones for a day, or you won’t be able to claim Noble.)</p>

            <p>It would be mostly irrelevant. All the claims happen d2 and by then the chance to spy would mostly be lost.</p>

            <p>I actually liked the old apostle’s ability that allowed you to hear the next 4 whispers. I think that would be more balanced and still make people cautious when claiming to the king. But I agree a change like this could help leverage the whisper meta.</p>
