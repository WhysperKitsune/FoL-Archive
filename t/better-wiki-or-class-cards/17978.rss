    <description>Hey guys! We need more info about classes.I made mistake when I killed obs (I was prince) who followed &quot;16&quot; last night. But I jailed &quot;16&quot;  last night and  I thought that jailed player cant be visited ( as in ToS) I thought he was lying and so I executed him. If you visit ToS wiki (http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Jailor) you will see  very detailed described mechanics and rules of roles. It would be very useful to have it on our wiki as well. And you could also check content of wiki more often. Few days ago I corrected incorrect amount of uses of Brotherhood. I know this is not your priority.You are busy working with content adding and balancing but its pretty annoying when we dont know how our classes works. Thank you for attention!</description>

            <p>It is not described whether or not prince visits his targets. The wiki does need to be updated regularly, what with all the constant updates</p>

            <p>They will be occupied, as happy hour removes their occupy immunity. Information like that is usually found on the involved class page, sometimes in strategy.</p>

            <p>“This class is an essential class for the Blue Dragon. The Prince does as he pleases, locking up other players at night (Occupying them, but also protecting them from attacks and conversion), with the ability to Privately have a chat with the prisoner, optionally able to use his Execute ability if he believes they are lying to him.” - <a href="http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/The_Prince" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Prince</a></p>
<p>It’s described that imprisoning them only occupies them and protects them from attacks and conversion, but I do see how that could be easy to miss.</p>
