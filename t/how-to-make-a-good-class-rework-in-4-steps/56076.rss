    <title>How to make a good Class/Rework in 4 Steps</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-to-make-a-good-class-rework-in-4-steps/56076</link>
    <description>Step 1: Figue out what problem this class is supposed to solve.

This can be one of 2 things:

A - A direct balence problem. Here the class itself is not important but rather it&#39;s interaction with everything else. Generally Reworks are because of this.

B - Lack of possablely space. Here the idea is to expand on a mechanic that is non-existent or underutilized. Make sure that it is still adding an interesting dynamic to the game. Usually entirely new classes are made for this reason. **Important: Do not make a class just because the class seems like it would be fun. You want to make it something that makes the game as a whole more interesting by allowing for more complex or more involved strategys. If you are trying to add counterplay to an existing strategy then that&#39;s type A**

Step 2: Solve the problem

Important here is to not loose sight of what you are doing. Anything you do here should solve what it is trying to and NOTHING ELSE. Do not do things here because they are fun or interesting but rather because they solve the problem. Make sure you do not overcomplicate for anything.

Step 3: Counterplay and Balence

Here you need to make sure of 2 things:

1: Whatever this class does can someone stop it

There needs to be both of 2 solutions. If an enemy knows who this class is would it be possible to prevent you from doing your main action.

Next is the same thing but the enemy only knows your target.

If your class is Investigative then it isn&#39;t neciccaraly required to directly stop the investigation or frame/mindwarp to accomplish the goal. Words can often work just fine if the information is vague enough. However with anything else there must be a mechanical counter. If there isn&#39;t but the ability needs to be there then give it limited uses. No more than 2.

Keep in mind that this should go both ways. It can require the countering side to have spacific tools on hand to counter but the more likely it is to be needed the more tools there should be to counter it. BD anti death requires the most.

The other thing you need is to manage Conformability. if it is scum then you might not care but in either case you want to have as little mechanical Conformability as possible. Anything that can be used to confirm should be on its Unseen version and hopefully on the cult version too if it is confirmable. At best an NK should be able to fake it. At worst the converted player should be able to maintain it for a full cycle.

Lastly there is power. If this class is similar to any other classes it should have the same strength as them. If it can do the same takes as more than 1 class then those classes should be able to do it better. 

Remember to keep KPN of scum consistent if possible.

Step 4: Fun

Here is where you worry about the class actualy being fun.

First thing is to look for RNG. If you use any past class assignment then remove it immediately. The only exeption is when there is an identical alternative that you can aim. (Ex: RNG for compulsive actions if you select no one.) Even there it should be avoided. 

The next thing is to make sure the class has interesting choices to make. And that means that in a majority of situations there should not be an objective best action at the very least at first glance. Allowing for WIFOM is a great way to accomplish this. 

While not every Ability needs to be like this on your class you should not find yourself doing the same thing every night with very few exceptions on the same person. Day Ability&#39;s can usually help with this. 

Make sure that all of these steps are still forfilled and then you are ready to submit</description>
