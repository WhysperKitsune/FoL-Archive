    <title>2 Things to keep in mind when making a class suggestion</title>

    <description>I&#39;m not exactly a veteran at ToL, but I have played enough mafia-style games to realize 2 things not to do.

1. **Death Immunity**

To many death immune roles is just frustrating for killers, especially neutral killers, who only have killing as a means to dispose of rivals. Be reluctant to give blue dragon classes night immunity (you can, for example the nobles) as they are supposed to rely on temporary death immunity, such as physician&#39;s heal. If you are not sure it would be balanced, consider distinguishing different types of death (I.E being immune to only poison, being immune to all but poison, etc.)

2 **Bypassing death immunity**

As many ToS players know, having to many classes bypass death immunity diminishes the value of death immunity (there are more kill-able roles in Town of Salem that bypass death immunity than do not). Currently, bypassing death immunity requires certain classes (reaper, prince, etc.), and these have restrictions on bypassing it (reaper most use souls, prince can only kill limited amounts of times). If you want your class to be able to bypass death immunity, consider having two types of killing: one normal, one death immunity bypassing, and make the latter have few uses (1-2); alternatively, try thinking up more creative killing systems, such as the reaper&#39;s _souls_</description>

            <p>I’m more of a fan of creating death immunity against death immunity kills, and just make it so certain classes can have an ability that bypasses the immunity for the death immunity so that their normal attack will succeed.</p>
