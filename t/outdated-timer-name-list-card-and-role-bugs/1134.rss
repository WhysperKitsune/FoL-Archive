    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/outdated-timer-name-list-card-and-role-bugs/1134</link>
    <description>####What happened?
so much wrong happened in this game, the timer went negative, to the right you can see the names are all &quot;player name 1&quot; etc., my card art did not correspond with my role (gave me weegee for whatever reason, DONT KNOW IF THATS A GLITCH but usually it would give me the card for the role i was assigned) id like to point out i also had NO abilities, both day and night time.

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?
well, the complete opposite of everything that happened up there, pretty self-explainatory in my screenshot

####Steps to reproduce:
all the steps are pretty basic, i just joined a game and it was all broken. did nothing but say hello day 1 lol.

####Comments:
