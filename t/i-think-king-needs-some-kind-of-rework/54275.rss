    <title>I think King needs some kind of rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/i-think-king-needs-some-kind-of-rework/54275</link>
    <description>Tl;Dr king is far too swingy with how powerful he is and it&#39;s nearly impossible to determine his faction before he makes a move or reaper kills him. He is also currently far too powerful when an evil king.

So it&#39;s been a good bit since king was given order execute, and I think I believe that it has brought out all the problems that we currently have with King and what can be done. 

Before order execute, we had Allies. Now a lot of people remember that being a bad time, as it was a pure faction check from a known source. Meaning barring a frame, whatever the long found you as, that was it. That&#39;s created a huge problem for neutrals, so we attempted a king with checking for royal blood. This led to king being useless and a meta of constantly executing the king. We went back to allies, and now we have order execute plus 6 total guards for the king. What I have found was important from allies is that due to the faction check, it was possible to deduce if a king was evil or not by what he came up with. This led to an evil king needing to be pro active or else he&#39;ll be hung. This is where the whisper meta came in since allies was gone. It is currently the only way to tell a king&#39;s faction, since a bd king can use the information to win. This has also amplified a problem I had with evil king for a long time, which was find the prince and kill him somehow. With the order execute, this gave him an extra opportunity. 

And this brings together the main problem with king: the percentage he can be either side. I think no matter what, as long as the king is as powerful as he is, having him potentially being on either side makes the game super swingy. With 6 guards, no one except butler and reaper can actually kill him. This leads to unseen, cult, and nk needing to slow the game down until king is out of guards, but the slower the game, the more information gets passed around, which is also detrimental to evil factions. This basically has just turned the game into &quot;hope king is on my side&quot; for everyone with no real way to figure it out, especially since there is a big push to out the whisper meta. 

Suggestions temporarily removed. Mainly just remove order execute and nerf guard numbers.</description>

            <p>That’s fair and as I’ve stated, I do believe my distaste for Decide Fate could be just me not seeing the bigger picture with the ability.</p>
<p>This is why I liked Allies so much. It let kind find evil classes, and then skilled kings could use this information to hide them from BD or potentially communicate with the member to leak various information he acquired. Current King has no such ability, which is why he’s devoted to killing the prince, and that’s about it.</p>

<p>I’m fine with Evil King having to convince the court to vote up the Prince before he can decide fate<br>
But being able to snipe him at night seems lame<br>
Of course Prince can counter this by getting guards and heals<br>
But it still seems a strange ability for King to have<br>
Wouldn’t the ideal be Evil King has to pretend to be Good, get Prince’s trust and claim, then leak this info to the Assassin to get Prince killed?<br>
I wish Order Exe were replaced with some ability that helps Evil King conspire with Unseen<br>
Like a conduit that the Mystic can’t spy on</p>

            <p>Having evil king isn’t really a problem.</p>
<p>The problem becomes what Evil King can do. As of now, Evil King is pretty close to a hard counter to Prince. Once the Evil King knows who Prince is, he can either attack him or try to vote him up. Now this isn’t super awful, but BD have no real way of “deducing” the King before he strikes, especially with the new King change, since it will just look like Prince was attacked if it fails. Basically the King HAS to kill the Prince before we can figure out he’s Evil, and by then it’s too late. King just takes matters in his own hands far too easily, which is why Evil King is so difficult to deal with in the first place. Add in we’re pushing a movement away from whisper meta, which means King just gets to sit around and do nothing until he finds the prince and can kill him. It’s a boring way to to play, when a decent amount of games are decided by a 65/35 split.</p>

            <p>Okay, that’s fine. I’m not advocating for Evil King to be removed, whatever you might think. Yes I made the idea, but I was not expecting it to happen, if anything as a last resort.</p>
<p>Also, I have already stated healers would not stick on king. He has guard for himself and if other players are bled/poisoned healers would have to back off. Butler also isn’t “useless”. He’s boring to players, but his ability to occupy evil roles is important since he can stop assassin/Reaper/Cult Leader from taking actions, and can stall them out.</p>

            <p>Evil king exist because we don’t want confirmable. If that was the case everyone would heal king and butler would be useless</p>

            <p>This is the scenario:</p>
<p>Day 3. King calls 11 up, wanting logs, claiming them to be evil, whatever that king thinks of.</p>
<p>The very second that 11 is voted up, Butler’s Nightshade ability is locked. 11 is frustrated and says he’s the prince. King force executes him. Butler still can’t nightshade him.</p>
<p>There is no point where Butler needs “fast reflexes”. In fact, it’s more on the prince than anything else to stop the voting and confirm himself as prince.</p>

            <p>Butler can’t poison during or after the trial, which means king gets to stay alive for two more days, allowing him to kill with both charges of Order Execute. It also is still a reactive situation, and not an active one.</p>
