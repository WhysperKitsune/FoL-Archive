    <title>More Aesthetic Additions and Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/more-aesthetic-additions-and-suggestions/4815</link>
    <description>Ok so I thought it would be cool if there was a whole character customizer where you can change your characters looks and different designs cost a certain amount of gold. (ex. The color of your shirt costs a specific amount of gold)

Another thing I thought about was different designs for the prince cell idk itâ€™s useless but itâ€™s aesthetics weâ€™re talking about.

The last thing is the LIGHTING of the rooms. I think it would look cooler if it looked more candle-lit because it adds that medieval touch to it. The main court should be candle lit too, think it would look nice.

Also I got some suggestions for new death spots: 
1. A garden
2. The very top of the castle on a balcony
3. Dining hall?
4. The castle gates/doors
5. A treasury of some sort
6. Hung from a noose somewhere(too grusome?)
7. In the TavernðŸ˜³</description>

            <p>Hung from a noose might be a bit graphic unless it was far away or something.</p>

            <p>I really support ideas like this, the candle lit idea I had never considered but is absolutely true.</p>
<p>They could always release a candlelit skin for the throneroom which you can buy with gp.</p>
