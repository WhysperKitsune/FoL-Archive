    <title>Get rid of the butler&#39;s party notification</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/get-rid-of-the-butlers-party-notification/49374</link>
    <description>When visiting a butler who used party you get the message &quot;You were occupied when visiting X&quot; I think this is unnecesary since it adds yet another way for the butler to prove himself besides poisoning the king. This could also help scum with fake butler claims, if for example someone is told to visit X to prove if they party they could just occupy the person that is going to visit them to pretend they partied.
Also, you should change the butler&#39;s poison notification as well as the assassin&#39;s one WHEN USED ON THE KING to say something like &quot;You have been poisoned by an assassin or butler. You will die in 1 or 2 days&quot;.

Its fine for a class to have a way to prove themselves but it shouldn&#39;t be as fool-proof as it is currently with some classes to allow for some extra claiming space.</description>

            <p>We could have both.  No reason the two poisons should be instantly distinguishable, and giving the servant fake poison would be generally interesting.</p>
<p>(However, if we add fake poison, it also needs to track that you’re fake-poisoned and give you a message when it’s “cured.”  I feel that that putting that in would be valuable, since we could also give fake bleed to someone to help limit Hunters from proving with it.)</p>

            <p>What about Party and Happy Hour giving the same generic message, “You were occupied and it bypassed your occupy immunity.”</p>
<p>Also someone made a great suggestion about hallucinogenic wine being given to Servant, a fake poison that doesn’t actually kill the King but notifies him that he’s poisoned anyway, to stop the poison-to-prove meta.</p>

            <p>I think that that’s better than letting everyone know.  Here’s what I’d do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a generic “You were occupied by something that bypassed your immunity!” message, for occupy-immune people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display that message for people who were debbed, too.  <span class="bbcode-i">Don’t</span> tell them they were debbed.  Anything else that occupies and bypasses immunity also displays this identical message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re killed on a night that you’re debbed, you get a generic “you were attacked and it bypassed your immunity” message, without telling you why (so it could have been a killer who bypasses death immunity, too.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This avoids giving up unnecessary information while telling the player what’s going on and making it clear it’s not a bug.  As an occupy-immune class, you can still <span class="bbcode-i">generally</span> conclude you were visiting a butler if you get occupied and it bypasses your immunity, but there’s some room for trickery and errors, and we avoid giving free information to non-occupy-immune people.</p>

            <p>It only gives this notification since it now also bypasses occupation immunity; it used to be the normal “Someone occupied you” message before the bypass change. Even if the message is reverted, occupy immune classes will still be able to tell they visited a butler.</p>
