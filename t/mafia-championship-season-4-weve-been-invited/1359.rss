    <title>Mafia Championship Season 4: We&#39;ve been invited</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mafia-championship-season-4-weve-been-invited/1359</link>
    <description>&gt;[b][u]INVITATION TO THE MAFIA CHAMPIONSHIP (SEASON 4)[/u][/b]

&gt;Hello everyone! :)

&gt;I would very much like to invite your community to take part in Season 4 of the Mafia Championship.

&gt;The Mafia Championship is an annual online tournament series that pits representatives from various forum Mafia (aka Werewolf) communities against one another as they compete to determine the Internet’s greatest forum Mafia player. Each participating community democratically elects one person to represent them and become their “Champion”.

&gt;Season 1 ran in 2013-2014, while Season 2 and Season 3 ran in 2015 and 2016, respectively. As of Season 3, a total of 160 communities have been represented in the Mafia Championship, making it the largest cross-forum event on the Internet.

&gt;I hope that all this sounds very exciting to you guys :)

&gt;1. [b]Do you accept the invite?[/b]

&gt;If your community wishes to participate, please confirm your participation to me ASAP to ensure yourselves a spot

&gt;If you agree to participate, the deadline for selecting your representative is [b]April 23[/b]. If this is too soon for you, just let me know :)

&gt;The games will take place on Mafia Universe. If it’s okay, I can link directly to the general discussion thread regarding this topic on Mafia Universe.

&gt;[u]Important notes[/u]
[list][*]You may decide yourselves how you want to elect your representative, but we highly recommend some sort of democratic process (public nominations followed by a poll usually works out well).[*]In addition to electing a representative, you should also name an alternate who will be asked to step in if the first choice needs to back out.[*]Your representative should be prepared for having to read upwards of 500 posts per 24 hours during the early stages of the game. Additionally, there’s a requirement that each player must make at least 10 posts per Game Day. Only active players should apply/participate. I repeat: [b]Your chosen player needs to be able to promise a good amount of activity on a daily basis.[/b][*]Relevant only to communities that participated last season: Season 3 Finalists are not eligible to play again this season.[/list]

&gt;2. [b]Season 4 Format[/b]

&gt;[u]The tournament structure[/u]
[list][*]150 communities will participate, each sending one representative.[*]10 Qualifying Games will be played consisting of 15 players each. I.e. every representative plays in one Qualifying Game. 1 player will advance directly to the Finale Game from each Qualifying Game. The players themselves vote post-game to determine who is deserving of advancement. I.e. 10 of the 15 finalists will be found this way.[*]A Jury consisting of finalists from Season 3 will along with me discuss and vote to determine a group of 30 wildcard players who will play in 2 Semi Final Wildcard Games. From each of these two games, two players will directly advance to the Finale Game. The last finalist is selected by the Jury[*]The Finale Game is played. Once it has completed, the players vote to determine who shall hold the title of Season 4 Champion.[/list]

&gt;[u]The setup[/u]

&gt;MOUNTAINOUS:
[color=green]12 Vanilla Townies[/color]
[color=red]3 Mafia Goons[/color]

&gt;We’re going back to basics for Season 4. Each season we’re changing it up, and for this season it’s finally time to play without any power roles or abilities at all. Pure mafia. You have only yourself and your reading/bluffing abilities to count on.

&gt;[u]Relevant mechanics info[/u]
[list][*]Day start.[*]Deadline Lynch w/ Option for Majority starting Day 2. I.e. when day timer runs out, person with most votes will be lynched. However, day can also be ended early (starting Day 2) if there is ever a majority of votes on one person.[*]If there is a tied lynch, one of the tied players will be randomly lynched.[*]No outside communication. I.e. you may not contact the other players outside of the thread (unless you are Mafia and wish to speak with your teammates).[*]Phase Lengths and Deadlines will be up to the players themselves (I’ll organize them into games with deadlines that suit their preferences).[*]Thread is locked during Night Phases.[/list]

&gt;3. [b]Season 4 Timeline[/b]

&gt;There will be 10 Qualifying Games, and your representative plays in just one of these. They will have start dates during the months of May and June. So in other words, as long as your representative can play sometime during that period, they should be good and I’ll make sure they get scheduled into a game that suits their schedule well. I.e. if your rep is busy until June, that isn’t a problem.

&gt;Kind regards,
Thingyman

&gt;If you want to get in contact with me ASAP, you can find me on Skype (thingyman) or Discord (Thingyman#6075).

So we have 2 decisions, as a community, to make
1. do we enter
2. if we enter, who will represent us?

            <p>Unfortuntely with exams and the my school expedition coming up, I would then be inactive. I would be the wrong person to play then. Maybe next season if they do it again and I may not be busy but till then, no.</p>
<ol>
<li>I say yes we should enter. And I think we should add more people to the pool as well as Frost and Ryan</li>
<li>I will nominate Jammy to do this (if you so wish)</li>

            <p>But is it really fair to send a player who hasn’t played in any of the Forum of Lies games yet?</p>
<p>Like, no disrespect to him, and I know of his contributions to Throne of Lies and his experience with Mafia in general, but I’d rather send somebody active in games here. Show that, even if we’re a startup with balance problems, we can still send a decent player.</p>

            <p>If the entire series is being run through forum posts, there’s next to nothing to call out suspicion on people, since people can take time to curate a post and edit it until it makes the most sense.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">INVITATION TO THE MAFIA CHAMPIONSHIP (SEASON 4)</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would very much like to invite your community to take part in Season 4 of the Mafia Championship.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mafia Championship is an annual online tournament series that pits representatives from various forum Mafia (aka Werewolf) communities against one another as they compete to determine the Internet’s greatest forum Mafia player. Each participating community democratically elects one person to represent them and become their “Champion”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Season 1 ran in 2013-2014, while Season 2 and Season 3 ran in 2015 and 2016, respectively. As of Season 3, a total of 160 communities have been represented in the Mafia Championship, making it the largest cross-forum event on the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that all this sounds very exciting to you guys <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">Do you accept the invite?</span></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your community wishes to participate, please confirm your participation to me ASAP to ensure yourselves a spot</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you agree to participate, the deadline for selecting your representative is <span class="bbcode-b">April 23</span>. If this is too soon for you, just let me know <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The games will take place on Mafia Universe. If it’s okay, I can link directly to the general discussion thread regarding this topic on Mafia Universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Important notes</span><br>
[list][<em>]You may decide yourselves how you want to elect your representative, but we highly recommend some sort of democratic process (public nominations followed by a poll usually works out well).[</em>]In addition to electing a representative, you should also name an alternate who will be asked to step in if the first choice needs to back out.[<em>]Your representative should be prepared for having to read upwards of 500 posts per 24 hours during the early stages of the game. Additionally, there’s a requirement that each player must make at least 10 posts per Game Day. Only active players should apply/participate. I repeat: <span class="bbcode-b">Your chosen player needs to be able to promise a good amount of activity on a daily basis.</span>[</em>]Relevant only to communities that participated last season: Season 3 Finalists are not eligible to play again this season.[/list]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><span class="bbcode-b">Season 4 Format</span></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The tournament structure</span><br>
[list][<em>]150 communities will participate, each sending one representative.[</em>]10 Qualifying Games will be played consisting of 15 players each. I.e. every representative plays in one Qualifying Game. 1 player will advance directly to the Finale Game from each Qualifying Game. The players themselves vote post-game to determine who is deserving of advancement. I.e. 10 of the 15 finalists will be found this way.[<em>]A Jury consisting of finalists from Season 3 will along with me discuss and vote to determine a group of 30 wildcard players who will play in 2 Semi Final Wildcard Games. From each of these two games, two players will directly advance to the Finale Game. The last finalist is selected by the Jury[</em>]The Finale Game is played. Once it has completed, the players vote to determine who shall hold the title of Season 4 Champion.[/list]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The setup</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MOUNTAINOUS:<br>
<font color="green">12 Vanilla Townies</font><br>
<font color="red">3 Mafia Goons</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re going back to basics for Season 4. Each season we’re changing it up, and for this season it’s finally time to play without any power roles or abilities at all. Pure mafia. You have only yourself and your reading/bluffing abilities to count on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Relevant mechanics info</span><br>
[list][<em>]Day start.[</em>]Deadline Lynch w/ Option for Majority starting Day 2. I.e. when day timer runs out, person with most votes will be lynched. However, day can also be ended early (starting Day 2) if there is ever a majority of votes on one person.[<em>]If there is a tied lynch, one of the tied players will be randomly lynched.[</em>]No outside communication. I.e. you may not contact the other players outside of the thread (unless you are Mafia and wish to speak with your teammates).[<em>]Phase Lengths and Deadlines will be up to the players themselves (I’ll organize them into games with deadlines that suit their preferences).[</em>]Thread is locked during Night Phases.[/list]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><span class="bbcode-b">Season 4 Timeline</span></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be 10 Qualifying Games, and your representative plays in just one of these. They will have start dates during the months of May and June. So in other words, as long as your representative can play sometime during that period, they should be good and I’ll make sure they get scheduled into a game that suits their schedule well. I.e. if your rep is busy until June, that isn’t a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Thingyman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to get in contact with me ASAP, you can find me on Skype (thingyman) or Discord (Thingyman#6075).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have 2 decisions, as a community, to make</p>
<ol>
<li>do we enter</li>
<li>if we enter, who will represent us?</li>
</ol>
<p>discuss</p>
