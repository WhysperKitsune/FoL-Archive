          <h1>Welcome to SFoL - Triple Threat: Hand of Byzantium!</h1>
<p>Hosted by Alice</p>
<p><strong>In a far away land, a magnanimous empire rules fairly over its land. However, familiar threats seem to be looming on the horizon…</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Triple Threat: Hand of Byzantium. This SFoL takes up a mixture of Moleland’s Triple Threat Setup while also utilizing the Hand of Byzantium Class cards in order to spice things up, this in short is a HoB game that has a multiball setup. The setup here is simple. The uninformed majority needs to find and execute both the Cult and the Unseen. The only difference here is that the uninformed majority is a different faction than the Blue Dragon, and both scum factions are present rather than a single one. The King is also replaced with an Emperor that is more social and active than the classic King.</p>

<h1>Changes from Normal HoB.</h1>
<ul>
<li>There will be a lynch on the first day and it will last 72 hours rather than 24.</li>
<li>The conversion cooldown has been increased from one day to two days to balance the fact that both factions are present.</li>
<li>The Mastermind and the Cult Leader will only be able to convert starting the second night to compensate for their additional starting member.</li>
<li>If both factions attempt to convert the same player, the one with less members will gain the convert.</li>
<li>In the above case that both factions have the same amount of members, the Cult will gain the convert.</li>
<li>The Random Unseen can also be promoted to Mastermind.</li>
<li>The limit of classes with Prestige spawning is 3 rather than 2.</li>
<li>To accomodate the higher number of players the Unseen cap will be raised to 4 and the Cult cap will be raised to 5. Both factions will start with 3 players each.</li>
<li>The Priestess and the Saint will not roll this match nor will the Pardoner or Blasphemer roll for the Random Unseen slot. Starting Ritualists cannot select the Priestess alts.</li>
<li>The Eccentric and the Bard gained some form of conversion protection in their abilities.</li>
<li>The Apostle has been reworked for this SFoL in order to remove all forms of dead interaction.</li>
