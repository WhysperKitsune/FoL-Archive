    <title>Deathnote Editor - (One for each class) Picture Example included</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/deathnote-editor-one-for-each-class-picture-example-included/4703</link>
    <description>I have decided to copy paste down my idea again from Discord, to give it more spotlight.

I have a suggestion which might be good...

1) **Give the Ability to Draw/Save Deathnotes to from the main Menu** (A different unique deathnote for each class), which can be used in game either with a click of a button or automatically.
2) At the top of the Deathnote Editor from provide a warning that inappropriate images will be reported which may result with a ban.
3) Add Colours (Black/White/Red/Yellow/Blue/Orange/Green/Violet)
4) Different designs of Paper to draw Deathnotes on..

OPTIONAL Side Notes:
-Perhaps only allow Black/Red to start with and you can &#39;Purchase&#39; More Colours $$$ with gold.
-Either make it so deathnotes HAVE to be done from main menu // or let them choose from ingame to draw or use premade.
-Different designs of Paper to write Deathnotes can be bought with $$$ gold.

Desired Effects
1) This will bring further enjoyment to the game for both Player and Viewer.
2) Will bring Creativity and Personality to each player and the role they play.
3) Will lower new players getting banned for being childish.
4) Will lower the amount of reports which Devs have to act upon, thus giving the devs more time to make improvements and less time reviewing reported images.
5) Making extra colours purchasable gives players things to do with gold, and if gold is purchaseable with real money in future could bring in $$ for the devs.
6) Different Death Note Papers that can be bought for gold, and if gold is purchaseable with real money in future could bring in $$ for the devs.

            <p>I was taking earlier about how sometimes I am so busy making a deathnote I don’t realise  I am about to get executed or some such similar activity . would be nice to have a way to preload a selection I had already drawn before the game .<br>
You could also have a slots available micro transaction for gold .<br>
So I could save 3 pics normally but if I paid gold etc I could save more to choose from in game .</p>
<p>Also trying to draw in game can be a rush so not as good as you could get if people had a bit of time .</p>
<p>Everyone loves a good death note <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

The Developers have already stated that they are going to introduce the ability to buy gold with money.</p>
<p>I’m surprised you totally overlooked my whole suggestion which is to introduce a Deathnote Editor to the main menu just to nitpick something which would be purely optional. If nothing else my idea brings something new to the table to spend gold on… as at the moment you can have 1 weapon and 1 armour which is cosmetic.</p>
<p>At moment I have over 4000 gold I have no reason to spend any more gold, as I have a weapon I like and a clothing I like for my character… Something new to spend gold on would be a great addition… thats why deathnotes paper styles and different colours would be a good suggestion.</p>

            <p>I have decided to copy paste down my idea again from Discord, to give it more spotlight.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion which might be good…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Give the Ability to Draw/Save Deathnotes to from the main Menu</strong> (A different unique deathnote for each class), which can be used in game either with a click of a button or automatically.</li>
<li>At the top of the Deathnote Editor from provide a warning that inappropriate images will be reported which may result with a ban.</li>
<li>Add Colours (Black/White/Red/Yellow/Blue/Orange/Green/Violet)</li>
<li>Different designs of Paper to draw Deathnotes on…</li>
</ol>
<p>OPTIONAL Side Notes:<br>
-Perhaps only allow Black/Red to start with and you can ‘Purchase’ More Colours $$$ with gold.<br>
-Either make it so deathnotes HAVE to be done from main menu // or let them choose from ingame to draw or use premade.<br>
-Different designs of Paper to write Deathnotes can be bought with $$$ gold.</p>
