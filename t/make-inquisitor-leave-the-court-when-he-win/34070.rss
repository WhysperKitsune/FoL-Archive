    <title>Make Inquisitor leave the court when he win!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-inquisitor-leave-the-court-when-he-win/34070</link>
    <description>When inquisitor wins for example, Day 3, he becomes a huge problem for Cult and BD magic users! And thats not even the Inquisitor goal!

My idea: When Inquisitor wins, he leaves the court next day, he still appears on Night room (because he is alive) but he dont go to court anymore. Abilities got silenced, he is no longer a target for abilities, and he appears like (Inquisitor) in the players card, just like King.

Optional: Make him hear dead people when he win, but he cant answer.

Hope you like my idea, sorry if my english is not the best :)</description>

            <p>If Inquisitor only gets silenced when he wins, he is also a threat and thats also not his goal.</p>
<p>He can vote, he can troll-claim and exe someone, etc.</p>
<p>Court just dont need him anymore! Let him go!</p>

            <p>Although, we could always have Inq stick around and cause them to lose all their abilities, too.  People are much less likely to fake-claim Inq (it doesn’t explain as much, plus it’s unique and requires a sorc), so it wouldn’t be quite as important as the scorned, but it’s still an option, especially if the real Inq gets defiled or something.  And there isn’t a huge amount of harm to having Inq stick around with no abilities.</p>

<p>So what your saying is people can’t have fun after they win?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well to me I think scorned should stay (but LOSE trollbox), just on the basis that won scorned isn’t a bad desperation claim for an evil, and that should be left as a possibility. The keeping the trollbox to me was the exact oposite of a good idea… the only good reason a scorned should stick around IMO is the doubt that exists of “was he really a scorned or is that just a really good cover for some other evil”. Trollbox gives wonned scorned the aiblity to self confirm… which is just silly to me.</p>
<p>Inq though, never is a good fake claim as it’s unique and only appears with sorc.</p>
<p>Now as far as “having fun”, it’s less about that, and more about their ability to chose a winner. normally if you perfectly accurately manage to figure out a class, you know their win condiiton, and can have a decent idea of what they are trying to do. Even an alchemist you can make assumptions of what they will and won’t do. Say an alchemist is unlikely to do actions that are likely to get them executed or attacked. As a result the living players can work with that, threaten or offer support to the alc to get him to do what they want etc… A living alc is a wildcard, but he is one that can be anticipated in some way, as well as manipulated.</p>
<p>A won inq though, he could totally kill 3 cultists, he could intentionally stab the confirmed psychic and paladin back to back, and neither is strategically better or worse than eachother, because neither has any connection to his already completed win condition.</p>
