    <title>A king died and for some people in the game the new king wasnt displayed</title>

    <description>#### What happened? For several people in the game there was no king displayed

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? A normal king vote

#### Steps to reproduce:not sure I dunno if there is a game id i can find 

#### Comments: A king died and a vote happened the same day, a couple people stepped forward and I voted for one but never saw who won, for the rest of the game the only king in the game was the one who died. Several people saw the same thing but some people apparently saw the guy who actually got elected king as king like normal. I think treason votes also looked odd. Instead of saying 8 accused 9 of treason it would just say 8 voted, like a king vote.</description>
