    <title>Disconnecting/Reconnecting During Game Frequently</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/disconnecting-reconnecting-during-game-frequently/26261</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
During the game, I keep getting disconnected and reconnected. This happens a three to four times a match, typically. I&#39;ve missed entire rounds because of this, at times.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Staying connected.
#### Steps to reproduce:
I&#39;m not sure how to reproduce this but it happens every game.
#### Comments:
Sometimes during a reconnect, I can not view the logs of people or deathnotes unless they die after I reconnect. The reconnect takes up to 60-80 seconds at a time. I can&#39;t upload my logs since I&#39;m a new user? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>
