    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/buffs-nerfs-suggestions-2/59592</link>
    <description>Okay suggestions for buffs, nerfs ect

Herbalist
-Day ability added-Defile logs: Blank log book that you write stuff in that will show up in place of the defiled persons log book.

Alcoholic
-Can happy hour prince
-Redirecting Investigators now make you show up as Blue dragon. 

Night watch
-Buffed follow to let you know the person visiting the targets Class. You follow A. B visits A. You learn B&#39;s Class and not A. Probably one of the bigger buffs, can be very nice to know which class is visiting. It&#39;s not overpowered cause its one of the worst converts. Feel free to comment on this if you think it is.

Alchemist
-Stone skins reduced to 3.
-Stone skins now protect you  FROM ALL DEATH. King OE. Prince execution, He won&#39;t lose a exe just won&#39;t be ax&#39;d by him. Feel free if you think the prince one isn&#39;t needed. Stone skins basically makes it sure you don&#39;t die that night.
-Bomb&#39;s have been upped to 3.

Merc
-Can be contracted to possessor. Your contract switches to the person he poss&#39;d next. Had to add this one in.

Duchess
-Day ability added-(NAME NEEDED):Check&#39;s a person faction-3-2 uses (depends on I just wanted to add this)

Okay now you are ready to shred through this...</description>

            <p>So let’s see here…<br>
Herbalist: A forge eh? It’s not a bad idea although i’m not sure if this fit to this role.<br>
Nightwatch: Subjective opinion is subjective, you called him bad, other guy will say he’s ok i would probably focus on other converts.<br>
Alcoholic: Yes definetely! Something like debauching investigators and came up as BD should be from beginning, and abillity to block Prince is also pretty nice.<br>
Duchess:<br>
I’m not sure, lad. Couldn’t be better if we just upgrade her main abillity and make that it will show class type and faction?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It is my belief that the good faction in a social deduction game needs to have an infallible way to get rid people who are completely outed or are simply confirmed scum. That is typically voting, but Fool or executing a good king, makes that fallible, so Prince execution fulfills that role. For sake of consistency, Drunk’s Happy Hour should also disturb Prince then and I must say I do not feel that strongly about the issue one way or another, except for Alchemist surviving prince execution, but I don’t think that was what you were referring to.</p>

            <p>The counter play to Prince is to kill him. He has zero defensive abilities and exactly the Alcoholic can get rid of that pesky Knight/Physician trying to protect him. If Prince knows who you are, and he hasn’t executed any BD before that, you have made a mistake and you should die in jail!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Herbalist</p>
<ul>
<li>Support, current Herbalist sucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcholic</p>
<ul>
<li>Not support. Prince should be infallible. It is typically better for the alcoholic to debauch protectives of confirmed BD, simultaneously framing those protectives. It is actually sometimes smart to debauch a sheriff, because it takes heat off MM and MM can just reconvert the third slot, so this would buff the alcoholic’s survival, but not the unseen’s winrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nightwatch</p>
<ul>
<li>Not support. Observers/Nightwatches are super strong already and I feel this change borders on OP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alchemist</p>
<ul>
<li>Not support. Attacks going through night immunity exist for a reason. Prince should remain infallible in this  regard as well. Stoneskin could be lowered to 3 uses. Bombs should not go above 2. Imagine the kill per nights of 2 yolobombing alchemists and the regular scum. 2 uses makes sure that Alchemists have to play the game and have a good fakeclaim or confirmed heals, before they can just end out the game immediately by killing everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merc</p>
<ul>
<li>Not sure, it might be difficult to coordinate with a possessor that jumps to different players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Duchess</p>
<ul>
<li>Support, more day abilities are nice and finding neutrals is a huge benefit to the unseen. Not more than 1 use in my opinion though, because it can quickly turn overpowered.</li>

<p>I have an alternative idea. Give him a day Ability that makes the redirect silent. So it instead frames his target essentially while also having uses in other situations.</p>

            <p>Okay suggestions for buffs, nerfs ect</p>
<p>Herbalist<br>
-Day ability added-Defile logs: Blank log book that you write stuff in that will show up in place of the defiled persons log book.</p>
<p>Alcoholic<br>
-Can happy hour prince<br>
-Redirecting Investigators now make you show up as Blue dragon.</p>
<p>Night watch<br>
-Buffed follow to let you know the person visiting the targets Class. You follow A. B visits A. You learn B’s Class and not A. Probably one of the bigger buffs, can be very nice to know which class is visiting. It’s not overpowered cause its one of the worst converts. Feel free to comment on this if you think it is.</p>
<p>Alchemist<br>
-Stone skins reduced to 3.<br>
-Stone skins now protect you  FROM ALL DEATH. King OE. Prince execution, He won’t lose a exe just won’t be ax’d by him. Feel free if you think the prince one isn’t needed. Stone skins basically makes it sure you don’t die that night.<br>
-Bomb’s have been upped to 3.</p>
<p>Merc<br>
-Can be contracted to possessor. Your contract switches to the person he poss’d next. Had to add this one in.</p>
<p>Duchess<br>
-Day ability added-(NAME NEEDED):Check’s a person faction-3-2 uses (depends on I just wanted to add this)</p>
