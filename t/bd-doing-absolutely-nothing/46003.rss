    <description>As BD your days are numbered.With that said Prince can really swing the game.Thing is once prince is dead BD&#39;s only way to kill someone is with votes as you&#39;re the majority.That said as BD you **CANNOT** just sit on your ass once prince is dead.You must and I mean must be aggressive and start voting for class and logs.Now this is a bad strategy when prince is alive.Once prince is dead though this should be the go to strategy.Like seriously who are you outing?The Princess,Physician?,Knight? Like what class really swings the game for BD.Knight and Phys become lackluster without a prince to guard.So I digress why do so many BD just sit on their ass once prince is dead?You have to do something YOU HAVE TO have claims.A Passive BD is a Dead BD.Why is this so hard for people to do?It&#39;s not difficult vote someone up get their logs.If they suck Exe.Rinse repeat.If you get put up and your logs suck well then tough luck.But this strategy only works if BD has majority as BD loses it fast so you have to act while you can.</description>

            <p>Anyone that doesn’t like this strat should remember that the first team to have a member that gets everyone’s claims usually wins. An open claim practically counts as BD knowing that person more than any other faction so a mass claim is usually beneficial to BD.</p>

            <p>Of course that entails BD having much to lose.As of N3 onward if prince is dead you should just start Voting for Class as there is no downside.Sure if you exe a BD then shame but what can you do?That was your only play as BD.There was no other out.There was no magical force that was going to gift you the win.If you played passively you would have lost.Im not saying this strat is the best.I’m just saying that the minute BD lose killing power is the minute they lose.This strat should be the go to strategy once prince is dead.</p>

            <p>Even if Prince is alive, he can’t solve all of your problems. He needs leads, for example. If nobody has anything, he just has to guess. In general the more claims you get the more tools you have to figure out who is evil.</p>

            <p>Course, BD loses majority roughly twice as fast if they’re knee-jerk exeing fellow BD.  That said, you’re 110% right… a passive BD team is a dead one. After prince, the only BD off the top of my head that should be playing it safe is a hunter with no bears left, since they have an actual attack that can change the game.</p>
