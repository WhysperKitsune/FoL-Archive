    <title>King Rework (Secluded King)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-rework-secluded-king/74117</link>
    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;cyan&quot;] The Secluded King [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;cyan&quot;] Blue Dragon Support [/color]** 
&gt; **Assert the Crown (Day)** - Become the King, not usable until day 3 - **1 use**

&gt; # [color = &quot;cyan&quot;] The King [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;cyan&quot;] Blue Dragon Special [/color]** 
&gt; **Aristocratic Business (Passive)** - Unable to be Whispered to or linked
&gt; **Tenacity (Passive)** - immune to redirection and occupation 
&gt; **Royal Finger (Day)** - Your next nomination vote will count twice - Infinite uses 
&gt; **Decide Fate (Day)** - Instantly execute or pardon a player an accused player - 1 use 
&gt; **Execute (Night)** - Kill a player bypasses death immunity - 2 use 
&gt; *Defeat the Unseen/cult and any neutrals that seek to do harm.*

This makes king more of a risk reward type of character, revealing too early means king won&#39;t get any leads, and revealing too late, since king can&#39;t guard himself, will mean he will get killed by evils. It adds a bit of depth with king maybe needing to fake claim in order to preserve his identity. In my opinion &quot;Little Bird&quot; is not a fix to the meta, but a bandage, and it seems although the whispering meta has clearly been weakened greatly, it has not been dealt with in a suitable manner, as it seems whispering comes back in the game after about day 3.

**King doesn&#39;t spawn in day 1**</description>

            <p>And trust me. WKM doesn’t suddenly work after D3. MM’s don’t use little bird when no one is whispering. So if you don’t whisper for 2 days then MM won’t use little bird for 2 days and thus he will never run out. Even when he does it never is a safe assumption so you can never be sure you are safe until after it’s too late</p>
