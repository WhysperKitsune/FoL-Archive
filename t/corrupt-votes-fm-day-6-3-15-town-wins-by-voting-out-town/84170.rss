###  &quot;You can purchase everything in the world.&quot;
#### Hosted by @Zone_Q11, co-hosted by @CRichard564, and reviewed by @DatBird
---
# Rules:

1. Follow the Global Forum Rules and the [Forum Mafia Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926).
1. Post a minimum of 10 game related posts per Day Phase.
1. Do not forget to leave a vote at the end of the day. (Unless Majority was activated.)
1. Fail to heed the former three rules more than thrice, and you will be subbed out or modkilled.
1. I can and might have to add and/or remove rules in the future. Except the first rule.
Let&#39;s just hope that I won&#39;t have to use this rule.


# Role PM:

[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
&gt; # You are a [[color=]Town[/color] / [color=red]Mafia[/color]] Points Sacrificer
&gt; ---
&gt; - You start with ten (10) points which you can spend on purchasing abilities, shown at the original post of the game thread.
&gt; - You may only purchase once per phase.
&gt; - If you have successfully executed another player, you will obtain one (1) point.
&gt;
&gt; *You win when the other party has been completely eliminated.*
&gt;  `(*)` *Mafia can also win by achieving Majority.*

&gt; # You are a [[color=grey]Neutral[/color]] Points Sacrificer Scapegoat
&gt; ---
&gt; - You start with ten (10) points which you can spend on purchasing abilities, shown at the original post of the game thread.
&gt; - You may only purchase once per phase.
&gt; - If you have successfully executed another player, you will obtain one (1) point.
&gt; ---
&gt; - You die immediately if the day ends up in a tied vote.
&gt; `(*)` A tie on no-exe counts as a tie nonetheless.
&gt; `(**)` This passive will not go away, even after choosing a side.
&gt; - Before the end of Night 2, you have to choose whether you wish to side with the [color=]Town[/color] or the [color=red]Mafia[/color]. In case you have not chosen by the end of Night 2, you will die immediately.
&gt; -&gt; If you choose to side with the [color=red]Mafia[/color], you will [u]receive[/u] two (2) points.
&gt; -&gt; If you choose to side with the [color=]Town[/color], you will [u]lose[/u] one (1) point.
&gt;
&gt; *Choose a side and achieve the same wincon as theirs.*
[/details]


# General Gameplay
* Days are 36 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 12 hours.
* There are no logs / last will mechanics.
* Self-votes are considered valid votes.
* Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios.
* All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes. (Please don&#39;t put your votes at the end of a sentence and make a new line instead.)
* All actions must be submitted in your classcards.
* Flips will be shown after a player dies.
* The Mafia factional kill IS mandatory.
* The Mafia factional kill is [u]NOT[/u] assigned, meaning that no specific member of the Mafia is required to be chosen to perform the factional kill.
* The Mafia will communicate through a private message.
* The game starts when the player list is fully filled.

# Gameplay
* This is an open setup. Everyone will have the same role; Points Sacrificer.
There will be 11 [color=]Town[/color], 3 [color=red]Mafia[/color] and 1 [color=grey]Neutral[/color].
The [color=grey]Neutral[/color] will have additional restrictions.
* Executions are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the executions will be determined randomly among the players [u]outside the tie[/u].
* No Exe is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In case No Exe and a player are tied at the end of the day, No Exe takes priority.

            <p>Probably why I lost that game on the Yu-Gi-Oh Site.<br>
I told people that these 3 are Town, Town Circle.<br>
One of them voted with me and we got a scum lynched.<br>
That same One of them died N1 and what does town do? Lynch both of them twice in a row.<br>
Not to mention I narrowed it down to 2 people that could be scum and if they lynched their instead they would have won.<br>
So I gave up at that point.</p>
