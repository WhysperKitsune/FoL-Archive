<p>I mean</p>
<p>Light and I are blatantly unaligned at EoD1</p>
<p>like as far as I can tell the actual “points” you’re raising today is ‘Arete was strawmanning’ which isn’t really true, like I think you think it’s true because you think your arguments against me are good but actually your arguments against me suck which is why I’m treating them as if they suck, and … whatever your point on Derps is? like as far as I can tell your point is ‘Arete said at the start of the day that they might vote Derps, and if Derps had been voted out scum would have won’ but you’re completely ignoring the fact that when it came down to it at EoD, with multiple people saying they were willing to vote Derps, I strongarmed the vote onto Light over Derps because I’d concluded that Derps was probably villa, like as far as I can tell you just do not actually have an explanation for why I did that that makes sense with the rest of your worldview</p>

<p>it would be helpful to me in sorting you if you would walk me through your play this game, as much as you remember of what you did, and explain what you were thinking/what your perspective was/the thought process behind your actions (like as in the things you’ve done in general, not just points stuff, to be clear) (Appel I know you were only in it for a couple days, just talk about it for the days you were in the game)</p>
<details>
<summary>
example of what I mean from another game, hopefully it's clear enough what I'm looking for? (yours doesn't have to be as much of a wallpost, but more detail will be more helpful)</summary>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so I’m going to try to walk you through the thought process behind my actions, I guess</p>
<p>so on D1 I was mostly trying to find a strong towncore so that I could solve by PoE + pick good ritual targets + make good decisions about who to target with my actions, since it’s obviously important that I collect pure blood, if it would be helpful I can try to quote specific posts that demonstrate my thought process but they’re also just in my Iso, you can find them for yourself if you want to, so for instance I (?probably? correctly) cleared DryBones based on his meta, and (incorrectly) cleared Kyo. On D1 I collected blood from DryBones because he was almost certainly a villager based on meta + my personal experience with him (I’ve played with him on other sites, I wasn’t just going based off of Alice’s read here) but I was thinking at the time that he was a good ritual because he was both obvious town and kind of useless (meaning that my time window for being able to get his blood would be limited). I wasn’t sure whether to collect blood + no-action or drain blood + drink, I decided to collect blood + no-action because my slot was kind of contentious and I thought that draining three blood + drinking was likely to kill town if  I had good reads and someone decided to check me and I thought that draining four blood + drinking was only going to do something if heretics decided to visit me, which I couldn’t count on. I was mostly trying to decide between Apprentice and Appelsini as the lynch targets on D1, I scumread Apprentice because he was much less solvey than in other games I’ve seen him in (I didn’t want to say this at the time because Anime was still ongoing, but he was a lot solvier in Anime where he was town) and his reads were basically just restating consensus statements, and Appel because a lot of her thought process felt fake/forced.</p>
<p>On D2 when we were choosing the ritual target I initially went for Italy because the whole ‘ritual Italy get free peek’ think sounded really good and he seemed ?probably? legitimate, but towards EoD his ‘haha but I <em>could</em> be the Lamb’ jokes were starting to make me nervous that he actually was because that’s the sort of joke that Lamb!Italy would think was really funny to make, I didn’t initially want to CFD to Kyo when we were both in the same four-person thunderdome (instead I wanted Marshal based on his IC claim, which I saw as most likely coming from an actual IC <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png!v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png!v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png!v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:">)    but went along with the Kyo CFD because Italy had made me really nervous and I saw Apprentice as the most likely fake Blood Mage by far (so the thunderdome wasn’t really factoring into my reads).</p>
<p>After Kyo flipped I was obviously not super happy about it, I decided the best thing to do was to look through his interactions to try to re-evaluate my reads since clearly I was badly wrong about the gamestate, I do think I managed to legitimately clear some people off of that but I might have miscleared sulit. When Vul subbed in I tried especially hard to read him because in the past I’ve been really good at reading him, it took me a little while but eventually he was able to make some posts that in my experience he would only be able to make as a villager in order to correctly clear him. I used my reads-in-general + associations with Kyo to try to make a PoE for the two starting non-Kyo non-traitor heretics and came up with Apprentice/Marshal/Wispmelia, I saw Apprentice and Marshal as unlikely to be W/W because why would Apprentice thunderdome himself with his wolf partner, and furthermore thought Kyo interactions looked the best for Apprentice. Since I thought the two starting not-traitor heretics were all in the Marshal/App/Wispmelia pool and that Marshal and App weren’t W/W that meant that Wispmelia had to be a starting heretic, so I started pushing her (this was after Amelia subbed in and did a bunch of super wolfy things like talking about how we wouldn’t know if she was starting or converted if she flipped wolf), and her response to my pressure was bad and <em>also</em> Marshal was defending her, when he was one of the other three people in my ‘starting heretic’ pool so I was like ‘HMMMMMMMMMM’ but I decided to push Amelia over Marshal because I was more confident in that read while the Marshal read was more based on associatives. Marshal was also making me nervous at that point because he was doing a lot of the things that he’s specifically talked about doing when he’s trying to pocket me, which IIRC I pointed out at the time. Anyways, we were pretty obviously behind even if Amelia was a hit, so I decided to drain blood from three people, which would give me four stacks of blood total. I didn’t want to take it from only two people (making three in total) because in that case if Amelia was a miss I was likely going to get visited by investigatives/offensives and if she was a hit there was a decent chance I’d be visited by protectives, the first one being especially bad because if too many visited me I could just accidentally send us past parity. I chose katze/Alice/Vul as my three targets, I don’t actually remember why I went with Alice and in hindsight if I could do that again I’d have gone with Italy but at the time I kind of forgot that Italy existed, Vul I was confident was a villager from talking to him and katze was also very villagery, I thought about you (Braixen) but at the time I had you still as a possible convert.</p>
<p>Night 2 I drank blood and hoped really hard that scum would visit me + that the blood was pure, even though at that point it was unlikely that both those things were true. Also I asked N.1 if Elixir of Blood kills could have deathnotes, since the OP said deathnotes could be submitted on a kill, and apparently they could (which is sort of weird because they aren’t targeted attacks but he’s the host not me) so I made a deathnote that said ‘Arete was here’ so I’d know for absolute certain if I’d killed anyone + be able to semi-prove myself. Also overnight I tried to re-evaluate my reads, because for Wispmelia to flip town I had to have miscleared someone. You can see my thought process for that in my logs dump at the start of the day, towards the end when I was running out of time it basically displays my thought process in real time.</p>

<p>Today I really didn’t want us to screw up and ritual scum again, I did ~math~ with everyone else about what each ritual type would mean for us numbers-wise and that’s part of why I wanted to go with a kat ritual, it was making me nervous that Marshal was pushing for it when he was thunderdomed with kat but kat was being super villagery particularly towards EoD and I didn’t really want to try another CFD. That vote was actually almost certainly a good vote, as in a vote on a villager, just obviously it didn’t work out. Also when people were talking about ritualling me I updated my logs just in case I got ritualled. I switched the kill ritual onto Wazza because he was being super wolfy and the vote ritual onto Braixen because if I accidentally gave it to a wolf that would be really bad and I didn’t super trust Braixen’s reads but I trusted his alignment (they had previously been on App and Marshal respectively, both of which were holdovers from D2).</p>
<p>I was doing a Duolingo Polish lesson while I waited for the results of the ritual so it took me a couple minutes to see the result, the <em>first</em> thing I saw was a red rolecard and I was upset with myself for misreading kat except then two seconds later my brain caught up enough to actually read the name and instead it was like ??how?? did Marshal??? get ritualled?? although I figured out that one pretty quickly. Since the Marshal ritual happened I’ve been trying to reevaluate my reads and figure out (a) who I can trust (b) who I can <em>still</em> trust, I want to try to look more at Marshal’s spew to figure out who isn’t W/W with Marshal but it’s hard because I don’t know for sure if he was converted or starting. I do think I’ve managed to clear a few people as not converted but overall this situation kind of sucks.</p>

          <p>Sure, ezpz for me tbh.</p>
<details>
<summary>
The inner machinations of my mind</summary>
<p>I will run through my D1. D1 I mostly wanted to do a reaction test to see if I could force scum into buying votes from me D2, since they would only get 1 and I would gain coins to use in future rounds. My read on you and Alice was quite and has been persistent since then. I decided <em>to</em> make this read because I know that solving you both early on is good because the later games go on, the more deepwolf paranoia begins so by just getting it done with, I was able to move on and focus onto others.</p>
<p>I also interacted more with people who I struggle to read, such as Cheese and Trochi. In the end I misread Trochi because some posts felt disingenuine and I think in retrospect my scumread on Cloned was a bit fast, though I still dislike how they handled Alice being the claimed neut and voting them for a significant time.</p>
<p>N1, I chose to not buy anything. I know that based on discussion I should have bought the tri vote but since I had planned D2 to do the whole bluff thing, I had to withhold from doing it then. I had considered whether thugging was good but there was not enough information to go off. Another reason I did not buy anything was because vote power would be high on D2 so I felt like it would not impact anything. I also used N1 to think over my reads some more as by then I had decided to let Wazza stay alive and just be someone for me to read later on.</p>
<p>D2, I went with the bluff but quickly changed it when I realised how scummy it would be once revealed that it was all a lie and the amount of time that I had wasted. I panicked due to the lie that I would be suspicious so I aimed to have it so that I could buy something, the triplevoter on the following night. I decided to joke about with Alice because it was still early on in the day and I do not regret that as I think it kept the thread pleasant.</p>
<p>I also did it so I could appear as my usual town self because I wanted to not be mislynched and so far it seems that it had worked. Both Alice and Arete at the time had agreed that I was likelier doing it as town than scum. I know it might be a bit unusual, but I wanted to use the meta to my advantage so I could live and actually do stuff.</p>
<p>Cloned and I had more interactions due to me suspecting them, but, this day was also when I did say my suspicions on the Eli slot which now holds Appel. I said I would likely miss EoD and I did. I correctly read Conduit though which made me feel proud despite the lynch going poorly.</p>
<p>N2, I got triplevote because, well, yeah. I kinda had to at that point.</p>
<p>D3, I very clearly had forgotten a bit about Eli and nobody really questioned it. I made a readslist and explained them. It was not the best since based off my current reads, it would mean I had 4 people wrong and 1 person fully missed off. I voted cheese because I was thinking they were scum, still from the paranoia of cheese having voted Alice and only really done that D1. I thought it was sufficiently scummy to continue my SR on them without just full reevaluation without bias.</p>
<p>N3, chose to buy nothing. Had no reason to do so and only 5 coins left. I started to feel a bit pissed off that I was on no wagons so had no spare coins at any other point.</p>
<p>D4, was honestly kinda a clusterfuck due to the forums going down and it killed most of the motivation I had. We had a usual fun me v Seth thing and I did not realise Call was Seth nor did I realise Lemon subbed for Alice, or, at least I forgot it later on and just thought of it like another slot which would be good for solving a slot had it not been the neut claim lol.</p>
<p>I tried to explain away my dumbness using sleep deprivation because, lets be honest, yall know I rarely ever get enough sleep and I thought that it would be thought of in a positive way because I was just being honest instead of making shit up.</p>
<p>Seth asked me to analyse Light because he kept saying we were a scumteam, some of which was based off false narrative for example the chart Light made, Seth said was made for this game in scumchat which I dismissed Seth for. I did not end up placing a vote for EoD but as I said I always would have voted Light over Arete so I at least spiritually on the wagon. The reason for this again was rest.</p>
<p>N4 I chose to buy triplevoter as now, votes are fucking <em>important</em> as I realised when I was analysing the possible results come the night end. Which is what I said a bit into today.</p>
<p>D5 so far I have attempted to poe everyone which I think is just as effective as deep analysing one slot in an ISO dive because I have known that I can be wrong when doing it that way so thought to try something new here which conceptually should be similar but hopefully will have different results.</p>

Trochilidae - The Vig claim was either a joke or a mistake on Chili’s part. Not a scumslip but a mis-reading. Either way, the way they did it feels off from my POV and unlike the Chili I’ve seen before.</p>

<p><strong>Light</strong></p>
<p><em>Why I was clearing Light:</em> <s>I was sheeping Alice</s> Light seemed to have posting that was mostly fairly decent (which his posting as scum usually isn’t). I also was soft-clearing him for how he handled the Wazza CFD at EoD – I think scum there would usually have jumped on for cred if they weren’t going to do anything to try to stop the wagon.</p>
<p><em>Do I think these reasons are good/still apply:</em> Light’s another slot that’s dropped off a lot (like, even if I look purely at activity, he has 8 posts today, which is a lot less than he had in the early game). I’d put this in a similar space to Eli, but a bit above Eli because he has slightly favorable Wazza interactions (albeit nothing unfakeable)</p>

<p>First of all this seems like an admission of guilt <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png!v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>
<p>The fact that you’re voting for PKR is just another reason why i think PKR is town, i have other ones</p>

</aside>
<p>How is it an admission of guilt? I just find it baffling that you would put so much weight on your suspicion of my read that it would influence your read on someone else. It’d be fine if you were convinced by my explanation or something but your reason seemed to be based on your scum-read on me and general distrust towards me. That reason would make sense if you thought I were on the scum team and had insider info but I’m just a neutral and there’s only 1 scum left so I’m struggling to see where you’re coming from.</p>
<p>If you have other reasons to town-read PKR, I’d love to hear them because I’m definitely not convinced by the reasons you’ve given so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think lemon is scum here, most importantly for their vote on PKR first thing today with the note “gg town” - i really cant see this as anything else than an invitation for scum to vote similarly. Why would anyone vote so quickly on something they realize is simply “you’re the only one i dont have a read on” and not take the vote down after their positions have softened?<br>
I dont see much point debating this, we kill lemon tmrw if we survive tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>*only one I don’t have a town read on<br>
PKR has thus far not shown any towniness that I have caught strong or weak hints off everyone else. Surge got NK’d and their top suspects were Light and PKR. I had a similar lack of town vibes from Derps before EOD4 but derps flipped town after getting mod-killed. Maybe I was being over-confident in my suspicion of PKR, but I genuinely believe they are the most likely candidate to be scum.</p>
<p>Also, considering the fact that I was the second to jump on Light’s vote wagon after Surge, I really question your scum read on me, which seems to come from paranoia more than anything else. If I were really scum-sided, I would just sit back and not say anything and vote last rather than start the day off by voting someone, thereby drawing attention to myself. Either way, your main reason for defending PKR thus far has been because I voted them and since you’re sure I’m scum, PKR must be town. Such logic makes absolute no sense to me but I appreciate your analysis on other people in this post.</p>
