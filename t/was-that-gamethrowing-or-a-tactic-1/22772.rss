            <p>No,purely outing yourself as MM would NOT have been gamethrowing in this situation(outing Nightwatch was).<br>
MM outs themselves at trial(they WERE at trial!) and gets Decide Fate pardoned=Unseen lynches someone else(for example, Prince)<br>
MM does not out themselves and gets executed; at night Prince(who was alive) imprisons and executes Assassin; then the former Nightwatch gets executed for treason at day(King+Assassin against 5 bd); no one kills, Drunk proves themselves, Psychic proves themselves, Prince is proven, King gets executed. Unseen loses.</p>

            <p>It’s still gamethrowing  as you had majority and could’ve won that day without the MM outing themself.<br>
Outing yourself as MM is gamethrowing because it usually destroys both your converted targets and yourself.<br>
However, putting an incriminatiing result on a fellow unseen in your loogbook, so long as you’ve asked permission before, <strong>is not gamethrowing</strong> and should not be treated as such. This is a valid strategy called <strong>Bussing</strong>, but it is used solely to gain towncred.</p>
<hr>
<p>Side note: Can I just say that I love the fact that the devs have acknowledged that a fairly advanced strategy exists publicly and thus can make good players actually exist? Sorry, go bak on topic.</p>

            <p>Because the MM outed its converted target definitely yes.<br>
Note: Just claiming MM at this stage is not necessarily gamethrowing, especially when telling the King that you have majority with them!</p>
