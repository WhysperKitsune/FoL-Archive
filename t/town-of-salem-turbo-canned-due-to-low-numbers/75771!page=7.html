<p>so basically what you’re doing right now, huh? and again, what reason would i have to lie about a fucking GAME MECHANIC?? not to mention(AGAIN) that your reasoning is flawed and imbalanced, which you refuse to state. if you didn’t think i was dong it then why not give me the benefit of the doubt then??? also, at least i can fucking admit that i’m wrong when the facts are presented</p>

basically a lame way of saving face if(more like when tbh) proven wrong, which you are still trying to do which pisses me off since you can’t acknowledge the fact that you’re wrong and should just deal with it</p>

<p>i havent formally admitted defeat quite yet because to the very moment your still being <em>so fucking aggressive</em> and i absolutely refuse to do that to someone being as aggressive as you are, as it supports the idea that being that aggressive when your not trying to intimidate them (you have no means to harm me, so its not intimidating at all, just annoying) is something good and i fundamentally disagree with as an idea.</p>

</aside>
<p>oh yeah this is exactly what i mean when i say that you won’t admit defeat because you’re embarassed or some shit like YOU’RE PROVEN WRONG JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP<br>
and me “being aggressive” isn’t an excuse like are you [REDACTED] how the fuck does that make you right?? so apparently me being aggressive means that facts become lies and lies become facts? great well in that case i’m santa claus and you’ve been naughty so you’re getting a DRDO shoving upped your ass</p>
