    <description>## Welcome

### Rules

### Gameplay
Cycles are 5 minutes during the day, or shorter if somebody dies. 2 minutes during the night
Actions are done by messaging me
Mafia/Coven/Vampires/Lovers will talk through a special server
Medium will speak with the dead through a separate server
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it.
To Whisper a player, type &quot;**/whisper (player) [message]&quot;**. no players will be alerted except the player you whispered. The player you whispered will know you whispered them

### Executions
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot; 
There are no trials, whoever has most votes at the end of the day will be executed.
Executions end the Day
Trials pause the counter

### After The Night
You will be told what happened to you

### Wills
Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed.

            <p>well, if simon has any logical arguments, he can continue it in dms</p>
<p>and no offense to magnus but i’m really not interested in joining a 15p turbo where every has a role (and that’d be tough on the host as well)</p>
<p>i’d much rather just play tos on steam :///</p>

<p>his aggressive responses (in like the 1st half mainly) served to lengthen this out and make it harder for me to accurately answer to his points</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you feel like my responses are too aggressive, then you should just leave. I have told you this NUMEROUS times, yet you ignored me, so you cannot blame me when you instigated it and continued it, because it meant that you wanted it(stop blaming me for your life choices). Additionally, aggressive responses are in no way, shape, or form illogical or against whatever fucking rules. I also cannot see how my foul language makes it harder for you to answer points when I state them pretty clearly in my opinion, and also put them in bullet points for you to answer. If you refuse to answer them, then I have no clue what you are talking about or trying to argue about so that is not entirely my fault, so I ask you <em>one last time</em>, what the fuck do you want and what point are you trying to drive across.</p>

<p>Additionally, if I feel offended, I am in NO OBLIGATION to tell you so. Normal people don’t tend to say they feel offended in casual situations(which it was until it was escalated). Putting your intentional bad attitude on me is the epitome of arrogance and I cannot see how it is my fault at all for your shitty behavior. Yes, I did insult you afterwards, but you also admitted that you were condescending so it was not undeserved, did nothing to try and fix it, continued to spam like you did nothing wrong, refused to answer logical and reasonable points, and tried to pin the blame on me.</p>

</aside>
<p>BUT you were disrespectful in your following posts and did not bother to correct your behavior after you even admitted that your way of typing can be seen as rude/condescending which only leads me to believe that you are doing it on purpose. Perhaps you were not doing it intentionally at first, BUT your posts followed a similar trend which makes it seem like it was intentional.</p>

            <p>I am arguing that i had not intended to disrespect him in the beginning, such that if he had opened with his anger on specifically that (and not making me wait till like 2/3s of the way through to tell me what he was referring to) and that his response to this all has been aggressive to the point of making it harder for me to answer specifically and logically and dragging this out.<br>
more succinctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>i was not intentionally disrespectful in the beginning post. i was intending to provide what i thought was a helpful correction</li>
<li>he should have told me he felt disrespected eariler on</li>
<li>his aggressive responses (in like the 1st half mainly) served to lengthen this out and make it harder for me to accurately answer to his points</li>
</ul>
<p>and more recently:<br>
he acted like he had asked me these questions and i had been ignoring them, but he has yet to quote the original times he asked these questions. i believe he never asked them, merely pretended to, then put the blame on me</p>

            <p>i’m arguing that he’s being illogical and that i have no fucking clue what point he wants to drive across</p>
<p>also he’s being a condescending fuck but refuses to acknowledge it or do anything about it</p>
<p>for example, the “doop” spam</p>
<p>tell me if you thought that was helpful and not condescending in any way</p>
