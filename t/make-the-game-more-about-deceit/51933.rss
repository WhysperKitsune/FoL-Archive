    <title>Make the game more about deceit</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-the-game-more-about-deceit/51933</link>
    <description>I think the current game main problem is that you can&#39;t lie before the **critical stage** of the game:
When you win if your suggested target get voted out.

There are 2 ways to fix this:
1) People who get executed won&#39;t get their class revealed until the end of the game.
2) the mm/cl will have a day ability that will do (1) for 1 day (3 uses).

Sure, this can be added with a buff to bd (for example, add unique unconvertable sheriff, that now unseen can claim they are!) , but this can make the game much more interesting.

MM dead? noone knows. the outed sheriff is the real sheriff? noone know, there are still a possessor/reaper? The drunk lied?

**Edit, as you suggested, there is a third option**
**Day ability:** Defile(mm,cl)- make a player executed at day appeared like another class (3 uses), can be used on yourself.</description>

<p>Seeker and sage then? Because I don’t want MM, Assassin or CL to have a move that powerful and it is relitively common for there to be an Herbalist or Sage in an Unseen game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not  common to have those because alot of the time you don’t have 3 unseen members.<br>
The point is being able to lie in the game. Your idea is to claim later: “no it was a sage”, those claims will just get you killed anyway because it’s rare to have a sage, and in the games you have a sage the sherif will just be executed after he find an unseen, and the mm will be alive until the end.</p>
<p>So when you are giving it to sage, the unseen will be super poweful with sage, and weak without  a sage</p>
<p>It should be given to mm/seeker or mm/cl, and come with a buff to BD.</p>

            <p>Though they are an interesting mechanic, I found cleans in ToS to be just frustrating and annoying to play with.</p>
<p><strong>Defile</strong> is one of my favorite abilities in the game, though, and I would love more of that kind of tomfoolery.</p>

            <p>Added your suggestion.<br>
I don’t think bd need it at day, it will be used by trolls and I don’t think its a good idea.</p>
<p>For me, it should be used by mm and cl, but you can’t add it to cult leader,  seeker is another option (seeker needs it more because a converted paladin needs to show that he can still find cult members)</p>

            <p>A trial clean would certainly be interesting. To a night kill that pretty much would eliminate the possibility it is unseen… but a day ability used during the execution vote, could be very interesting.</p>

            <p>I think it’s funner, more interesting and involves more skill if you get the option to select a class.  Many if not most defiles I see are not believable.</p>
