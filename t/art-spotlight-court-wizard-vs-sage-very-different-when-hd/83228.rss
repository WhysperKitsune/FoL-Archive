    <description>When we see CW vs Sage at 50px resolution, it&#39;s hard to appreciate the grandeur of the 2:

(low res)
![image|496x181](upload://3K6mYsRKpdvOEJtsBr4pcHRkMZ4.jpeg) 

Looks like a small edit, right? Now, open this in a new tab and zoom (this still isn&#39;t the full res of each for the sake of keeping them side-by-side):

* Xed did the CW (left) - came 1st.
* Adiart did the Sage (right) - came later.

The only part that is actually 1:1 the same about them .... are *proportions* (outline). The rest is actually completely redrawn, repainted in Adiart&#39;s own style.

Let&#39;s start with the mustache style and strokes:

You can already see that these are 2 completely different styles, when zoomed. The left mustache is more &quot;outwards&quot; like `_/_/\_\_` while the right is more &quot;downwards/straight&quot; like `/|||||\`. Adi&#39;s version I also believe has a &quot;smoother/straighter&quot; nose.

Let&#39;s compare paint strokes:

Xed has more abstract/textured strokes while Adi has more smooth/silky strokes, both wonderful in their own styles.

Finally, the &quot;halo&quot;:

Xed&#39;s version was more of a chaotic swirl, while Adi&#39;s swirl is more stylized with a less-abstract approach.

They both have so much flavor and go deep into detail - such detail that I wish I could show more in-game than what the tiny portraits barely portray.

So much detail goes into many of the art pieces that created *Throne of Lies*. 

**Which portrait do *you* like the best?**

* Court Wizard (Xed)
* Sage (Adi)
