    <title>Bug - Chill Button Peaced out in a clutch!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-chill-button-peaced-out-in-a-clutch/71032</link>
    <description>Played game as Reaper. Got Mystic linked. That night, King&#39;s logs rolled from prior reap and I saw Mystic&#39;s #.
Day began with king dead; vote time froze actions for a few. On resumption:

What happened: Used Chill ability. Chilled target whispered King right after.
Looked at my Chill ability. **Yep, I&#39;d used it. 8 was selected.** Chilled 8 a second time. Worked, but in the meantime Mystic outed me to King.

What should&#39;ve happened: Chill should have functioned :stuck_out_tongue: 

Steps to reproduce: Rush to Chill on a Dead King morning

Comments: immediately was exed because it didn&#39;t fire off of course ;_; nbd on a fluke instance but if it happens to many that would suck.


** sorry, no SS. I was confused and rushing to re-chill the fella
8 was the mystic XD</description>

            <p>Sry if that was confusing. Yea I had reaped the starting King and as the day started he died and his logs rolled, so there was a period of time to “Vote for new King” and in fact for the sake of all info available – only one person stepped forward with RB for King, so there was not an actual vote iirc, just a “pause” on the day clock while that took place.</p>
<p>My plan was to Chill the Mystic and Reap him that night (empowered if the day went poorly), to prohibit use of Telepathy <em>or</em> whispers. Mystic still would’ve outed me with Telepathy, I imagine.</p>
