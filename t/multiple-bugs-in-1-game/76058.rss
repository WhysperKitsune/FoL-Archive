    <title>Multiple bugs in 1 game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/multiple-bugs-in-1-game/76058</link>
    <description>#### What happened? There was some lag at the end of the night making it take way longer than usual to switch to day, making me able to flirt twice in the same night by changing my target when timer was stuck at 0 seconds. After that, was unable to target/accuse certain people. Also sorc bombs didn&#39;t kill anyone when detonated

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? Only 1 flirt a night, be able to target everyone alive, sorc bombs must kill those who aren&#39;t healed

#### Steps to reproduce: No clue

#### Comments: I know it are multiple bugs in 1 report, but since it happened in game, I decided to post them all in 1 post.
