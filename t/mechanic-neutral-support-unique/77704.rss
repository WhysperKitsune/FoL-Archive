    <description>Passives:

Traveler:
Since mechanic brought two gears

Have two gears at start.
Gear is what mechanic use to build his things(I dunno).

Thief:
Search can bypass occupied,redirected and imprisoned.(only search)

Day abilities:

Robot bird(requires one gear):knows the target player what notifications on his ability that night.

If the target player is prince/mm/cl/killer/offense  type

Mechanic will get a notification of
‘The robot bird got destroyed!’

Can be used on D1
Only tells you when the night is over.

Night abilities:

Craft:(requires three gears):Recharge target player’s abilities once(Even lost by fool or prince executed bd)

If mechanic use this ability on a no ability limit class or the target player didn’t use a limited ability.

He will just receive a notification as
‘[Target player]does not require any ability recharge’ and still has those gears 

Search:Guess target player’s specific class type,if correct.Get two gears.if wrong,Lost one gear.

Cannot use search on dead body or king.
Can only search a player ONCE.



Goal:Craft item for two DIFFERENT people in court to win.

Since it’s neut: mechanic won’t be necessary to side bd or unseen/cult to make them overpowered.

It can also interact with court,I think.

            <p>Then it needs eight gears total, which means that with the 2 starting gears it needs a <em>minimum</em> of three correct guesses, and then four nights of crafting, which is still seven nights.</p>
<p>Remember that this isn’t even counting hitting the jailed target, or guessing wrong.</p>

            <p>So the most glaring problem I see with this is that to win, it needs 9 gears. Starting with two gears, it can gain at most two gears every night, which means it needs four nights of <em>correct</em> guesses just enough to have enough gears to achieve its win condition, and then an <em>additional</em> three nights of actually crafting items, for a total of a minimum of seven nights when it needs to play perfectly just to win.</p>
