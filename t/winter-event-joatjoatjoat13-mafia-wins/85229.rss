    <description>

# Welcome to JoaTJoaTJoaT13, hosted by @Arete and @Geyde with a set-up designed by @Geyde! 

# Winter event:

This game is part of the Mafia Colosseum - FoL winter crossover event! For the first 24 hours of sign-ups, five slots will be reserved for people from FoL and five slots will be reserved for people from Mafia Colosseum.

# Rules:

Follow the Global Forum Rules, given in this post, as well as all Mafia Colosseum rules. 

https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926

Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of **10 substantive, on-topic, game related posts** per in game day are required. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing *solely* a vote. The first time a player fails to meet this requirement, they will be given a warning; the second time they fail to meet it, they will be replaced out. A player who zero-posts will be subbed out without a warning. This requirement may be reduced or waived if an execution is hammered early by majority.

The game will begin on December 21st.

# Gameplay

- The set-up is a 13 player set-up with 8 Vanilla Townies, 2 different Town Jacks-of-All-Trades, 1 Mafia Jack-of-All Trades, and 2 Mafia Goons.

- Each JoaT has access to three abilities. Town JoaTs may only use each ability once. The mafia JoaT must use each ability once before using the same ability twice; however, it is not required to use them in the same order each time.

- The Mafia JoaT may perform the factional kill and use a JoaT ability in the same night


- Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Executions are majority and plurality. Ties will be determined by RNG among all tied players.

- No-execute is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-execute and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-execute will have priority in the rand.

- Self-votes are considered valid votes.

- Votes are locked in LyLo (execute-or-lose) scenarios, but not in MyLo (misexecute-and-lose) scenarios. That is to say, in situations where town must execute correctly or lose, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.
- The Mafia factional kill is assigned. If the member performing the factional kill is not specified, the last member to submit a kill will be assumed to be performing it.

- The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.

- The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

# Flavor
- By popular request, the game will be lightly Danganronpa flavored. I will try to avoid spoilers, but there may be some minor ones. 
- Flavor is neither role nor alignment indicative.
