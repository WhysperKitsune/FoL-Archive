    <description>#### What happened? in two games I played randomly with 2 other people and each of us got the same class both games. Thats 3 people, same class, 2 games in a row. Odd but not THAT odd I guess. Also, I have been playing all day and the classes have been coming in sets of 3 or 4 games at a time. A lot of others seeing this as well.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? Not that?

#### Steps to reproduce: Many people, in fact every game I have played in today, have been seeing this....so much for RNG?!

#### Comments: I really hope someone looks into this....i am all about coincidence, but this....feels off.</description>

            <p>don’t ask what the odds of this happening to you are. Ask what the odds of it happening to SOMEONE is. It’s just like how winning the lottery does not make you a fraud become the odds were too low for it to be random because there was always going to be at least one winner.</p>
