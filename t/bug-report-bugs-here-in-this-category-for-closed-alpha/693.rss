    <title>[BUG] Report bugs here in this category for closed Alpha+</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-report-bugs-here-in-this-category-for-closed-alpha/693</link>
    <description>This category (subthread) was renamed to &quot;Bug Reports/Feedback&quot; &gt;&gt; There is also now a bug reporting template:

**If you are reporting feedback and not a bug, just delete the template.**
[color=red](**Pro Tip:** CTRL+A &gt;&gt; DEL)[/color]

It&#39;ll help if you put [BUG] in the subject if you want it to stand out.</description>

            <p>ehhh, here as in THIS CATEGORY! I’m locking this thread for clarity~ That’s why I changed the name to <strong>Bugs/Feedback</strong> and added a bug reporting template <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>That mashes too many distinct things into one subforum though. It’ll get messy.</p>

            <p>Probably because Bugs are kind of feedback-- and a bug report “suggests” fixing (I.e. A suggestion). I’d assume.</p>
