    <title>[Class suggestion] The adventurer + the explorer</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-adventurer-the-explorer/2961</link>
    <description>_Inspired by Tormental&#39;s treasure hunter_

Upon the stumbling across a large network of tunnels below the castle, the sheriff hired the adventurer to clear it out of any valuables; he planned to block it off so no conspirators would be able to use it to get around undetected, but didn&#39;t want to risk blowing up any thing valuable.

&gt;The adventurer
_Blue dragon investigative_
**Passive: Dungeon crawler**
The prince will be unable to execute you; he will be told &quot;Your prisoner escaped through a secret passage!&quot; He will still expend a use of _execute_
**Night ability: open chest**
_infinite uses_
Open a chest below the targets room. You cannot open a chest below a targets room you have already opened. Something will happen based on the target&#39;s class type (see below class card)

&gt;Types of chests:
-**Killer class:** _Trapped chest! You were poisoned with deadly nightshade!_
-**Support class:** _You found an elixir and drank it._
If poisoned or bleeding: _&quot;You drank the potion, and suddenly your (wound disappeared/poison was cured)!&quot;_
-**Social class:** _&quot;You found a magical transcript, filled with all the whispers that happened the previous day!&quot;_ (you will be shown a letter looking like the old noble letter, filled with &quot;x whispered to y: message&quot; for all the whispers from previous day.
-**offensive class:** _&quot;You found a stockpile of booze! This will take a few days to drink&quot;_ (you will be occupied the next two nights)
-**Investigative or special:** _&quot;You found a letter sealed with a symbol of a (black rose/eye depending if unseen or cult). It say that the (class that was converted this night) was successfully initiated!&quot;_ 
-**Wildcard/framed:** _&quot;The chest is full of sponges. They aren&#39;t edible.&quot;_


Converts into the explorer!

&gt;The explorer
unseen support
**Passive: Dungeon crawler**
same as adventurer&#39;s
**Day ability: Map**
_infinite uses_
Find a way through the network of tunnels for a secret entrance into your targets room; the assassin will be able to bypass their visit immunity the following night, and if he selects to assassinate them, will be able to do so with occupy immunity.
**Night ability: Open chest**
same as the adventurer&#39;s

            <p>What you’re saying is that Assassin won’t be initially available for Unseen.</p>
<p>If that does happens, then Unseen won’t able to convert anytime soon. That put them at disadvantage, don’t tell me otherwise because I have seen this happen with MM+Assassin+Sellsword with SFoL Famine game.</p>

            <p>Because, you are making these roles into Special-type.</p>
<p>Unseen need Mastermind to convert people and putting Explorer as second starting role together with Mastermind means they don’t have Assassin to start with, not to mention they won’t able to convert anymore after that unless one of the members died.</p>
<p>Since you’re making this special type, chances between fifty out hundred spawns Explorer with Assassin which put them at huge disadvantage due lack of converting.</p>
<p>Which in that sense, the explorer has to die early on for Assassin to become Mastermind.</p>
