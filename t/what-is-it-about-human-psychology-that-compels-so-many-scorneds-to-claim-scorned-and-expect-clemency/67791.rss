    <description>I&#39;m talking about Scorneds that haven&#39;t yet won.  You always see that Scorned who gets executed for claiming Scorned before they even won, to either Prince or Mystic.  As if they expect to be allowed to live and frame an innocent BD target?  Lol?  Why?</description>

<p>The more reasons BD has to hate on neutrals, the less claimspace there is for evils, the stronger classes with confirmable powers are, and the easier it is for BD to play a “deduction by murder” game, where instead of using information, logic or the social aspect of a social deduction game to win, they simply win by process of elimination, by literally killing the weakest claims whether they’re likely to be BD or not, until only the unfakeable claims remain.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is one of the entire reasons why the Alchemist needs a nerf. The issue here is that if an Alchemist gets a heal confirmed and nobody else claims it he’s basically set to go as he won’t be executed by BD and his four night immunities discourages evils from attacking him. To make matters worse, as since Alchemists cannot be converted then this leaves little room for the Unseen/Cult to counter him.</p>
<p>Ultimately, right now Alchemists are running too damn close to <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/addressing-neuts-out/10561">being an unbalanced neutral</a>. IMO, either they should be able to be converted to balance out <span class="hashtag">#2</span> and <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, or they need a limitation in their kit that lowers their utility along with their self-confirming potentials, or potentially even adding another mechanism that allows evils to counter them.</p>
<p>This was a rough draft I made of a reworked Alchemist that fulfilled the above conditions without removing their immunity to conversion. I’d imagine a balanced Alchemist would look something like this, albeit I dislike the lack of interaction with this kit.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="gray"> The Alchemist </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray"> Neutral Support </font></strong><br>
<strong>Coagulate (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to bleeding and nightshade poison.<br>
<strong>Stoneskin Potion (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to death the following night provided you did not use either of your night abilities.<br>
<strong>Crimson Potion (Night)</strong> - Heal a target player, preventing their death. Also cures any poison or bleeding . - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Emerald Potion (Night)</strong> - Poisons a target player with a lethal dosage, instantly killing them. You can NOT target The King with this ability. - 2 uses<br>
<em>Survive until the end of the game.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new Stoneskin would essentially allow the Alchemist to be night-immune as much as he’d like at the cost of his infinite healing ability. The purpose here is to limit his healing in order to put a cost to his utility and prevent easy confirmation as optimally a reworked Alchemist would play more selfishly and thus would only heal when absolutely necessary, which would also diminish his potential for confirming himself. By the end-game, they will essentially have to choose between putting themselves at risk to a nightkill or not healing anyone, which fixes the current issue where endgame it’s impossible to kill the GK or Prince as an evil because they have a nonconvertible and immune Physician pocket healing them.</p>

            <p>I would like to vote for the exact opposite of an Alchemist nerf to happen.</p>
<p>The more reasons BD has to hate on neutrals, the less claimspace there is for evils, the stronger classes with confirmable powers are, and the easier it is for BD to play a “deduction by murder” game, where instead of using information, logic or the social aspect of a social deduction game to win, they simply win by process of elimination, by literally killing the weakest claims whether they’re likely to be BD or not, until only the unfakeable claims remain.</p>
<p>Instead, there should be more neutrals that are BD-aligned or true neutral (or whose win conditions are malleable), less confirmable powers and more sources of information and death prevention so that the game is more about deduction and piecing together who’s what, instead of simply letting the death toll do all the work for you.</p>

<p>Which is why they need to be reworked to prevent them from being night-immune and nonconvertible Physicians. In the current meta there’s no reason to execute a proven Alchemist as they’ll automatically side with BD due to their kit, and there’s almost nothing Evils can do against their 4 nights of immunity.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <blockquote>
<p>Why do people misunderstand Neutral classes this much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because a class with a wincon that sets BD backwards while also having a kit that brings only negative utility is not a BD-aligned class regardless as how much you want it to be. The entire point of the Scorned is to use misinformation to execute a player who started as, and will also likely be BD-aligned by the time of their execution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only Neutrals you can’t reasonably justify sparing as BD are Sellsword and Killers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Fools, Scorneds, and Inquisitors who have claimed after the Sorcerer died. The optimal play in the event of a Scorned or a Fool being found is to execute them outright, at night in the Fool’s case. Both classes have a wincon that will go against BD and have kits that help them fulfill them.</p>
<p>Also reminder that from time to time the Neut claims are actually evils hiding behind that claim, so food for thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scorned is only an evil leaning Neutral in the early game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incorrect. They still need to get their targets lynched via misinformation regardless if they get converted or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALL of his targets are convertable and, depending on if the MM/CL hits them, he can subsequently change his leaning depending on the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sigh, how many times will I have to repeat myself? The odds of a Scorned having their target converted is very low and the fact that they bring negative utility to BD, as in framing and troll-boxing, while also having a wincon that requires them to trick BD into executing their target regardless if they have been converted makes them automatically scum. Your reasoning here is as ridiculous as claiming that the Inquisitor isn’t an anti-Sorcerer class as they can become a Neutral King and win with her. It can happen, but only in very fringe circumstances, ergo the exception to the rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve sometimes openly claimed to a Prince when jailed only if I know for sure that we have a common interest and they need my vote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, your goal is to basically get a BD-starting player executed regardless if they’ve been converted or not. If the convert is obvious, then just execute them upfront and you don’t have to do anything. If not then the execution is pretty much a terrible as executing a player who’s likely BD just to get a Scorned’s vote is downright idiotic, as if the execution is wrong the executed player would also have bene a vote for BD while also bringing in utility with their kit.</p>
<p>In short, it’s absolutely pointless to execute a BD to get a Scorned’s vote as you’re basically putting yourself in the same LyLo situation as before, except that now you also waste a day to execute the BD member.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scorned is one of the easiest classes to prove thanks to trollbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire reason why Trollbox can be used for instant confirmation is because no well-playing Scorned would use it to out themselves in the first place. If you’re doing that then it’s bad play at its best and game-throwing at its worst.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The Scorned is not an Investigative class nor is it aligned with the Blue Dragon faction. Your goal as a  Scorned is to trick the court into executing your Blue Dragon-aligned target. If your target is an obvious convert, then the court should just outright execute them rather than relying on you, and if not, then odds are that there’s no way you’d have known as you have no investigative abilities.</p>

            <p>Why do people misunderstand Neutral classes this much? The only Neutrals you can’t reasonably justify sparing as BD are Sellsword and Killers. Scorned is only an evil leaning Neutral in the early game. ALL of his targets are convertable and, depending on if the MM/CL hits them, he can subsequently change his leaning depending on the situation.</p>
<p>I’ve sometimes openly claimed to a Prince when jailed only if I know for sure that we have a common interest and they need my vote. Scorned is one of the easiest classes to prove thanks to trollbox.</p>
