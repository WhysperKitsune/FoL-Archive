    <title>Bring Back Old Mercenary and Change Sellsword</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bring-back-old-mercenary-and-change-sellsword/63535</link>
    <description>**Mercenary:**
1. Bring back the previous Mercenary before the update, with the same abilities and win condition
2. Make the Mercenary&#39;s evil contract percentage down to 60%, good up to 30%, and neutral to 10%
3. Can not spawn with Sellsword

**Justification:** Before the update, if you were outed as a Mercenary, you almost always had you and/or your target executed; by changing the chance of the different aligned contracts, evil contracts have a better chance of survival and/or victory. The Mercenary was a unique class that had a very different goal from other classes; I personally found it a lot more fun than the new Mercenary.

**Sellsword:**

1. Changed alignment to Neutral Support
2. Can not spawn with Mercenary
3. Is unique
4. Can not spawn with Inquisitor/Sorcerer

Focused (Passive): Occupation and Redirection Immune
Buddy System (Passive): Spawns with at least 1 other Neutral (Not including Neutral Killer)

What do we do (Day): Learn the win condition of one other alive neutral role [Not usable until day 4] [1 use]
(If you&#39;re the only alive neutral, you will be informed of this)

Come at me (Night): Guard a random neutral, giving them death immunity; you will know the neutral&#39;s name if they&#39;re attacked. [Infinite uses] 

Vengeance (Night): Kill 1 person who voted execute on an executed neutral. Bypasses death immunity. Will not work on another neutral. [2 Uses] 

Goal: Have at least one other neutral fulfill their win condition.

**Justification:** Neutrals other than Alchemist and inquisitor seem to not win as much as it seems fair (I know I&#39;ll be incinerated by the feedback for saying that), and with a class that is specifically designed to help these classes win, will help increase their win rate by at least a little. The old Sellsword was an okay class that not many got to play, and by bringing it back to help neutrals, could be a lot more fun.

I am more than ready to be murdered by feedback</description>

            <p>Oh I definitely understand they’re direction. I disagree with it, but it isn’t a deal breaker to me. I meant what I said basically to stress how much I disliked the previous Merc.</p>

            <p>If you said go back original merc, maybe. The previous merc is the worst it ever was. It was so heavily evil focused even when sided with bd. There was almost no reason to not spam guards and voting up their target was useless due to the force pardon.</p>

<p>Is that a trollbox? Because seriously this cannot be further from the truth and also, I think new Sellsword is super fun.  Not sure about new Merc because I haven’t played it yet.</p>
