    <title>Mastermind Died N1 while being debauched</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mastermind-died-n1-while-being-debauched/13640</link>
    <description>N1 Mastermind died at the same time as I debauched him. Somehow we both died (and no one else). Mastermind did not claim he was possessed and no one could figure out how this happened. 

MM should have night immunity and debauch should have protected (I would think)

            <p>While that is a possibility, it is still unlikely as the MM didn’t know how he died. If he had gotten happy houred he would have gotten a message telling him so.</p>

            <p>I don’t mean to be rude <a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a>, but I think this thread is discussing an older patch of the game when Drunk’s Debauch caused all the visitors to their target to be redirected to them.</p>
