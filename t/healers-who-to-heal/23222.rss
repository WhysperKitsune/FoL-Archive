    <title>Healers-Who to heal</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/healers-who-to-heal/23222</link>
    <description>OK so here&#39;s the thing I have seen this now 2 times.If your a healer healing the king IS NOT I REPEAT IS NOT always the right play and usually isn&#39;t if all kings are played equally as that means king is only BD 33% of the time.I will give 2 situations where this lost us the game.This matters more if your physician if your alch it doesn&#39;t matter as you can screw around and do what you want.2 examples of this losing us the game.So im poisoned as a confirmed observer and king is poisoned by butler.The healer gets jailed and now has to decide between confirmed observer or undecided king.The healer heals the king and lets me die.The king is evil and that loses BD the game as they needed one vote to hang an unseen.Another situation was between a bleeding butler and a poisoned king.Healer heal king and dies making our butler die.King was evil and lost us the game because we couldn&#39;t hang cult.So if your a healer(Physician mostly but also alch if your siding with BD)you heal important people in order-.Changes if someone is bleeding/poisoned but if no one is then healing these people in this order should be the best bet for how to heal.Obviously context matters as you need to know if you can trust someone or not.Healing a confirmed observer is a better bet then a knight claim that is unconfirmed.Also conversions are a thing so you have to know if you can still trust them.This just triggers me seeing physician heal the evil king instead of a confirmed BD which ends up losing us the game.

            <p>Personally my list would be:</p>
<p>Prince, Psychic, Sheriff/Paladin, Confirmed good king, Obs, Phys, CW, Princess, Butler, Drunk, King, Knight, Hunter, Alch, Merc.</p>
<p>Psychic is super important for letting the BD coordinate.</p>
<p>Sheriff/paladin is the best late game invest with Obs as the best early game and Princess as in-between for early and mid.</p>
<p>CW can be used for late game power plays and so can butler/drunk but less effectively. Usually however it’s Information you need.</p>
<p>Knight usually kills himself in ways you can’t heal and Hunter doesn’t need the help he can defend himself.</p>
<p>A confirmed good king is incredibly useful for securing a late game win.</p>

            <p>I don’t entirely agree with your priority list but otherwise I agree.</p>
<p>Remember that as an Alch the story is different as the unconfirmed king is your best friend.</p>
