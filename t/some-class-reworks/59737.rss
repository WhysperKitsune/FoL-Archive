<p>Day Ability: Recontract: Break off your current contract, and make someone your new contract. Unlimited uses, 2 day cool down. (Takes effect at the end of the day, doesn’t notify target)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I feel like this should be limited use. That or have a much longer cooldown. Otherwise you lose that sense of trust with your merc as the contract entirely. It’s not that the idea is fundamentally bad it’s just that it needs to be nerfed a bit.</p>

            <p>My weird attempt to rework Mercenary:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="grey">Mercenary</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="grey">Neutral Support</font></strong></p>
<p>Passive: Failure: If your target dies, you will commit suicide. You will commit suicide if you don’t have a contract by night two.</p>
<p>Passive: Contracted: You may not accuse your target of treason, and will automatically vote to pardon them.</p>
<p>Day Ability: Recontract: Break off your current contract, and make someone your new contract. Unlimited uses, 2 day cool down. (Takes effect at the end of the day, doesn’t notify target)</p>
<p>Night Ability: Stand Guard: Prevent visitors to your target. 3 uses.</p>
<p>Night Ability: Rebound: Prevent and kill all visitors to your target. 1 use.</p>
<p><em>You must ensure you have a living contract at the end of the game.</em></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s my feedback to everything:</p>
<p>Hunter: I get why we want Wolf to be a day ability. So it mixes in with assassin and cult leader. However I dislike that because I don’t think assassins or cult leaders are claiming Hunter. Now they could with this change, but Hunter is a decent claim for NK right now. Sure they still can’t wolf, but a day wolf basically completely removes the capabilities of that claim. I’d much rather Hunter stay as is.</p>
<p>Assassin and Enforcer: I am not sure how I feel about it. I feel Frenzy just being a guarantee kill on anyway every single unseen game would be a tad overpowered. I mean, for the most part, this basically means Prince can NEVER be outed. And the very moment he is, he’s dead, as there are not really many better targets than Prince. I’d be willing to try it out, maybe on the test server if possible.</p>
<p>Poacher: I think he’s strong enough on his own. Even if we did go with the other Hunter claim, you can coordinate with your assassin to bleed someone else. I don’t think Poacher needs a buff.</p>
<p>Cult Leader: I like the Blood of Mithras change. I have rarely ever found a use for sacrificing cult members.</p>
<p>Acolyte: Not completely sure how I feel. I know we’ve been trying for a while to get Acolyte as a thing, but I just wonder if a killing class would be too much in addition to the cult leader. I don’t have too much criticism here though, so I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Fool: I assume that’s everyone who votes him up? I think it’s alright. I’ve never been a fan of the “no accusations for the next day” punishment. It seems rather boring. Again not much to say though as I have no real opinion either way.</p>
<p>King: The comboing of Head of State and Decide Fate would help Decide Fate be a more useful BD tool, so I think it’s alright. I wish we could get rid of OE, but again, what are we gonna do? Love the Guard change. I’d even say start with 4 and every new King starts with 1 less (King 2 has 3 guards, King 3 has 2 guards, King 4 has 1 guard)</p>
<p>Neutrals to King: The problem with Fool and Inquisitor becoming King is that becoming King Negatively affects their ability to accomplish their goal. Scorned can just fake info he gets and merc can guard his target. We could just restrict fool and Inquisitor from becoming King.</p>
<p>Healing: I can see giving the same feedback to the healer, but I don’t think it matters for the person being healed. They’re going to see whether or not the big red spotches on their character portrait are gone or not.</p>
