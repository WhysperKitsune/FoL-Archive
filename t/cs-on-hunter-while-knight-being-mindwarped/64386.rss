    <title>CS on Hunter while Knight being mindwarped</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cs-on-hunter-while-knight-being-mindwarped/64386</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Knight coldsteeled a Hunter while being mindwarped by an Illusionist. Neither the Knight nor the Hunter died, so presumably the Hunter beared. The Knight was given a message that the Hunter was immune to CS, thus he concluded that the Hunter was the Mastermind.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
At least the Knight should have died since he attempted to attack a BD player. I have no idea whether Mindwarp played a role in this scenario.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Convert a Mystic. Have him mindwarp a Knight who is about to CS a Hunter. Have the Hunter use Bear.

#### Comments:
There was a lot of confusion after the game whether the Knight straight up lied about his night action, whether Mindwarp influenced the message the Knight was given or whether a Knight just does not die when he attempts to CS a Hunter using Bear, since Bear does not kill Blue Dragon players visiting the Hunter.
Therefore, this potentially is not a bug at all.</description>

            <p>So the mechanics that are crushing onto each other are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bear does not kill visiting BD</li>
<li>Knight attacks but does not die because Bear does not kill BD</li>
<li>Knight gets an immune message because Bear prevents the Hunter’s death</li>
<li>Knight does not die because he hit a target that was immune, even though it was an ally</li>
</ol>
<p>Is that correct? Seems awkward, but working as intended I guess.</p>
<p>/close</p>
<p>/Edit: Also the message the Knight is given is indistinguishable from Possessor/Sorc/MM. Might need some change.</p>

            <p>I’m not wrong.</p>
<p>If a knight hits a immune they don’t die.<br>
For example if a knight cs a prince guarded by a king. The knight doesn’t die</p>
<p>You didn’t kill them therefore you didn’t die</p>

            <p>Slow down, friend. Take your time to read it again.</p>
<p>From the description of Knight:</p>
<p><em>Kill a player. If they are an <strong>ally</strong> you will <strong>take your own life</strong>. Not usable until Night 3.</em></p>
