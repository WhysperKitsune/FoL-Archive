    <title>Occupying Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/occupying-suggestion/1601</link>
    <description>I think the messages of the occupation should be changed so that no matter what ability is used, you see the same message; something like: `You were occupied last night.`, or something like that. This will be a little bit more &quot;fair&quot; and balanced in my opinion. Also, it would make the **Fireworks** ability of [The Fool](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/The_Fool) actually useful.</description>

            <p>But classes that punish you for a correct lynch are inherently bad for game health. If ToL never attempts a competitive mode, that’s fine though.</p>

<p>It only reveals to the person that had it. If I was evil, a good trick would be to immediately say “fireworks! There’s a Fool”. People would be careful about voting off the evil dudes. Just because you say there’s a fool doesn’t necessarily mean there IS one <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> use it to your advantage</p>

            <p>Nope <a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a> . The use of fireworks still notifies the player it was a fool who did it. (It is like this even after the newest patch)</p>
