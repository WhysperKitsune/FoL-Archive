<strong>Inside Knowledge (Passive)</strong> - At the start of the first day, you are given the name of another random player who is guaranteed to be a member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong>. Additionally, at the start of each day, you will learn which <strong>Reshape Reality</strong> effect the <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> used last night, if any.

<strong>Tenacity (Passive)</strong> - You are occupation and redirection immune both at night and during the day. You may also use both night abilities at the same time.<br>
<strong>Entrust (Day)</strong> - Choose a player. You gain a day/night neighborhood chat with that player until your death, at which point the other player will be forcibly removed from the neighborhood. Your target cannot be the player whose name was given to you at the start of the game as part of <strong>Inside Knowledge</strong>. (1 use)<br>
<strong>Royal Judgment (Night)</strong> - Learn if a player is a member of the <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong>. If they are, you will attack them as well. The attack is regular and does not bypass immunities.<br>

<h2>
<font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> <strong>mechanics:</strong>
</h2>
<p>You have a singular <strong>factional kill</strong> per night, which is <strong>compulsory</strong> and <strong>assigned</strong>. One must sacrifice their night action in order to perform the kill. A different <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> member must perform the kill each night until every living member has performed the kill, then the cycle resets.</p>
<p>You have two types of <strong>assigned anti-claim shots</strong> and each can be used <strong>once per day</strong>. Each shot is <strong>assigned</strong>, meaning that the member of the <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> taking it must sacrifice their day ability to do so. A <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> member cannot take the shot if they have already used a day ability in a phase.</p>
<p>The first type is the  <strong>regular shot</strong>. To use it, quote a post which appears to be a hardclaim or a softclaim and name the class you believe the poster to be claiming. If you are correct, you will fire an unstoppable shot at them, killing them unconditionally, unless they are protected by the<font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Priestess</strong></font>. Note that the post you quote does not have to be written in the primary game thread; posts in neighborhood chats are eligible as well.</p>
<p>The second type is the <strong>PR shot</strong>. To use it, quote a post a non-<strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong>  player wrote, then name a player who you believe to be the <font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Arbiter</strong></font> or the <font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Priestess</strong></font> <strong>based on that post.</strong>  Note that your target does not have to be the same player whose post you quoted. If your<font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Arbiter/Priestess</strong></font> guess is correct, they will immediately die, bypassing everything. However, if your guess is wrong, the shooter will die instead, also bypassing everything. Neighborhood chat posts still count.</p>
<p>The <strong>PR shot</strong> becomes disabled when both the<font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Arbiter</strong></font> and <font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Priestess</strong></font> are dead, since it has no remaining function.<br>
Finally, the <strong>regular shot</strong> becomes unassigned when there are two or fewer Syndicate members left alive. However, the <strong>PR shot</strong> always remains assigned.</p>
<p>If the <strong><font color="00A292">Elder</font></strong> ever becomes the only <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> member left alive, they automatically join the factional chat.</p>
<p>Every night, you may activate a <strong>Reshape Reality</strong> action from a list. You may only activate each action once. The selection is not assigned by any means, and it is made as a <strong>collective decision</strong> in the factional chat. The <strong><font color="00A292">Elder</font></strong> will not be able to choose the action until the join the factional chat, but they will be informed which <strong>Reshape Reality</strong> action is in place at the start of each day.</p>
<details>
<summary>
List of Reshape Reality actions</summary>
<ul>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Fool</strong></font> - If a member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> is executed tomorrow, the day will be extended by 24 hours and there will be an additional execution. However, during the following night, each member of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> will be able to choose what class they want to appear as, and who they want to be seen visiting. They will appear to investigators as that class, visiting the player(s) of their choice. The <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> bypasses this mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Magician</strong></font> - Everyone will be occupation and redirection immune during the coming day and night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The High Priestess</strong></font> - At the start of the coming day, all targets of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> and <strong><font color="goldenrod">Priestess</font></strong>’s abilities during the night will be revealed in the thread, but not which players were targeted by which class and/or ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Empress</strong></font> - During the coming day and night, using limited-use day and night abilities will not consume any uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Emperor</strong></font> - Tomorrow, the King’s vote will count as three. However, they will start bleeding sometime in the middle of the day. If the King is the <font color="00A292"><strong>Divine King</strong></font> or <font color="00A292"><strong>Elder King</strong></font>, the bleeding will be fake, and the King will be informed that the bleeding is fake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Hierophant</strong></font> - On the next night, all players will be automatically redirected to their targets from the previous night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Lovers</strong></font> - The <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> chooses two players, one of which is a member of  <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>, as they activate this action. If one of the chosen players dies tomorrow by any means, the other will die as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Chariot</strong></font> - All attacks during the next night will be impossible to stop by occupation or redirection. However, <strong>Killer</strong> classes in the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> will not receive any penalties for killing members of their faction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Strength</strong></font> - On the next night, all regular attacks will become strongman attacks, which bypass night immunity and healing. However, all attacks which bypass night immunity and/or healing will become regular attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Hermit</strong></font> - All living players with <strong>Investigative</strong> classes will be occupied during the next night, but they will also be night immune and they will receive healing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Wheel of Fortune</strong></font> - A beneficial and harmful effect will be randomized from among the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>’s <strong>Reshape Reality</strong> actions and they will both take effect. The <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>, including the <font color="00A292"><strong>Elder</strong></font>, will know which effects were randomized and put in effect. The <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> will only be informed that the effects were randomized, but not what exactly was randomized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Justice</strong></font> - If a member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> is executed tomorrow, all players on their wagon will have their immunities removed during the following night. However, if a member of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> is executed tomorrow, all players on their wagon will be protected from negative effects, excluding attacks, during the following night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Hanged Man</strong></font> - Whoever is executed tomorrow will gain access to two night abilities, which they can use during the following night and <strong>only</strong> during the following night. They can use both abilities if they want; both are ninja (do not count as visits) and unstoppable. The first ability is an attack, only usable against players who ended the day on the main wagon. The second ability is a heal, only usable on players who did <strong>not</strong> end the day on the main wagon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Death</strong></font> - At the start of the coming day, the current King will revert to their original class and another player will randomly be chosen to be the new King. The new King can be a member of either faction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Temperance</strong></font> - All day abilities used tomorrow, excluding factional abilities, will automatically fail. If they were limited-use abilities, the uses will still be consumed. However, all members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> excluding the <font color="00A292"><strong>Elder</strong></font> automatically lose a use of each of their limited day abilities, regardless if they use them or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Devil</strong></font> - During the coming day, three random players will start bleeding at various points of the day. The bleeding will kill them two nights later if they are not healed until then. The same player can be chosen twice or even thrice, but the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> members are not informed in advance about who was chosen. Bleeding the same player more than once does not make them bleed out any faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Tower</strong></font> - At the end of the coming day, the King will die and nothing will be able to stop it. However, if the King is a member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong>, they will be informed of this in advance and they will be able to secretly choose a player to go down with them. That player will also die at the end of the day, and nothing will be able to stop it either. If the King mentions knowing about this in the thread or a neighborhood chat, and the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> points it out in their factional chat while highlighting the specific post, the King will die immediately and their chosen target will live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Star</strong></font> - All dead members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> will be able to use their unlimited-use night abilities on the next night. However, if the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Priestess</font></strong> and/or the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> are dead, they will be able to do so as well, and they will be able to use both at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Moon</strong></font> - A random member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> will be occupied throughout tomorrow. Another random member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> will be occupied on the coming night. A third random member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> will appear to investigators as a <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> <strong>Killer</strong> during the coming night. However, on the night after that, the same effects are repeated for members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>, and the same player can be chosen multiple times regardless of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>’s numbers. The members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> are never informed about who was randomly chosen to suffer from these effects, but the <font color="00A292"><strong>Elder</strong></font> and <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> are still informed that this <strong>Reshape Reality</strong> action is in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The Sun</strong></font> - The <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> chooses two players. At the start of the coming day, if there are thirteen or more players alive, the two selected players will be publicly announced as “<strong>exempt from execution</strong>” and voting them will be impossible until the end of the day. However, they will also be unable to vote. If at least one of them is a member of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font>, all other members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> will have a single silent vote on them throughout the day. The silent votes will not be revealed unless a member of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> is executed while having the silent vote on them (the silent vote will be visible on the executed player). The <strong><font color="00A292">Syndicate</font></strong> cannot target themselves with this action if it would make all of them impossible to execute on that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>Judgment</strong></font> - All dead players will be able to speak in the thread tomorrow, and it will be announced at the start of the day. However, all dead members of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> will be able to use their night abilities during the following night. Typical limits apply – for example, if a member of the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> died with no uses of their limited night ability, they will not be able to use that ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="00A292"><strong>The World</strong></font> - Learn the path to victory. If there are fewer than ten players alive at the start of tomorrow, the <font color="00A292"><strong>Syndicate</strong></font> will learn their exact classes and which player has which class. However, a random member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> will be revealed by the host as a member of the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Hand of Byzantium</font></strong> within the thread, and they will be unconditionally protected from death during the following night. This effect may protect the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Arbiter</font></strong> or the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Priestess</font></strong>.</p>

<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> begins with 5 main members from the start and cannot convert.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> is the only threat to the <strong>Blue Dragon</strong> and there are no Neutral Killers.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> members will retain their actions upon becoming King.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> knows which of the Priest, Mystic, or neither rolled in the match.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> has an anti-claim mechanic in play.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> has tailor and framing effects, and one of their members is a Godfather.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> has a sixth member that does not join their chat.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Syndicate</strong> has a class that has a backup for Omega actions.</li>
<li>The identity of <strong>the Prince</strong> will be told to you at the beginning of the first day.</li>

<strong>Entrusted Correspondence (Day)</strong> - Select one of the first eight bullet points from Forbidden Knowledge and you can anonymously post it in the thread, effective informing the players of a mechanic from this setup. - Infinite uses.<br>
<strong>Eldritch Learning (Day)</strong> - In the beginning of the first day you will learn the names of the Omega action of each member of <strong>the Syndicate</strong> . In each day you can choose the learn what the effects of each Omega action performs at the start of the night. - 6 uses<br>
<strong>Judgment (Night)</strong> - Informs you whether your target is a member of <strong>the Syndicate</strong> or not. This bypasses tailoring and framing effects.<br>
<strong>Forsaken Records (Night)</strong> - Select a Mark or a Counter that is used in an Omega action which you’ve learned of from using Eldritch Learning, and you will learn how many players have been marked with it already or are at a Counter of 2 for it. - Infinite uses.<br>
