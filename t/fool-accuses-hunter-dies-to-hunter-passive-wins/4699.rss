    <title>Fool Accuses Hunter, Dies to Hunter Passive, Wins</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/fool-accuses-hunter-dies-to-hunter-passive-wins/4699</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Fool accused the hunter and brought to a vote. Game voted to execute hunter. Fool is killed by the Hunter&#39;s passive. Hunter is executed. &quot;Fool has been executed&quot; message and we are unable to vote for execution due to Fool &quot;Execution&quot;. Fool wins game. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Fool accuses Hunter and brought to a vote. Game voted to Execute hunter. Foll is killed by Hunter&#39;s passive. Hunter is executed. Game continues on as Fool wasn&#39;t executed. Fool loses. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
1) Be a Fool, know who a hunter is
2) Initiate vote to accuse hunter
3) Vote succeeds, Hunter is executed
4) Get killed by Hunter passive
5) Win game

#### Comments:

I assume this is unintended as it can allow the Fool to win on his own by just accusing hunter&#39;s.</description>
