    <title>[Class Suggestions] Queen</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestions-queen/10986</link>
    <description>**Objectives of this class:**

#1 Replace neutral Killers. Queen allows to speed up the game, but its not as random and chaotic as neutral killers. I would put Queen in the game and remove Reaper/Possessor.
#2 Balance the game: If king is evil, at least queen won&#39;t be evil.

**Features:**

Queen is in every games, like the King.
Queen&#39;s alligment is random, but never the same one as the King. But she is never neutral. Unlike the king, she is hidden. Nobody knows who she is. When she dies, her alligment is not revealed until the end of the game. Could consider doing the same for the King(s).

**Ability:**

Passive: Occupation immune. Cannot be converted.

**Night ability 1: Thirst for blood**

Disabled night 1,
This ability can only be used when nobody was executed during the day. The queen can choose someone that will be instantly executed at night. This target cannot be the king. This ability bypass all protections, just like an execution.

**Day ability 1: Queen&#39;s message. 2 uses**

Works similar to psychic. Allows queen send one anonymous messsage in her name.</description>

            <p>Queen would be in every single games. She is a replacement for Reaper/Poss</p>
<p>I don’t believe killing the king to know queen allignement is a good idea. If he flips BD, then you just lost a BD king which is extremely good for BD, and you still don’t know who the evil queen is. If king flips neutral, you gain 0 info.</p>
<p>That being said, maybe she should be FORCED to actually execute people when her ability is active, because the whole point is to make sure game is not slowed down too much.</p>
<p>But thanks for feedback i was sad not to get any hahahha xD</p>

            <p>I like it - But why remove NK?</p>
<p>Like you say she’ll never be the same as the King but will never be Neutral -<br>
So if she is BD then cool.<br>
If she is Unseen / Cult cool too but as soon as nobody announces reaped / possessor game you will know there is a Queen - This could cause for Kings to be hung far too often so that people know the Queen is allied with BD or Unseen/Cult (They won’t know who Queen is obviously, which again may cause random hangings).</p>
<p>I think this would be a good addition as well as the NK, and instead remove 1 Neutral to replace with Queen?</p>
<p>In terms of abilities etc I think it’s a great idea though <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
