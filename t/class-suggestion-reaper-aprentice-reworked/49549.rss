    <description>


**Name - apprentice/reapers apprentice** 
**_Faction - Neutral_**
**_Class Type - Investigative_**


**Passive 1 - slowly dying** - The first time you are attacked, he will not die but the next day and night you will not be able to use any abilities, also you will not be able to talk in any form of chat (includes prince or psychic chat for that night)

**Passive 2 - known allies** - if anyone evil decides to visit you (NK, cult/unseen) then you will know the name of the player who visited you and what they did to you that night. 

**Day Ability 1 - soul snatcher** - take a players night ability and use it tonight. (unlimited uses)

- This will always take the unlimited ability unless they don’t have a unlimited ability.
- If you take someone’s night ability that has unlimited then they won’t know you took one, but if there is a limit then you will be alerted that some of your soul has been taken.
- If you take someone’s soul for the third time, who has royal blood then you would gain royal blood. 

**Night Ability 1 - full body swap** - become a class of your choice(except any Unique classes) you will become that class for the next day and night. When you become a class you are allowed to use their day and night abilities (2 uses)

Notes:
- if you become a BD member and are checked that night by an invest Ability then you will show up as BD for that night.
- if you become a fool and get killed during the day that morning then you will win still.

**Win condition**- survive to see the BD fall. 

**My thoughts -** this is a class to help counter BD while also having a lot of claiming space.</description>

            <p>It should be removed. It’s weird, happens in edge cases, and adds little to the class.</p>
<p>It’s an okay class, but I wish it had a more interesting goal.</p>
<p>Also can you call something besides Reaper’s Apprentice? Reaper isn’t even most games. Apprentice doesn’t fit either, since it is an independent entity.</p>

</aside>
<p>I did this so the player could claim a class like princess or another class with royal blood. It might be too good, so that’s why i wanted some feedback on it.</p>

<p>I still think it would be better to come up with new win cons than use existing ones.</p>
