    <description>If it worked like Inquisitor&#39;s death immunity, protecting him from the first death, it would make Knight less expendable.</description>

            <p>I don’t see the purpose of this suggestion.  What’s it trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Knights aren’t “expendable” in the eyes of the BD because they’re weak (they’re very powerful and very useful), they’re expendable because their wills are easy to fake, which means you have to execute people who claim the role if there’s any hint of a valid reason for suspicion.  That’s a necessary part of the game and not a flaw - otherwise evils who weren’t converted would have no options for things to claim.</p>
