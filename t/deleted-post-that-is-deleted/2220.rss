<ul>
<li>
<p>“Third antagonist faction, WIP” - At least finish it before submitting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Medieval times, you wouldn’t have had a President running a Government. It was down to Kings etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Starts with president and the hitman” “The federation spawns with the president and the executioner.” Wot?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Manslaughter” showing a random killer class when exhumed isn’t useful, especially if it shows Reaper, Merc, Prince or even Cult Leader/Assassin. It’ll just give away the original Killer quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which faction does Executioner belong to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detective seems too bland. Which faction does it belong to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medic seems like weaker Physician. Which faction does it belong to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saboteur’s ability doesn’t make any sense. What faction does it belong to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bureaucrat class makes it support, not social. What faction does it belong to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You only gave Revolutionary a Faction. Also, killing Blue Dragon with no penalty = Very fucking OP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Class seems very much like Cult + Ruby’s Cabal.<br>
1 only 1 of each class<br>
2 “Test allegiance” = “Test of faith”<br>
3 “Class type determines what someone is converted into”<br>
4 “Brainwash”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole Revolution theme here triggers me. It doesn’t many any sense to me right now. This seems all over the place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Please do pick apart my suggestion in the replies, as I have hit writer’s block with this .-.” I’m confused by this. Did you mis-type and forget “do not pick” because if so, you should have finished this post before submitting it.</p>
