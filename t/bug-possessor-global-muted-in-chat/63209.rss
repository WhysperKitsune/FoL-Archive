    <title>[BUG] Possessor GLOBAL MUTED in chat</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-possessor-global-muted-in-chat/63209</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
After using my second possession (first failed), I was suddenly muted globally (as in, I couldn&#39;t even see my own messages, nor the others I think). Voting is still possible. (Won me the game despite bug.)

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
After possessing, you should be able to continue your mischief and trick BD into upping or downing anyone you deem evil / good. And most of all, you should be able to talk.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Jump into King (What I did) / Any other player.

#### Comments:
