    <title>Quality of Life Issues</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/quality-of-life-issues/2803</link>
    <description>This is my favorite game out there right now and I am completely obsessed! I have a journal in real life that I keep of things that I feel like could be improved on, a lot of them are &quot;Quality of Life&quot; fixes. I have my full list back at home, but I am at work now and just wanted to post what I had off the top of my head.

1. Add a &quot;Journal Template&quot; setting
- at the start of EVERY game I have to open my journal and type in the whole left side with &quot;n1 - n2 - n3 - n4 - etc&quot; and the right side with &quot;1=, 2=,3=, 4= etc&quot;.
- it would be so nice if there was a setting category where you could make a Journal Template of some kind. It could be class specific or not, but something that I didnt have to do so much typing at the start of the game.
- would make overall gaming experience more relaxing, focused on the game instead of typing formatting.
 - could have a &quot;clear all&quot; button for anyone who wants a fresh slate

2. Have a Match History 
- im sure this is something that will for sure come, but I would like to see match histories so I can make notes on how I won specific set ups/ stats on win % with each class.
- in Beta we have to leave the win/ loss screen at the end of games so fast to get into the lobby so that we dont get left behind. Sometimes I want to see what player the king was, or who ended up being what.

3. Character Appearance Randomization
* Have a setting where you can make your appearance or the appearance of others characters randomized, or at least randomize your set up from what you currently own.
- the issue: I will be playing with my friends and we are on skype sometimes, we never say who we are and I LOVE the 2nd layer of mystery trying to find out who my friends are in the process... but If there are 5 people left and I see that only one player is using the Electricity Sword Thing... then I know thats him. And based off his conversations over skype I now have extra information that could corrupt the game for me. I dont like having that extra information, some people probably get on skype and tell each other who they are and what class or w/e, but we dont and Id hope there are others like us. So having the randomized setting on yourself or others would be nice.

4. Private Journal Section
*  A tab or section of the Journal that is not revealed upon death
* RopeStringFace idea, and I have had this same feeling of wanting to get a piece of real life paper sometimes and write stuff down as an evil or jailer or w/e. Which I feel is not something someone should have to do to play optimally
* As super imprtant roles (for good or evil) you sometimes want to write KEY information down... but cant because if you die you would be throwing everyone under the bus and essentially &quot;gamethrowing&quot; on accident because you wrote down and outed your team.

            <p>Thanks for the reply man! This game has SO much potential! I have literally told as many people as I can in my social circle about it and brought over around 5 players so far, and definitely feel like the player base is growing.<br>
Ill keep making notes and throw up a post when me and my friend Rook have any other ideas.</p>
<p>Yall are awesome, keep up the great job!</p>

            <p>Lol… no. If your computer is lagging in windowed, something is wrong with your system, because a lot of games offer windowed mode and lower resolution to improve FPS.</p>

<p>You may have read we’re revamping some “data stuff”. We actually <em>do</em> already have a match history “in the background” with this new system. We’ll be able to show it later – and even share it so community sites would be able to extract this data (future stuff). Including stats. You can see the Discord bot already start gathering that info – right now, it’s just temporary, but later it’ll be saved.</p>

            <p>1 I HIGHLY AGREE WITH YOU. Having a journel template would be really cool :3. I thinnk it should be optional-able.<br>
2. I like this idea. Npt sure how it would work though.<br>
3. Alot of people want this. I agree.<br>
Issue. I can see the problem with this. I don’t use skype, but hey you can if you want. too. (10/10 grammar would grammarz again)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is my favorite game out there right now and I am completely obsessed! I have a journal in real life that I keep of things that I feel like could be improved on, a lot of them are “Quality of Life” fixes. I have my full list back at home, but I am at work now and just wanted to post what I had off the top of my head.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a “Journal Template” setting</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>at the start of EVERY game I have to open my journal and type in the whole left side with “n1 - n2 - n3 - n4 - etc” and the right side with “1=, 2=,3=, 4= etc”.</li>
<li>it would be so nice if there was a setting category where you could make a Journal Template of some kind. It could be class specific or not, but something that I didnt have to do so much typing at the start of the game.</li>
<li>would make overall gaming experience more relaxing, focused on the game instead of typing formatting.</li>
<li>could have a “clear all” button for anyone who wants a fresh slate</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have a Match History</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>im sure this is something that will for sure come, but I would like to see match histories so I can make notes on how I won specific set ups/ stats on win % with each class.</li>
<li>in Beta we have to leave the win/ loss screen at the end of games so fast to get into the lobby so that we dont get left behind. Sometimes I want to see what player the king was, or who ended up being what.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Character Appearance Randomization</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Have a setting where you can make your appearance or the appearance of others characters randomized, or at least randomize your set up from what you currently own.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the issue: I will be playing with my friends and we are on skype sometimes, we never say who we are and I LOVE the 2nd layer of mystery trying to find out who my friends are in the process… but If there are 5 people left and I see that only one player is using the Electricity Sword Thing… then I know thats him. And based off his conversations over skype I now have extra information that could corrupt the game for me. I dont like having that extra information, some people probably get on skype and tell each other who they are and what class or w/e, but we dont and Id hope there are others like us. So having the randomized setting on yourself or others would be nice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Private Journal Section</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A tab or section of the Journal that is not revealed upon death</li>
<li>RopeStringFace idea, and I have had this same feeling of wanting to get a piece of real life paper sometimes and write stuff down as an evil or jailer or w/e. Which I feel is not something someone should have to do to play optimally</li>
<li>As super imprtant roles (for good or evil) you sometimes want to write KEY information down… but cant because if you die you would be throwing everyone under the bus and essentially “gamethrowing” on accident because you wrote down and outed your team.</li>
</ul>
