    <title>Cannot kill as PK</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cannot-kill-as-pk/81246</link>
    <description>#### What happened? Became PK, first 2 nights, I had no problem attacking. Then instead of my guard killing like they should, I got the message that my useless guards protected me instead

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? They were supposed to kill that pesky hunter who was still alive

#### Steps to reproduce: Become PK -&gt; Fail at managing your guards

            <p>No, I did attack into his bear once N5, it correctly said immune then.<br>
I attacked (or attempted to attack) him a total of 4 times that game (N5 + N7 + N8 + N9) so he was definitely out of bears . If it was a visual bug, he would’ve died, but my attacks just didn’t go through.</p>

            <p>i believe it’s more of a visual bug than anything, since the first image shows “4 was immune” and the last ones show “you protected yourself”</p>

            <p>are you 100% sure this was a bug<br>
because you don’t die if you send guards and run into say, a bear<br>
but hunter is still death immune when using bear</p>

            <p>We don’t use output_log anymore, we use Player.log (or Player-prev.log if you’ve restarted your game once since)</p>
<p>Either way, thank you for the screenshots <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>
