    <title>A Nice Buff to Drunk- Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-nice-buff-to-drunk-suggestion/3223</link>
    <description>Hello guys
Recently the Drunk has recieved some changes- Happy Hour was changed from a defensive anti-convert ability to an offensive way to remove occupy and night immunity from the target. I think that currently, the ability is quite underwhelming, and I will explain why.

Removing night immunity is nice, but Drunk is a member of the BD, the only class that can help him is the Knight, or teaming with Alch or NK(super unlikely). That means this part of the ability is pretty much non relevent.

The occupy immunity removal however is quite cool, but it means you have to work with another BD in order to occupy the target. Only a Butler can help you, and this is situational at best. You need two people just to occupy one player!

One good part of the ability is that it notifies your target, which can confirm you as Drunk. Honestly, that is the only good use I can find for this ability right now.

I offer to buff the abilty slightly, and make it also **Occupy the target**. This way, you have two charges(and only two!) of guaranteed occupation! This makes the ability much more powerfull and also more fun. You will no longer need to team up to occupy someone, and having two charges means you can not abuse it (you are not a real butler!).


Please let me know what you think

            <p>Agreed. Drunk is very weak on its own.</p>
