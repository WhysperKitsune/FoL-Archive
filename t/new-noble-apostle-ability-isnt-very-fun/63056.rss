    <title>New Noble/Apostle Ability Isn&#39;t Very Fun</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-noble-apostle-ability-isnt-very-fun/63056</link>
    <description>The Noble/Apostle ability that listens to every single whisper isn&#39;t good for the health of the game. 

It discourages both good and evil from cooperating and making plays.

It&#39;s _especially_ punishing for Neutral Killers and Neutral/Evil kings trying to work with the bad guys.

If I whisper somebody I should be able to do it in confidence. The fact that people can see who and when I whisper should be enough for them to deduce.</description>

            <p>Noble spy isn’t powerful enough to be delayed till N3.</p>
<p>It would basically tell everyone to whisper all the claims to the prince and king on D2 when it can’t be used</p>
<p>Making it unique will just make it harder for apostle to claim noble. Or even possessor. Now don’t say well he couldn’t claim noble anyway he can’t force someone to vote someone else. I’ll say that is wrong because you can basically claim anything and get away with it.</p>

            <p>I would argue that whispering anybody that isn’t king or outed prince is <em>already</em> risky and that by discouraging people from whispering non king/prince targets makes the game less interactive in the first place.</p>
<p>I’ve had several games tonight were a merc whispered his target and him and/or the target get immediately voted up.</p>
<p>Giving two classes a blanket hear all whisper ability that can be used the first 2 or 3 nights seems overpowered to me.</p>
<p>I would make Noble unique and make the ability not usable until night 2 or 3.</p>
<p>I understand that you disagree and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts.</p>

            <p>These plays should be risky<br>
You shouldn’t be able to whisper without the fear of others listening. It makes the game less intractive.</p>
<p>You can still make them in this meta. You just have to take calculated risks.</p>

            <p>You shouldn’t be whispering unseen as a neutral killer anyway as you can’t win with them.<br>
If you’re sorc you know who they are</p>
<p>As a non nk neut once your wincon is done who cares if you get hung for whispering someone? Fools actually BENEFIT from other people hearing their whispers as does scorned most of the time.</p>

            <p>I argue that Noble / Aristocrat / Apostle is CRITICAL for the health of the game and is 10x more fun than before. Obviously fun is subjective, but the game was NOT in a healthy state before the change. Before, everyone would just whisper the prince and let him solve the game for them. If he got empowered reaped or wall of fired well, rip the BD’s chances of winning.</p>
<p>Now you’re encouraged to lead public discussion as BD which is what the game is actually about. Not whisper one person your claim and idle performing night actions.</p>

            <p>Your solution is so strict that it is never going to play out in a real game, so an evil claiming he snooped would have decent credibility (in our hypothetical game where Snoop doesn’t belong to Noble).</p>
<p>To clarify, your solution requires the Noble survive without being converted to at least D4, have a successful snoop N1 or N2 on someone with legitimate logs, communicate this to either Prince or Good King before D4, then another successful snoop on someone with fake logs N3 or later.  And Prince or Good King, whichever you communicated with, must also be alive to back you up on D4.</p>

            <p>Plus you can easily just have you and your first snoop target immediately whisper his logs to a third party such as king or prince immediately after getting them to prove before you even get the second one.</p>

            <p>And no. You can’t just assume that every prior target to the one being accused would have already posted logs. That’s usually not true.</p>

<p>Same way princess does. Scum avoid changing claims to avoid getting accused. However unlike the Princess a Snoop result is way harder to fake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do you need to fake a Snoop result?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure you are underestimating how fast people out logs because unless someone dies they can often go the whole game without claiming. Let alone posting logs.</p>
