    <description>&gt; # [color=green]Alchemist[/color]
&gt; **[color=green]Neutral Support[/color]**
&gt;
&gt; Passive: Coagulate: You are immune to Nightshade and bleeding.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Stoneskin Potion: Make yourself immune tonight. 4 uses.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Obsidian Potion: Poison someone, they will die in two nights. 0 uses.
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability: Crimson Potion: Heal someone. If you succeed, you will gain a use for both Obsidian and Emerald potion.
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability: Emerald Potion: Attack someone. 0 uses.

Problems with the Current Alchemist.
1. There is no desire for either team to kill the Alchemist. If BD kill them, they lose a healer, and protectives are very valuable. On the other hand, they aren&#39;t sworn enemies to evil factions, so evils are always better off killing someone else. Therefor Alchemist will be left alone. Thus, they claim early and live.

I&#39;m also gonna quote some of Hippo&#39;s arguements on the FoL changes thread:

2. It is no fun for town. There is no deception or intrigue in claiming Alchemist as Alchemist, supporting town all game, and then backstabbing them for no reason. That is not skillful play, and it is not satisfying for anyone involved. Sure, Alchemist is clearly a very pro-town Neutral, but it is far less fun to interact with than the Mercenary for example.
3. It is not fun for the Alchemist. If you claim early on like most people you are pushed to irrelevancy. Icibalus had a well-thought out post on SFoL13 saying something along the lines of “why should I not get to play or contribute just because I rolled Alchemist”. You have an incredibly small impact on the game. Rolling Alchemist is essentially being told “hey, I know you signed up for this game to play, but tough shit. At least you get a free win though, right?”

This is just my sample suggestion, but I really think Alchemist needs some changes.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I dont think unlimited attacks would be the solution… It would change the meta from “claim d1 as alch and be left alone” to “kill alchemists on sight”. It would also change the amount of kills per night from 2 to 3 or potentially 4 if 2 alchs spawn. And with around 8 BD spawning each game, this means the entire BD could be dead by d3.</p>

            <p>Here’s what I am thinking</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="darkgreen"> Alchemist </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="darkgreen"> Neutral Support </font></strong><br>
Passive: Coagulate - You are immune to poison and bleed.</p>
<p>Day Ability 1: Stoneskin Potion - You will be night immune tonight. (2 uses)<br>
Day Ability 2: Invisibility Potion - Your Ability’s won’t count as visiting tonight. (1 use)</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Emerald Potion - Attack Target. Successful kills give you another Stoneskin and Crimson Potion. (Unlimited)<br>
Night Ability 2: Crimson Potion - Heal target player. If you successfully save someone then you will gain another Invisibility Potion. (2 uses)</p>
<p><em>goal: Survive</em></p>

            <p>I still think he should start with less uses of stoneskin and gain more when he kills people. This would prevent alchs from being too passive.</p>
