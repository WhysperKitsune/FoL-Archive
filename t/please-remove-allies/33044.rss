            <p>Actually people whisper leads and claims to the king as it is right now. One thing I might do is remove starting Neutral king and make it a 66% chance of good king and a 33% chance of evil king.</p>
<p>After that giving the king info is a much safer bet and evils don’t really care anyway.</p>

            <p>In a perfect would that would be great, but half the time bd wont trust you with information regardless of how good of a king you act like.</p>
<p>And I’m not saying king needs to keep allies in it’s current form, but he does need something. Otherwise there will be almost no way to differentiate a good king from an evil king until they’re hung.</p>

            <p>I’ve jumped to king as possessor on night one in my last three possessor games.</p>
<p>Maybe they can lower the Allies uses to like 2 and add more guards or other abilities.</p>
<p>This would make it so king saves Allies checks instead of just using them the first 4 or 5 days randomly.</p>

            <p>Agreed, the king just needs to be completely reworked.  Different kings should have different abilities.</p>

<p>I feel as if king needs an investigative ability of some description. He wouldn’t feel like a leader if he had no leads tbh.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree, a LEADER, is one who organizes people to use their abilities in the optimal way. He takes the information people brings him, makes determinations of how valid that information is. basically if he can judge the claims he gives the possibility for the investigatives to accuse without outing themselves, which is damn strong.</p>
<p>As an Investigator, he’s basically a dues ex-machina. Oh did the king find you… well ok well you can’t try and convince anyone he isn’t really king… in the first 3 or 4 days it’s pretty unlikely he’d sacrifice his cover yet… so 99% chance he’s either a good king doing his job right, or an evil/neutral king that wants to kill an evil/neutral to avoid suspicion, either way there’s no rational reason to discuss it, time to hang the SoB that’s been outed by the king.</p>
<p>Really they might as well give the king “automatically send someone to the stand and auto execute” for the direct effectiveness of a kings investigative abilities in the early days. There’s no wiggle room, no discussion, really no plausible reason to think he’s wrong beyond a lucky scorned/fool interfering.</p>

            <p>You would be surprised how fun that aspect of king can be when people play along. If the game mechanics encourage doing that then the king suddenly becomes fun to play dispite not having an investigation tool</p>

            <p>What if Allies became more of a parity cop check? So you can actually check who is aligned to whom?<br>
So something like</p>
<p><strong>Allies [Night Ability]</strong> 5 Uses<br>
Check someone. The first check will receive no feedback, and any further checks will compare the alignment of  the current check to the previous check, giving the feedback “Same Faction” or “Different Faction”.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you just pick 2 people with it (simillar to a CW tornado UI.) and it tells you “Same Faction” “Different Faction”</p>

            <p>My main suggestion is that it has infinite uses but as soon as king finds someone of the same faction, he loses it. It was meant for evil king to find fellow evils, not BD hunt evils</p>

            <p>While the royal invest was better than the faction check he has now I am in the mindset that he needs to have a social ability rather than an investigative ability. Possibly Private matters. Either that or a support ability like an upgraded guards.</p>

            <p>I agree there, was hugely popular among the experienced players in the testing, then as soon as it hit public, it took the general public more than a day to adjust… and rather than adjust they whined, and the dev’s were waay to quick to double back.</p>
<p>To me though, I think a better comprimise… is to make neutrals appear as bd to the king. You can’t deny or CC or anything to a king… so it shouldn’t be used as an auto LOSE. (Note I don’t mind an assasain, or a single cultist etc… dying, I used the word LOSE because that is different than dying, IE BD and Unseen/cult still win with their team, but with the exception of mercenary, most neutrals goals do not outlive themselves.</p>

            <p><em>sigh</em> Put it the correct category ffs</p>
<ol>
<li>I liked the allies where it checked royal blood. It countered MM claim princess and other scum doing that.</li>
<li>I agreed allies is OP as fuck, but it needs to be changed not removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>also don’t do 1/2 liner posts like this. It’s incredibly annoying</p>
