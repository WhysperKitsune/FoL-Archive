    <title>Possible Bug in Unseen Winning Game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possible-bug-in-unseen-winning-game/75092</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Alive on d5 - Good King
                     Prince
                     MM
                     Assassin
                    Enforcer

d5 goes like this.  Unseen vote up Prince. King pardons. We vote up King and exe him. Unseen auto win the game.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

d5 goes like this - Unseen vote up Prince. King pardons. Unseen votes up King and exes. Prince jails Assassin (He knew who he was and has all exes).
n5 - Prince exes assassin. Unseen cant do anything.
d6 - Nothing since King was exed there can be no votes. Prince jails Enforcer who now is assassin (He knows who he is, still has 2 exes)
n6 - Prince exes assassin. MM cant do anything.
d7 - Not enough votes for a king or to vote anyone up. Prince jails MM.
n7 - Prince exes MM

BD win.

#### Steps to reproduce:

See above

#### Comments:

I was part of the Unseen team. Im not complaining about the win, but it seems a bit off for this to be an auto win? Am I missing something on how this should have played out?</description>

<p>lol It really did. And very very low Im assuming.</p>
<p>My understanding is that MM cant turn assassin if theres another assassin right? So he couldnt make that choice to end prince.</p>
<p>Also yes I do on Windows</p>
