    <title>Evil class, showed in Blue on final scoreboard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/evil-class-showed-in-blue-on-final-scoreboard/25328</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was Physician, became Ritualist. Final scoreboard showed me as Ritualist...in blue.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Should&#39;ve been Ritualist in red

#### Steps to reproduce:

NFI. See the screenshot below for enough info to hopefully track down game, which ended ~5 minutes before this message. I&#39;m player #7. Looks like #9 also shows in blue incorrectly.
