    <title>Knights... why do you always do this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/knights-why-do-you-always-do-this/4358</link>
    <description>Whenever I&#39;m possessor, I send a random sucker at the King. Everytime I get 2 for one as they are killed by a knight. Like... Knight and Priest, Knight and Sheriff, Knight and Observer

Everytime, BD have gone onto lose (I don&#39;t usually win, as unseen grow out of control fast)

So why do knights do it?</description>

            <p>While a neutral King might be friendly or a bit helpful, they won’t do things a Good King would do.  For example, a Neutral King isn’t going to guard a prince over himself.  He might not even guard a prince at all, since he doesn’t particularly care if they die.  A Good King will stick with the BD no matter what, he has no choice, but if I’m a neutral King and the Phys dies, now I’m thinking the assassin can poison and kill me at will, so I better dial back my support for the BD.</p>
<p>So yea, a neut King is generally helpful for BD, but not to the same degree as a Good King since he doesn’t have the same selfless priorities as a Good King.  So a neut King bring BD to the losing point faster.</p>

            <p>we are asking if the king is trustworthy most of the time. Because if you pick someone at random there is a good chance that they are not BD.</p>
<p>1/3 - BD king (good)<br>
1/3 Neut king (good?)<br>
1/3 Evil king (bad)</p>
<p>If we come to the conclusion that the Neutral king is probably going to work for the BD then the Neutral king is trustworthy.</p>

            <p>Well, the only way to know a King is Neutral early game is if they admit it, so I could add the caveat that I would always kill any King <em>claiming</em> to be neutral.  If they are a Neutral pretending to be BD and actively helping BD, yes, you wouldn’t kill them, but such a King would be indistinguishable from a Good King anyway.</p>
<p>If the King <em>claims</em> Neutral, that’s them pretty much saying “I’m not going to help much, here’s why.” which is totally unacceptable.  BD has to hold the King’s feet to the fire so that he’s forced to help them early on regardless of his alliance.</p>
<p>I would also point pout that while Allies is a powerful ability, information is only valuable when the source is trusted.  The MasterMind knows who all the unseen are, but we don’t advocate keeping Masterminds alive because the information is held by a source that can’t be trusted.</p>

            <p>The problem with killing an early neutral king is that a neutral king will give out results from his 4 investigations.<br>
There is no point a  neutral king keeping these things secret and he will be better trustee if he gives out this Info</p>
<p>so who do these results benefit more ?</p>
<p>given that unseen already know who all the bd/neutrals are then the investigation knowledge of the neutral king is more likely to benefit the blue dragon . who know the sum total of duck all.</p>
<p>So killing a neutral king before he has used his 4 investigatives is a weak play for blue dragon .</p>
<p>so don’t kill neutral king before turn 4 . after turn 4 once you have all his information you can do . but only if you have a cast iron proof your new king is blue dragon .</p>
<p>although bare in mind that a neutral king will vote with the majority to get pretty much anyone you can get close to the stand on the stand .</p>
<p>both a neutral king and a blue d king will vote with a convincing argument for a blue dragon led hanging<br>

            <p>That may be true overall. But in the early game the neutral king will usually side with BD. If he was just a survivor this wouldn’t matter. But he isn’t. The starting king can find and out evils better than the other 2 kings with Ally’s. The fastest way for the neutral king to win is to immediately get the entire unseen killed.</p>

            <p>There is only a 33% chance the starting King is BD.  If an unseen royal takes over being King that means it must be an unseen game and the unseen must have converted a Royal.  Yes, that can happen but the odds are fairly low.  There are never any sure plays, just plays that are statistically good or bad.</p>
<p>And as Neutral Kings, the bad guys win once they achieve a voting majority and BD can no longer execute (generally… this isn’t always 100% true but usually is),  The King holds double the voting power of anyone else.  A neutral King who double votes to kill a BD and end the game is a 4 vote swing compared to a BD King who double votes an unseen or cult to extend the game. The King is vitally important to getting people voted up and executed.  Even a King that just sits on their hands is devastating to BD.  Yes, a neutral King might decide to stick with BD anyway, but there’s no reason to bet on people working against their own interests.</p>
<p>The problem is it’s difficult to determine the difference between the Right play and the Winning play.  Sometimes the right play doesn’t win you the game, and sometimes the wrong play would have.  It’s like if Option A has a 75% chance of winning and Option B has a 25% chance of winning.  You should always pick A, even though 1 in 4 times it will lose you the game, and people will always say “I just played 2 games in a row and did B and won!”  It’s still not the right play, just because it worked.</p>

<p>Uhhh… Their objective is too survive. Not to screw over BD. They look at who is winning, then they side accordingly. They have no allegiance to any faction and aren’t bound by game throwing rules when it come sot screwing over a faction. If a BD King screws over BD that would be game throwing no doubt. So basically you want to punish people who get RNGesused and can’t do anything about it. I was once a BD king who claimed Nuetral for Unseen to leave me alone and it worked until a said a neutral was Unseen. I was then outed as BD King and help them get the sheriff off the stand then we won.</p>

            <p>My guess it was early in the game and the knight didn’t know a possessor was amidst. Also, sometimes, one just has to take a guess and hope it works out.</p>

            <p>A neutral King <em>could</em> help BD.  A Good will <em>will</em> help BD.</p>
<p>Any king who declares Neutral early on should be killed and replaced.  They’re going to turn on BD as soon as doing so can secure the game for unseen or cult.  The only time neutral will always help BD is when BD is winning anyway.</p>
<p>The replacement King is likely to be BD since the only way a royal blood Evil King can happen is a royal getting converted in an unseen game.</p>

            <p>As Neutral King ill always try and give a vague idea that I am goo d for the first 5-6 turns whilst bd are in the majority , when it gets a bit nitty gritty  nearer the end ill usually declare as neutral and state that I have no further interest in the squabble and suggest that everybody leaves me out of it .<br>
If I get neutral ill declare it as not ally , evil - not ally , good , blue dragon .<br>
Its kind of easy as neutral to claim Good .</p>

            <p>If a king gives you a “BD” feedback on a Mercenary, for example, or an alchemist, and they claimed Neutral then one of those two is lying. If the Merc is confirmed then you can safely vote up the Evil King.<br>
The reason for that is that the Evil king only sees if someone belongs to its faction, just like the Good King… while the NKing sees the exact alignment.<br>
Similarly, if a claimed King says “BD” on any neutral that later dies… they are evil.</p>

            <p>It’s better to let the first king die and let a more likely bd king step forward. I played a semi convincing good/neutral king as an evil. Lost because I accidentally approved a possessor as an ally, and voted first for a hunter. Unseen were wiped out by thus point, so nothing I could do about it</p>
