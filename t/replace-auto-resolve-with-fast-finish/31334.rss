    <title>Replace auto-resolve with Fast-Finish</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/replace-auto-resolve-with-fast-finish/31334</link>
    <description>I think there&#39;s always a lot of discussion, annoyance etc... on the autoresolve system. Kings losing when they could have fingered the last guy, CW/assasain endings etc...

Rather than trying to get a perfect end game calculator, what if instead of an auto resolve taking effect, the game goes into &quot;wrap up&quot;, or something. IE days become 25 seconds, nights become 15 seconds. and let the game resolve by actions.</description>

<p>Well I would say, I don’t mind them, for lessening draws… for all intents and purposes, everybody loses in a draw. And in town of salem… there’s hugely different chances of winning. That being said in throne of lies, the factions are pretty balanced, but there is a huge problem with the auto resolver making decisions that just aren’t right.</p>

<p>My main issue is that rules for tie-breakers tend to be obscure in Throne of Lies, so sometimes you get a surprise win or loss that you couldn’t prepare for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or if king doesn’t have guards.</p>

</aside>
<p>correct, and from what I’ve seen there’s cases where it auto resolves in the unseens favor if say the day starts out 1v1 with assasain vs king <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/7lo6mt/bd_king_loses_1v1_against_assassin_during_the_day/" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/7lo6mt/bd_king_loses_1v1_against_assassin_during_the_day/</a></p>
<p>which from what I understand, is either because the king was poisoned (irrelevant as he’d still live long enough to finger if the game didn’t cut off early), or because he was out of guards (again irrelevant in that case).</p>
<p>also heard of cases of auto resolves 1v1 in unseens favor when it’s assasain with no poison vs court wizard, one that should either be a BD win or a draw.</p>
<p>There’s all kinds of nuances, debatables etc… that the games algorythms just aren’t able to work around. I get that it’s more or less to eliminate the standing around for like 2 minutes waiting for a day and night to end when everyone already knows the ending. Hence my idea of a way to avoid the 2 minutes waiting around, but not risk the algorythm making bad decisions, is to shorten the days and nights after the conclusion is set in stone.</p>

            <p>From what I know, the game only auto-resolves when it’s impossible to win anyway. Like if King is in a 1v1, it always auto-resolves to king win since he can use his finger to vote the other person up.</p>
