    <title>The new hightlight chat feature</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-new-hightlight-chat-feature/7449</link>
    <description>I was really excited when i saw they made a feature to click on a line from chat to highlight it.  that way when so many people are talking i figured i could go back and see all the important lines i highlighted.  Unfortunately you can only highlight 1 line, if you click another, the first highlight goes away.  Any chance next patch we can highlight as many lines as we want? would be really useful for checking history later for lines that we thought were very important info.</description>

            <p>Awh <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> well it was a nice thought. Is it possible to copy what you highlight and paste it into your private notes for future reference?</p>
