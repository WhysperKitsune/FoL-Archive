    <title>Inconsistency with &quot;Unhealable&quot;</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inconsistency-with-unhealable/73791</link>
    <description>Stab = assassin kill with no modifiers unless specified otherwise

N1: Sheriff is Stabbed, reaped and healed by a physician
D2: Sheriff is dead

Thus reap makes the target unhealable rather than just having an unhealable attack

N3: MM is wolfed
N4: MM is reaped and healed
D5: ???

People are saying the MM should survive even though reap should make him unhealable

Hypothesis: Attack on immune considered unsuccessful?

Experiment: Use Possess on MM. If attacks on immunes are considered unsuccessful then he will regain a use

Result: Possessor does no regain a use on immune targets. Immune targets are not considered failures 

Hypothesis 2: Unhealable attacks only make the target unhealable if the attack kills them

Experiment:

D2: Poison Reaper
N2: RE and heal reaper

If he still is poisoned D3 then the Hypothesis is correct

ERROR: Reaper removes poison on consume regardless of heal

Alternative Experiment:

D2: Poison Reaper
N2: RE and heal reaper

The physician should revive a message about removing poison from the target 

Result: ???

            <p>I am trying to determine what actually happens. That sort of thing being a mistake means that other outcomes being emergent rather than hardcoded are more likely</p>

            <p>Uh</p>
<p>For example 1</p>
<p>Are you saying the Phys should get a heal notification but then the Sheriff dies anyways?</p>
