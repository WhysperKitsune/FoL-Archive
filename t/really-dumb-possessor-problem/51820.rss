    <description>So I just tried to possess a person who disconnected like 1 second before the night ended, &quot;You cannot possess a disconnected player.&quot;  Then that person rejoined and continued to play.  Wow really?</description>

            <p>The obvious solution is get rid of the connect/disconnect messages.  They allow metagaming in other ways also and they have no justification for being in the game.</p>

            <p>They should at least die. “You could not possess the player so you killed them normally instead”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s more complicated to fix than it seems.  Think about how the messages involved work (and remember, they’re visible to everyone):</p>
<p>“4 has disconnected!”</p>
<p>(Night ends, Possessor, who was 5, jumps to 4.)</p>
<p>“5 has reconnected!”</p>
<p>Now it’s obvious who the possessor is.  You can fix this by having it display their old number, but that will require some tracking.  And there’s still some other issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What if they take a while to reconnect?  The Possessor can fake being disconnected, but it’ll be a bit tricky and many possessors would miss that they have to do so.  I guess it could prevent the possessor from speaking?  It’s complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if that person doesn’t reconnect at all?  Eventually, it will have to show a fake reconnect message, but when?  If it happens in a predictable way (ie. immediately after the night ends), people might notice and suspect a possessor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about their new number, which never showed a disconnect message but is now disconnected?  If they never come back, how is this handled?  Will they appear as an option to be raised as a DK, say?  Note that if they’re now silently disconnected, a Phys could notice the missing number the next night, look back to see who was disconnected at the end of last night, and identify who the Possessor is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I agree that it should be fixed, but there’s complications that need to be worked out first.</p>
