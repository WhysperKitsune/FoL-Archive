    <description>We occasionally hear things from devs like &quot;possessor&#39;s win rate is much lower than reaper&quot;, which are super interesting. I&#39;d like to be able to dig through that data myself. Currently I have guesses based on personal experience, like &quot;alchs tend to survive after the nk is dead&quot; and &quot;reapers tend to win more in games where unseen/cult did well&quot;. I&#39;d like to replace those guesses with numbers.

Nothing too fancy would be necessary, I&#39;m thinking of something along the lines of:

* csv or json data stuck on a web server somewhere
* daily dump or similar is fine, no need to be real time
* no names, no chat logs, no day-by-day of what happened, just: original and final classes, winners, when people died, and the game version

I could learn a lot just from that.</description>
