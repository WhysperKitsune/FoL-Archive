    <title>Please let the accused paste full logs on the stand</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/please-let-the-accused-paste-full-logs-on-the-stand/67684</link>
    <description>It&#39;s very tedious to have to copy and paste multiple pieces of my logs on trial, it takes time since anything to do with text in the game on my laptop lags a bit by almost half a second.  And I frequently fuck it up and it&#39;s very aggravating when it happens, it makes me look guilty.  

So can we remove or at least greatly lengthen the cap on the amount of text the accused can post on trial?  Make it so I can post my full logs with a single copy &amp; paste please.</description>

            <p>Going a bit further: a button to actually show your logbook on stand after ~7 seconds there, working as a way to write some details in fake logs. There is always the private one in need of hide something you want to write up, and then it would make much easier for everyone who just doesn’t want to copy-paste. Of course it would be optional option in case a Mystic or Prince are upped and don’t want to show their claims in the right side of the log. Chill and Silence could also prevent them from showing that.</p>

            <p>Honestly, if we have a Default key that pre-loads a nice setup for you, we could have a key that just posts your logs (just the left side) and that key alone can bypass the chat character limit.</p>
<p>It’s a bit unfair for scum trying to write/edit logs on the fly, but you can always say “lag” or something to justify the delay.</p>
