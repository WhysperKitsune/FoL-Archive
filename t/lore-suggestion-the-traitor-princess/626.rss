Lore Subject: 

Lore:

The Black Rose for all their cunning and murderous ways devised something that none could expect. The corruption of our most fair and beautiful Princess. Her weapons of words and coercion become tainted with venom and spite preying on the very way of life of those she interrogates. How does one so graceful who danced in the flames of nobility become the bitter sting at the heart of a winters storm? Nobody knows. All we can assume is that our fair princesses righteous heart became entangled in the thorns of the Black Rose Mastermind. The strength of Royal Blood turned against us is the worst nightmare we could possibly imagine. Her Kingdom, her family, the very light sanctified in her heart is sacrifice to the Black Rose in return for a pale imitation forged by her now palpable skill at draining others of everything they hold dear in the name of those who would oppose us. 

Nobody in the Kingdom would dare question our beloved princess but when she questions the kingdom there is no answer for her other than the destruction the Black rose seeks. While we cannot and will not explore the warped reasoning that would drive a royal into the darkness we have to accept the possibility that perhaps our most brilliant and vibrant star will someday implode and erase all of us in her most holy light of judgement.

We must remain steadfast in our knowledge that while our way of life my contain it&#39;s flaws it provides a way of life along the path of light for many. Our idols cannot be deemed absolute and while the princess may provide a light that shines in many hearts the cold winter of reality may be upon us.


Comments:

So I decided to do my first Converted role lore. It&#39;s based on the concept of the Bright and warmth of the princess turning into that of an ice queen unmerciful and cruel in her gain of information.

As a base line you could understand that the black rose undertake far more political tactics than the more moral orientated Blue Dragon. Therefore I had this image of the princess instead of providing a trusting figure instead acting like a cruel and vicious dominator who would threaten a persons family or shatter insecurities and mental images to gain her goals.

Think of it as the princess being a virtuous and fierce defender of good while the Traitor princess maintains this facade but does truly unspeakable acts of manipulation that cannot be revealed unless as an act of Mutual destruction in private.</description>

            <p>Well it was more based on the actual fable of the Snow Queen because Frozen doesn’t really paint Elsa in a dark light but if you consider that Frozen was also based on the Snow queen then yes that would be a good reference.</p>
