            <p>Your passives give you away, just make it bleed and death immune.</p>
<p>I like the idea behind cursing and it’s effect where people visiting someone with the curse dies, what I’d propose however, is an ability to make someone your “cursed” who curses whoever visits them and if a cursed player visits the “cursed” then they die.</p>
<p>It also needs a direct method of killing too, so maybe a 3-time usual kill.</p>
<p>There’s a few avenues you could take with this class</p>
