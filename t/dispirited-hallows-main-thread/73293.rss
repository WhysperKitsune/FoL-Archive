    <description>Such is the dispirited, weak and broken. Those who hath come aboard, and those who hath fallen. The tides are changing. The era of peace is about to end.

The beloved King, Grant the Second is failing. The crown prince Rashie Zealot Grant the Third is stipulated to become king. His coronation will take place in two days.

There is a village.by the borderlands, the village of Millias. The mediator between two kingdoms. We have several children playing by the fields of the village. One of them is Lyn Itsucha. She is a very vibrant girl, of 9 years old. She is skipping around in the village, looking at the flowers that adorn the field.

&quot;When will the others come?&quot; The green haired lady asks. Here, her conspicuous hair colour doesn&#39;t matter. &quot;I&#39;m getting bored...&quot;

## Most roleplayers will be friends of Lyn. Arc 0 starts... now.</description>

            <p>Dawa unconsciously looked through the door during most of the time after the discussion’s half, as expecting something to come out of here. It was such a natural course of action as a guard it because a habit.</p>
<p>“Any leads on what could motive those actions? I would mostly say money, but depends on how the villages were raided. If they were completely destroyed as soon he was seen, it may be for motives further from generic guesses.”</p>

            <p>“Discernment of Hakix is difficult, due to him concealing his presence, not to mention he deploys illusions to his needs as well. Guards are not well equipped to handle a man of his prowess. But you should do just fine, being young and all.”</p>
