    <title>Suspended for 1d then got extended to 30d for no clear reason</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suspended-for-1d-then-got-extended-to-30d-for-no-clear-reason/78172</link>
    <description>&gt; [color=red]*For better/faster support, try Discord: https://discord.gg/tol[/color]

What happened: I was Suspended for 1d for being afk in jail. (Really stupid on my part I apologize)
Logged on after one day had passed and it had suddenly become a 30d suspension!

Unsure what Ban Evasion Means?? if that has increased it I really don&#39;t know why.

any help would be appreciated!!                                                                                                                                     [TOL%20-%20Ban%20Reason|690x388](upload://bKR8AA9LTlRaGff8QdzB0fSoWyy.jpeg)</description>
