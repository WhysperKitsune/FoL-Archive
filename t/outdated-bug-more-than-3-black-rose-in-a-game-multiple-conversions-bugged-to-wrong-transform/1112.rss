    <title>[Outdated] BUG: More than 3 Black Rose in a game - multiple conversions bugged to wrong transform</title>

**Expected Results:** Only 3 Black rose would exist in a game and converted Blue Dragon members would convert to their appropriate Black Rose role

Knight &gt; Enforcer
Priest &gt;Soulcatcher
Princess &gt; Traitor Princess

**Actual Results:** **_Knight, Priest, and Princess all converted into Assassins._**  This allowed for multiple Assassin kills in the end game, and the game does not consider Assassin unique, so I was able to keep converting beyond the 3 max Black Rose members.  By the end of the game, I had 5 Black Rose members that I was aware of (with 1 BR King who disconnected later in the game).

I believe the cause of the bug to be linked with my Assassin who DC&#39;d day 2, before I converted the first princess into a Traitor Princess.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Be Mastermind
2. Night 1 - Don&#39;t kill anyone with the Assassin that spawns with you.  Don&#39;t convert night 1
3. Day 2 -  Have the Assassin disconnect from the game.
4. Night 2 - Convert cult member on night 2  **(note the game won&#39;t mark the original Assassin as suicided/dead until day 3)**
5. Day 3 - Original Assassin shows to Court as suicided.  BR now includes Mastermind and a random BR.  No assassin is with the BR.  **_I think this causes the game to freak out to try to force an Assassin to appear._**
6. Night 3 - can&#39;t convert
7. Night 4 - Convert another member.  This role will appear as Assassin, as the game tries to add an Assassin back to the BR team.
8. Repeat Process on nights 6 and 8 for conversion.  Game will continue to convert any BD role to an Assassin, and the Black Rose will exceed past the limit of 3 members.

**Comments:**

See the attached screenshots.  **I can not attach a log file.  .txt is not in the supported extensions for forum uploads.**  I will post the log file on discord to any dev available upon request, as I have it saved under a new name on my machine, separate from other logs.
