    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-miscellaneous-thoughts-on-how-to-improve-game/73754</link>
    <description>Some of these ideas are not necessarily my own but anyways here goes.  These are things I deem to be major problems as opposed to simply things which could be improved but don&#39;t need to be:

- Allies OP

I think almost everyone agrees on this point.  It hurts neutrals so badly and also pressures them to open-claim neutral which goes against the spirit of the game.

- Observer OP

If Follow were reverted into how it used to be (as I hear it was split into two weaker abilities), the problem would disappear.

- Chronomancer OP

Chrono is very close to being a killer Physician who can self-care and heal in the same night.

- Posswords 

Giving Possessor the whisper history of his Possess target would eliminate this tedious meta and is a better solution than the current whisper-reading one for Puppet-Strings.  Also, give him the entire chat and ability feedback history of his target.

- Prince Exe &amp; Coldsteel unusable before n3

The only reason this exists is because of gamethrowers, but your anti-gamethrower system supposedly works very well so get rid of this.  It encourages neutrals to open-claim D1 as well as letting Fools (and people pretending to be Fools, like Sellswords) to run amuck for 2 days.

**EDIT:**

- Noble twin-vote confirmation

Noble twin-vote notification should not be public if it doesn&#39;t affect the trial&#39;s outcome.  According to my philosophy, any ability whose primary use (in practice) is confirmation, needs to be changed to eliminate this practice.  The current primary use of twin-vote is confirmation, so it needs to be fixed.</description>

            <p>it really isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s can be a pretty clear cut gamethrowing/not game throwing if you take a look at it. Obviously i donâ€™t deal with reports so i canâ€™t say with  with 100% certainty</p>

            <p>yolo CSing can be considered game throwing. Doing it n1 on someone for no reason. Thats def game throwing. Yoloing with 6 people left possibly facing being even in vote power the next day? I would consider a yolo CS in that situation not game throwing as they did it with the intent to win.</p>
