    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-apprentice-v-3/73165</link>
    <description>I know i had this class before but the meta has changed a lot, so i want to see what you think of this class being played in the game now


```
     •Apprentice 
```

&gt; ***Type - Support***
&gt; ***Faction - Neutral***

• unique 

&gt; my favorite classes to come up with are Neutral. Mostly because they offer a larger veritity of option and some very unique win cons. This class has a simple win con but adds some depth to it.

CANT SPAWN IN WITH SS



&gt; ***Passive 1:***
&gt; *Known allies*  - if any evil doer (NK/Cult/Unseen) visits you then you will know who they are and what class they are. You will also become death immune that night

&gt; ***Passive 2:***
&gt; *Transformation*   - if you select a class with your *Mimic*  day ability and that class has redirection or occupation immunity, then you will gain it too for the night

&gt; ***Day ability 1:***
&gt; *Mimic*  - pick a player, you can use their primary ability tonight (the ability on the left)  ***(unlimited uses)***   *if the player is a unique or special class then you will be notified and will not be able to use their ability, instead you  will become death immune that night* .  ***Can not target the same player more then 3 times***

&gt; ***Day ability 2:***
&gt; _Hidden powers_ - (2 uses) - Pick a player, and disguise them as any class of your choice

&gt;***Night ability 1:***
*New toys -*  the ability that you mimicked this morning will be the ability that takes this night abilities place. @Kirefitten

 **Win con**  - Defeat the BD at any cost 

Questions that you could answer for this class:

1 - will this be a good class to play along with in the game?
2 - will you have fun playing this class?
3 - do you think this class is too overpowered or too underpowered?
4 - do you think this class will change the game in a positive or negative way?</description>

            <ol>
<li>this class should be unique</li>
<li>it isnt really any class type as it can use abilities from all classes. it could become occ, support, etc. instead, you should make it special, but depending on who you stole the ability from, you also gain they class type or smth.</li>
</ol>
<p>feedback:<br>
1 - imo this would be pretty fun to play alongside, more room for if evils get caught, etc it also seems fairly balanced. more nuetrals is definatly a upside.<br>
2 - i think i would definatly have fun playing this class.<br>
3 - i do think this class would be not overpower or underpowered, as you would have quite the tough time claiming as it, but you also get to know like everyone’s classes essentially.<br>
4 - i think this class would definatly add new mechanics to the game, i also like classes that are able to frame night results as you shouldnt only play the game based off of “wow ur evil exe lol u suck noob” and more of actual deduction. i like how it makes more space for when evils get caught, and that it’s wincon is something like defeat bd and not survive till end</p>

<p>If it’s already death immune to any cult/unseen get rid of this. Just make it have the immune to cult, that way knights can kill you and stuff.</p>
