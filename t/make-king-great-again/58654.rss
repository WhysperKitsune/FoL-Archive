    <description>I&#39;ve made this account only to post this.

The worst mistake you have ever done was changing the king skill (allies to execution).
Before the rework, king actively needed to use hes investigation skill to proove that his a good king, leaving his protection to knights and physician. An useless king would not be popular amoung its people and would receive no protection, leaving he the choise to guard itself and further down is approval rate, or use allies to find an evil and execute it in public, regaining the kingdom trust.

The old king relies on its connection with others players, and the most satisfying moment was finding an evil with allies skill, execute him on the next day and earn the kingdoms trust, knowing that you could rest assured that night because you had knights and physicians on your back. Also if you had princes trust and he whispered you, you could guard the prince while the knights and physicians would protect you, keeping the prince identity hidden.

Not only that, but and evil king would also be more active, when finding an evil with allies skill and whispering him, forging an alliance and working together with the evil team.

Nowdays, the king is worthless, only thing they do is guard theirselves and maybe execute someone whos acting weird. Also i&#39;ve never seen an evil king cooperate with the evil team, mostly because theres no way for then to find each other, except in those cases where theres 4 or less people left and king openly claim being evil.

Before the rework, the king was a leader, and had to proove its merit, now its just a isolated class who dont interact with anyone. I understand that executing king was common before the rework, but for me that was just part of the role, and if not, can be easely adressed.

I strongly belive that if you revert king, the prince meta would end, and king would be a fun and skillfull class again.</description>

            <p>The problem is, obviously if you are dealing with a minority situation, they still have <em>and were probably already locking onto</em> an option… AKA you… The only scenerio I can see that you stopping a BD execution at your expense is if it’s say prince, king vs 3 unseen, and everyone knows everyone</p>

            <p>I’m not advocating for any such king night ability, but finger is not as situationally powerful where there are neuts in play.  With finger, you may get beat out in the rush to vote by evils.  With my idea, you can set the trial at the start.</p>

            <p>I just struggle to see the night application of this for good king.  I think if it’s going to be a night ability, it has to be more powerful.  For example:</p>
<p>Royal Agenda: Select a target.  If both of you are alive the next day, that person is immediately put on trial.  Your day abilities are disabled.  The only other person who can be tried that day is you.</p>
<p>The above may have some application for good king where the numbers are tight.  There are many situations where you know who is evil and have the numbers to execute them but not the numbers to put them on trial.  Of course, this may tank reaper win rates, but reaper can counter by killing the king.</p>

</aside>
<p>well assuming it’s a random join game and not a discord or similar game… it’s enough casual players to assume you are getting executed on n3 if you don’t at least false claim to have logs.</p>
<p>me personally I usually guarded myself n1 and investigated n2-4. (for me the focus was on doubling the amount of possible MM catching checks). After getting executed two games in a row for admitting that I was doing so, I quickly learned if I didn’t at least lie and claim to have found a BD n1, it was a death sentence.</p>
<p>Of course that also made it a really tough sell on n5 if I actually found something… I couldn’t imagine how any king would pull off claiming any investigative results n6+ if he used his allies half sparingly.</p>

Checking N1 <strong>anyone</strong> could make some problems if he came up as BD.<br>
Since there was many scenarios that can happen like same target being converted same time.<br>

<p>If you didn’t use it each night and have an answer the next day (e.g., “found a BD”), you were probably getting put up.</p>

<p>Ok back this one up. How does the King no longer having a kill stop the prince from outing?</p>

            <p>King with Allies was just a 4 use Sheriff.</p>
<p>It wasn’t interesting, it wasn’t tactical.</p>
<p>Order Execution is actually the kind of thing you don’t want to Yolo. It’s a thousand times better than Allies.</p>

            <p>Back in the day king was very hard to play.</p>
<p>It wasnt just randomly use allies, you needed to check your claims and find the most suspect person to investigate, while also choosing carefully whenever to protect yourself, prince (or a good target like a confirmed sheriff) or investigate.<br>
Also if you were evil king, you couldnt just execute no one and hope to live long, often times evil teams would accept to sacrifice a member to ensure kings aprooval rate.<br>
Neutral kings would have to play both cases, choosing if either execute a evil you found or working with them, and changing sides with games flow.</p>
<p>Todays king is just an alchemist on steroids.</p>

            <p>Very interesting concept.  Is this an unlimited ability?  How does it work mechanically with point finger and decide fate?</p>
<p>In practical application in the mid-game phase (i.e., excluding late game), won’t this 95% of the time be used as a pre-trial force pardon?  Most of the time, a king will be using it to protect a specific player that people are putting up for trial, and the response from court will be that it is evil king.</p>
<p>Should king using this ability change the votes required to put king up (royal advantage)?</p>
