    <title>Psychic can link in jail again?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/psychic-can-link-in-jail-again/34539</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Linked someone in jail

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Should be prevented, didn&#39;t see anything about changing it in patch notes
#### Steps to reproduce:
link anyone who is jailed
#### Comments:
I mean I&#39;m fine either way, honestly, but it&#39;s weird to have it come back without any notice and makes me wonder if stuff like faction checks are also getting past jailed like they used to.</description>
