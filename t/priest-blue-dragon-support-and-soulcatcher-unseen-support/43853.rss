    <description>&gt; Priest (Blue Dragon Support)
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Call of the Dead: Speak to the dead at night.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Power of the Dead: Use the primary power of a person who died last night. You may not use any ability that directly kills a target, or converts them. Unlimited Uses
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Strength of the Dead: Same as Power of the Dead, but uses secondary ability. Unlimited Uses

&gt; Soulcatcher (Unseen Support)
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Call the Darkness: Dead Unseen may speak to the Unseen while this is alive.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Power of the Dead: Use the primary power of a person who died last night. You may not use any ability that directly kills a target. Unlimited Uses
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Strength of the Dead: Same as Power of the Dead, but uses secondary ability. Unlimited Uses

Notes: Reintroduces Priest, but also gives it a neat, versatile ability so the class isn&#39;t boring.</description>

            <p>It’s meant to be a jack of all trades kind of class. Necromancer is the perfect role to do it with. Also, the dynamics are much different when you are not part of the Coven (a poorly thought out faction), so it will probably played in drastically different ways.</p>

            <p>If you really want a class focused on vote manip then make it it’s own class instead of trying to rework the noble. Noble has been about spying for far longer than he has been about vote manip and he has been better for it.</p>

            <p>Fine then keep it for strength of the dead but remember that just using the primary Ability is not as good as just being the class (unless it’s Investigative). You could just make it not give feedback to balence it too.</p>

            <p>That would make the Priest essentially every class that died. Drunk and Knight dead? You could use both abilities. It would be OP.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Priest (Blue Dragon Support)</p>
<p>Passive: Call of the Dead: Speak to the dead at night.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Power of the Dead: Use the primary power of a person who died last night. You may not use any ability that directly kills a target, or converts them. Unlimited Uses</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Strength of the Dead: Same as Power of the Dead, but uses secondary ability. Unlimited Uses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Soulcatcher (Unseen Support)</p>
<p>Passive: Call the Darkness: Dead Unseen may speak to the Unseen while this is alive.</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Power of the Dead: Use the primary power of a person who died last night. You may not use any ability that directly kills a target. Unlimited Uses</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: Strength of the Dead: Same as Power of the Dead, but uses secondary ability. Unlimited Uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes: Reintroduces Priest, but also gives it a neat, versatile ability so the class isn’t boring.</p>
