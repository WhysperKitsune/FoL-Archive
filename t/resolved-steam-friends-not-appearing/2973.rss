    <title>[RESOLVED] Steam friends not appearing</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-steam-friends-not-appearing/2973</link>
    <description>What happened:
I was able to load the game but was not able to see steam friends.

What was SUPPOSED to happen:
Log in and be able to see friends playing the game.

Steps to reproduce this issue:
(I have no clue on how to reproduce this issue. Friends have no problem seeing each other but not me.)
1.  Log in.
2.  Look at friends list
3.  Not see anything.</description>
