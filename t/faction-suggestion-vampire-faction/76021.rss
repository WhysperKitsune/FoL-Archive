            <p>First off, get rid of the vampire dying if the faction leader is still alive. IMO, Dracula should stay being occupy immune however I don’t think they should be death immune. Honestly, we should probably go for a mix of cult and unseen however we don’t want to cross it. We should also get rid of the ghoul and just make it so there’s the killer of it. Make there be a replacement system as well and get rid of the killer occupy immunity as well. So example, the game would start off with a Dracula And then the killer. If the Dracula died, the leader becomes Dracula and then whoever they convert become the leader.</p>
<p>We should nerf the killer of this class by making its killing Ability occupy the person they attack, however it delays the attack by one night. (Occupy the person you want dead N1 and they die N2)</p>

            <p>Bad idea. You should expect the Dracula to die in almost every game and balance accordingly.</p>
<p>In fact you also need to make sure the vampires aren’t screwed if he dies immediately to like a poss into knight or a lucky maid or something</p>
