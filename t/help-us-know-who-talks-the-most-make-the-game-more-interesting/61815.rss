    <title>Help us know who talks the most- make the game more interesting</title>

    <description>I think the game lack the deduction part.
It&#39;s really annoy me that one of the best unseen/cult tactic is just being quiet.

But also, I don&#39;t think its realistic to keep track on who talked the most of 16 players.

I suggest that you&#39;ll keep a counter for each player that show&#39;s the number of chars that he used on chat.
I think this should make the game more about talking.</description>

            <p>Silence is a strategy with obvious counterplay, vote them up and make them talk. I don’t think this is necessary and will look clunky to be honest. I also think it might lead to just more memeing and not force out more game related talk.</p>

            <p>Easily Kitten who talks the most. Thanks for asking. /s<br>
But in all seriousness, this might be a good idea. It might slightly give the BD an advantage, though. They will likely be the only ones who need it.</p>
