    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Hexer, neutral offensive</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-hexer-neutral-offensive/33898</link>
    <description>Hexer. Neutral offensive, magic user. Cannot be converted.

Passive 1 : Immune to occupy.

Passive 2 : If someone cursed die at night, its body stays as a liveless puppet. Puppets are occupy immune, cannot be reaped, converted, psylinked, bled or poisoned. Puppets are neutrals. 

Day Ability 1: 
Gets all your puppets to vote with you (can be used during trial, even yours, then they would be pardoning). 2 uses.

Day ability 2: 
If someone try to visit you tonight, it will be redirected to the puppet you target. 2 uses.


Night Ability 1: Curse
Occupy your target. It becomes cursed for 2 night. (you cannot curse occupy immune target that way) Infinite use.

Night Ability 2 : Spread
Everyone visiting or being visited by your target gets cursed for 2 night. Can only be used on a cursed target. 1 uses.

Win condition: Make 3 puppets.

Comments: 
The idea behind this is a neutral that is not a killer, but still a threat somehow. Maybe its closer to &quot;special&quot; than offensive, i don&#39;t know.. Of course, biggest counter is Psychic. Knight is very strong too as it gets lots of CS targets.
I&#39;m unsure about winning condition. Living till the end would work? but maybe something different.. The way i put it, he can still win when dead. But this part i&#39;m quite unsure.
The easiest claim would be butler.

Any thoughs?</description>
