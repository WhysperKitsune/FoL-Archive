    <description>So, possible Loremaster, you want to make a Lore Suggestion? Well, You could go for adding more lore to a class that has lore already, however, if you want to make some that will be the first for a class, you will probably want to make lore for an existing role that has no lore. [You can find them here](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/Category:NoLore).  However, if you want to do it for a role that has lore, [you can find them here](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Lore).</description>
