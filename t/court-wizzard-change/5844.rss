    <description>Hey , i think most of the peoplle will agree with me , Court Wizzard is most booring role to play. Can we have some update on him , i sugest to give him 1 offesive ability and 2 support. for example he could have ability to reveal to everyone who killed him or ability to see King is good or bad. i think wizzard should be powerful.  thanks :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Court Wizard is quite powerful right now. Ice Ward protects against both conversion and death and other nasty things the 3rd Unseen can do or the other Cultists can do. Ice Ward is essentially a more flexible, more powerful, and more easily confirmable heal.</p>

            <p>It’s quite unfortunate how some really crucial roles are considered weak or boring by many players.<br>
Especially Court Wizards and Physicians. They keep BD solid but still change the whole game once converted, yet still they are the most common classes I’ve seen instant quitting.</p>

            <p>Wizard is one of the strongest classes, especially in cult games. You are able to make sure the investigatives stay BD, validating their accusations so no one can say that they are converted.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, King’s whole base is that he is unable to be investigated. That will never change.</p>
<p>Court Wizard’s abilities effectively protect revealed BD that are considered vital. Sheriff found the Unseen? CW can ensure they aren’t converted. Psychic keeping the Prince and Noble in connection? Protected. Prince possibly attacked tonight? Protected.</p>
<p>I’m sorry not every role is a fun killing role with super powers. CW, Noble, Psychic… these “boring” roles are unsung heroes that are necessary for the balance in this game. If you play the game as intended, and socialize, you will find CW to be an enjoyable experience.</p>
