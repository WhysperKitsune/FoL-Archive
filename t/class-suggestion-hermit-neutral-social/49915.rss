    <description>**Hermit** (Neutral Social) - An outcast from the kingdom who wants petty revenge.

Passive:
**None of Your Concern** - You are murder immune until the first player dies from your &quot;Mark of the Pariah&quot; ability.

Day Ability:
**Mark of the Pariah** - Select a player mark them. All players capable of killing (all factions) will be notified that your target has been marked. No one will be able to protect your target (healing, guarding, etc.) on that night. (Unlimited use, but if your target isn&#39;t killed, you must wait a day before using it again.)

Night Ability 1:
**Stink Eye** - Select a player to avoid. From that point forward, your target will be permanently &quot;prevented&quot; from using any night abilities on you. Abides by normal rules with regard to classes that can&#39;t be prevented, etc. (4 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Break Bread** - Select a player to stay the night with. You will share all positive and/or negative effects done to that player, while preventing actions directed specifically at you. (3 uses.)

_^ Risky if your target is attacked, since you get the negatives along with the positives, but useful if you know who&#39;s going to be healed or guarded, etc. Does not do stuff like give Sheriff two results, you&#39;re ONLY sharing good/bad things done TO your target._

Win Goal:
Use &quot;Mark of the Pariah&quot; on three players who are killed that same night.</description>

            <p>Overall, the role fits well with the Medieval theme. I’d suggest this goes from social to offensive, as it has more offensive abilities than social abilities.</p>
<p>Passives:</p>
<p>None of Your Concern ~ Not really necessary, evils would gladly work with you anyways, and Prince/King could bypass this, so I don’t see why it exists</p>
<p>Day Abilities:</p>
<p>Mark of the Pariah ~ Seems more of an offensive ability to me. Makes this class apparent to evils AND BD, so you might be screwed. Maybe just make this apparent to Evil Killers only.</p>
<p>Night Abilities:</p>
<p>Stink Eye ~ Good for avoiding NK and EK, but why 4 uses? Too OP for 4 uses. 1 would be best.</p>
<p>Break Bread ~ More of an Investigative ability to see who is evil or not, kind of a risky ability. I’d change this to something else, but if you make this good for an offensive class, then touché.</p>
