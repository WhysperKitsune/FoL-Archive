<p>oof at everyone scumreading me for what I did earlier. I guess you guys haven’t played with me much but if there’s a way for me to get converted I will try to do so because I greatly prefer playing scum to town so my statements were pretty NAI for me.</p>
<p>In all seriousness the Universal should definitely come out. With Ici and a lynch we can fulfill your condition d1. Other than that I think coming out should be done only if you have information if not you just kind of help scum figure out who to kill</p>

<p>I want to play with to the highest odds of me personally winning not the group as a whole. If that means behaving anti-town while still town or behaving town then I’ll do either. The posts I made where I spouted words or wanted to get converted were mostly an attempt to get an Arete to reach out to me (actually hitting the word would be great but very unlikely). Unlikely with a Matron but if I could get converted right away it would be great. Being able to give an additional bluff to the evil team, take a lynch for them, and remove a good role from the game is huge. However, there’s a solid chance I don’t get converted so I’m not going to just try to help the evil team win all game. I just want to put myself in the best position if it were to happen.</p>

<p>Alright I’ve caught up for the most part haven’t read the entirety of the last 200 or so posts but have the general idea. In my opinion the most likely situation we’re in currently is that Dat was a minion and everyone else nominated is good. Dat was scummy af and I find it highly unlikely that there was more than one evil player nominated today regardless of the Bishop’s alignment. That being said I’ll still give my thoughts. RedRover has been very active in solving and kind of feels like he’s pocketing me. Some of his posts I’ve agreed with and others I’ve disagreed with. He seems to be kind of all over the place imo. I think Napoleon claiming such useless info early makes me townlean him and he’s definitely not the demon. Need to ISO Alice again. I think everyone up to be killed is town now that Dat is dead.</p>

<p>Apprentice’s ISO is actually terrible. I’ve said this before. The guy is openly admitting to playing anti-town, his reads are forced and his tone feels stilted. Additionally, that’s not how he was playing in the last BotF, where he was a villager. From the very start of the game, his tone and thoughts were not like this. Saying that he doesn’t enjoy playing V <em>now</em> feels like either a lie, a weird change of progression, or a backhanded excuse.</p>
