    <title>[Suggestion] Temp Royal Blood Passive for MM</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-temp-royal-blood-passive-for-mm/67202</link>
    <description>As if the MM didn&#39;t need anymore passives, here is a suggestion to help MM more reliably fakeclaim royal blood classes, whilst also giving evils a bit more of a reason to get that pesky starting king out of the game.

&gt; **Transfusion (Passive)** The starting mastermind has being given a blood transfusion that makes him appear to have royal blood, and thus can step up during king elections. However, due to the fact that it is foreign blood, his body is fighting it off, and there will be no trace after night 3 and he will no longer be able to step.

Now I realise that this is very likely to _increase_ the unseen&#39;s winrate to &lt; or =40% which is where the devs don&#39;t want it, so I&#39;d propose taking away the mastermind&#39;s death immunity and/or investigation immunity. 

Overall, this change is made with the intention of increasing the mastermind&#39;s expendability so that he doesn&#39;t get busted over to not having enough towncred later on.</description>

            <p>Why not make it a choice? Give the starting Mastermind a “Dark Boon” that they can choose what to obtain for that game. Allow them to choose Investigation Immunity for 3 days or Royal Blood for 5 days. If you play your cards right, you might not need the Investigation Immunity.</p>
<p>Edit: The Dark Boon would be a one-use Day ability that takes effect from that point onwards, so you could save it for later.</p>

            <p>I prefer a class that steals royal blood so that fake princess claims have a plausible excuse for not stepping up.</p>

            <p>A king dying before N3 is rare, and even if a king dies within that frame you have the option of changing your claim that early in the game.</p>
