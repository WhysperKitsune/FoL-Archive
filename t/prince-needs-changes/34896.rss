    <title>Prince needs changes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/prince-needs-changes/34896</link>
    <description>As it is right now prince is what decides whether Blue Dragon wins or loses. They have too much power compared to any other BD class. They have a knight&#39;s cs without the downsides and an guaranteed occupy. Prince also makes it harder on any neuts and fools if anyone has a slight suspicion of a fool they get executed by the prince and the bd avoids any punishment for it. Prince consolidates too much of the bd&#39;s power in one class and makes it much harder on everyone in a game.</description>

            <p>True, but those things aren’t guaranteed to even exist in a game.  Prince always will.</p>
<p>It isn’t uncommon to see a game with no Hunters or Knights, or a lone Knight at best.  Also Knights are pretty good at dying horribly and early most of the time and can be diverted pretty easily.  If you relied on Knights to deal with Fools, the Cult especially would likely just kill them by swapping them to a BD.</p>

            <p>Well, CS is also an option for dealing with fools…  and technically the wolf if you don’t mind them hanging around a bit.  But I generally agree that the Prince is fine as-is.</p>

<p>Except there is.  It’s a limited resource and if the court is wrong, it goes away forever.  Plus it wastes time, which is always against BD.</p>
<p>Prince is almost perfect the way it is.  It’s by far the strongest BD class, but it can easily make a mistake and lose most of that power.</p>
<p>Also it would make Fool’s too strong.  Prince is usually the only option.  Without Prince everyone would just claim Fool on the stand if it looks iffy.  It would swing things so far into evil’s favor it would be unreal.</p>

            <p>But… Prince helps balance the game. Without Prince, no BD is convert immune.</p>

            <p>My issue isn’t necessarily that the prince is outright powerful. It’s also that they negate risk for the BD. There’s not a choice between executing people or risk taken to execute a potential fool. Problems that the BD should be facing are just denied by the prince. Prince shouldn’t give BD an out for their bad decisions.</p>

            <p>The fact that the Prince is more powerful than other BD roles is by design, though, since it makes it important for evil roles to try and identify who the Prince is.  You wouldn’t want all BD roles to be equal in power - that would make who the evils target less important.</p>
