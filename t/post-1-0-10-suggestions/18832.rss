    <description>**Psychic**
Two Psychics in a game is far too messy. It should become a unique class again.

Of course, cutting one potential Psychic reduces both the expected number social classes and the expected number of magic users.

That’s why I suggest the glorious return of the Noble and Priest.

**Noble &amp; Aristocrat**
(Social class)
Remove Hearsay as passive
Remove Noble Twin as daytime skill
Add Spy maid as daytime skill: Target a player, you will see all whispers to and from that player today. Cannot be used before day 4. (3 uses. Can target king)
Increase the uses of Political Pressure to 3
Increase the uses of Royal Decree to 3
Increase the uses of Send Order to 3

**Priest**
(Unique social class. Magic user)
Add Confession as passive. (This is the old Noble’s Hearsay passive)
Add Good Karma as a daytime skill: The person that confessed to you last night becomes immune to death, occupy and conversion the next night. (1 use)
Add Piousness as a daytime skill: You are immune to conversion next night (2 uses)
Add Savior as a nighttime skill: If you die from an attack, you will be the only one to die from that attack. (unlimited uses)
Add Repentance as a nighttime skill: The person confessing to you this night cannot talk, accuse or vote tomorrow.
In the morning a message will be shown: Name (number) is repenting for his sins. (3 uses) (he can still be voted upon)

**Dark Priest (Unseen version of Priest)**
(Unique social class. Magic user)
Add Confession as passive. (This is the old Noble’s Hearsay passive)
Add Bad Karma as a daytime skill: Target a player. If this is the player that confessed to you last night, he dies next night. (2 use)
Add Embrace the Void as a nighttime skill: Target player will leave an empty will (unlimited uses)
Add Repentance as a nighttime skill: Target a player, if this is the player confessing to you this night, he cannot talk, accuse or vote tomorrow. In the morning a message will be shown: Name (number) is repenting for his sins. (2 uses)
(he can still be voted upon)


Hearsay did not work on Noble. Because an anonymous message is just too tempting to troll with if you have no real info or if you are neutral/evil.
Priest now has the tools to reward good or punish bad confessions. Also, the person confessing is still hard pressed to do so anonymously, because **If** the Priest is converted to Unseen, giving your number away means almost certain dead. This makes this passive skill different from Prince and Psychic where the person giving the information is known.</description>

My suggestion is replacing it with another info/claim based class. So no loss there. (2 Psychics would become 1 Psychic and 1 Priest)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bbiaglla">@bbiaglla</a><br>
That feels very artificial, and dead people would still have a hard time figuring out who is talking to who. It is still a conversation spaghetti. Not just to dead people btw, it is also weird for some being linked two nights in a row.</p>

            <p>I love having 2 psychic, its makes the game much less random(healing right target, guarding right target, testing right target) and much more base of info and claims. This is what this game should be all about.</p>

Whoops, plagiarism! No, I  honestly cannot recall reading that post. Let’s say great minds think alike <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Seriously, I would expect such a solution from you as well, as just feels like a fitting ability for a social class.<br>
I like the fully anonymous aspect of it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ropestringface">@RopeStringFace</a><br>
Good idea. Another option would be: If Repentance is used, that target will not be shown around the table and a message will be showed in the morning: Name (Number) is repenting for his sins elsewhere.<br>
This way the priest knows who it was and in case of conduct that was in violation with the rules, he can report that player after the game.</p>

            <p>The whole point of it is that it is completely anonymous. I think, however, that it could work if there was a report hearsay abuse button, which asked which night, and then the mods could check who did it.</p>
<p>Also, I was thinking a cool ability for the noble would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Royal decree</strong><br>
(? uses) A message will be announced to the court the following morning that “Extra, extra! Adiart times are in!” If people click on the message, they will view a transcript of this night’s conversation, seeing it as “noble” and “source”</p>

            <p>Alright, because your suggestion looks pretty close to mine. I feel like talking about this might be a good idea. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Here’s my thingy, it’s where Noble’s Hearsay was originally pulled from</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-priest-and-heretic-social/9863" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-priest-and-heretic-social/9863</a></p>
<p>I too called it “confession[s]”, and I too allowed you to punish the person confessing to you.</p>
<p>However, I also allow you to tactically choose who confesses to you a couple times per game, making it a very cohesive role, and I decided not to take away their ability to chat because that makes Priest kind of easy to confirm.</p>
<p>I had also considered erasing the will of their targets, but ended up making no decidions on that front yet. I could go either way.</p>
<p>But yes, either way should add decent risk to confessions. A class dedicated to confessions that can punish abuse of the feature, and may have been used to choose exactly who is confessing, is definitely the only way such an ability will work.</p>

I think that is solution is too abusable. The Psychics knowing each other as a base game mechanic is extremely powerful as both have Private Matter.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a><br>
I didn’t. I will search the topics for it. <strong>edit</strong>: I can’t seem to find the topic.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bart_auringer">@Bart_Auringer</a><br>
I know that was the case with Noble. If that happens with the Priest he can simply use Repentance.</p>

            <p>I think more than one Psychic is fine.  But I think the Psychics should know each other at least.  This way it avoids confusion when two players start claiming Psychic.</p>
<p>I was in a game recently where I was a Psychic. And there was another Psychic as well.  We had two different people claiming they were linked and it was all very confusing.</p>

            <p><strong>Psychic</strong><br>
Two Psychics in a game is far too messy. It should become a unique class again.</p>
<p>Of course, cutting one potential Psychic reduces both the expected number social classes and the expected number of magic users.</p>
<p>That’s why I suggest the glorious return of the Noble and Priest.</p>
<p><strong>Noble &amp; Aristocrat</strong><br>
(Social class)<br>
Remove Hearsay as passive<br>
Remove Noble Twin as daytime skill<br>
Add Spy maid as daytime skill: Target a player, you will see all whispers to and from that player today. Cannot be used before day 4. (3 uses. Can target king)<br>
Increase the uses of Political Pressure to 3<br>
Increase the uses of Royal Decree to 3<br>
Increase the uses of Send Order to 3</p>
<p><strong>Priest</strong><br>
(Unique social class. Magic user)<br>
Add Confession as passive. (This is the old Noble’s Hearsay passive)<br>
Add Good Karma as a daytime skill: The person that confessed to you last night becomes immune to death, occupy and conversion the next night. (1 use)<br>
Add Piousness as a daytime skill: You are immune to conversion next night (2 uses)<br>
Add Savior as a nighttime skill: If you die from an attack, you will be the only one to die from that attack. (unlimited uses)<br>
Add Repentance as a nighttime skill: The person confessing to you this night cannot talk, accuse or vote tomorrow.<br>
In the morning a message will be shown: Name (number) is repenting for his sins. (3 uses) (he can still be voted upon)</p>
<p><strong>Dark Priest (Unseen version of Priest)</strong><br>
(Unique social class. Magic user)<br>
Add Confession as passive. (This is the old Noble’s Hearsay passive)<br>
Add Bad Karma as a daytime skill: Target a player. If this is the player that confessed to you last night, he dies next night. (2 use)<br>
Add Embrace the Void as a nighttime skill: Target player will leave an empty will (unlimited uses)<br>
Add Repentance as a nighttime skill: Target a player, if this is the player confessing to you this night, he cannot talk, accuse or vote tomorrow. In the morning a message will be shown: Name (number) is repenting for his sins. (2 uses)<br>
(he can still be voted upon)</p>
<p>Hearsay did not work on Noble. Because an anonymous message is just too tempting to troll with if you have no real info or if you are neutral/evil.<br>
Priest now has the tools to reward good or punish bad confessions. Also, the person confessing is still hard pressed to do so anonymously, because <strong>If</strong> the Priest is converted to Unseen, giving your number away means almost certain dead. This makes this passive skill different from Prince and Psychic where the person giving the information is known.</p>
