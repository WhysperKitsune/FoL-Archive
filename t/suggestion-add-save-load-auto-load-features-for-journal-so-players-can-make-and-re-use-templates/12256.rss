    <title>[Suggestion] Add save, load &amp; auto-load features for journal so players can make and re-use templates</title>

    <description>I&#39;m sure most of us are familiar with setting up our journals D1/N1 with numbered lists, &#39;graphs&#39;, artwork the odd poetry -- what have you. If you&#39;re a frequent player of this game though, this can get a little tiresome.

So I suggest we get the ability to Save, Load Auto-load user made &#39;templates&#39; for our journals that are stored client side.

* Save - Saves your current journal contents to a file on your hard drive.
* Load - Load previously saved journals into your current journal in game.
* Auto-load [Checkbox] - Automatically loads the template that you have selected to load each time you begin a new game. Note: Requires you to choose a template with the Load option in order for it to work. 

Mockup of what it would look like using MS Paint and a screenshot. (It would look 100x better in game because the devs don&#39;t suck at drawing like me!):
