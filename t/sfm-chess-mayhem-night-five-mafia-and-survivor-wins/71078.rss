## [color=Orange] Introduction: [/color]

- Hello and welcome in another Forum Mafia game!

- At this time around, this gonna be a classic Mafia but...well of course not everything is that simple.

- Each player would represent a Chess Piece and they will be known to the public. For what reason? 
Since it&#39;s basically a closed setup, i left a hint that might help you to solve my Chess puzzle. :smiling_imp: 

###### Hosted by Twil1ght

## [color=Orange] Rules: [/color]

1. No gamethrowing.
2. No editing messages.
3. No private messaging with others in the game about the game.
4. Don&#39;t show your role card to anyone without permission from the Host.
5. Be active! After 24 hours you will be prodded and if you don&#39;t answer in 12 hours, you would be replaced/modkilled.
6. Don&#39;t spread toxicity. If you&#39;re upset or frustrated about something, please just hold it in yourself instead of expressing negative emotions by typing it in chat.
7. Most importantly have fun! After all this is why you&#39;re here.
8. Breaking any of those rules will be effective in a warming and next attempts would be follow up replacing out or by potential modkill.

## [color=Orange] Gameplay: [/color]

- Days will be 3 IRL days long or shorter if someone would be lynched.
- Nights will be 1 IRL day long.
- Evils have a day and night chat.
- Idenities of all Chess Pieces are known to the public.
- This game has a balanced number of Town roles and Non-Town roles. There is always Mafia in game!
- Mafia have a factional kill that they can do along with other action if they have one.

## [color=Orange] Executions: [/color]

- To accuse someone say “/lynch [player]” or “/vote [player]”.
- If a player gets enough votes they would be lynched immediately and end the day.

## [color=Orange] Deathnotes and Journals: [/color]
- There are allowed. The latest sended Journal would appear after you die.

## [color=Orange] How to Join: [/color]

- Just say something like &quot;/join&quot;, &quot;in&quot; or whatever you want to express your interest in joining.

## [color=Orange] Role Cards: [/color]

            <p>The CC’ing totally cleared Captain as town for me though. I thought that was a good move. Rolling 4 town offensives is also really unheard of to me, but I guess things like that can happen.</p>

            <p>I redirected you as I was suspicious of your entire behavior towards Sam as you seemed far too confident such a scummy player would flip town, and I was correct. And again, my analysis was correct that Marl bussed Unknown once I rechecked his wagon d3.  My play was proper as I focused on intentions and motivations while the rest of the town focused only on results, which is why they fell for the bussing and turned on me for mislynching a scummy townie, along with excessive focus on mechanics which is why the morons here thought CCing in a closed setup was a good idea.</p>

            <p>But, thats not the main reason why i got you myslynched. Your general D1 behaviour, plus how you kinda buddied with Marl, then said he had bussed unknown (Which both me and him did) and i used that to say you were trying to distance yourself from him, trying to make your self look more town (Which you were and trying to do). Plus i claimed a Town protective, and you stated that you redirected me, which also helped further doubt with people, because Maxi died that night, due to claiming an investigative role. Your pushes werent the reason you died, your actions and behaviour was the reason you got myslynched, along with a Maf DV.</p>

            <p>Yes, because I pushed hard against 2 scummy players, M and Sam, I totally am scum. Claiming a player is scummy because they pushed on the mislynch of a completely scummy player is just braindead town play.</p>
