    <title>Class: Nepotist (The Black Rose Fool)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-nepotist-the-black-rose-fool/202</link>
    <description>So I was thinking perhaps a class that embodied loyalty in it&#39;s darkest sense. Should he be killed in the day phase he would be only able to kill a blue dragon who voted for him. Now here&#39;s where the abilities get a little wierd.

1. He will be able to rewrite a persons log book but he MUST include the letters of the mastermind&#39;s name within the rewrite. This will create a dangerous ability that will require strategy and good writing to incorporate.

2. If killed in the day phase he will be able to kill one member of the blue dragon who voted against him but only the blue dragon. He also has the opportunity not to kill anyone.

3. His role will show as a regular Black rose member unless investigated,

4. If a Black rose member dies the previous day all sentences will incorporate one random word into their speech everytime they try to speak for the following day.

Obviously this sort of stuff may be a little weird and I have no experience writing roles for this game but maybe some of the ideas here would be useful XD</description>

            <p>It means he will show up as another class type of the black rose if investigated by a class that can determine exactly what he is.</p>
