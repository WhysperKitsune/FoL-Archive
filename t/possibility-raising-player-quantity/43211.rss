    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possibility-raising-player-quantity/43211</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking on the idea of reducing PoE possibilities, one thing that comes to mind is maybe making non-uniques go up to 3ish, and raising the amount of players in a game. Origionally this was probably a no-go during the times when it took minutes rather than seconds for a game to start, but lately I haven&#39;t seen a game take more than 20 seconds to start, it could be an option to consider. It would greatly reduce the odds of say claiming CW and 2 CW dying etc...

of course the real drawback might be game legnths increasing as well. So there&#39;s more thought to it there. This may fall more to a discussion than a suggestion, as I&#39;m currious what others think on the idea, and how the class list would be rebalanced if such were there. One of the huge perks of the way ToL is designed, is that graphically there isn&#39;t an art/asset problem that would come from changing the quantity of players at a table (hence why we were able to get 16 without issue).</description>

            <p>I would rather prefer 24 player games with both Cult and Unseen rather than NK if you know what I mean, although having 1 NK in 24 wouldn’t be too bad</p>

1 Prince<br>
1 Mastermind<br>
1 Assassin<br>
1 Cult Leader<br>
1 Seeker/Invoker/Ritualist<br>

            <p>For the record (assuming a good/Neut king and 1 good Neutral) if all of the scum play perfectly it would take 4 nights to kill everyone and 3 to get majority. Even then it would not be a win for them because of each other.</p>

            <p>indeed hence why I refrenced it in the last line of the post, and it was indeed a great change that improved balance significantly. in it’s time that also pretty much was the maximum we could hope for, as 15-16 man games still took at least 3-5 minutes to start back then. Now based on the rate of joining I’m seeing most the time, a 30 man game could be filled in under a minute (I’m not saying a 30 man game is a good idea), I’m more just pointing out that with the game’s current state. how fun it is AFTER the game starts is the only portion to worry about, which was not something that was on the table when 16 man games were the choice.</p>

            <p>That’s where I figured discussion could be opened to, Thinking like 20-21. Of course the harder part is balancing duration of the game etc… hence why I was more trying to open the discussion rather than make a solid decleration of how it should be.</p>

            <p>I’d personally think this would be a great idea if paired with a multiball gamemode. I’m obviously not the first to suggest that but I think the 3 class maximum would help with that mode.</p>
