    <description>We dont need to have a full palate (although that would be cool) but it would be really cool to at least have Purple, blue, and white.  I&#39;d like to be able to rep my alliance when i&#39;m BD or Unseen.  It feels weird making a black and red Prince DN.  I want a regal blue and white one.  make new colors buyable with gold or unlockable.  like 100 wins with unseen unlocks purple and 100 wins with BD unlocks white and 300 wins with bd unlocks blue or something like that.</description>

            <p>Agree, I think its a good idea to have colors to buy with gold (or games played) <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

            <p>Unlocking colors for games played is a neat idea.</p>
