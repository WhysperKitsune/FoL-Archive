            <p>Inquisitor and Sorcerer games are now fun to play! They both seems really balanced right now <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It was a good change.</p>
<p>I only wish that you would inform about these changes a bit better, because it is big change in balance and this is still patch 0.1.10.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/akabane">@Akabane</a> Yeah I feel the same way, despite I haven’t seeing lot of action of Inquisitors lately but the theory how this class will be played is exactly the problem I am seeing, the winning condition of the Inquisitor is to kill the sorcerer and that’s fine except they have nothing else to do.</p>

            <p>I think Hunter is ok. It is an Unique class and Bear has limited uses. I actually like it a lot.</p>
<p>Now the Mastermind, Sorcerer and Possessor have to pay attention because they are not completely safe to do whatever they want at night.</p>

            <p>I thought it was just a bug fix.  Before this patch Hunter bears would let the Hunter die (and maybe even be converted).<br>
They’d kill attackers, but the Hunter would still die.  It also stripped Night Immunity from everyone who visited.  It was strange.</p>

            <p>Honestly I think that more people should be worrying about the Hunter change.</p>
<p>Before if you were Reaper with 5 souls you could gather darkness and safely kill the hunter. If you were unseen you could use your enforcer’s 1 time use ability to trade blows with the hunter (sometimes a good idea). Now both of these will fail and that isn’t a good thing.</p>
<p>To be honest I don’t like ANY of the changes in this patch. Allies is a problem again, noble is gone, CW is impassable to claim cuz a CC will kill you. 2 Psychics can get really confusing and is unfair for the Poss. Plus the fact that 2 psychics can instantly confirm each other through the dead.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Alright, so I’m no expert game designer, but I’d like to discuss “Allies” just a bit.</p>
<p>So as it currently stands, “Allies” is probably the strongest ability in the game. It instantly can check a player’s faction, which is only matched by Observer. King also has twice the charges to observer. This is obviously incredibly strong, and can mean the lose condition for a Neutral is just “be checked by the King”. However this isn’t exactly the case. This is more how the meta has evolved around the King and the “Neuts out” meta. Kings also had to be concerned with potential fool executions and killing alchs who typically side with the King no matter what. And this has rarely been a problem for Unseen/Cult, as they can convert players to regrow, and already deal with Sheriffs/Paladins.</p>
<p>The recent change to “Allies” made it so King could only detect Royal Blood. The major problem with this ability is that it’s incredibly underwhelming.You can confirm Drunk/Princess claims, but that’s about all this ability was useful for. And I think given time, this ability would have been completely useless, as neutral/evil roles would start claiming not royal roles as to not be found out. Drunk claims are already impossible with the new changes to Drunk anyway. And the other problem is that with this version of “Allies” I can only see the King meta evolving two ways. Either you kill off the king d2 and try to put up a person sooner to have a confirmed BD King or the King never dies because no one cares about the King. Yes “Point the Finger” is really strong late game, but as it currently stands, everyone can just ignore the King, and the King has literally nothing to do except watch the game unfold and figure out who is Royal. Maybe I’m wrong about this, but everything about this version of “Allies” seemed to make King go the way of Noble: being really boring.</p>
<p>So as it stands, I think strong “Allies” is better than the Royal version. I saw a suggestion earlier saying Neuts should show up as Not Evil, along with BD, which I’m unsure of, because that basically turns King into a Sheriff/Paladin with limited checks. I really do think a powerful King is much better for this game, but obviously that’s personal opinion. I’m excited to see how this gets expanded.</p>

            <p>It is supposed to be a nerf, to make the King less about investigation. But not as big a nerf as the initial Royal Blood ability was.</p>
<p>I think 4 uses is a good amount. It should most definitely <em>not</em> transfer to any new kings. This makes the initial king too disposable. And it would make the king about investigations for the entire game, which is not the intent at all.</p>

<p>No. Allies buffs the King to increase their survivability- makes BD think twice about executing a potential investigator. Kings who step up should <strong>not</strong> get that one. At least not with full power.</p>

            <p><strong>Edit:  Thanks for the update that gives Inquis only limited night immunity, going to test out that change, so the below is no longer current.  Left for the record.</strong></p>
<p>Just wanted to talk a bit about about a common and frustrating end game state in Sorc / Inquisitor games.</p>
<p><em>Yeah it has been said already, the inquis is far too easy to win and there is little counterplay available for the sorc, but this post isn’t really about that.</em></p>
<p><strong>My issue is that the inquisitor has far too much influence on who wins a game.</strong>  I frequently arrive at end game states in sorc/inquis games where the remaining people are some permutation of: 1 king, 2 evil faction members and an inquisitor.  In such a situation the inquisitor is the deciding vote that determines the winning faction, and that doesn’t really feel right.  I don’t think this situation is quite the same as an alch left standing, since the alch has to survive to win and there are ways to eliminate or otherwise deal with an alch too strongly aligned to any faction.  The inquis on the other hand literally does not care and just arbitrarily decides who wins the game.</p>
<p>See, the problem is that most games will end with an inquisitor still alive.  They are very hard to kill, and both BD and evil factions have little incentive to execute an inquisitor once they are confirmed.  BD will always rather spend time finding evil and would never execute an inquis, and evil would look incredibly suspect trying to get a confirmed inquisitor executed.  Because of that, executing an inquisitor is not a viable option, they are almost always left alive at end game, with the only possible counter play being poison/bleed.</p>
<p>I think that one possible solution  is to not allow the inquisitor to accuse or vote once he has won the game.  It really feels like if MM + Assassin are left alive vs a king, the win should be Unseen’s – same deal with the cult.  As things currently stand, the only way to win with 100% certainty against a good king + inquis is to have a full roster of 3 members of unseen, it seems pretty ridiculous to expect that in order to have a win.</p>
<p>Perhaps once the inquisitor vs sorcerer balance itself is fixed, we will see less end games where the inquis is left standing, but as things are I think they have far too much influence on the outcome and should not be the deciding factor, it feels really wrong.</p>

<p>I’d rather see the King get a strong Social role, but that’s better than this</p>

            <p>There were tons of complaints in-game about the new ability. We cannot ignore that.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the faction check a bit more, mostly because Royal Blood does so little, it<br>
makes the King not feel very special anymore.</p>
<p>But I get it why the more veteran players dislike the strong investigative ability of the King.</p>
<p>What do you think of this suggestion for ‘Allies’? What if the King only considers other Noble people to be potential allies?<br>
It combines the old and the new.</p>
<p><strong>Allies</strong><br>
If a character has Royal Blood, discover what faction it belongs to.</p>
<p><em>Possible feedback:</em><br>
13 is a member of the Blue Dragon.<br>
13 is a member of the Cult!<br>
13 is a member of the Unseen!<br>
13 has no Royal Blood.</p>
<p>Framed targets would always show as Cult/Unseen.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t be opposed to giving Royal Allies more time in the wild, but I assume it got changed for a reason.</p>
<p>Noble… couldn’t be changed fast enough.  My first 2 games were both Noble and after being spammed insults and random crap from people I couldn’t report I never wanted to play the class again.</p>

            <p>I think we could reasonably change it into</p>
<p><strong>Betrayal Investigation</strong> (4 uses(starting King)/1 use(other King)):Anyone who attacked someone protected by your guards will be classified as traitor .Starting King:Attacks under possession are ignored, converted Blue Dragon will show up as traitors.</p>
<p>That is still high power, but you have to deal with the starting evils being hidden(unless they attack you), and a new king will have a seriously crippled ability.</p>

            <p>While i think its amazing how the balance team is so active and listens to community feed back i don’t think you guys should be caving in when people bitch about things they don’t know about. The king being able to instantly out 4 people on top of being impossible to kill early in the game is a terrible combination that made playing neutrals and evils really bad. Being able to find royals may not have been the most exciting thing but it was a step in the right direction.</p>

            <p>^ solid post as always, Moxie.</p>
<p>This is the core issue. Everyone needs to read your post.</p>
<p>We should have let the Royal Blood ability settle first. I personally didn’t even get a chance to try it out before it changed back again.</p>
<p>Patches and tweaks are welcome, but when they come so frequently that the dust doesn’t even settle, it gives no reliable feedback or indication of effectiveness. Patches need to slow down.</p>

            <p>So, the Allies thing…</p>
<p>This is really difficult to balance.  The starting King has a higher probability to be Evil than a random member of court.  Because of this, the starting king needs an ability powerful enough for BD to feel that risk is worth it.  But, it can’t be so powerful it’s leading to BD sitting back and expecting the King to carry the game for them, nor so powerful that the King’s alignment determines games by itself. We also don’t want the NK meta to be “Kill King N1” every game, like it was.</p>
<p>That’s a really hard thing to balance, and it’s probably going to take a lot of experimentation to find the sweet spot.  Because of this, I don’t necessarily have an opinion on if Royal Blood allies or the current Allies is better, but rather I think things are changing far too quickly.  I felt the same way about the Priest, getting multiple patchs and then removed in the span of a week.  It takes a lot of time for changes to sink in and for the community to react, and the King is even moreso effected by the playerbases’ attitude. They need time to digest the changes.  I don’t really think we got a fair showing of if Royal Blood checks was really a good thing or not.</p>
