    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Pretender</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-pretender/27627</link>
    <description>New version!

**The Claimant : Neutral Offensive**

Goal : **Become the King.** Once you have become King, your class is changed to the **Foreign King**.

The Claimant is a foreign noble seeking to extend his influence over our Kingdom, and has already married into the royal family. He is now trying to climb the throne itself.

Passive Ability : **Royal Marriage** : If no royal steps up to become King upon his death, you will immediately become the new King. **Once King, all Royal Blood courtiers, excluding Cult Leader, will lose all of their abilities!** (This is a deterrent to &quot;just let the neutral get king, whatever&quot; that used to happen with neutral killers. You REALLY want the Claimant dead.)

Active Ability : **Investigate Legitimacy** : Check if the target is of Royal Blood and occupy them. Infinite uses.
(does not bypass immunity)

Active Ability : **Forge a Claim** :  If your target is of Royal Blood, they will no longer be able to step up as a royal blood on a king&#39;s death. If they are not (Court wizard!), reveal to the court at day that there&#39;s a Claimant in the game. Your identity will stay concealed. Infinite uses.

Day Ability : **Hire a Guard** : You will be immune to death and occupation tonight. 3 uses.

Day Ability : **Hire an Assassin** : The King will be killed tonight unless healed or protected. You will not visit the King. 1 use. (Maybe two?)

**The Foreign King**

The Foreign King cares little for the internal politics of the realm.

Goal : **Has already won the game.**

Same abilities as a regular king. Cannot be spawned as the starting King and will not be revealed as foreign until his death, similar to the psycho king.





(Old version here)

**Pretender : Neutral Offensive** (Unique, can spawn with a &quot;real&quot; neutral killer)

Goal : **Become the King.** (Once you are elected, you will become a Neutral King, but you will already have won, you do not need to survive to the end.)

The Pretender is of royal descent but never got to sit on the Throne, and he&#39;ll be damned if he won&#39;t before his end!

**Passive Ability : Royal Blood :**  As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. 

**Passive Ability : Loyal Guards :** Immune to death, occupation, and conversion at night.

**Active Ability : Investigate Legitimacy, infinite uses :** Check if your target is of Royal Blood.

**Active Ability : Plot to Murder, infinite uses :** If your target is of Royal Blood or is the King, you will kill them. Does not count as a visit. If your target lives for any reason, they will know who attempted to murder them!

Your strategy should be to find and eliminate all other Royal Blood courtiers so that you may climb the throne unopposed. You may also want to be an active &quot;blue dragon&quot; member, so that your fake drunk or princess claim can appear more legitimate. Be careful though, any failed assassinations will likely result in you being outed and promptly executed!</description>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions! (you and others aswell). Reason I went with neutral offensive is because I did not want the Pretender to replace the NK (reaper, poss, etc) on the role list. I’ll think it over and might edit a new version later on! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I like this idea for the most part. I think you could come up with a more interesting name.</p>
<p>Also though, it’s kind of a Neutral Killer. Since you’re able to directly kill up to a handful of players. Offensive classes don’t kill directly. I think instead of killing them you should be maybe blocking them from being able to step up as King at all, or something to that effect. It’s more of a disruptive ability that aids your goal, rather than just an attack.</p>

            <p>You should replace Royal blood. As is you can win too easily. Make the passive: If you step up you automatically become king.</p>
<p>But since you are not royal you need to kill those that are.</p>

            <p>Hey! A Neutral Offensive! We need that!</p>
<p>Allow me to share my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s a cool goal, but since we’re in this hype about the Psycho King, why not make Pretender become the “Fake King”. His only ability could be a few uses of Hide. If that became a thing, Fool and Scorned could follow that route as well, after they’ve succeeded in their goals. Having already won would be a requirement and a passive in those classes. Something along the lines of <strong>Passive Ability - Lottery Winner: After meeting your win condition, you are allowed to step up on king nominations.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Royal Blood is required of course. Loyal Guards seems a “bit” too much. Make it immune to conversion and that’s it. Maybe change the name to Loyal to the Cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding his night abilities: How is he an offensive class and not a killer, if his second ability literally kills? My suggestion is making his day ability a poison/bleed. His night abilities would then be to occupy whoever visits the target (could be king, but this ability would need to have a very short number of uses) and your suggestion of finding Royal Blood.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think? Hope I helped strengthen your idea! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
