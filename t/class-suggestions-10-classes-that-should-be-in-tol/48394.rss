            <p>I mean i definitely feel that its very clear cut. If you are princess you go to seeker, paladin to seeker, I think there needs to be more diversity and this is why I feel there needs to be more classes for the cult.</p>

            <p>Eh, having few classes is the Cult’s thing.</p>
<p>It would be cool if they each had individual classes, like the Unseen, but adding extra classes seems arbitrary.</p>
<p>Also how would you know who converted to what?</p>

            <p>I think that the cult should have more classes. Additionally, maybe 2 investigative classes, instead of the seeker, 2 support classes, instead of the ritualist, 2 social classes instead of the apostle, 1 killer class and 1 offensive class instead of invoker.</p>

<p>Knight can do this while not having to die, although he does commit suicide on a wrong guess. But you can kill a Blue Dragon like this, and will unless you know someone is evil, but then the Court could just execute them.</p>

<p><strong><font color="steblue">Blue Dragon Killer</font></strong><br>

<strong>Trap of Arrows (Night)</strong>- Poison all visitors. 2 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to Eliminate the Unseen, The Cult, and any Neutrals who stand against you</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately , i couldn’t find a way to incorporate your original idea into this without it being Knight 2.0.<br>
Please understand.<br>
However: I had an easier time with the conversion:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="purple">The Sharpshooter</font></h2>
<p><strong><font color="purple">Unseen Support</font></strong><br>
<strong>Arrow to the Knee (Night)-</strong> The next time the Assassin kills, it will not count as a visit. 2 uses.<br>
<strong>Takeover (Night)-</strong> Visit the target the Assassin is going to for him. 2 uses<br>
Your objective is to Eliminate the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who stand against you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kept the idea of a non-visiting assassin, but i felt Barriered up was unnecessary , and Shootout a bit too strong.</p>
<p>I’ll do more in the future i guess</p>
<p>Also this is in general</p>

            <p>Actually, not exactly copying. Lookout is not like CW. It’s like a walking Princess, that can send visits of somebody to somebody else. But the conversion, you can know who visits.</p>
<p>Witch is kind of like ToS witch, but it’s kind of needed, to cause chaos.</p>
<p>Scientist is actually good, because you can test somebody to see if they are immune, but can get wrong results, from a King guard, or an Alchemist stone skinning.</p>
<p>Pyromaniac is not a ToS Arsonist. ToS Arsonist can ignite whenever they want. Which Pyromaniac can’t, they automatically ignite whenever everybody is doused.</p>

            <p>Knight: We already have Knight. This is a ToS vigilante. As for converted form, Unseen Killing is a bad idea besides Assassin or a neutral convert.</p>
<p>Priest: ToS Retributionist. We already had this, but it was removed. Besides reviving is a bad idea. Also the converted abilities are weird and random.</p>
<p>Scientist is a limited use Sheriff who can find NKs. We already have Sheriff.</p>
<p>Gravedigger I think is okay. Witch is ToS witch.</p>
<p>Lookout is a Court Wizard without barrier, not an investigative.</p>
<p>Pyromaniac is ToS arsonist.</p>
<p>Most of this stuff is copying ToS.</p>
