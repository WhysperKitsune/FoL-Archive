    <title>[DONE] Throneoflies.com may be &quot;weird&quot; for 1-2 days as we test new server</title>

    <description>We like cutting-edge features. The good stuff.

To get the good stuff, we need to move servers so that we can offer more to you guys! Such as faster page loading and future features such as synchronized stats, etc etc. You get the picture ;)

Apologies for the inconvenience! Hopefully shouldn&#39;t effect anyone as most tests last only a few minutes at a time, then back to normal.</description>
