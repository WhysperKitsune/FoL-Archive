    <title>[FM] Poker Mafia Class cards</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/fm-poker-mafia-class-cards/60461</link>
    <description>I made some changes to poker mafia classes for future poker mafia games.
Differences from the first poker mafia classes:

* All classes are able to get abilities from the pool.
* Townies and mafiosos will be able to choose a gift at the start of the game (see below for the gifts they can choose from).
* Most gambling events have been removed and replaced with the &quot;Roulette&quot;. 
* There are still daily events, but they no longer involve gambling (see the events section for more information).
* All classes can use more than one day or night abilities, but they must pay 3 tokens for every extra ability besides the first one. (You can&#39;t use the same ability multiple times).
* Godfather no longer needs to use tokens to kill.
* Godfather no longer buys abilities for his mafiosos, he buys them for himself.
* There are 8 different ability types: Support, Offensive, Social, Investigative, Killing, Gambling, Passive and Scum. There are also certain classes with starting abilities. These abilities will appear as &quot;Special&quot; to investigators.

**Available gifts:** 
&gt;* **Abilty gift**: Start the game with a random, non-golden ability.
&gt;* **Token gift:** Start the game with 3 extra tokens.
&gt;* **Golden gift:** Start the game with a Golden ticket. At the start of the game, one person with a golden ticket will be selected at random and get a free Golden ability. (Golden abilities are powerful one-shot abilities).

**The Roulette**
Gambling related events have been replaced with the roulette. The roulette is available all days and offers you the chance to buy tickets for it. There is no limit on the amount of tickets you can buy every day. The roulette lasts for the first 24 hours of the day. Each ticket costs 1 token.

**Available tickets:**
&gt; **Common tickets:** These are used to bet on the results of the roulette. All 3 common tickets are available every day.
&gt; * **Color ticket:** Pick red or black. If you are right you win 2 tokens.
&gt; * **Number ticket:** Pick a number between 1-3. If you are right you win 3 tokens.
&gt; * **Full ticket:** Pick a number between 1-3 and a color. If both are right you win 6 tokens.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rare tickets**: Out of everyone that buys these tickets, only 1 of them will get a price. Only 1 of these will be available each day.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Jackpot ticket**: Every token used to buy tickets from the roulette will be added to the jackpot (roulette tokens count as normal tokens for this purpose). The winner ticket will get all the money in the jackpot.
&gt; * **Golden ticket**: The winner ticket will get a golden ability.
&gt; * **Special ticket**: The winner ticket will get a special token.

**Selling abilities:**
The way selling an ability works has been changed. You can now choose an ability to sell and it will go back into the ability pool. People will be able to bid for said ability like normal, but the tokens from the highest bid will go towards the seller.

Class cards:

<p>Btw just realized that mafia does have a niche use for this ability, which is to kill town sided neuts without wasting the Godfather‚Äôs attack.</p>

            <p>What do you guys think about this change?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Selling abilities:</strong><br>
The way selling an ability works has been changed. You can now choose an ability to sell and it will go back into the ability pool. People will be able to bid for said ability like normal, but the highest bid will go towards the seller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically instead of getting a fixed amount of tokens for selling an ability you would get the tokens from the highest bid.</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt want to completely remove faction-specific abilities, but I do want to reward people that spend their tokens denying abilities to their enemies instead of getting abilities from themselves. If reroll isn‚Äôt the best solution, I‚Äôll try to think of another way to do it.<br>
I tried to do this in the first poker mafia with the ability to sell your abilities back, but no one seemed to use that feature except for the neutral killer, who had the ability to see all bids as they happened.</p>

            <p>Of course, people still have the choice of selling abilities for tokens, but the advantage of reroll is that you get a new ability immediately and the old ability doesn‚Äôt go back to the pool.</p>

            <p>While that would solve the problem it might cause problem if either X was too high on those niche ability‚Äôs or if it was too low on all of the other ones. Maybe make X dependent on the ability and have it give you another ability of the same value?</p>

<p><strong>Reroll:</strong> Whenever you get a new ability, you can pay tokens to change it for a random one.</p>
