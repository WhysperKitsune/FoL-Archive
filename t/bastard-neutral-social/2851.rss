            <p>I don’t want a neutral king because that would make the class borring. A king varrient that only wins with evils and neutral killers would work just fine though.</p>

            <p>Neutral evil is a neutral that generally has the goal of " survive to see the Blue Dragon fall" and as such they have to work with evils to see their goal reached, but they are still technically neutral.</p>

            <p>I honestly don’t see why a neutral role shouldn’t be able to be evil latter on. Ever played as the witch is ToS? That is one of my favorite roles because they give the evils an Ally that they don’t know about. Would you prefer I made a separate alignment just for this case?</p>

            <p>How about,  make it neutral evil, and make the king a special neutral evil king? That way it’s technically neutral, but still shares similar enough goals to evil to count in them as an ally</p>

<p>I still stand by: If you make a neutral class it should stay neutral no matter what. Making it an evil King would be disastrous.</p>

            <p>The reason it is neutral is because the rules of the game make it hard to work in as an evil. Remember why I suggested this role in the first place.</p>
<p>A: to put more pressure on the king at the start.</p>
<p>B: to put more pressure on a noble king later on.</p>
<p>C: to make the evils less likely to kill a new king that they didn’t choose.</p>
<p>That last one means that they can’t meet with the evils.</p>

            <p>They might not help, but they can win with the BD. Their target is not to win with the evils, they just want their targets or themselves executed. BD still has chances.</p>

<p>I would agree, but 2 reasons that I think it would be pretty balanced.</p>
<ol>
<li>He has tools at his disposal to overthrow the king, whos alginment can be one of 3 (obviously)</li>
<li>Once he is king, he will be a 100% confirmed Neutral King. He could confirm himself through his messages he sent earlier. This would lead to him not having the same ambiguity of what side hes on. You would not have to worry about him being “good or evil” depending on what side you’re on.</li>

<p>This is not needed for 2 reasons. 1) Neutrals don’t need investigative abilities and 2) since your goal is to kill the King and take his position why would you wanna know his faction? You are gonna kill him anyway lol It’s not like you’re not gonna kill him if he’s BD or something.</p>

            <p>The thing is a neutral class is supposed to be neutral. So making the class win with the evils is not a neutral class. Simple as that. It doesn’t work like this. It will either be neutral or evil, it can’t be both lol</p>

            <p>I’m taking all ideas that have been discussed in this post and compiling them into what I think this should look like.</p>
<h1>The Heir</h1>
<p><strong>Neutral Social</strong></p>
<p>Goal: Become the King and survive to the end</p>
<p>Passive 1: Royal Blood</p>
<ul>
<li>Can step up as royalty. If voted up you will become Neutral King</li>
</ul>
<p>Passive 2: Strong Will</p>
<ul>
<li>Night Immune once</li>
</ul>
<p>Day Ability: Private Matters (unlimited)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your next whisper is anonymous and silent to others</li>
<li>Your message will appear to your recipient as being from “The Heir”</li>
</ul>
<p>Night Ability: Plot to Overthrow (2-3 charge)</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain an extra vote towards the current king only the following day</li>
</ul>
<p>Lore: The Kings bastard son who seeks to claim the throne that is rightfully his</p>
<p>Potential Edit: You could swap his day and night ability. Since the message is something you could send at night (like a private Noble message) you could do that, then have the day ability to the “overthrow” mechanic, similar to what the king himself has… that might feel better.</p>
<p>I originally loved the idea of him becoming an Evil King… but this would cause too many problems. Once people are getting messages from this “Bastard/ Heir” then they would immediately know this class is in the game (since no-one else can whisper like that) and all Blue Dragon would be skeptical of anyone voted up to be king that has not confirmed themselves as another role.<br>
Him being Neutral feels a lot better from a gameplay perspective and you would be doing everything in your power (using goods and evils) to overthrow you father and become king. That doesn’t need to have an “Evil” theme to it, and once you are king, you can now just try and survive as a Neutral King.<br>
This is one of my favorite class ideas, good job man. Lots of great feedback from the community too.</p>

            <p>What exactly do you mean? Did you try out the class in FoL or just a similar class? What went wrong and is it something that can be fixed?</p>
