    <title>Wrongful Ban Appeal</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/wrongful-ban-appeal/24495</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve only had the game for about a month and have only played maybe 5 games and I log in tonight to see I&#39;m banned for &quot;pr0n spammer&quot;?  I followed the link and it&#39;s just a picture of someone spamming some website in game?  It doesn&#39;t have my account name in the screenshot or anything.

I don&#39;t know if my account was hacked (Steam didn&#39;t notify me of any suspicious logins) or if there is some bug or if I got wrongly caught up in some automated ban system but something isn&#39;t right.  

Could you look into it please?  My account is Myrkur(login screen), or sometimes I see it as Myrkur300 in chats?</description>

            <p>nah, if there was - he would’ve been using system chat instead of just private messages and only while he was alive. It was just a human. We thought we caught the spammer, but he just ended up being sneaky so we accidentally autobanned more accounts than intended</p>
<p>TL;DR: False positives <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> sorry about that!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the speedy reply!  Really appreciated.</p>
<p>I was able to log in just now.  Was it really my account that spammed that?  Is there other way into the game account than through steam?</p>
