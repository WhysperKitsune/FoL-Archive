    <description>Having a bad day as MM? Sheriff surveilled your assassin and the Blue Dragon is getting him drunk every night or slamming him in the cell? Well fear not anymore Unseen! Here comes a rework straight from the history books!

&gt; **Backstab** (D) (2)
You offer a member of the unseen the option of taking their own life. If they accept, they will bleed to death tonight if not healed. A use is only spent if accepted. Usable once per day. 

As a bonus you can now fake claim EVEN MORE classes! What a time to be the Mastermind!

Feedback Appreciated

            <p>I agree with this. This should also work for the MM themselves early on in the event that they’re found and BD is intentionally keeping them alive until the time for the Assassin to step up passes. Also allows Unseen members to fake claim Knight or Hunter depending on circumstances.</p>
