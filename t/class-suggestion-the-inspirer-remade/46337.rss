_**Name - Inspirer**_
**Faction - neutral** 
**Win condition - survive until the end**

**Passive 1** - My bright side - inspire anyone who visits you, healing them the night they visit you_

**Day Ability 1**- True to your Kingdom - make a player conversion immune{1}_

**Day Ability 2** - Hideout - have your followers meet you in a meeting tonight(simialar to cult\unseen meetings){2 uses}_

**Night Ability 1** - Convincing argument - Make a player realize that everyone should live together in harmony.(Convert a player into a neutral of their class, with one goal to protect the inspirer){2 uses}_

_Ex. If a Noble is converted Neutral then the Noble will keep all of his day and night ability but his win condition will change. He will also appear Neutral from there on out._

**Night ability 2** - Pep talk - Convince your followers that they are unstoppable. Make your concerted followers death immune and occupy immune for the night. {2 uses}

The plan here was to make a Neutral that can convert and also have an impact on the game

Notes: I realize that there is no real reason to try to harm the Inspire as he is a neutral trying to live. Maybe making him Neutral evil and changing his win condition could possible help make this an interesting class. Read below for my alternate idea for this class





_**Name - Inspirer**_
**Faction - neutral evil** 
**Win condition - survive To see the BD fall**

**Passive 1** - My bright side - inspire any evil class who visits you, instantly healing them 

**Day Ability 1**- True to your Kingdom - make a player permanently death immune{1}_

**Day Ability 2** - Hideout - have your followers and unseen/cult meet you in a meeting tonight {2 uses}_

**Night Ability 1** - Convincing argument - Make a player realize that everyone should live together in harmony.(Convert a player into a neutral of their class){2 uses} (if it fails then it will count as a use)

_Ex. If a Noble is converted Neutral then the Noble will keep all of his day and night ability but his win condition will change. He will also appear Neutral from there on out._

**Night ability 2** - Pep talk - Convince your followers that they are unstoppable. Make your concerted followers death immune and occupy immune for the night. {3 uses}</description>

            <p>First of all I know Neutral evil isn‚Äôt a thing but I don‚Äôt know the proper name for it.</p>
<p>Secondly if you are talking about the first one (Neutral offense) then yes he can convert unseen/cult. They still appear in the meetings and count as a member of unseen/cult but will appear as neutral and his win condition is changed to keep the inspirer alive.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre talking about the ‚ÄúNeutral EvilüòÇ‚Äù then no he can‚Äôt convert unseen/cult.</p>
<p>Edit: I‚Äôm still thinking of merc. Maybe his target will be Instantly switched to the inspirer or something along them lines. Looking for feedback about that.</p>

            <p>Neutral Evil isn‚Äôt a thing <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Seems pretty hostile, as it takes away BD resources to protect you. Also why does it need to grant conversion immunity? For the second one permanent death immunity is a powerful thing to give.</p>
<p>Can you steal Cult/Unseen/Other Neutrals? Can Unseen/Cult steal from you?</p>

            <p>Which do you think is a better fit for this class. Neutral offense(the class above suggestion) or Neutral Evil(the bottom class suggestion)?</p>
