    <title>Possible Inqu rework(no more mini NK)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possible-inqu-rework-no-more-mini-nk/74028</link>
    <description>Okay before you type in the comments...YES! I did post something like this before in the forums. It was called the detective. I will delete that one soon. 
 
This is a rework on the inqu since I hear many people in game say how inqu is just a mini NK. This version of inqu allows for him to be a invest class but is not completely randomized on the targets. This also helps from you randomly becoming a heathen due to RNG. Tgis also helps prevent you randomly dying in game from inqu, which is not fun. 

This inqu also can side with evil or BD. Or Evan stay solo killing your targets. 


&gt;# Inquisitor 
Neut
Invest

&gt;[color=yellow]Passive 1;[/color]
[color=Brown]Holy blessings -[/color] You are death immune once

&gt;[color=yellow]Day ability 1;[/color]
&gt;[color=Brown] Sixth Sense -[/color] Select a player, If your target can attack someone, then prevent them tonight and attack them [2 uses]‚Äù

&gt;[color=yellow]Day ability 2;[/color]
&gt;[color=Brown]Ruthless efficiency-[/color]  Your next attack will go through death Immunity _**[2 uses]**_ 

&gt;[color=yellow]Night ability 1;[/color]
&gt;[color=Brown]Quick Hunch  -[/color]  Select a player, Find out if they have attacked someone before or is attacking someone tonight. It will say they attacked someone even if the attack failed to kill. You will also prevent any invest classes from visiting this target_**[unlimited uses]**_
&gt;
&gt;[color=yellow]Night ability 2;[/color]
[color=Brown]Personal Business -[/color] Attack a player that you have found who attacked someone else _**[unlimited uses]**_

&gt;[color=yellow]Win Con - [/color] Kill 2 player that have successfully killed another player

NOTES:
If poss uses someone to kill than it will still count as poss killing someone not the person that was forced to attack for him. 


_**PLEASE READ THIS**_
Questions that you could answer for this class:

1 - will this be a good class to play along with in the game?
2 - will you have fun playing this class?
3 - do you think this class is too overpowered or too underpowered?
4 - do you think this class will change the game in a positive or negative way?

            <p>That still could work. Give it a decent kit around that and it could possibly be decent. Give me time to create one and than give me your opinion there</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt see it having potential. It is at best a check that can find NK and Assassin/CL, which is already less useful and less reliable compared to both Sheriff, Maid and Observer (Princess has a different use entirely but also has literally that ability)</p>

            <p>Or that could be an ability for Paladin or Sheriff rework. Since people don‚Äôt like hard counters than instead of checking if someone is unseen/Cult they can check if they have attacked someone or is attacking someone tonight.</p>
