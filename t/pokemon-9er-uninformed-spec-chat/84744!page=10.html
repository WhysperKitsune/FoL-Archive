    All of his townreads are pretty basic and just stating what we already know/want to hear, but for the most part i agree with them 
his scumread on gorta is fairly similar to yours and that’s a good sign imo. he also sussed gorta earlier in the game but presumably because he lacked confidence didn’t push him then. but at least now he’s learnt? 
as for my read on kiro

    First off - I think Kiro is a rolecop and if he did check me, then he knows I’m only able to track on odd-numbered nights. I was bluffing to force both Cloned and Kiro to out their actions first, but since Cloned turned up dead, I’m telling you guys this now. 
Now I want everyone to give their readlist. Please write if you think someone is individually scummy, and also write who you believe their wolf teammate could be. State your reasons as clearly as possible. Also, if I were a wolf, who would…

    YBW has been pushing on both gorta and kiro the entire game - he literally can’t be scum with either of them unless it was a 500 IQ distancing push on kiro because he knew that he could get away with throwing sus on kiro without him actualy getting lynched, which until now would be correct. But I really doubt this from a new player 


since at this point we almost 100% know Kiro is scum, and YBW has been scumreading kiro the most out of anyone the entire game, I’m pretty confident at this…

Gorta said he was going to trust Cloned over his own read on Silviu, and Worse jumped because he was unsure of what to believe.

Kiro, you did a good job of falsely leading us to townread you. It was a good play, at the risk of Cloned flipping town during the night. Your behavior as scum is more or less the same as your behavior as town, so I’ll keep that in mind for future reference. 
Gorta, you did a good job misleading us as well. Ultimately, it’s the lack of not only interacting with but also discussing Kiro’s place …

When they accused Wind I felt that he was not a mafia for some reason. He always trusted me and had some readings similar to mine. At the beginning of the game it seemed strange to me that cloned did not talk much and d…
