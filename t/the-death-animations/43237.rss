    <description>I&#39;m going to try to keep this short 

My idea is when there is a day time execution then two knights should hold down the player about to get executed. As of right now if you are executed during the morning then you just stand there and take it. If I was there, then I would be running my ass off trying to escape. 

I know this doesn&#39;t change the game at all and this is really really tiny detail but it&#39;s always funny when you know you&#39;re going to die but just stand there and do nothing. Tell me what you think.</description>
