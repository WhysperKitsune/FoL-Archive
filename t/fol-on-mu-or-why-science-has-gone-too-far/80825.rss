    <title>FoL on MU, or why science has gone too far</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fol-on-mu-or-why-science-has-gone-too-far/80825</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to be using this thread in order to compile every important fact about interactions in order to make sure an FoL game on MU could work.
There are several important things to define before I could consider posting it on there.
Namely:

- King Election
- Frames and their interactions
- Mind Warps and their interactions
- Promotion systems
- Action resolution system (I already have this nailed down)
- Abilities that don&#39;t work in MU (grand trial, most voting-based abilities, priest channel, warp reality)


I&#39;m considering changing every instance of unintuitive terminology to be more friendly to MU (ex occupy would instead be roleblock)


What I might need help on is picking up on potentially confusing things that I missed</description>
