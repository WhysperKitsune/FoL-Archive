**Critically acclaimed Bastard Mechanic Host, Celeste_Ludenberg has started the bastard to end all bastards... Camelot has risen, and soon it shall fall. For in the shadows, a faction of traitors await. None escape their sight for even Arthur is on their list.**

This game is **heavily** bastardized and is not appropriate for children under *three* years old. You have been forewarned. 
# Rules:
1. You must abide by the https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244?u=celeste_ludenberg. 
2. Respect the Host, other players, and the mod-errors that the Host produces.
3. No private messaging others in the game about the game.
4. No screenshotting, quoting, or any direct means of posting host messages from your classcard direct messaging without approval from the Host.
5. No gamethrowing. This includes any form of intent to make your faction lose. *I don‚Äôt care if you try to suicide unless you are evil.*
6. Refrain from posting 1000+ messages per day phase &amp; posting 5 messages in a row.
7. No editing messages. Period. 
8. Players are not allowed to use BigBoi text nor Celeste‚Äôs gradient mod colors.
9. You may not complain about how terrible the game is. ~~It hurts my feelings ;(~~
# Joining:
You may be wondering... ‚ÄúHow do I join this hellhole?‚Äù(Firekitten 17). Well, here is the problem. You can not join. Why? Because you are already in the game. Mention me with /join in bold, and you will be placed in the player list in under 24 hours! 

If the player list is full and the sign-up stage still hasn‚Äôt finished, you can still sign up! The more ~~slaves~~ err... I mean people, **YEAH** people, the merrier the game and the salt that fuels my madness.
# Gameplay
Days take up 3 Real-Life Days unless a lynch occurs. Night takes up 2 Real-Life Days.

# Executions
Executions are signified by a **/vote Player#** with a mention of the host. Ex. **/vote Player0 Celeste_Ludenberg** If you vote with a player‚Äôs name, it will be counted.
Executions are instantaneous. No trial. A majority is needed for each execution. Easy game. Easy life.
