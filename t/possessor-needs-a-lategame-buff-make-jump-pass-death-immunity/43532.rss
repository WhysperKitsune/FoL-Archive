    <title>Possessor needs a lategame buff, make jump pass death immunity</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-needs-a-lategame-buff-make-jump-pass-death-immunity/43532</link>
    <description>Right now, possessor can&#39;t really beat unseen in late game (can&#39;t kill mm, cant kill king)
And if bd is dominanting, they can just exe everyone but the king and win.

Possessor needs some kind of way to kill the death immune people.
I think make the jump pass death immunity makes sense.


Don&#39;t forget, reaper can win whenever there are 4 players left, sorc can win with unseen/cult, and only possessor can lose with 2 players left.


Update: due to the discussion here, my two suggestions are:
1)  Make Possess pass death immunity, can only kill MM after n5 or n6
2) Add a day ability that allow posessor to kill death immunity the next day. (2 use, can&#39;t be used before day 4 or 5)</description>

            <p>Tbh I think that Possess should bypass healing rather than immunity.</p>

            <p>Why not all? The only way it would affect anything is that it could kill Mastermind and Scorned. There’s no reason it should only pass temporary immunity.</p>

            <p>The value of immunity is not a problem. It’s there to protect from basic direct attacks, aka Assassinate, Eradicate, Reap, Puppet Strings, and Magic Missile.</p>
<p>The Neutral Killers should have a way to get around it (preferably a costly one, like Reaper’s souls), since they don’t have the votes like the Unseen/Cult has.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, I do think that there have been unforeseen side-effects to increasing the starting king’s guards to 6, and weakening the Possessor is one of them.  OTOH I’m dubious about giving too many people easy ways to go through immunity, since it can devalue immunity.</p>
<p>I still think the coolest buff for the Possessor would be to give him the “mimic” ability I suggested before, letting him use some abilities of the roles he possesses.</p>

            <p>Possessor’s win rate was half of reaper’s BEFORE he got buffed. I’d question that this remained the same after his heavy buffs. NK is also hard to play and hard to win with by design. You are supposed to have a harder time than a whole faction, because it is more fun if more people win than a single player.</p>
<p>And no, if you want to kill a balanced number of scum/BD, you do not completely cripple a faction by removing their head. The unseen have a very short lifespawn after the MM is dead. This is why if you’re a good reaper, you don’t immediately empower reap the MM the next night, if you find him early game.</p>

            <p>How it is harder to play? you can just get out with bad claims because you jump.</p>
<p>The reason is: Reaper can win the game with chills and reaps when there are 5-6 players left.<br>
with 3 players left and 1 reaped his win is guranteed unless there is a butler or prince. His only realy weakness is occupy, and he might be occupy immune in late game.</p>
<p>Posessor can’t even win 1 vs 1 against a king or mm.</p>
<p>It’s just game mechanic.</p>
<p>How many games you won as possessor compared to reaper?</p>

            <p>Possessor win rate might be lower than Reaper’s simply because Possessor is harder to play, not because he has less potential (I think he has more).</p>

            <p>He is right, but in order to kill a balanced number of scum/BD, you should be able to kill the unseen which spawns new unseen.</p>
<p>Reaper can,<br>
Sorc doesn’t need to,</p>
<p>Posessor win rate is half of reaper win rate because of that reason, and of course, the king who can use guards or prince who have 10 healers,  knights on him</p>

            <p>Yeah and as a NEUTRAL killer you should avoid that situation by killing a balanced number of scum/BD. Possessor can hear whispers so he has plenty of information to work with, including the previous logs of his jumps. You can also simply deduce the MM… that is what this game is about you know. If you’re outnumbered and they know your identity, YOU SHOULD LOSE. That is the balanced scenario.</p>
