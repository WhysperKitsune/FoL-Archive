    <title>Undo hits both sides of the log at once</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/undo-hits-both-sides-of-the-log-at-once/24487</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I typed some stuff in the left side of the log. I undid it (now that I know the key on Mac). It undid the left, but also erased the last change I made to the right.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Both sides of the log should be &quot;the log&quot; together for undos, and most recent one should update. Failing that, it should work only on the side your cursor is in.

#### Steps to reproduce:

1) Open log
2) type abc on left
3) type abc on right
4) Hit Ctrl-Z

Expected: right hand abc disappears, left stays
Actual: both disappear

#### Comments:

This is with latest .12 patch, but I&#39;ve seen it previously when all my player numbers disappeared from right, after having done a default log and then undoing a name mistake, and couldn&#39;t figure out why.</description>

            <p>It means orange agree’s with you that it should be fixed… normally this response is done in feature requests rather than bug fixes though <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I’m not actually sure what that means. Is that something I should do or a voting mechanism?</p>
