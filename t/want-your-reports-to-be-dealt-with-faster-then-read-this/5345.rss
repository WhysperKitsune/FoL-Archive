    <description>## Do you want a healthy comunity?
I believe everyone wants the community to stay healthy and that&#39;s why we have reports. However, there are some things **YOU** can do to help us keep the community clean. 

## How to help us serve justice faster?
We&#39;ve been getting a lot of reports lately and it is to be expected, but we would really appreciate if you could help us deal with them faster. Generic summaries really don&#39;t help us, most of the cases we have to read the logs of an **entire** game -which takes a lot more time than actually playing the game- to deal with a report since there is not enough information given. Please make our life easier and your reports will be dealt with faster too. A good summary lets us know what we&#39;re looking for.

## A really common example:
Worst case is **gamethrowing reports**. 9/10 people say &quot;`Gamethrowing`&quot; in the summary. That&#39;s _really_ not helpful at all. Try to give more specific information like &quot;`Outted the Cult as a Cultist`&quot;. It will only take couple more seconds of your life to do this, but it will save us a lot more, which also means the person will be punished faster, _considering they really are gamethrowing of course_.

I hope you help us! :smile:</description>
