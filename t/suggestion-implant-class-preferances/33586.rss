    <title>[Suggestion] implant class preferances</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-implant-class-preferances/33586</link>
    <description>Hi,

Ever got a class that you hated 3 times in a row? Ever got the sorcerer or Court Wizard  and threw the game because you hated it? Ever got bored of some of the classes simply because they are not fun or do not suit your interests at all?

If you answer yes to any of the questions, I present to you: CLASS PREFERENCES!!!

As stated by the name, I am hoping for ToL to allow players to choose their preferred classes they want to play in the main menu. It simply allows people to play more according to their strengths. Psychic is a good example, some people hated that class because its too much work or too boring while others like it because of its abilities to get logs AND exposing people while remaining secret. 

Specifically in my case, I like to play fool and NK (except sorc) . However, i rarely get those classes which makes the snek really sad :(. If i am able to choose what class  or classes I would prefer in the main menu, I would have a better game experience  as I am more likely to get fool or NK.

Keep in mind I said the words &quot;more likely&quot;. The system should increases the chances of getting your preferred classes and it is not meant to be a guarantee.  This is because of class limits. For example, if 2 players put prince as their preference,  the system would have to roll RNG and decide which player will get the prince. Similarly if 3 players put butler or other non-unique class as their preference. The system will not be perfect until the Devs can make all classes more or less equally fun *cough* looking at you CW *cough* . However, it will allow players to get their favourite classes more often and I would really suggest this system. It would be great if players can put more than 1 preferred class down, so if a player does not get to play prince which he likes, he can play as physician who he also likes. 

Other then that, good work on the game Devs. Keep up the good work!</description>

<p>It probably goes without saying, but this is against the rules so don’t do it. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
