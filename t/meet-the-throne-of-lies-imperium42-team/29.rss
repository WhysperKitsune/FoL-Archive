    <description>Hi,

My name is Dylan and I am the founder/developer of [Imperium42 Game Studio](http://www.imperium42.com) and our flagship title, [Throne of Lies](https://www.Throne-of-Lies.com).

I have been developing since the first version of HTML (Geocities, Angelfire.. whew ) and have been in love with it, ever since. Open source projects, contributions, and tinkering with Unity. Finally I decided that &quot;It&#39;s Time&quot; and put together this wonderful team to form this game I&#39;ve been dreaming about. 

I&#39;m from California, lived in Hawaii for quite a long time for college, met a Taiwanese girl and moved to Taiwan to learn Chinese and recently got married. We have a famous cat, Teemo :)

which is where our logo actually came from, believe it or not:

I enjoy swimming, surfing, billiards, puzzles, **and tv shows**. Breaking Bad, Battlestar Galactica, Dexter, **Oh yeah.**

**Games?** I play EverQuest (retired), CS:GO, Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, Shadowverse, and Hearthstone, mostly.

**EDIT:** And Overwatch ;)</description>

            <p>Hey guys, my name’s Stephen, but I use TeaHacker everywhere online. I loved tea, founded my online store where I sold my favorite tea leaves I’d get straight from China, and I enjoy coding, so yeah… TeaHacker.  Studied computer science and game design in college, even though I was a psychology major. Got into Game Design and Development about 5 years ago with Game Maker, then Unity 3D, and I’ve been learning Unreal Engine for the past year. Got hired by an Apple Design Award winning app studio called Tapity, here in Charlotte NC a bit over a year ago, to make an iOS and Android game in Unity. Once that project was complete, they switched me to Marketing, since I had 3 years of professional experience doing that at my previous job. We created our own crowdfunding site that got over $60,000 for our iOS app, Hours, which has been features on the app store as a main banner a few times. I’m considered "<br>
Technical PR" here at Throne of Lies, and I hope to grow our community and have a successful KickStarter. I enjoy games like StarCraft II, League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Super Meat Boy, Mount and Blade, Rocket League, Splatoon, and Overwatch. I’ve played a lot of board games similar to Throne of Lies, too. Let’s make this an exciting game and a big community of ToL players :3</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As the only girl on the team, I feel excited to work with these guys.<br>
My name is Elsa and I am the co-founder of Throne of Lies and Imperium42 who does little things from admin to HR.</p>
<p>To be honest, I never thought I would ever be in the gaming business. How can I say… It all started with love? I watched my boyfriend play video games for hours. Simply, just watch him, and it suddenly hit me that playing video games isn’t easy, and sometimes it’s not just about game: There are more to games than meets the eye, and it is even more difficult to develop one. After I finished my master’s degree in HR Mgmt in Hawaii, I moved back to my hometown: Taipei, where all the technological gadgets are produced. I found myself in the government trading business, being a worker in well-known tech companies, or working as project manager in university - even a translator. I still think there is more to life other than these types of jobs: More fun ways to do stuff. So I decided to support Dylan and the team to create a game which is both fun and allows multiple people to play together.</p>
<p>I wish everyone enjoys the game and, like me, might find more from the gamers’ world.</p>

            <p>I’m Boslof and I’m a developer for ToL. I made a game called <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=574041005" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Cinakra</a> last year. I also graduated from college about a year ago with a B.S. in Comp Sci. I’ve always wanted to develop games, so that’s what I’m trying to do.</p>
