    <title>Changing Mastermind</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/changing-mastermind/213</link>
    <description>Currently, the Evil faction has huge problems if the Assassin gets occupied.
Also, Mastermind is dead weight if nobody can be converted anymore.
I propose these abilities to be added to the Mastermind:
Ability: Backstab Type: Day. Uses:1 Description:Prepare to kill the Assassin at night instantly. They can be replaced, and the new assassin can kill that night.
(to depose occupied assassins)
Ability: Retire. Type:Day. Uses: 1 Description: Turn into Assassin. Only avaliable if there is no assassin.
(Last ditch try if you somehow survived all assassins and suddenly face only unconvertables)</description>

            <p>No, it sounds more like"I lost a game where the Prince kept my assassin locked down and I couldn’t convert anymore, and the Neutral Killer died Day 2 by King-reveal. They then locked down my assassin while the investigators looked for my conversion and myself. Due to the presence of healers, nightshade was useless. Their invests invested until they got us both, then we got killed."<br>
I was in a game where Prince jailed Assassin continuously from Day 1(no kills). Reaper was found by King N1. The other Unseen was found Night 3, then Prince told us not to execute them and to look for MM instead. I don’t need to tell you why they lost, do I?<br>
It is even worse for the Cult. If the Cult Leader gets locked down by prince it is game over no matter how good your play was(the solution there is simply to allow the CL to suicide)</p>

            <p>Is it possible that if you as Blue Dragon have managed to lock up the assassin and out lasted to the point where you only have the prince left ( maybe a DK too) , that just maybe you should have a good chance of winning without the MM being given a button to finally push through your last line of defense .</p>
<p>This sounds a lot to me like</p>
<p>" I lost a game where the  prince played really well and kept my assassin locked down and I kept missing my converts , please can you make it so I never lose again …"</p>

            <p>Probably not, that’s why it was one-use.<br>
Oh, and it probably should occupy the Mastermind at that night, if backstab is implemented. Otherwise, it could be used too offensively(Kill Assassin to enable both killing and converting that night-that would be too powerful)</p>

            <p>that’s why it has a 2-night cooldown to prevent it from being spammed so the mastermind can only prevent 1 attack and that assuming the mastermind is not prevented in some way from using his ability</p>
<p>anyway, the retire ability is just not needed if you lost all the other black rose members and you don’t have a killer since if no one is a killer the newest member becomes 1 and you know for sure that you can’t convert don’t forget it is a 1 night cooldown so that very lucky. then the blue dragon/neutral have clearly done a good job in destroying your effects now you lose no chance. that should be a part of the game not hey I am the killer haha lol you die now</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that that tactical thing would make Occupying nearly useless, backstabbing, on the other hand, has a serious drawback, which allows Mastermind to break an Occupation chain while Occupation would still be a weakness. You seem to have missed that part of Retire: [quote=“Unknown, post:1, topic:213”]<br>

            <p>I don’t think assassin players would like being killed by the mastermind very much even if its to make sure you can kill</p>
<p>and for the assassin being role blocked I have heard some really good ideas like tactical kills where everyone black rose members apart from the assassin of course get a night ability that if the assassin is role blocked they can use it to make sure he kills(probably a 2 night cooldown since mastermind and every other black rose class gets it but it costs there night action</p>
<p>anyway, the mastermind should not be able to become an assassin at will. I bet that will be used when you already have a full black rose team just to get more kills and that’s something that they don’t need</p>
