    <description>This category is for support with *Throne of Lies* or other Imperium42 products. Discord is better than this forum for support: https://discord.gg/tol

If you create a topic in this category, you will be given a template -- please use it so we can better/faster patch you up. If you don&#39;t use the template, a day or two may be wasted to ask common questions ;)

Please pretend you are us for a second by trying to include as much information as possible so we can fix your problem ASAP. A happy **you** is a happy **us** &lt;3</description>
