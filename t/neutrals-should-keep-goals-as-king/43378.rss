    <title>Neutrals should keep goals as King</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutrals-should-keep-goals-as-king/43378</link>
    <description>Becoming a king as most neutrals completely changes your goal to survive (unless NK), and this can allow some to escape their goal. I would suggest becoming King would leave your objective completely unchanged. (Ex. Scorned would keep target, Mercenary would need to keep target alive)

It&#39;s a small tweak, but I think you shouldn&#39;t for example, escape suicide as Scorned by becoming King, or something similar.</description>

<p>Passive: Head of State: All your votes for accusation count as two. Your actions do not count as visits, and you cannot be occupied or redirected. If you are the Psycho King, you are immune at night.</p>
<p>Passive: Loyal Subjects: If you are executed, there will be no trial tomorrow. Good and Foolish King only.</p>
<p>Passive: Failure: If your target dies, or you have no target night 3, you will commit suicide. Protective King only.</p>
<p>Day Ability: Decide Fate: Determine the outcome of a trial. One use. If you are the Starting Vengeful King, you cannot use this on either of your targets. 1 use.</p>
<p>Day Ability: Offer Protection: Choose a player. They will be your target for the rest of the game. Must be used day 3 or before. Protective King Only. (Should also replace Mercenary Offer Contract)</p>
<p>Night Ability: Guards!: Protect a player from death. If you are the Starting Good King, this will also protect against conversions. If you are the Protective King and you are using this on your target, it will prevent all visits. 4 uses. Does not appear on Psycho King.</p>
<p>Night Ability: Fatal Guards: Kill a player. Psycho King only. Infinite uses.</p>
<p>Night Ability: Order Execution: Kill a player, bypassing death immunity. This action will be announced to the Court. 2 uses, starting King only.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Good King: Guards protect from conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evil King: Identical to now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vengeful King: Crowned from Scorned, keeps targets. If starting, has random targets and cannot use Decide Fate on their target. Scorned Win Condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foolish King: Mechanically identical to Good King, but has Fool Win Condition and Guards are normal and don’t protect from conversions. (and Butler won’t suicide). Crowned from Fool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protective King: Crowned from Mercenary, keeps target. If they are the Starting King, they will choose target. Guards on target protect from all visits, other Guards act normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cowardly King: Same as the Neutral King.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psycho King: Identical to now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New spawn chances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good: 60%<br>
Evil: 30%<br>
Vengeful: 5%<br>
Protective: 5%</p>

            <p>A thing like that exists though, my assumption is that you would try to accuse confirmed BD and then get executed… pretty efficient</p>

            <p>This is true in Forum of Lies, but then this would need more programming to be done in ToL than we need for the Cowardly King, Mad King, etc.</p>
