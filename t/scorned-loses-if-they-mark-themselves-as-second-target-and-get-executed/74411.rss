    <title>Scorned loses if they mark themselves as second target and get executed</title>

    <description>I just played a game where Scorned disguised Hunter as Assassin, then got redirected into disguising THEMSELVES as Mastermind.  We executed him but he lost =(

Would have been cooler if he won :upside_down_face:</description>

            <p>While it might not be the most satisfying resolution. It is consistent with other similar win conditions such as the Inquisitors.</p>
<p>If we change the interaction to be like mercs then if you mark a target the night you die and that target gets lynched then you would win. It is subjective if this is a good thing or not</p>
