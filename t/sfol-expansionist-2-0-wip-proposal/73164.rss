    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sfol-expansionist-2-0-wip-proposal/73164</link>
    <description>### Gameplay
Days will be 4 IRL days long, or shorter if someone dies
Nights will be 1 IRL days long
Actions are done by messaging me
Revolution members will talk through DMs. They can talk there during both the day and night
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it

### Executions
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
When someone is on Trial they will be able to make a single post defense, during this time no-one should post, everyone will then vote Guilty or innocent in the thread until hammer is reached or until EoD
Executions end the Day

### Projects

There are now projects that are funded with resources. New projects are selected by the Chancellor and provide passive effects once completed. Funding is private and it is only revealed when a project is completed. The Chancellor may start up to 2 Projects per day but each person may only contribute to 1 of them. 

Resources are committed to a project during the day or night privately in your class card. Your decision is locked in at the end of each night. It is never revealed who or how meany resources are contributed towards a project. If at the end of the day a project has enough resources to be completed then it will come into play at the start of the next day and it&#39;s effects will last for the rest of the game.

Your resource does not change when your class does. 

The Resources you can have are: Wood, Stone and Gold depending on your starting class

[details=&quot;Projects&quot;]
* Lumber mill - Everyone who has Wood may provide another Wood to a project (4 Wood, 2 Stone, 1 Gold)
* Shipyard - If the Lumber Mill is built, then can be built. Anyone who visits this room will be able to move themself to a player of their choice the next night, and be affected by all actions that affect their target the night after. Doesn&#39;t affect investigative abilities (6 Wood, 2 Stone, 1 Gold)
* Quarry - Everyone who has Stone may provide another Stone to a project (4 Stone, 2 Wood, 1 Gold)
* Treasury - Everyone who has Gold may provide another Gold to a project (3 Stone, 3 Wood, 3 Gold)
* Alchemy Campus - If a player who has Wood or Stone visits this room, they may use either resource the following day. (3 Wood, 3 Stone, 1 Gold)
* Transmutation Facility - If the Alchemy Campus is built, then this can be built. Once built all projects are now completed when the correct total number of resources are committed regardless of resource type. EX: The Common room could be built with 8 wood. (1 Wood, 1 Stone, 4 Gold)
* Grainery - Civilians no longer starve (3 Wood, 3 Stone, 3 Gold)
* Common Room - Can be visited. Anyone who visits this room will do their action on everyone else who visits this room. You will not know who. (3 Wood, 4 Stone, 1 Gold)
* Public Security - Citizens are death immune. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop starvation deaths (4 Wood, 6 Stone, 4 Gold)
* Armory - Can be visited. Anyone who visits this room will have their abilities bypass death and occupy immunity&amp;rsquo;s the next night. (5 Wood, 3 Stone, 1 Gold)
* Sleeping Quarters - Players become occupy immune after being occupied twice. (4 Wood, 4 Stone, 2 Gold)
* Panic Room - Visitors will be death immune so long as there are less than 3. Otherwise this does nothing. Each player can only visit the panic room once per game. (3 Wood, 4 Stone, 5 Gold)
* Investigation Headquarters - The night after this is built all investigative abilities may select an additional target. (widened search selects an additional class instead) (4 Wood, 8 Stone, 3 Gold)
* Secret Pathways - Each player may visit a room as a bonus action in addition to their night action once per game per player after this is built (5 Wood, 2 Stone, 1 Gold)
[/details]


### Civilians
There are NPC civilians. The game starts with 10. If there are ever 0 then the NK wins. They have other effects on the game as well. 1 will die every night of starvation starting night 3 and they can be collectively targeted by some abilities.

### Chancellor
&gt;# Chancellor
&gt; **Unknown Special**
&gt; Resource: Any + Starting Resource 
&gt;
&gt;Passive 1: Diplomatic immunity - You cannot be investigated or converted and your resources cannot be tampered with by any abilities. If you are a member of the Revolution you do not count towards their faction cap. You also cannot be jailed or attacked by a Dominion member.
Passive 2: Political Leader - You may put forward up to 2 different projects per day. Everyone including you will vote yes or no on each of them throughout the day until an option is hammered.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Public Support - Each living Civilian will add a vote to your next vote. This can affect any vote. (3 uses)
&gt;
&gt;Night Ability: Guards! - Give target player death immunity tonight. Can target self or the civilians. (3 uses)
&gt;
&gt;Goal is the same as your original class

The Chancellor does not spawn. Instead a player is anonymously elected as Chancellor at the start of Day 3. The vote is over 24 hours and is anonymous. If the Chancellor is killed there will be another one elected the next day unless there are 4 or less players. 

The Chancellor keeps their old ability&#39;s and passives but they can still only do 1 day action and 1 night action. 

### After The Night
You will be told what happened to you
&gt;**Night:**
You slept peacefully
You were unfortunately killed
You were converted to the Rebellion!
**Day:**
You were exposed to deadly poison!

### Journals
Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed
