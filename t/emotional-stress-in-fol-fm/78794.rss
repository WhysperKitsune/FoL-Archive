    <title>Emotional stress in Fol/FM</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/emotional-stress-in-fol-fm/78794</link>
    <description>Hi,
sometimes the games are ending up so heated (*not* toxic but heated) that I find myself crying or even unable to work for a day or two. I know that&#39;s happening to a lot of players. FM means stress, and you often have to take some *months* break to recover.
Do you have some tips how to reduce the stress on yourself while playing, or just how to keep at least *some* some emotional distance?</description>

            <p>If someone straight out insults you, you can tell your host or call a mod… outright toxicity is the last thing we want to have on this site, and we don’t tolerate it. There is a difference between criticising a playstyle or straight attacking the person behind it. Try to calm down the situation yourself if you can, but you can always ask a mod for help.</p>

            <p>Oh that’s a good thread<br>
I was pretty interested in getting into forum mafia some time ago and played for around 3 games here<br>
Two of them just made me get sick of it as fast as I had the desire to play before</p>
<p>It was not even stress, like, getting pressure<br>
I was just straight out getting insulted. Not a good way to keep noobs around lol</p>
<p>Well I am back now and if anything like this happens again I will just drop the match :^)</p>

            <p>I’ve only read like half of this thread. But for me personally I get emotionally stressed from things that are happening in real life and it intervenes with FoL matches when I am trying to act like my normal self, but I don’t feel “normal” — if that makes sense. Basically it’s hard to act like I am supposed to act when I am not feeling well. Sometimes I also feel unmotivated to contribute to the game and I feel bad that I’m not playing to my best ability. But in general I don’t take anything personally within games and I find most players to be very encouraging and uplifting and supportive</p>

<p>Well I’ll reference auction mafia then. I think it was an easier game for scum, because of the many slankers, but you still did quite well early. I don’t think you would have gotten away with the seriously heavy amounts of fluff otherwise.</p>
<p>Your push against me was <em>fine</em> there, but you dropped it way too fast. You don’t just start heavily pushing a townleader and after 2 posts be like… oh I guess it’s fine anyways unless you at least say something like lolreactiontest.</p>
<p>Don’t be fine with getting a daycop check when you can’t counter it against a town leader that you’re not able to fend of when you’re away. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I would have tried something like. NO, THAT’S A WASTE! blabla</p>
<p>You also attempted too much to distance from your whole scumteam with your inevitable flip that you actually further incriminated Blue with completely swapping your read on him. That didn’t make any sense when your previous beliefs (that I was apparently scum) were actually being solidified. You don’t start second guessing your reads when you’re being proven right. Try and remain calm under the enormous pressure and act accordingly. (I struggle myself with that too) Take a hot minute to decide whether it makes sense what you’re posting with your previous (fake) mindset. You even had the excuse there that you were at a party, which probably also impacted that, but that would be my critique for you during that game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">Also powerwolf more, you cowards!</span></p>
<p><em>Rereading that game was painful.</em></p>

            <p>Maybe that’s why people scumread you as BD</p>
<p>cause its stressful</p>
<p>I dont see it that way, it’s less stressful cause you dont have pressure and you need to be worried about every post u make as wolf</p>
