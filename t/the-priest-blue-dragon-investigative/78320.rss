&gt; ## Passives
&gt; 
&gt; ## Day Abilities
&gt; **Suspicious Ritual** - Your use of *Religious Aura* tonight cannot be *tailored*, you will appear *framed* tonight as well. (2 uses)
&gt; ## Night Abilities
&gt; **Religious Aura** - Determine if a player is not Blue Dragon, or is visited by a non-Blue Dragon player. (Inf Use)
&gt; **Unorthodox Method** -  Check two players. If at least one of them is a Cultist, you attack both. (2 uses)

&gt; ## Notes
&gt; The Priest will only spawn in Cult games.

            <p>Mainly because of theme. It’s relationship with he Paladin(/Sheriff) is that this class also serves as the “Faction Hardcounter”, and having a maximum of 6 hardcounters is like having 2 BD Alchs with 6 BD Healers. It’s a <em>little</em> unfair.</p>

            <p>Take this rework for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/court-wizard-enchanter-rework/74137" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/court-wizard-enchanter-rework/74137</a></p>
<p>While I could go on all day about how this class rework would improve the game. The thing I want to point out is that is wouldn’t work very well as a standalone class rather than as a CW rework, simply because the existing CW already does the things this rework does.</p>
<p>The point of the rework is to make the CW more flexable and less complicated, but that doesn’t change that he is in fact still the CW</p>

            <p>In order for a class to be justified it needs to either:</p>
<p>A - Solve a problem with the game (Scorned, Fool, Inquisitor)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>B - Expand on an underutilized mechanic. The less utilized the better (CW, Maid, Cult, Hunter ect)</p>
<p>I don’t like Chronomancer because it is none of those. It resolves like a physician and we already have the Physician. Same goes for Paladin compared to Sheriff (or vice versa technically)</p>
<p>Paladin used to be more unique (but less balanced) at which time he was more justified, but at this point I do think a Paladin and Sheriff rework makes sense</p>

            <p>The problem with this class is that it resolves like a Paladin.</p>
<p>They have identical primary abilities (not even the chronomancer’s main ability is literally just a heal), and their secondary abilities other than False Membership serve the same functions as well (anti-conversion and killing cult)</p>
<p>The differences here are insufficient.</p>

<p>Being evil is itself a redeeming quality. A difference in wincon usually has a far bigger effect than a difference in mechanics.</p>
<p>This is why Alchemist is valid as a neut but would be redundant as a BD.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Inquisitor and Scorned serve different functions. They are valid for pretty much the opposite reasons as Knight and Physician.</p>
<p>Knight and Phys are valid because their mechanical difference means completely different playstyles, counterplay ect inspite of having identical functions.</p>
<p>Inquisitor and Sccorned are (sort of) mechanically similar. However they serve different functions. Scorned works to make investigatives more suspicious and give good reason for early game false accusations. While Inquisitor is anti-massclaim.</p>
<p>Inquisitor can’t fulfill the Scorned’s function and the Scorned can’t fulfill the inquisitor’s function.</p>
<p>You can (and should) debate on how successful these classes are at fulfilling those functions, but an attempt was made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prince is just a glorified Butler with kill capacity. <em>Get rid of it</em></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Prince’s guaranteed status at the very least means that there will be a minimum of 1 blue dragon with occupation and kill abilities. And even if it didn’t Butler is justified for the same reason as Knight in this regard (the existence of a butler is something that can be played around and thus attempts will be made in doing so, while Prince does not bring up that dynamic)</p>
<p>Meanwhile Prince has his own dynamic with how the BD tries to keep him hidden from scum while scum are attempting to break through those defences to reach him at all costs.</p>
<p>The Prince is the entire reason why anti-protectives are so strong in the meta (ritualist, sage, enforcer ect).</p>
<p>And even then there are plenty of people who don’t think that this dynamic is sufficient justification for his existence and thus he should be reworked into a non-unique class with a more limited niche.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not really. The existence of only single kill capable class, the limited yet common nature of the converts and the promotion system means that the 2 factions play very differently.</p>
<p>If the Cult had unique converts for every class, promoted the same way and had the same fundamental Kill rhythm as the Unseen then I would say they were too similar even if the converts and abilities were slightly different. But that isn’t the case, so its it’s fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knight is just Prince + Phys.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While Prince is certainly better than Knight, that doesn’t make them the same thing.</p>
<p>Same goes for Knight.</p>
<p>Chronomancer doesn’t add anything to the game because they both stop the same things. When asking what they are used to deal with they are interchangeable.</p>
<p>However there are plenty of things Knights block that Physicians do not. That is why we can say that Knight is better against Reaper than Physician is but Possessor is better against Knight while Sorc can deal with Knight but not as well as Possessor and is weak to Physician.</p>
<p>The simple fact that Knight blocks things that Physician doesn’t and Physician blocks things that Knight doesn’t already makes them very difficult. Combine that with the fact that Knights guard is a counter attack and is also unsustainable in that it eventually Kills him too and they are only similar in that they stop Kills, which makes them comparable but not interchangeable like chronomancer and phys are.</p>
<p>As for the Knight CS there are important differences there too. Specifically CS visits, doesn’t bypass anything, and isn’t known to exist beforehand.</p>
<p>From the PoV of balance none of that is particularly meaningful, since they are all negatives besides the unknown part which is sometimes good (the REAL upside to CS is being unlimited use but that property isn’t important here).</p>
<p>This means Unseen/Cult have a bigger reason to worry about attacks (and thus can get converts to block said attacks), and they can also attempt a Kill on neuts for creditably. Neither of which are the case with just the Prince.</p>
<p>Hunters kills are either telegraphed or are too situational, Prince Kills are also telegraphed and are unstoppable anyways (making it pointless to try and get converts to stop it) and neuts don’t usually go for Scum, even NK’s.</p>
<p>Maid and Sheriff are about as similar as classes can be without being too similar (discounting classes with different wincons like alch vs phys) since they both serve the same overall purpose but achieve those functions in different ways with differing counterplay and considerations at any given moment.</p>
<p>Now what about this class?</p>
<p>Do we need a direct Kill? We already have the Knight, so what does it being here add to the game?</p>
<p>Technically a permanent convert block doesn’t exist, but we tried it before and it didn’t go well. Especially against the cult due to the stalemate potential. And up to 3 of these? It’s at best a balance hazard.</p>
<p>The only thing interesting here at all is a self frame. But a single interesting thing doesn’t offset the cost of having an unnecessary class in the game.</p>
<p>Remember, the more classes there are the more complex the game is. Which means in order to justify the class it needs to add more depth than it does complexity. Having classes that are fundamentally interchangeable adds less depth than classes which are not, but they both add similar amounts of complexity. So again, why should this class be added into the game? How is this supposed to improve the game? What interactions are possible thanks to this class that weren’t before and how do those interactions make the game more interesting?</p>

            <p>So before you even look at the mechanics, saying how to change this into a good class, you instead dismiss it as Bad because these mechanics already exist.</p>
<p>Well then we might as well remove:</p>
<p>Chronomancer (Basically just Physician)<br>
Paladin and the Cult (Basically just the Unseen and Sheriff)<br>
Knight (CS is covered by Prince’s Execute, and Defend is basically just Execute + Heal)<br>

<p>Direct Unseen Checks exist on the sheriff. Just make sheriff able to spawn in both games and remove pally (tweaking sheriff a bit)</p>

</aside>
<p>The fact that they <em>are</em> different has some balance implications. It means neutrals can’t fake “the right cop” right of the bat and the cops in question have some more credibility in the fact that they know which kind of game it is right away. I agree that this class is a bit minimally different from current Paladin, so would just serve to make it harder to understand for new players all the classes in the game.</p>
<p>Oof and then you post this.</p>
