<h2>Daigo Yamano</h2>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
<strong>Appearance:</strong> An Unkempt and tired face. Short dark hair, stubble and tired eyes. He often wears a jacket overtop his shirt and tie.<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 32<br>
<strong>Personality:</strong> Down to earth, sarcastic. Not intentionally unfriendly, but can seem like it. Dark sense of humor.<br>
<strong>[???]:</strong><br>
<strong>Backstory Occupation:</strong> An ex-cop, now turned private investigator.<br>
<strong>Backstory:</strong> Daigo started his law enforcement career at the young age of 20. After struggling to make it through training he eventually made it. He started as a beat cop, patrolling the streets. After a few years of climbing the police ranks he was promoted to a detective. His future looked bright - until it didn‚Äôt. He arrived at his home expecting to be greeted by his loving wife and 14 month old daughter. Instead he was greeted by his wife‚Äôs uncaring corpse. She was slashed several times across her torso and her organs had spilled out onto the floor. The image of her unbeating heart still haunts his dreams. There was no sign of his daughter, missing without a trace. He became obsessed with her case and the quality of the rest of his work declined. Three years ago Daigo clashed with the newly promoted superintendent of police. Arthur took Daigo off his wife‚Äôs case. Daigo, unable to focus on anything else, retired and turned in his badge. He‚Äôs since worked as a private investigator, taking side jobs to pay rent while focusing on trying to find any clue that could lead to his wife‚Äôs killer or his daughter‚Äôs location. It‚Äôs almost been 5 years since her murder. He always carries around his trusty revolver and a silver locket with the last photo he took of his wife and daughter.</p>

<h2>Taisto Leino</h2>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
<strong>Appearance:</strong> green eyes, long hair dyed black but it‚Äôs probably naturally some shade of brown, somewhat of a moustache and beard, pierced ears (flesh tunnels, I had to google the term), often wears a beanie<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 19<br>
<strong>Personality:</strong> A somewhat serious, somewhat emo guy who mostly keeps to himself and often complains about his life.<br>
<strong>[???]:</strong> TBA<br>
<strong>Backstory Occupation:</strong> Night shift pizza delivery<br>
<strong>Backstory:</strong><br>
A singer/drummer in a heavy metal band in his spare time, Taisto has few long-term goals and a pretty dismal outlook on life. Living on his own in a small apartment he can barely afford in a dodgy part of the city, he sometimes dreams of doing something more interesting, but his motivation is pretty low. He has a small circle of friends - primarily his band members - but he still tends to bottle up his emotions instead of talking about them unless he‚Äôs drunk. He doesn‚Äôt contact his family very often, and he moved out when he was still in high school to room with his friends for a couple years before he had saved up enough to rent a place of his own. He hates his job, but it‚Äôs just another daily routine to make some stable cash and give him something to do. On weekends, he and his band perform gigs at the local venues; they aren‚Äôt super popular, but they‚Äôve accrued a small fan base.</p>
