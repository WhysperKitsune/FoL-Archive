    <title>Some Kind of &quot;Role List&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/some-kind-of-role-list/3640</link>
    <description>I put role list in quotes because I don&#39;t think an actual role list would be a good idea, but something more vague may be helpful--especially to new players. Something like this:

King
BD
BD
BD
BD
BD
???
???
???

I really enjoy this game, but I will say that the biggest hurdle for me starting out was the complete lack of in-game role knowledge--how many good guys are there, how many bad, how many neutral? Further than that, how many good/bad/neutral CAN there be in a game?

Do you think something along these lines would be good for the game?</description>

<p>She? lol.</p>
<p>And no, that list is just a generic 8 person game list.</p>
<p>A full 16 player game is a lot more random. There is always a Prince, King, Faction Leader, Faction subordinate and at least 1 Neutral.</p>

            <p>One time you showed a list, that was something like this:</p>
<p>King<br>
prince<br>
BD<br>
BD<br>
BD<br>
Neutral<br>
Mastermind/cult leader<br>
assassin/seeker</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>I think she wants that one</p>

            <p>To be completely honest, I don’t really think it’s good to have a check-list that Blue Dragon can use to list off all the classes available and then go down that list whenever someone dies.</p>
<p>Having the entire list be random in every game creates the element of surprise. You never know what you’re going to get.</p>
