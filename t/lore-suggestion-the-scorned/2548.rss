    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Scorned</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-scorned/2548</link>
    <description>The court of Adiart used to be filled with more royals.
2, one man and one women, to be exact.
they were twins, inseparable. they did everything together. 
it seemed as though death itself couldn&#39;t even come between them. 
However, it did. Upon failing to kill the female noble, the unseen deliberated and decided to poisoned her.

No matter; there was a physician who spoke up after seeing her cough blood and said he would heal her after everyone went home.

He didn&#39;t.

Apparently, one of the butlers was angry over the twins ordering him around everyday for the last twenty years; he decided to distract the physician with his one vice: wine.

luckily, she still had a day to live; the butler would come to his senses and allow the physician to do his job.

at least, that is what the poisoned one&#39;s brother thought. The butler was determined to achieve is revenge.
he waited at the door, all night, for the physician to come; he never did.
his sister died, in his arms, covered in blood.
her last words were &quot;Do not seek revenge against those who have wronged me; justice will be met in the after life.&quot;

No, no, no! The alchemist was *this* close to discovering the secret to immortality, thought her brother. If they got a hold of it, vengeance might never be met!

Upon the revealing of her death to the court, the now-lone nobleman scanned the courtiers faces: the physician looked guilty, the assassin had a glare of success in his eye, and the butler grinned, even though he attempted to mask it.

-------------------
the nobleman walked away. He would come back, under a new identity, to exact his revenge.</description>
