    <title>Switching Cult and Unseen classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/switching-cult-and-unseen-classes/43835</link>
    <description>I really as Unseen, you rarely have members that remain in their converted form, so they see little play. On the other hand, the Cult is much more likely to keep converted classes, since there is only one inherited position, and no Mastermind.

So it seems really counter intuitive why unseen has more classes than cult. I feel like they could really shine if they could be played in the faction more suited for them. So why not give Unseen the classes that get converted based on type, while giving the Cult the more specialized classes?</description>

            <p>From what I’ve seen cult doesn’t die too much more frequently.</p>
<p>Also, unseen member doesn’t stay as a carbon copy, since they get promoted in about 5 seconds, if they don’t die.</p>

            <p>The cult is like a disease that is supposed to spread quickly or die. Compared to the Unseen the cult seems weaker, but I would say they are near the same power level due to their ability to spread and have a good KPN. sure if an Unseen gets lynched it’s bad but as cult it’s no real biggie, you can just convert someone else</p>

            <p>the main point is the unseen only gets one class at a time, but overall they are more powerful (or at the very least more sneaky, because they are near carbon copies of their former selves)</p>

            <p>The cult buff is true, but I don’t see how it would nerf the unseen much. They don’t get much use out of most classes besides Assassin and Mastermind, since other classes get promoted to Assassin.</p>

            <p>I see your point, but don’t think changing it in this way would do anything except buff the Cult a lot and nerf the Unseen a lot.</p>

            <p>Cult isn’t really shorter lived than unseen, and blood of mithras is rarely used, since you usually don’t get maxed out on cult members for long. And unseen rarely uses their abilities.</p>
