<ol>
<li>Global Forum Rules apply.</li>
<li>If you haven’t posted in 36 hours, you will be prodded for inactivity via a ping. Not responding to a prod will cause you to be replaced.</li>
<li>Avoid discussing the game outside the thread while the game is still running.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>
Days will be 60 hours long, or shorter depending if a player is executed.<br>
Nights will be 24 hours long.<br>
Day and Night Actions are done by messaging me.<br>
The Mafia and the Cult will talk through their own separate PMs.<br>
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it.<br>
All class cards and modifiers that can be rolled will be shown.<br>
All game mechanics will be put on the OP.</p>
<p><strong>Classes and Modifiers</strong><br>
Each player will receive a class card detailing their night and/or day action. In addition, their class card will gain from one to three <strong>Modifiers</strong> that will passively influence how they interact with the game. Some modifiers help while others hinder, and others cannot roll in specific circumstances. The odds of a player receiving <em>n</em> number of <strong>Modifiers</strong> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Modifier = 30%</strong><br>
<strong>2 Modifiers = 50%</strong><br>
<strong>3 Modifiers = 20%</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, only up to 20% of the players will receive a <strong>Bastard Modifier</strong>. Players will not be told they have <strong>Bastard Modifier</strong> and their effects are more dramatic than your normal <strong>Modifiers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mafioso Promotions</strong><br>
All Mafia-aligned players will begin as a Mafia class and the Mafioso class cannot be initially rolled. In between the start of the first day to the end of the first night the Mafia must decided which player should become a Mafioso, based on the usefulness of their classes and mods, and message me their decision. If the Mafioso dies, then they must again undergo this process in order to perform a nightkill. The Mafioso player’s mods will be the same as the ones from their previous class.</p>
<p><strong>Backgrounds</strong><br>
Each Neutral Killer will be allowed to choose one of the four backgrounds presented in the start of the match. They either give the user an additional day ability, a passive, or allows them an additional night action in the place of their ordinary kill, but they are not effected by the user’s modifiers. These backgrounds can be used to either further their goals or to meld in with the Town as a fake-claim.</p>

<p><strong>Trials</strong><br>
To accuse someone say “<strong>/accuse [player]</strong>” or “<strong>/vote [player]</strong>”<br>
Once majority is reached, the player will be automatically lynched and the game will go to its Twilight phase.<br>
Executions end the Day unless a Prosecutor used their day ability.<br>
The VC will be modified to show if a player is Hated or Loved and it will show revealed Mayors and Kleptocrats, but will not inform if a player has the Influential modifier or has the Condemned Bastard Mod.</p>
<p><strong>Kill Flavors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Name) was found dead last night, a close examination has shown that their body was riddled with bullet holes and stab wounds!</em> - (Killed by a Mafioso, a Vigilante, a Serial Killer, or a Mass Murderer.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Name) was found dead last night, according to the coroner they violently passed away in their sleep from some sort of lethal toxin or pathogen!</em> - (Death by lethal injection, disease, or radiation.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Name) was found dead last night, and they had severe third-degree burns all over their body and it was only through sheer luck we could have identified them!</em> - (Incinerated by an Arsonist.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Name) was found dead last night, it seems they were sacrificed to some sort of ancient eldritch abomination in a horrifying ritual!</em> - (Death by the Cult.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Name) was found dead last night, their corpse was found hanging in their own closet with a disturbing note written nearby!</em> - (Suicide from Jester lynch, a Compulsive mod, a Suicidal bmod, or killing a townie as a Vigilante or Anesthesiologist.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Daytime</strong><br>
In the beginning of the first day the host will inform the number of Bastard Mods in play and will also announce all players that have the Innocent mod, and then will list the players with the Lynchproof mod as they will be un-votable until the fourth day.</p>
<p><strong>After The Night</strong><br>
You will be told what happened to you. In addition, each class has their own specific feedback. In general the feedback is minimized and being roleblocked will give the same feedback as if your ability failed. Whenever the word malady is used, it means either the lethal injection, or the delayed deaths from the bmod Diseased and Irradiated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Night:</strong><br>
You slept peacfully.<br>
You were visited by (Name). You noticed this as they are a particular loud individual.<br>
Someone redirected you!<br>
Someone gave you the Thirfty adjective!<br>
Someone wishes to speak with you for the night.<br>
You were converted to the Cult!<br>
Your mind is clearer and you are not Selfish/Guiltless/Slothful anymore!<br>
You were murdered while you were asleep!<br>
You sadly passed away from a fatal malady that you acquired in the past!<br>
You died from third-degree burns as your home burned to cinders!<br>
You couldn’t bear it any longer and you took your own life!<br>
You were sacrificed by the Cult to an eldritch abomination!<br>
<strong>Day:</strong><br>
You were injected with a lethal injection. You will die tonight if you are not healed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Journals</strong><br>
Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you receive your death message shall be the one displayed.</p>
