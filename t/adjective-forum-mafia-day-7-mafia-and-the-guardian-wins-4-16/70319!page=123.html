Luxy's Logs</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Luxy the Journalist</p>
<p>D1: Interview Firekitten<br>
N1: Response from Firekitten<br>
D2: Interview Icibalus</p>
<p>Reads:</p>
<p>Firekitten (Townlean) - Interviewed him N1, asked him what he was going to do. Said he was going to check Sam and he did. Right off the bat accusing Htm. 2nd person to accuse Memesky. He is analysing things which he doesn’t do as scum.</p>
<p>Overthebin (Slight Scumlean) - Open claimed doctor when the tiniest bit of pressure was put on him. Doesn’t want investigatives on him, possible distancing with htm. Very focussed on mechanics instead of scumreading. Doesn’t want to scumread Day 1. Attempted to shift suspicion from himself onto Solic OMGUS style. Sheeped Meme.</p>
<p>HTM (Scumlean) - Sheeping at the start. Very LAMIST at the beginning (‘I wouldn’t do this if I was scum…’). Scummy vibes from the start, using his lynchproof as an excuse not to defend himself. Apologising for being lazy; I don’t think he’d do that as town. Whiteknighting me day 1, very possible to be scum whiteknight. Refused to vote Meme like he knew he was town and could say ‘I told you so’ later for free towncred.</p>
<p>Margaret (Slight Townlean) - Seems to be town Marg as she doesn’t seem too self-conscious. A lot of IIoA tho. Strongly against pushing newbies.</p>
<p>Insanity (Scumlean) - Normal VI Sheep activity that is usually indicative of town!insanity D1. Brought up that Captain was rather defensive. Displaying his common scumtell: excessive amounts of IIoA. Hard claimed instantly under pressure which also appears to be a scumtell of insanity. Bad votes, and was on the Memesky wagon.</p>
<p>PoisonedSquid (Slight Scumlean) - No analysis to be seen, just fluff posts and information that is common knowledge already almost like they’re just trying to provide content to seem town. Pushing on Poke due to his modifiers.</p>
<p>Marluxion (Slight Scumlean) - The first person to push on Memesky, could have been going for an easy mislynch on Memesky. Overreacted on a meme I made. Supports captain. Somehow thought I lock-towned Solic? Is quite sure that Marg is town. Says that one post of mine stating that bin’s post was bad was ‘hard whiteknighting,’ seems to almost be over-exaggerating things I to make me look scummy, and therefore, push a mislynch on me later. Says he doesn’t like the vote on Captain earlier, then votes him later with no reasoning. Really pushed the Memesky wagon. Didn’t want to CFD onto poke. Could have been trying to pocket Ici.</p>
<p>Captain (Slight Scumlean) - Overreaction to being pushed. Said insanity was acting like a VI but still voted him. Fast wagon however which may suggest he is the NK or town. Softed Lookout or Tracker (can’t be NK then if he has the vengeful modifier).</p>
<p>Icibalus (Slight Townlean) - Miller Slot. Possibly pocketing Marl. Gutread is town tho. Analysed the Sam v Firekitten argument</p>
<p>Solic (Slight Townlean) - Says he can’t read FK early on. Brought up the point that scum could claim to have more modifiers than they do as an excuse if they’re red checked. Also talking about the helpfulness of hiding your modifiers as town for certain reasons. Soft-Defending Poke.</p>
<p>Sam17z (Slight Scumlean) - Shitty Reaction test on me day 1. Slight scum motivation from the start. Deflecting off htm, however he was questioning Solic. Bad reads which are usually indicative of Scum!Sam. Needlessly saying ‘come explain with your emotions’ D1. Something feels off about his early D1 posts. Late Miller claim. Derpcleared by Ici tho.</p>
<p>Luxy - Me</p>
<p>Gamerpoke (Null) - No analysis, just talking about his inability to vote due to modifiers.</p>
<p>PokemonKidRyan (Null) - CarnivalMaster posted 4 posts, 2 of them were joining/confirming, 1 was a sheep vote and the other was a meme. Need more content from PKR to analyse. Softing Vigilante.</p>
