    <description>
**Rules**
1. Global Forum Rules apply.
2. If you haven&#39;t posted in 36 hours, you will be prodded for inactivity via a ping. Not responding to a prod will cause you to be replaced.
3. Avoid discussing the game outside the thread while the game is still running.
4. Avoid using larger font size. Nobody likes to confuse memeing with actual host stuff.
5. Avoid deleting/edit messages unless it&#39;s a recent one or to correct grammar mistakes.

**Gameplay**
Days will be 60 hours long, or shorter depending if a player is executed.
Nights will be 24 hours long.
Day and Night Actions are done by messaging me.
The Mafia and the Cult will talk through their own separate PMs.
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it.
All class cards and modifiers that can be rolled will be shown.
All game mechanics will be put on the OP. 

**Classes and Modifiers**
Each player will receive a class card detailing their night and/or day action. In addition, their class card will gain from one to three **Modifiers** that will passively influence how they interact with the game. Some modifiers help while others hinder, and others cannot roll in specific circumstances. The odds of a player receiving _n_ number of **Modifiers** is:
&gt;**1 Modifier = 30%**
&gt;**2 Modifiers = 50%**
&gt;**3 Modifiers = 20%**

Additionally, only up to 20% of the players will receive a **Bastard Modifier**. Players will not be told they have **Bastard Modifier** and their effects are more dramatic than your normal **Modifiers**.

**Mafioso Promotions**
All Mafia-aligned players will begin as a Mafia class and the Mafioso class cannot be initially rolled. In between the start of the first day to the end of the first night the Mafia must decided which player should become a Mafioso, based on the usefulness of their classes and mods, and message me their decision. If the Mafioso dies, then they must again undergo this process in order to perform a nightkill. The Mafioso player&#39;s mods will be the same as the ones from their previous class.

**Backgrounds**
Each Neutral Killer will be allowed to choose one of the four backgrounds presented in the start of the match. They either give the user an additional day ability, a passive, or allows them an additional night action in the place of their ordinary kill, but they are not effected by the user&#39;s modifiers. These backgrounds can be used to either further their goals or to meld in with the Town as a fake-claim.

**After The Night**
You will be told what happened to you. In addition, each class has their own specific feedback.
