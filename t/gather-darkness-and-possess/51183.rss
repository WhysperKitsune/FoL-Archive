            <p>It’s mostly just a wording change. That way the change in the OP can go through without affecting the knight interaction.</p>

            <p>then what’s the point. I mean the killer will likely not survive. so why preventing from visiting. he’ll be dead by the morning.</p>

            <p>My change would have no effect on occupys, conversions, investigations ect and is worded so that he doesn’t counterattack attackers that don’t visit (such as inquis, sorc or psycho king.)</p>

            <p>Nonono. It ONLY prevents killers. It just does PREVENT killers as opposed to just saving the target in a way that imply’s that a reaper, enforcer or king could bypass it.</p>

            <p>If you make, then you can just scrap the CW, as the Knight now also prevent conversion, occupation, as well as killing.</p>
<p>your change is way too op.</p>
<p>stopping killers is enough. we don’t need to make the knight stop conversions as well.</p>
<p>Also, gather Darkness, will kill the king is he guard himself and it will kill the prince, if he is defended by the king, its exactly the power of the reaper, its the only nk that can easily bypasses night immunity, the sorc can do that too, but only with circle of death.  and this ability aint easy to use, plus it won’t kill the KING</p>

            <p>Would it? Does that happen with preventions? In either case that’s not a big deal.</p>

            <p>That would confuse observer logs, since someone who got killed by a knight guard would be seen as visiting nobody.</p>

            <p>So this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night ability: Sacrafice - <strong>Prevent</strong> all attackers from attacking your target. Attack any killers that try to <strong>Visit</strong> your target giving your life to do so. Bypasses night immunity. (Unlimited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highlighted key words.</p>

            <p>I would make a knights guard officially a prevention. This would not make any mechanical difference but it would make the interactions more clear.</p>

            <p>Gather Darkness can’t make your reap bypass a Knight guard, because that would make it impossible for starting King to survive a Reaper game.  King wouldn’t be able to do anything to protect himself from Reaper.</p>
