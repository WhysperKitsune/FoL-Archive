&gt; 1. Added Acolyte as a killer convert since it doesn&#39;t make sense that killer classes become invoker having nothing of their former selves 
&gt; 2. Didn&#39;t add Apostle since he is getting an official rework
&gt; 3. Added CL!!! Tell me your opinions on it
&gt; 4. Gave Invoker a better Bewilder as his bewilder right now isn&#39;t that good
&gt; 5. Gave Ritualist some Phys concepts since he didn&#39;t feel like Phys at all even though he is converted from him  
&gt; 6. Made him have more of observer qualities since it freaking annoying to have claimed observer out loud then get converted and being unable to prove myself 
&gt; 
&gt; Feedback/suggestions are appreciated

&gt; Changes: 
&gt;=
&gt; 1. Separated Bewilder into 2 abilities, Cult Empower and Bewilder. Suggested by @NuclearBurrito 
&gt; 2. Acolyte&#39;s Blood Veil will no longer affect Prince. Suggested by @Twil1ight 
&gt; 3. Reduced Cult Shield&#39;s uses to 2. Suggested by @Twil1ight
&gt; 4. Changed Multiple Names. Suggested by @RHCube
&gt; 5. Removed Identify. Suggested by most voters
&gt; 6. Replaced Expose with Uncover. Suggested by @RHCube 
&gt; 7. Fixed Spelling.</description>

<p>I was just giving an example, there are a bunch of other reasons. Like killer is the only class type  that has that concept. Even the Unseen don’t have that concept</p>
<p>If we are not making an acolyte then Invoker at least needs 1 killer ability</p>

<p>I like the idea, but it’s more support than killing.  Make it so it bleeds all visitors, and reduce it to 1 use.  And change it so it can target anyone(even yourself).  Also change the name to Crimson Shield(Or at least something other than “cult shield”.)</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like the idea, but it’s more support than killing.  Make it so it bleeds all visitors, and reduce it to 1 use.  And change it so it can target anyone(even yourself).  Also change the name to Crimson Shield(Or at least something other than “cult shield”.)</p>

<p>This is fine, but the name should be changed.  Abilities shouldn’t have the name of the faction in them.  Crimson Steel would be fine.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is weak.  Only 2 BD classes are affected by it.  Just change it to this: Corax’s guidance(2 use) - Choose a cultist and a cult class.  They will immediately become that class.  Can target yourself.</p>

<p>Day Ability 1: Expose ~ Reveal who the prince imprisons tonight. 2 use</p>

</aside>
<p>This is weak.  It’s useless once the prince dies.  It’s not even that useful while the prince is alive, the only information you gain from it is who the prince is not and who to not target.  Change it to this: expose(2 use) - Reveal the next player to use a day ability besides the king.  Tells you who they target if they target someone.</p>

</aside>
<p>The cult needs buffs though.  A lot of the abilities are weak, and some classes are impossible to fake(observer)</p>

            <p>You don’t have to use my suggestion. I’m just coming up with ideas to replace the identify ability. I don’t even know if my enchantment ability is a good replacement for it, like if it’s to over powered or underpowered or just doesn’t even fit in with the class. Still I would like to hear feedback on it.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it’s a supportive Ability because it’s a self buff Ability. It that ability worked for other members of the cult then yes it would be a supportive ability. Other then that I’m just trying to find other abilities that can replace Identify. I’m kinda against it because the only real thing it does is find Neutral players.</p>
