    <title>[RESOLVED] Can&#39;t login anymore</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-cant-login-anymore/1708</link>
    <description>What happened:
I can&#39;t login with steam anymore on throne of lies; it always says that I have gotten a verification mail  that I have to activate (but I don&#39;t have one). If I click resend, it says that I have done that too much (but I didn&#39;t even do that once) Can someone help me? :(</description>

            <p>Can you provide more information though? No one can help if you don’t provide more information. It’d be good to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/qQazm4j">discord</a> too. If you can’t at least provide more info here, or in another post on the forums.</p>

            <p>Actually, I just experienced it too or I wouldn’t believe it! I accidentally deleted something a few patches ago and I know what is causing this. Very separate issue from the one a while back in early Alpha~ This one’s a false positive.</p>

            <p>You had this issue when it was a bug. However, it’s no longer a bug.</p>
<p>If you don’t see the email, it’s somewhere in spam or your email service deleted it for whatever reason. Alternatively, create a new account on the website with a new email and try that.</p>
