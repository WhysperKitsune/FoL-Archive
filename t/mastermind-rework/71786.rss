            <p>Idk you could possibly change it back to dirty work or allow it to use something idk like a night abiliy which will activate during the end of the night and you will get info back<br>
so for instance if you use follow you would then get results at the end of the night</p>

            <p>Btw to make your class look nicer you should put it in card format</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="purple">The Mastermind</font></h2>
<p><font color="purple">Unseen Special</font></p>
<p>Passives:<br>
Can’t Touch this - reverted back to when Mastermind showed up as not occupy immune.</p>
<p>In the Shadows - Will appear bd to investigate abilities for 3 nights - don’t know if I should change this to all game?</p>
<p>Day Abilities:</p>
<p>Watchful Spirit - The mastermind uses a captured spirit to spy on a certain player revealing all whispers to and from the player.(2 uses) - Completely gets rid of prince meta aristocrat can keep maid.</p>
<p>Peaceful End at Midnight - You may decide to kill yourself and make a member of the Unseen the mastermind this ability is only usable after the third day and takes after the night you used it to activate it to do it’s effect , if you are jailed or killed the effect does not activate.(1 use) - seems weak might change?</p>
<p>Night Abilities</p>
<p>Dark Empowerment - Empower a unseen member based on their class (4 uses)<br>
Killer - Makes them not able to attack guarded targets, that are death immune,healed or have scout on you will receive a message “There is a scout on your target” if this is true.<br>
investigator - Gives them the class of the player when using an investigation ability( except follow) and ignores prefixes(such as must be bd).<br>

Alcoholic - If anyone visits this class they will be re-targeted to another player of your choosing.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yeah I can see where you are coming from but buffing investigate properties will make it seem like a pre existing investigator and the only real investigation role Mastermind can claim is princess or the observer, and observer is nearly impossible to claim I guess you could claim sheriff since the new changes were there is only likely one, but I think Mastermind should seem like the head of somebody who tries to help members rather then taking the spot light and I know the class claim problem still happens here as I was thinking of adding a day ability that could help with this</p>
