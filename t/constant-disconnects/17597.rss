    <description>#### What happened?

I&#39;m disconnected maybe two out of three games. I&#39;m playing on a Mac laptop in windowed mode, in case that&#39;s relevant. I get the trying to reconnect screen and then after maybe a minute the game drops me back to the main menu.

My internet seems to work the whole time. I can switch to the web browser and it will load a page immediately.
