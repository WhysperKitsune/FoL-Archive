    <title>New Game Mode Suggestion &amp; Gender Specific Queen/King Roles</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-game-mode-suggestion-gender-specific-queen-king-roles/10076</link>
    <description>**Suggestion 1: New Game Mode**

20 people but unseen and cult are in the same game. 
Paladin would convert to Templar if converted by unseen

Passive: Holy Spirit
The Unseen are told if they were attempted to be converted into the Cult.

Abilities:

Determine Loyalty:
Determine if a player is convertible or not
2 uses

Unholy Faith:
If a player is cult, kill them and do not consume a use of this ability. If they are not cult but convertible, kill them and consume a use of this ability. If they are not convertable and not cult, take your own life.
2 uses

The Templar picture:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/261525739617255424/376537800297807872/The_Templar-Card.png

The Templar would be a Killer class.

**Suggestion 2: King/Queen Gender Specific**

I find it highly odd that a Princess can become King.

How about female roles instead become queen?
The Queen will have a different ability than Allies which would be called “Similarities”
Similarities will display something along the lines of “You will see if (name) has any similarities with (name).”

This ability will have 5 uses. You pair someone with another person to see if they are the same Class type.

Roles that would become Queen/King

Physician/Herbalist: Player would Decide
Drunk/Alcoholic: King
Noble/Aristocrat: King
Princess/Duchess: Queen
Butler/Servant: King
Alchemist: Queen
Assassin: Previous Class would Decide
Court Wizard/Sage: King
Cult Leader: King
Knight/Enforcer: King
Fool: Player would Decide
Hunter: King
Psychic/Illusionist: Queen
Invoker: Previous Class would Decide
Sheriff/Marshal: King
Mastermind: Player would Decide
Mercenary/Sellsword: Queen
Observer/Nighwatch: King
Paladin: King
Possessor: Player would Decide
Priest: Queen
Prince: King
Reaper: Player would Decide
Ritualist: Previous Class would Decide
Scorned: Queen
Seeker: Previous Class would Decide

If the Player would Decide they would Decide the following night the King/Queen died what they would be if they got chosen to become King/Queen

Please do take my idea into consideration. 
If anyone has any questions please do ask away.</description>

            <p>That’s why you wouldn’t decide to become King. Also, it doesn’t matter whichever one they chose, only the starting King/Queen would get the Abilities.</p>

            <p>not a great idea, if you’re Mastermind and become King(for whatever reason), and were looking to claim, let’s say, Princess, you now can’t do that</p>
<p>also there’s no point</p>
<p>like, none whatsoever</p>
<p>women Kings have existed before, and Kings aren’t elected so “King” in ToL is moreso an arbitrary title signalling an elected leader, such as President or Prime Minister</p>

</aside>
<p>Wouldn’t this ability make more sense the other way around, killing unconvertables? Also it doesn’t make much sense for an unseen to take their own life.</p>
<p>With regards to the King’s gender, it’s been discussed way too often on the Discord, but the gist of it is that King is actually not a gendered word and both men and women can be King.</p>
