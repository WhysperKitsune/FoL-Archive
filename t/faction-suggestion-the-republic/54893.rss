            <p>While I would love for the Sheriff to work like that. It doesn’t and I’m not going to try to suggest we change that in every faction post I make Ad nauseum. Also making the sheriff work like that would not change the fact that it is a soft counter. Everything is a soft counter.</p>
<p>Plus the deduction isn’t with the sheriff knowing who is bad but rather everyone else knowing who is sheriff. It’s kinda the whole point of classes like Scorned to throw a wrench into that.</p>

            <p>There is something wrong with them.  Throne Of Lies is a game based around DEDUCTION.  Knowing what the opposing faction is at the start of the game is not deduction.  Smite is also overpowered.</p>

            <p>Eh, it prevents getting randomly killed by the Republic and lets the general lock him down preventing his kill/investigation.</p>
<p>And the kill he does have will realistically only see use like 5 times max assuming he’s able to divine who the general will use to attack. It’s the same problem as old smite - it’d be better just to check the guy.</p>

            <p>The description is right. One time Immunity is still Immunity.</p>
<p>It’s definitely more than anyone else gets automatically. Especially compared to Sheriff or Paladin</p>

<p>I would disagree. The Diplomat has immunity to the Republic’s attacks and his kill is Unlimited</p>

</aside>
<p>He has a one time immunity unless the description is wrong.</p>
<p>Also I thought Enforcer didn’t prevent. Huh. Well I’ll retract my complaint there then.</p>

<p>Yes. You would do this if you are paranoid about the Diplomat killing you. However it would leave him open to Knights or Hunter’s</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is only 3 classes that can prevent. The General’s only prevents a specific player under specific situations which can sometimes be incriminating anyway. So there are only 2 that can really use it effectively. If you look at the unseen you will see that there are 4 classes with visit prevention: Poacher, Enforcer, Sage and Sellsword.</p>
