    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Butcher (Rework)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-butcher-rework/2121</link>
    <description># [color=grey]Th[/color][color=red]e B[/color][color=grey]u[/color][color=red]tc[/color][color=grey]her[/color] - (Neutral Killer)

_Passive: Seeing [color=red]Red[/color]_
Nothing will stop your [color=red]Blood[/color] obsession, you are immune to death at night.

_Passive: [color=red]Blood[/color]y Mess_
You will spill [color=red]Blood[/color] on anybody that visits you as long as you are covered in [color=red]Blood[/color]. [color=red]Blood[/color] will appear in all Investigative results.

**Night Ability 1: Slaughter - Infinite uses**
You will slaughter your victim tonight, covering yourself and anybody visiting in [color=red]Blood[/color].

**Night Ability 2: Butcher - 2 uses**
You will butcher your target tonight, destroying any Journal they have created. Only you will get covered in [color=red]Blood[/color].

**Day Ability 1: Clean - 2 uses**
You will wash the [color=red]Blood[/color] off of yourself today.

**Day Ability 2: Wipe - 2 uses**
You will wipe some of the [color=red]Blood[/color] onto your target, covering them with [color=red]Blood[/color].

**Goal: Go on a murderous rampage and kill anyone that would oppose you, Blue Dragon, Unseen and even the Cult who&#39;re using [color=red]Blood[/color] in the wrong way!**

Lore: _&quot;If I don&#39;t kill somebody soon, I&#39;m going forget how! My knives are dry like bone and need to be dripping with [color=red]Blood[/color]!&quot;_

Once thought to be just an average local butcher, this individual became obsessed with [color=red]Blood[/color]. After watching carcass after carcass be dragged through his butchery, he wanted to see more. He offered locals to see his merchandise and lead them to their demise. He often bathed in their [color=red]Blood[/color], sometimes even painted portraits of his victims using their own [color=red]Blood[/color]. He was considered almost demonic.

Even The Cult considered The Butcher to be out of his mind. It was said that even Mithras denied any form of contact with The Butcher&#39;s mind. His obsession with [color=red]Blood[/color] was beyond any sort of mystical power. It made a lot of people sick. But little did they know, the [color=red]Blood[/color] obsessed Butcher found his way into Castle Adiart. His wrath will soon strike again...

Notes: 

- Currently, The Butcher is going to be used in SFoL6: The Brotherhood, but this one I&#39;ve reworked with a similar style that would be better fitted into Unseen/Cult games.
- In terms of Investigative - Princess would be somewhat of a counter to The Butcher&#39;s blood. If she sees &quot;Killer - Covered in [color=red]Blood[/color]&quot; - then she may have The Butcher. But if she sees &quot;Not a Killer - Covered in [color=red]Blood[/color]&quot; then it&#39;s not The Butcher.
Sheriff, Observer, Paladin and other Investigatives however, will see &quot;Covered in [color=red]Blood[/color]&quot; after their results.
- I did think about adding something extra, further the blood. Different stages to the blood. An example:
&gt; Stage 1 Blood: **Invest result** - Your target has blood on them
&gt; Stage 2 Blood: Your target has too much blood on them to detect anything

That being said, it could be too powerful for The Butcher.</description>

<p>Hmm, I seem to remember you being not-so nice in my threads. Which I am fine with; neither I or you should want praise for our roles, only constructive criticism.</p>

<p>But for real. Don’t make this about who has the better class suggestions. I put heartful effort and dedication into mine, making them clean and tidy. I even added colours and made sure my abilities made sense for the type of person the character is.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is off topic, say nice things about The Butcher!</p>

            <p>The Butcher can kill everynight and anybody that visits his victim is covered in blood that shows up on any investigative result. Not one, like Investigator. All of them. Anyone that visits The Butcher is then covered in blood.</p>
<p>The results will not be covered up because that itself is too powerful even for a ToL game.</p>

            <p>I did. I am suggesting that all investigators see is “you were distracted by your target being covered in blood”</p>

            <p>To make this better, it should be that blood REPLACES investigative results. This way blood is incriminating, but you can say it was smeared on you.</p>

            <p>Nah, just the person you visit. Because surely, if I’m not dead from the visit, then you’d know it’s not The Butcher anyway, right?</p>

            <p>Let me create a scenario</p>
<p>Jammy - Butcher<br>
Me - Butler<br>
You - Observer<br>
Noz - Princess</p>
<p>Jammy wipes blood on me during the day<br>
You watch me at night and Noz checks me</p>
<p>You will see “NozBugz visited your target tonight. Your target was also covered in Blood.”<br>
Noz will see “Your target is not a Killer. Your target was also covered in Blood.”</p>
<p>You will be made to think that I’m The Butcher because I’ve got blood on my hands but Noz will be able to confirm that I’m not because I’m not a Killer.</p>

            <p>So I am an Observer and watch who visits you. Jammy does. Do I see “Jammy, who was covered in blood visited your target, who was also covered in blood” or am i only informed if Jammy is covered in blood?</p>
<p>It’s being pedantic but its important to iron out exactly how mechanics work before starting a game with.</p>
