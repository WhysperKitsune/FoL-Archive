    <title>Delayed someone, yet they died</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/delayed-someone-yet-they-died/81754</link>
    <description>#### What happened? Delayed hunter, yet he still died. I believe he was reaped and the &quot;delayed&quot; message is a visual bug

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? He should&#39;ve lived (if he wasn&#39;t reaped)

#### Steps to reproduce: If he was reaped: The night the reaped person&#39;s body shows up, delay him with chrono
If he died to assa: No clue

#### Comments:

            <p>Problem is, the chrono themself was reaped so that didn’t happen</p>
<p>Also if that DID happen, it would show as Could Not Delay</p>

            <p>He might have been attacked by both an Assassin and a Reaper.</p>
<p>I’m 100% not sure if that allows for a successful delay but that’s the only situation I think this is possible.</p>
