</aside>
<p>Good ability, glad you didn’t forget the death immunity. The bleed thing is meh, maybe just switch it to bleed/poison immunity? Unless you want phys to see you bleeding and didn’t claim, outing you.<br>
Also I do like the seeing classes beside infected names. Gives you claimspace.</p>

<p>I thought this would be an ability… but ok? Maybe a bit unblanced,but no RNG, so that’s a plus</p>

</aside>
<p>How about making it see all infected whispers? Having 2 Uses for 1 person… kinda like combining Puppet Strings and Cult Spy, but putting the negative features on instead of the good features.</p>

<p>Personally, I’d decrease the time to 2 days recharge, but that’s me. Other then that, this ability is good</p>

<p>This plus the Passive seems a bit OP, but it’s situational, so i’ll Let it slide.</p>

<p>REEEEEEEE ANOTHER ARSO</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, this class is gonna be weaker then most NK’s. Just saying, as it faces a lot of the issues Arso faces</p>
