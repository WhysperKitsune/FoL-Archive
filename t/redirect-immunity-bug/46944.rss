    <title>Redirect Immunity Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/redirect-immunity-bug/46944</link>
    <description>#### As Invoker I tried to redirect Princess to myself the same night she WoW&#39;d King and got reaped but I got message that she was immune to target changing, and King got the WoW instead of me.

#### I was suppose to get her wisp.

#### Redirect a wisping Princess to yourself the night she gets reaped and wisps somebody.

#### This made me lose the game.

I posted the output log on Discord.  I also posted the output  log for a previous game where I was Paladin but immune to target changing by another Invoker.  At the moment Invoker is broken because of this since you will be executed for claiming Drunk ... your &quot;debs&quot; don&#39;t work.

Also sometimes phys and alch are redirect immune, no idea why.</description>

            <p>Maybe they were already occupied/debbed/redirected/jailed 3 times and they became immune for the rest of the game. That is known mechanics.</p>
