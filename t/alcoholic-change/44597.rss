    <title>Alcoholic Change</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/alcoholic-change/44597</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to suggest an alteration to the Alcoholics Debauchery.

Right now it works the exact same as the Drunks. However, this can prove very dangerous for the Alcoholic, who might (like I did) Deb a Sheriff and get outted instantly. 

I suggest changing the Alcoholic Deb slightly and make it so that the Alcoholic appears BD if they deb a Sheriff. That way the risk of doing it by accident is removed. The Alcoholic wouldn&#39;t KNOW they debbed a Sheriff either so might not do it again (and be found) and if they do know then a Sheriff would become suspicious as to why the same Drunk is forcing them to change their target over and over again.

I find this change would be most useful, as Alcoholic deb is less useful than the Drunks in terms of finding killers. The Assassin isn&#39;t going to be debbed (nor would they want to do this), so all you can possibly find with it is the Reaper or a yolo alchemist. 

It might be personal bias but I found myself useless as Alcoholic when I got it. I think I debbed a Sheriff instantly, one that was not out, so I didn&#39;t know to avoid them. Hope this suggestion is considered :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>a bigger thing also, assuming the sheriff wasn’t your first and only debauch of the game… and you aren’t dumb enough to be debauching a sheriff that’s claimed publicly. Suicide accuse the sheriff…</p>
<p>wait no I just debauched (sheriffs number) and was attacked, he’s trying to accuse me because he knows he’s busted.</p>

            <p>Agree. Suicide accusation is almost always a good idea when at the member cap. The more you do it the less likely a real accusation is to be trusted.</p>

            <p>The point of Debauchery is to see if they attack you/occupy a player. If they don’t know who the Drunk is, it doesn’t matter.</p>

            <p>Then you’re playing the game wrong in my opinion. You need to either kill yourself to give MM more room to convert via suicide accusation for instance or push for king to die so you can step up as evil king. If you stay at the 3 member limit you don’t kill as much as you could at night. Actually debbing the sheriff can be the correct play as that will surely get you killed during the day. I do not support this change.</p>

            <p>I agree, Alcoholic is pretty bad, only good point is that he has Noble Blood, but like Drunk cant be converted when he debauch CL, it would make sense for Alcoholic to appear BD for investigator.</p>
<p>Another idea would be to make it work like how debauch worked before, as a protective ability: You debauch someone and you become the target of these incoming abilities.</p>
