    <title>Neutral/Evil Kings and the Noble</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/neutral-evil-kings-and-the-noble/8150</link>
    <description>Had a game as Mastermind yesterday where we were way behind but I had a hunch the King wasn&#39;t good. I went all in and whispered him who I was and what my plan was. 

The problem was a Noble then immediately reported everything I said to the table.

This felt pretty bad and made me realize that an Evil or Neutral king is completely destroyed if there&#39;s a Noble listening in every day on what they&#39;re doing. Even if they find evil allies they&#39;re crippled by the Noble and there&#39;s no counter-play.

My backup plan was asking my other evil-doers to whisper other people to try to distract the Noble but by that point, it was too late.

Perhaps it would be balanced if the evil or neutral king had an ability to whisper in secret temporarily?</description>

<p>Because it completely relies on people whispering.</p>
<p>If people refuse to whisper, you just sit there doing nothing the whole game unless you survive to the VERY end where your ability to stop a voter has some value.  That said, I don’t mind the Noble, it just means an Evil King has to be careful what they whisper.  The bigger issue often is him then feeding it all to a Priest that he knows for sure is on his side after he dies, but that’s true for almost half the roster these days.</p>

            <p>I actually preferred the Alpha Nobles. They were a class that almost had to lie as BD so the evil team wouldn’t convert two players in a single night (Alpha Nobles used to get converted together if one of them was converted. If one of them died the other one died too.)</p>
<p>I didn’t like that they had Night Immunity though. They made the game swingey, but I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing. There are a ton of swingey elements in this game that aren’t talked about or addressed (Mastermind getting hanged day 2, Prince dying before Priest does, so many scenarios.)</p>
<p>I liked the night chat BD had with Nobles, but they couldn’t out themselves during the day. Was kinda interesting.</p>

            <p>I feel this is a real non issue to be honest . the noble is dull most of the time.<br>
the whole purpose of making the kings alignment unknown is to make it unknown.<br>
Removing features to make it easier to get round this key element of game design  seems counter intuitive .<br>
it’s currently a real risk to try as an unseen to communicate with a king , the walls have ears</p>

<p>Basically I think that when a Noble Maid spy’s you that you get the notification. “You notice someone eavesdropping you. ‘This could be from a Noble, Aristocrat or Apostle’”. You would get this message whenever someone uses an ability that would let them hear your whispers.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think this is a great suggestion and feels like it fits into the game design perfectly.</p>
<p>Making the Noble unique and implementing something like this would balance things out very well.</p>
<p>The only other suggestion I’d make is having the spy remain on the same target until you change it, like the Sheriff’s scout ability does.</p>
<p>It’s really frustrating having to interrupt my notes to retarget the king <em>every</em> <em>single</em> <em>day</em>.</p>

            <p>I was wanting to make the King be alerted if someone is spying him. I did say that the noble shouldn’t be able to target king, I said that the noble should have some limitations on spying on the king.</p>
<p>Basically I think that when a Noble Maid spy’s you that you get the notification. “You notice someone eavesdropping you. ‘This could be from a Noble, Aristocrat or Apostle’”. You would get this message whenever someone uses an ability that would let them hear your whispers. If you think that it is overpowered then it could only apply to the starting king or only apply to evil king or whatever.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of a unique class. Other than that, the noble is really only there to retain information the king receives so if king dies, the information is not lost, and to find out if a king is evil. Taking away ability to target the king takes away both of those purposes and the noble would be pointless. If king is evil, his first priority should be finding the noble and figuring out how to get him killed. Noble keeps evil king in check. If the noble became unique, which it should, evil king and unseen would wanna make noble their priority if they wanna communicate. Saying noble shouldn’t target king because then evil king can’t communicate they way he wants is like saying phys shouldn’t be able to heal because then unseen can’t successfully nightshade.</p>
<p>If you wanna successfully plot with evil king, get rid of nobles first.<br>
If you wanna be able to nightshade, get rid of phys and alch first.<br>
If you wanna kill people without getting debbached, find and target the drunk. (Whoever he debs that night will get exed… bonus!)</p>
<p>Etc</p>

            <p>Btw that restriction does not have to actually prevent the king from being targeted. It could just alert the kind when they are being spyied</p>

            <p>Yup, that’s what the noble does.  But there are ways around it.  If you’re Cult/Unseen and the King messages you saying “I confirmed you as BD.” the King is telling you “I’m an evil King, I know you’re cult, there’s a noble.”</p>
<p>That said, I don’t like intercepting communication as a mechanic generally. All it does is dissuade cooperation.  At least there is no Spy role that can list to evil at night, though.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t. Its very useful and it is currently implemented in a way that doesn’t negate the use of whispering entirely. One thing it might need is a restriction on targeting the king.</p>

            <p>Whisper-reading is pretty awful, might as well remove them entirely for all of the good it does tbh</p>
