<p><em>As the mist settles and the court of Castle Regalia settles down and discuss who they shall punish with their imperial might, a mysterious dark fellow appears. No one is sure who this person is but they apparently like to give themselves really cool, stupid, grammerful and cringey introductions. However, ignoring that, the unknown traveler provides the court with a piece of writing, detailed as “The Unknown Steps of Winning Together As Town.” No one is really sure whether this mysterious fellow can be trusted as they can be a part of the cunning Unseen or the bloodthirsty Cult, or even a crazed psychopath who wishes to see everyone dead, but they are providing some advice for town, now then, do we trust them and read the book? Well that’s up to you really, read at your own discretion.</em></p>

<p>My reads for now, these will most likely change<br>
an_gorta_pratai (Null) - Nothing much to say, Gorta appears to be one of those types who don’t type much, but idk. Opinions gonna change later probably<br>
Chloe (Slight Town Lean) - Seems to be overall towny right now, I would say has a decent amount of towny posts so far.<br>
Jane (Slight Scum Lean) - I feel like right now, Jane is questioning a lot of things, which is not a bad thing. However, to me, it is starting to feel more like nitpicking than actual questioning, and they have some meh posts, not town nor scum. This will change most likely, but I’m keeping it here for now<br>
Wazza (Non Poster)<br>
PsychoKang (Null) - They have some neutral posts in my opinion and nothing stands out about them right now. They’re also new so… I’ll keep it here for now<br>
Blizer (Null) - I actually can’t really remember anything about them to be honest.<br>
Centuries (Slight Scum Lean) - Has some interesting interactions I would say, nothing else much. Probably will change soon<br>
CRichard564 (Non Poster)<br>
EightySecond (Null) - Nothing stands out<br>
highway_101 (SLIGHTEST SCUMLEAN) - Their introduction was iddy, nothing else<br>
mathmods (Null) - Nothing stands out)<br>
Apprentice (Null)<br>
UnknownTraveler (Townread) - Highest townread, is town and must never reevaulatue.<br>
PokemonKidRyan (Null) - Thinking about it now, their interactions with Mode are getting more and more confusing for me, and I don’t really want to touch it right now.<br>
Anstreim (Null) - Some posts, then left, nothing much<br>
Arete (Null) - Nothing stood out either<br>
ModeShifter (Null) - Not touching the interactions for now, maybe later<br>

<p>This post pings me as off because lolfullnulllist, but could come from a newb townie. The issue is I don’t think UT is a new player and would know better. In fact they should know better if they read previous games and jotted down enough notes to makes that opening post.</p>

<p>Hello I am back…<br>
Ok so Wazza is pretty much right we did waste our entire Allies chat… it was sad. I was bluffing when I said we got a lot of things done, we didn’t. I mean I was pretty open but Seth and Wazza were kinda like silent I guess</p>

<p>It’s also odd having an almost full null list <strong>on d2</strong> when there was plenty of content to read and make reads from. In my opinion this is borderline unacceptable from a town PoV. It might be a newb thing, but I don’t think they are a newb</p>

<p>This post screams "hey, look at me! I totally didn’t think it was a cult game, so I can’t be cult.

<p>What pings me about this is that we think UT is new and they know all of this. It’s not super AI, but if you “noted down what town have screwed up on” you should have a decent understanding of terms. They also made that wall post from those notes it seems. Like I said I don’t SR them for pretending to be new, but for the content of the posts that they are getting a pass for</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>As the mist settles and the court of Castle Regalia settles down and discuss who they shall punish with their imperial might, a mysterious dark fellow appears. No one is sure who this person is but they apparently like to give themselves really cool, stupid, grammerful and cringey introductions. However, ignoring that, the unknown traveler provides the court with a piece of writing, detailed as “The Unknown Steps of Winning Together As Town.” No one is really sure whether this mysterious fellow can be trusted as they can be a part of the cunning Unseen or the bloodthirsty Cult, or even a crazed psychopath who wishes to see everyone dead, but they are providing some advice for town, now then, do we trust them and read the book? Well that’s up to you really, read at your own discretion.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Unknown Steps of Winning Together As Town</p>
<p><em>I have travelled many great distances, far and wide, many lands for I have seen great kingdoms tore down by evil people. It appears that the good people of this world require some help it seems. From what I have seen, town appears to lose matches quite often from time to time and I think we need to lay out some basics and such for this match to ensure town wins. I’m not forcing everyone to follow this but I would be very well appreciated if everyone could to ensure a nice town victory. Anyways, enjoy.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>We will make reads everyday<br>
Reads are very important to this game, so it is essential that we actually make them. What I request from everyone is to not necessarily make constant reads every second as that would just become fluff essentially, but to provide reads here or there. I would also like everyone to make sure that before or near EoD, they have a least posted one <strong>FULL READLIST</strong> . Basically, a full readlist is readlist and your opinions on everyone so far, which means literally everyone.</li>
<li>Marshal’s little tip about voting or something<br>
If you aren’t aware, our lord Marshal actually gave town a tip, which was to make sure nobody is ever at L1 because of the various vote manipulations that can occur in this FM. I would like everyone to follow this since it is generally good advice for a forum match like this.</li>
<li>Bussing happens… so beware, but not like too aware?<br>
Bussing is a thing scum can do, and it can happen. However, this does not mean that every “confirmed” invest must have been secretly a scum who bussed, all I am saying is that bussing is a thing that happens, so we mustn’t automatically town read or insta confirm every confirmed invest. If an invest to you has been generally towny and active, then you can say that they probably haven’t bussed. However, if an invest has been suspicious and suddenly comes up with a redcheck, you should be aware of bussing.</li>
<li>Slacking not good, sleep is good.<br>
Another thing I’ve noticed is that clearly, town likes to go after slackers because, well they are slacking and that is suspicious, and I don’t blame town for this, this is totally something I would do. So in order for us to make sure no town slackers get mislynced, we need town to not slack. I understand that people sleep, but try your best not to slack, it only hurts town more and gives scum another place to hide. Also, stay on topic most of the time, there will be understandably moments where we will start meming, but generally, try to post on topic stuff.</li>
<li>We will execute people for good reasons<br>
As town, we <strong>MUST</strong> have reasons for executing someone. I am really focusing on this because town mindlessly executing someone without reason is another thing that really hinders town from winning. Also, if a person who is the top lynch is able to provide actually good answers to all the reasons pointing to them, don’t just keep your vote the same, actually make a good decision and think about whether voting them is a good idea anymore, make a smart decision, not a dumb one.</li>
<li>The dead tell us something<br>
Very self explanatory, watch who is killed at night and try to think about the reasons scum would have, you know, <strong>KILLED THEM</strong> . Is it their reads? Who were they pushing? Any random theories they might have had that ignited a spark into scum for killing them? Think think THINK. Also, listen to what the dead says. If they say person A is good don’t exe him, then don’t exe them. Of course there are certain exceptions and situations where this might not apply but it’s generally good that we listen to the dead.</li>
<li>We Hunt The People behind the scheme, not the converts<br>
Pretty simple, make sure to hunt the MM/CL first, not the converts to make sure we save time and energy.</li>
<li>Claiming Bad<br>
Don’t claim… like ever until we reach the situation where we do need to confirm ourselves.</li>
<li>Analyze actions and behavioral changes<br>
I know this is kinda obvious, but like seriously, make sure to watch everyone’s moves everytime. Look into everyone’s basic motives for the things they do and try to notice any changes in someone’s behavior, as it might become very useful evidence later down the line.</li>
<li>Don’t try any fancy FPS’s<br>
Pretty easy, don’t try anything too fancy or you might end up a meme on this forum. Not sure if becoming a meme on this forum is that bad though but either way, try your best not to do anything scummy or suspicious as hell, for the betterment of town.</li>
<li>We fight with logic, facts, evidence, proof and simple deductions, not insults<br>
Something else I’ve noticed a lot is that town really likes to fight other people who disagree with them with insults. Don’t do this, actually try to convince them that you are right if you are town, and if you are wrong, well you are wrong, nothing wrong with that, we are human and we make mistakes, except me, <strong>I AM PERFECT AND I DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES</strong> .</li>
<li>
<strong>LOGS LOGS LOGS</strong><br>
I want everyone right now to have atleast something written in their logs to make sure that we can be absolutely confident as to whether someone had their logs flipped or not. Other than that, make sure you pay attention to logs, as those are the last things someone will ever give to us.</li>
<li>We ask questions<br>
If you are town, make sure to question literally everything. Ok maybe not, but still, if you are confused or want to make something clear, there is nothing wrong with more questions, all it does is make it more clear for town on what someone’s opinions on everything are, which helps avoid mislynches.</li>
<li>Opinions change<br>
Opinions do change, and we should not randomly say that someone is scum because someone’s opinion just changes. However, this does not mean we don’t read into why their opinion has changed. With a good townie, you should be able to understand 99% of the time why they had their opinions changed on something, but sometimes, we’re not all good townies and asking questions instead automatically scumreading them might work better.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that is it, hopefully we can win this town, let us get ready for the victory ahead of us</p>

<p>This is the first post they make, which could be pre-written/copied, but it looks semi unique in it’s wording. I know that pretending to be newb as experienced townies isn’t always AI, but let’s look at their other posts and see what they could get away with people thinking they are new.</p>

<p>My reads for now, these will most likely change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an_gorta_pratai (Null) - Nothing much to say, Gorta appears to be one of those types who don’t type much, but idk. Opinions gonna change later probably<br>
Chloe (Slight Town Lean) - Seems to be overall towny right now, I would say has a decent amount of towny posts so far.<br>
Jane (Slight Scum Lean) - I feel like right now, Jane is questioning a lot of things, which is not a bad thing. However, to me, it is starting to feel more like nitpicking than actual questioning, and they have some meh posts, not town nor scum. This will change most likely, but I’m keeping it here for now<br>
Wazza (Non Poster)<br>
PsychoKang (Null) - They have some neutral posts in my opinion and nothing stands out about them right now. They’re also new so… I’ll keep it here for now<br>
Blizer (Null) - I actually can’t really remember anything about them to be honest.<br>
Centuries (Slight Scum Lean) - Has some interesting interactions I would say, nothing else much. Probably will change soon<br>
CRichard564 (Non Poster)<br>
EightySecond (Null) - Nothing stands out<br>
highway_101 (SLIGHTEST SCUMLEAN) - Their introduction was iddy, nothing else<br>
mathmods (Null) - Nothing stands out)<br>
Apprentice (Null)<br>
UnknownTraveler (Townread) - Highest townread, is town and must never reevaulatue.<br>
PokemonKidRyan (Null) - Thinking about it now, their interactions with Mode are getting more and more confusing for me, and I don’t really want to touch it right now.<br>
Anstreim (Null) - Some posts, then left, nothing much<br>
Arete (Null) - Nothing stood out either<br>
ModeShifter (Null) - Not touching the interactions for now, maybe later<br>

<p>This post pings me as off because lolfullnulllist, but could come from a newb townie. The issue is I don’t think UT is a new player and would know better. In fact they should know better if they read previous games and jotted down enough notes to makes that opening post.</p>

<p>It’s a weak ping, but they are being cleared for crap like that. It comes off as pure and it is, but it isn’t AI</p>

<p>Don’t think these posts are really self-aware? You can see what they meant to say, it was just weird phrasing.</p>

<p>Possibly, but why would they say that if they didn’t know their comments were scummy to begin with? This is why I say they are too self aware for my tastes</p>

<p>There was one game in which I made a super scummy post and did recognize it after the fact, but that was when I made one of the worst plans ever and it almost cost me my life that game. So, I suppose it’s possible to recognize that you (yourself) are scummy. I just don’t like how they constantly recognize that they are scummy, but don’t try to improve, which is why I say they are self aware to begin with.</p>
