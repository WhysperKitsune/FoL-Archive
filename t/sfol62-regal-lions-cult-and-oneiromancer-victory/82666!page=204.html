<p>As everyone still living wakes up, a feeling of utter despair washes over them. Something terrible has happened. They can just feel it. This prompts a castle-wide investigation. What was found was a horror like no other.</p>
<p>Within the highest tower in the castle was the body of Chloe, drenched in blood and surrounded by glass. Her crystal ball appeared to have been shattered over her head.</p>
<p>Inside the tower on the other side, was the remains of PsychoKang, crushed under the weight of a meteor gone awry. Something had disturbed their magic.</p>
<p>In the medical ward was the body of EightySecond, an apparent wound found within their chest. And not too far from the medical ward was the clocktower, where one of the clockhands was replaced by the body of TheBlueElixir.</p>
<p>The remaining Regal Lions, distraught and shaken, vow to avenge their fallen allies!</p>

<p>CRich/PK coasters?</p>
<p>CRich being too easily cleared off of the basis they played poorly as scum. But in CRich’s game, they had pressure less then an hour in. They havent been analyzed at all here; I dont imagine it would be hard. They also havent done much reading and progression past early game, which is a lot like Mode as Senex; doing short ISOs to get TR’d and then halting because you dont need to is wolfy.</p>
<p>a case  <em>for</em>  PK I imagine would be based on tone, but thats a wack clear. If your town psycho, actually make reads; not sheeping VCs or the person above you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dont let the wolves twist NKA to make themselves look better; do it yourself</li>
<li>Exe should out; the PoE is too small.</li>
<li>Dont push Blizer/highway. Prob TvS, but do not waste time or the execution there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blizer + Centuries are delay vigged by Chloe and PK.<br>

So instead, <strong>I want everyone to post their reads and do it now.</strong></p>
