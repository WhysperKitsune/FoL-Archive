<ul>
<li>We will make reads everyday<br>
Reads are very important to this game, so it is essential that we actually make them. What I request from everyone is to not necessarily make constant reads every second as that would just become fluff essentially, but to provide reads here or there. I would also like everyone to make sure that before or near EoD, they have a least posted one <strong>FULL READLIST</strong> . Basically, a full readlist is readlist and your opinions on everyone so far, which means literally everyone.</li>
<li>Marshal’s little tip about voting or something<br>
If you aren’t aware, our lord Marshal actually gave town a tip, which was to make sure nobody is ever at L1 because of the various vote manipulations that can occur in this FM. I would like everyone to follow this since it is generally good advice for a forum match like this.</li>
<li>Bussing happens… so beware, but not like too aware?<br>
Bussing is a thing scum can do, and it can happen. However, this does not mean that every “confirmed” invest must have been secretly a scum who bussed, all I am saying is that bussing is a thing that happens, so we mustn’t automatically town read or insta confirm every confirmed invest. If an invest to you has been generally towny and active, then you can say that they probably haven’t bussed. However, if an invest has been suspicious and suddenly comes up with a redcheck, you should be aware of bussing.</li>
<li>Slacking not good, sleep is good.<br>
Another thing I’ve noticed is that clearly, town likes to go after slackers because, well they are slacking and that is suspicious, and I don’t blame town for this, this is totally something I would do. So in order for us to make sure no town slackers get mislynced, we need town to not slack. I understand that people sleep, but try your best not to slack, it only hurts town more and gives scum another place to hide. Also, stay on topic most of the time, there will be understandably moments where we will start meming, but generally, try to post on topic stuff.</li>
<li>We will execute people for good reasons<br>
As town, we <strong>MUST</strong> have reasons for executing someone. I am really focusing on this because town mindlessly executing someone without reason is another thing that really hinders town from winning. Also, if a person who is the top lynch is able to provide actually good answers to all the reasons pointing to them, don’t just keep your vote the same, actually make a good decision and think about whether voting them is a good idea anymore, make a smart decision, not a dumb one.</li>
<li>The dead tell us something<br>
Very self explanatory, watch who is killed at night and try to think about the reasons scum would have, you know, <strong>KILLED THEM</strong> . Is it their reads? Who were they pushing? Any random theories they might have had that ignited a spark into scum for killing them? Think think THINK. Also, listen to what the dead says. If they say person A is good don’t exe him, then don’t exe them. Of course there are certain exceptions and situations where this might not apply but it’s generally good that we listen to the dead.</li>
<li>We Hunt The People behind the scheme, not the converts<br>
Pretty simple, make sure to hunt the MM/CL first, not the converts to make sure we save time and energy.</li>
<li>Claiming Bad<br>
Don’t claim… like ever until we reach the situation where we do need to confirm ourselves.</li>
<li>Analyze actions and behavioral changes<br>
I know this is kinda obvious, but like seriously, make sure to watch everyone’s moves everytime. Look into everyone’s basic motives for the things they do and try to notice any changes in someone’s behavior, as it might become very useful evidence later down the line.</li>
<li>Don’t try any fancy FPS’s<br>
Pretty easy, don’t try anything too fancy or you might end up a meme on this forum. Not sure if becoming a meme on this forum is that bad though but either way, try your best not to do anything scummy or suspicious as hell, for the betterment of town.</li>
<li>We fight with logic, facts, evidence, proof and simple deductions, not insults<br>
Something else I’ve noticed a lot is that town really likes to fight other people who disagree with them with insults. Don’t do this, actually try to convince them that you are right if you are town, and if you are wrong, well you are wrong, nothing wrong with that, we are human and we make mistakes, except me, <strong>I AM PERFECT AND I DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES</strong> .</li>
<li>
<strong>LOGS LOGS LOGS</strong><br>
I want everyone right now to have atleast something written in their logs to make sure that we can be absolutely confident as to whether someone had their logs flipped or not. Other than that, make sure you pay attention to logs, as those are the last things someone will ever give to us.</li>
<li>We ask questions<br>
If you are town, make sure to question literally everything. Ok maybe not, but still, if you are confused or want to make something clear, there is nothing wrong with more questions, all it does is make it more clear for town on what someone’s opinions on everything are, which helps avoid mislynches.</li>
<li>Opinions change<br>
Opinions do change, and we should not randomly say that someone is scum because someone’s opinion just changes. However, this does not mean we don’t read into why their opinion has changed. With a good townie, you should be able to understand 99% of the time why they had their opinions changed on something, but sometimes, we’re not all good townies and asking questions instead automatically scumreading them might work better.</li>
</ul>
