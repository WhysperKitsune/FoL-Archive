    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Story of The Unseen</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-the-story-of-the-unseen/72485</link>
    <description>**The Unseen**

When I was a young lady, my life was easy and normal. I lived in a quite big family. I had eleven siblings, but only one lived until adulthood. He was my youngest brother. I was fifteen when he was born. We weren&#39;t rich, not at all. My father was a peasant, he worked in his whole life, while the king and his &quot;royal&quot; family was drinking wine, or having partys.
 
I did never like them, and nor did my father. He sope up against the old king, he told him that what he&#39;s doing, and how they live is wrong, and the whole kingdom might collapse because of them. That was my fathers biggest mistake. In the dark of the night, after we ate a little bit, they came. The earth was shaking while they were marching, all of us were scared. They were the king&#39;s men, and they took my father. They took the man who taught me everything. My mother kept screaming even after he was long gone.
 
On that day I swore an oath, that I&#39;ll avenge him, even if it takes my life. Time past, and the king died, _The Prince_ became _The King_. I am thirty years old now, and I had much time to think about a plan. I and my brother (who became my _Assassin_) are ready, to change this kingdom. We&#39;ll corrupt the rich, so they&#39;ll help us destroy our enemies, who want to keep this world as a rotting place. We don&#39;t know if the new King is with us, or not, but even he can&#39;t stop us now. I am _The Mastermind_, and if you think I will go down easily, you are dead wrong.

 (_The Mastermind_ has a criminal backstory, this is why _The Sheriff_ knows that they are evil. They need time tho to research about them, because they are smart enough to fake their own backstory. After _The Sheriff_ completes his research [N3] not even _The Mastermind_ can fool them. Why can _The Sheriff_ see the other unseen members, like _The Assassin_? Even if _The Assassin_ is the younger brother of _The Mastermind_, they&#39;re not as smart as them, and _The Mastermind_ can&#39;t help them, because then they would look suspicious. Also, _The Assassin_ is a very-very self-sacrificing man, so if he has to, he&#39;ll suicide just to help the Unseen out. He has no faith, only in his sister.)</description>

            <p>But the old Prince (that is now king) might not be just like the new one. They aren’t the same persons. There was an old king and an old prince (his son), and after the old king died came the new prince, who we don’t know much about.</p>
