    <title>Converting and Dying</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/converting-and-dying/107</link>
    <description>I have noticed in throne of lies, a big thing is the Convert mechanics I believe that these gameplay options are gonna be really unique however it will require a lot of balancing in order to make it work.

Firstly Because you have not specified what happens when the mastermind and The Assassin die, so I believe at the moment that when 1 dies a lower rank swaps their role for the dead 1. for example when the Assassin dies a non-killing black rose class changes to become the assassin so the black rose can still kill, or an assassin becomes a mastermind so they will still be able to get some members 

however, this can be a problem because if this happens a lot the grave will be filled with nothing but assassins and masterminds making the blue dragon unable to tell what Role&#39;s alive and what&#39;s dead anymore

my idea was this when a role dies that was changed from its original, not including the masterminds Convert ability so it stills shows their evil role when they die not their blue dragon role. 
it will instead show what they were when they died
for example, an assassin was killed so the newly appointed Servant is now changed to the assassin, however, he dies but when he dies he is shown to be a servant but with something like a symbol next to it so the blue dragon knows that he was a servant but he was changed into an Assassin or an assassin changed into a mastermind

this method could also work with the cult members so when one dies it shows its original class, however it would need to be a different symbol if a cult member was changed into the cult leader, so it still shows his starting class but it tells us that he was a cult leader, not a normal cult member 

doing this method would make the blue dragon a lot less confused when these types of roles are shown in the grave so it&#39;s not just cults and assassins in the grave.</description>

[/quote] Honestly it is a good idea you decided to switch it up. it only would have made the game more complex from both a design and actually playing the game</p>

            <p>Np teahacker. I just thought I’d fill in some redlinks while I was there.<br>
Well a 1-night cooldown certainly makes it less powerful. And the conversion immunity is there too… Okay that works, thanks <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It does have a 1-night cooldown. I’ll make sure it’s added to the wiki. I think the cooldown only activates when he actually converts someone, I’ll check the code and make sure.<br>
We’ve been having someone go through and update the wiki. I recently did the class cards and there were a lot of changes, so some things might’ve been left out. I’ll check it all when I have some free time.</p>

            <p>I have also noticed that in some cases online(as in not including the wiki)</p>
<p>that the masterminds Convert ability has a 1-night cool down which makes getting rid of a member that much worst.<br>
also, I was wondering that if the mastermind targets a convent immune character does he still have to wait the 2 nights? or is he able to Convert the next night</p>
<p>also as a suggestion when you post a video like the class cards etc. could you also update the wiki to reflect the changes? thanks just wondering</p>

</aside>
<p>Many classes are <strong>immune</strong> to being converted (they don’t have a converted class) - so let’s say 1 black rose gets himself killed. Well, 3 rounds may go by and he <em>could</em> get no one! It’s quite risky. The risk shouldn’t, in theory, be worth it.</p>
<p>The risk/reward is out there, if they want it, but it would not be wise in most situations.</p>

What I mean is: if a new Black Rose member is recruited, they could accuse a Blue Dragon, get them executed and then be executed themselves - which wouldn’t benefit the Blue Dragons a great deal, since the Mastermind will next night replace that member. On the other hand, the Black Rose has just successfully got rid of a target - if the Black Rose picks accusations carefully they could deal with most of the Detective-like roles quickly, right?<br>
(Correct me if I’m wrong, may have missed a key mechanic)</p>

            <p>Nobody converts to the Mastermind when he dies. If the Assassin dies and there is another non-MM member, then they’ll be converted to Assassin. If there’s only the MM left, then the next person he recruits ends up becoming the Assassin immediately.<br>
As for keeping the original class name, that wouldn’t be too hard to implement. We’ll talk it over. Thanks for the feedback/ideas.</p>

            <p>I have noticed in throne of lies, a big thing is the Convert mechanics I believe that these gameplay options are gonna be really unique however it will require a lot of balancing in order to make it work.</p>
<p>Firstly Because you have not specified what happens when the mastermind and The Assassin die, so I believe at the moment that when 1 dies a lower rank swaps their role for the dead 1. for example when the Assassin dies a non-killing black rose class changes to become the assassin so the black rose can still kill, or an assassin becomes a mastermind so they will still be able to get some members</p>
<p>however, this can be a problem because if this happens a lot the grave will be filled with nothing but assassins and masterminds making the blue dragon unable to tell what Role’s alive and what’s dead anymore</p>
<p>my idea was this when a role dies that was changed from its original, not including the masterminds Convert ability so it stills shows their evil role when they die not their blue dragon role.<br>
it will instead show what they were when they died<br>
for example, an assassin was killed so the newly appointed Servant is now changed to the assassin, however, he dies but when he dies he is shown to be a servant but with something like a symbol next to it so the blue dragon knows that he was a servant but he was changed into an Assassin or an assassin changed into a mastermind</p>
<p>this method could also work with the cult members so when one dies it shows its original class, however it would need to be a different symbol if a cult member was changed into the cult leader, so it still shows his starting class but it tells us that he was a cult leader, not a normal cult member</p>
<p>doing this method would make the blue dragon a lot less confused when these types of roles are shown in the grave so it’s not just cults and assassins in the grave.</p>
