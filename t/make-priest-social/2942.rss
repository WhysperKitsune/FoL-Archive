    <title>Make Priest Social</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/make-priest-social/2942</link>
    <description>Priest has some support abilities, but it&#39;s main ability is to talk to the dead. The main reason why I want to change it is because of the cult. The class that the priest currently becomes is the ritualist. It would make more sense if the priest became an apostle because then they can still talk to the dead. In regards to other things not much changes. Princess is unaffected and the duchess/seeker aren&#39;t any more interested in social vs support much of the time. This also makes there be 3 convertible social and 3 convertible support.</description>

            <p>Troll box is fun. Im not really sure how to use it right but I’m sure others will figure it out as the meta develops. Especially since the scorned will have it.</p>

            <p>Seconded.</p>
<p>Also, change the Scorned and Fool to social. No need for a Wildcard type right now.</p>
