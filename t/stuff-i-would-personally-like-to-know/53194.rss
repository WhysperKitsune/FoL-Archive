    <title>Stuff I Would Personally Like To Know</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/stuff-i-would-personally-like-to-know/53194</link>
    <description>Okay here is what I would PERSONALLY like to know to see how things interact

- A 1v1 ladder resolve 

- A OoO(Order Of Operations) which is public so we know what classes act first.

-  Why there are so many good class ideas that are not being implemented (Yes I know it takes time to code but for real, there have been MANY classes during Beta/Alpha that would be great to see in the game. I.E Maid and others that I can&#39;t remember. It feels like you are ignoring good classes imo)
- A Torando killing the killer, (I.E Cw redirects assassin to himself. Cannot remember if this has been said but I&#39;m forgetting)

- Why does scorned commit seppuku after she wins? Maybe she gets a gold bonus if she gets BOTH targets lynched?</description>

<p>This is ToL not epicmafia</p>
<p>If they implement new classes every patch, you can throw balance out of the window</p>
