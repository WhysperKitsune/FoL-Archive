    <description>## Disclaimer: I am not intending to majorly buff or nerf the chrono. I am also trying to make as little reworks as possible to achieve my goal in this thread

---

So the chronomancer was just added to Icibalus&#39;s delight. However there is just one issues with him: He is redundant with the Physician

Now I&#39;m not saying that anti-death is impossible to be unique from other anti death. I&#39;m just saying that a gimmick doesn&#39;t really do that in a satisfying way

Solution? Give Time Warp things it can stop that heal can&#39;t and things heal can stop that Time Warp can&#39;t.

There are multiple solutions to this but first here is the Knight and Physician and what they CAN&#39;T stop (besides execution):

Physician: Reap, Frenzy, RE, Possess, CW Empower

Knight: CoD, Poison/Bleed, Bomb, Frenzy, Knight/Hunter

So my goal is to create a list that is different from both of these

Simplest solution is to let it stop heal bypass but not death immunity bypass. So the list would be:

Chrono: Empower Reap, Frenzy, Bomb, Poison/Bleed, Knight/Hunter

However now it is almost identical to the Knight but replace CoD with Empower Reap. So we need some other solution. For example it could stop any and all direct attacks no exception but nothing else:

Chrono: CoD, Poison/Bleed, Bomb, Knight/Hunter

Now this is just a buffed Knight. Still not what we want. 

So, working from scratch we want a protective ability that both A: Makes sense somewhat, B: Blocks things that heal doesn&#39;t and things that defend doesn&#39;t C: Doesn&#39;t block some things that heal and defend block and D: Blocks normal attacks

Failing that it should at least be better at blocking something even if it can be blocked by something else, for example Puppet strings can be blocked by Knight but it is better to block it with Physician.

Since plan A isn&#39;t feasible without arbitrary conditions ect we can instead make it&#39;s utility relatively unique

This my final proposition (for now):

Time Warp delays ALL forms of death at night (besides suicide) BUT delayed attacks are unstoppable except by redirect or reaper souls/possessor jump and thus must either redirect it or let the target die. This ought to make Chrono less of a straight up protective and puts more emphasis on her other aspects since she cannot be countered in the same way as a physician but is also more vulnerable to every single other method of anti protective (occupy, visit prevention, redirection, killing the chrono, ect) 

It also would have bonus utility for kill setups with Knight along the lines of Drunk HH


*ok fine I did want to buff him a little*</description>

            <p>I mean. Without a full reworks it is going to be at least a little redundant. While I would be ok with a full rework it is also the equivalent of giving up in this context.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer: I am not intending to majorly buff or nerf the chrono. I am also trying to make as little reworks as possible to achieve my goal in this thread</h2>
<hr>
<p>So the chronomancer was just added to Icibalus’s delight. However there is just one issues with him: He is redundant with the Physician</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying that anti-death is impossible to be unique from other anti death. I’m just saying that a gimmick doesn’t really do that in a satisfying way</p>
<p>Solution? Give Time Warp things it can stop that heal can’t and things heal can stop that Time Warp can’t.</p>
<p>There are multiple solutions to this but first here is the Knight and Physician and what they CAN’T stop (besides execution):</p>
<p>Physician: Reap, Frenzy, RE, Possess, CW Empower</p>
<p>Knight: CoD, Poison/Bleed, Bomb, Frenzy, Knight/Hunter</p>
<p>So my goal is to create a list that is different from both of these</p>
<p>Simplest solution is to let it stop heal bypass but not death immunity bypass. So the list would be:</p>
<p>Chrono: Empower Reap, Frenzy, Bomb, Poison/Bleed, Knight/Hunter</p>
<p>However now it is almost identical to the Knight but replace CoD with Empower Reap. So we need some other solution. For example it could stop any and all direct attacks no exception but nothing else:</p>
<p>Chrono: CoD, Poison/Bleed, Bomb, Knight/Hunter</p>
<p>Now this is just a buffed Knight. Still not what we want.</p>
<p>So, working from scratch we want a protective ability that both A: Makes sense somewhat, B: Blocks things that heal doesn’t and things that defend doesn’t C: Doesn’t block some things that heal and defend block and D: Blocks normal attacks</p>
<p>Failing that it should at least be better at blocking something even if it can be blocked by something else, for example Puppet strings can be blocked by Knight but it is better to block it with Physician.</p>
<p>Since plan A isn’t feasible without arbitrary conditions ect we can instead make it’s utility relatively unique</p>
<p>This my final proposition (for now):</p>
<p>Time Warp delays ALL forms of death at night (besides suicide) BUT delayed attacks are unstoppable except by redirect or reaper souls/possessor jump and thus must either redirect it or let the target die. This ought to make Chrono less of a straight up protective and puts more emphasis on her other aspects since she cannot be countered in the same way as a physician but is also more vulnerable to every single other method of anti protective (occupy, visit prevention, redirection, killing the chrono, ect)</p>
<p>It also would have bonus utility for kill setups with Knight along the lines of Drunk HH</p>
<p><em>ok fine I did want to buff him a little</em></p>
