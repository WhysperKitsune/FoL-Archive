    <title>Illusionist Buff</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/illusionist-buff/58278</link>
    <description>With the new Noble incoming, I feel like Illusionist needs a buff/rework(she&#39;s been needing one for a while now anyway). So, my proposed suggestion is to give Illusionist unlimited uses of Conduit and a passive to allow her to use both night abilities at once, making BD have to be more wary of Conduits and giving Illusionist a slightly easier time fake claiming.</description>

            <p>I suggest that mental blur cleans both chat history and logs to make it a lot stronger. That way, people have no way to catch up on the chat they now miss. This could be used in conjunction with the assassin to give BD no logs information. So mental blur occurs before being killed. The argument could be made that private notes solves the former a bit, but that argument could also be made for the chat disappearing or people writing it in a third party program or copying all the chats there for instance.</p>

            <p>Infinite Uses of Conducts?<br>
I’m not sure about that. If you want stick to Mystic claim after conversion, you’re probably aware of that someone would ask to use “Link” instead of “Conduct”, which is a dead giveaway since you can’t confirm yourself. Obviously “Mental Blur” need replacement but i would think about somethin’ else.</p>
