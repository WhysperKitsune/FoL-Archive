            <p>I agree with the Psychic Illusionist, but maybe not the Apostle. But I think Psychic should stay unique. Psychic’s chill is exactly like at night, so I understand why they’re immune to it. I don’t get the Reaper’s reap that kills them instantly though.</p>

            <p>it doesn’t die from chill, it is immune to it, why? Because it feels weird that it can happen to it same with troll box, what I was trying to say is that if a reaper reaped a psychic it wouldn’t stay alive it would auto die</p>
<p>Psychic is already confirmable so I see no problem with that, also what about illusionist or psychic converted into apostle, it can’t confirm that their psychic bud has been converted</p>
<p>Have you seen the abilities I’m gonna come up with, once you see them then say it’s boring or not</p>

            <p>The thing I like about this is, if your Illusionist you should be able to link still. Bc if u get converted, u’ll die.</p>

            <p>Psychic change is weird. Why make it immune to Trollbox and die of Chill?</p>
<p>Also 2 psychics could confirm each other via dead chat.</p>
<p>As for Noble, omniscient whisper knowledge is just too powerful. And it has abilities, and people would consider it boring.</p>
