    <title>Voting for classes (VFC/VFR)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/voting-for-classes-vfc-vfr/2550</link>
    <description>Pros of voting for classes as blue dragon:

-catch scum with the holes in their log (through observer, etc.) and get princess to know if their claim fits within her results (if they have invested them before). Especially good for finding cult/MM because they won&#39;t know what the princesses second result will be, and their are no claims within &quot;special&quot;
-let investigative classes know who is best to investigate for scummy claim (like knight) 
-confirm players like butler (by using concentrated wine)
-Sheriff/paladin will know who to skip over for investigations (prince)

cons:
-potentially reveal important classes (prince, sheriff/paladin, etc.) to unseen/cult so they can make more informed conversions/kills
-if an important class (prince/sheriff) is put on trial and claims, and the king is evil + suicidal, he could decide fate to execute them.

In my **opinion** (don&#39;t get triggered) voting for classes is a good strategy if you have enough knights/physicians/alchemists</description>

            <p>Dew, while I respect you for all the effort you put into that post and that you took the time to join our community to post it, I still do not agree with VFC.</p>
<p>Yes, while high rank players will find it fun, ToL does not have a ranked system and it’s doubtful to get one.</p>
<p>I’ve played over 600 hours of ToS in ranked, and I was once apart of many “VFR” sessions, admittedly to me, they were very boring on both ends.</p>
<p>It makes the game not-fun anymore if you make it too easy for BD to find the scum within the votes/trials.</p>
<p>Late game, I completely understand. But at that stage, I wouldn’t call it Voting for Class, it’s deduction. If say, there are like, 5/6 people left, then yeah, it’s narrowing down your last options.</p>
<p>What Norm wants is completely off my radar. VFC from the start/early stage of the game.</p>
<p>I still do not want VFC to become a thing in ToL. Not as BD, not as Unseen, not as a Neutral, not even as a King.</p>
<p>Also.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Dew_the_Do]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Didn’t I mention that somewhat in that massive wall of text I posted earlier(I hope it was decent to read that wall of text BTW =D).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As stated. Voting for Classes is a lazy way of playing the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s much less satisfying to sit around and wait for sheriff to find a Possessor or something, than it is to deduce voting patterns, see the validity of CCs and force everyone to be active and claiming and counter claiming roles, which is doubly useful in a game with alignment-changing roles”</p>
<p>“Even if you get a BD lynched, the votes will most likely reveal several evils who obviously will guilty. If you cannot get any information out of a misslynch, such as voting patterns, you are not a very good scumreader.”</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, please watch those linked games. As I said in the post ToS and ToL have many differences to each other, but the fundamentals aren’t that different. Do those VFR games against a lobby that’s filled with mostly high-level players look boring to you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As stated. Voting for Classes puts your faction at danger against a smart scum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copied from main post:<br>
"Blue Dragon can totally use that information to their advantage as well.<br>
Why everyone just assume evils/scum benefits from information? You reveal Prince(!)? Ok, not the greatest result ever obviously, but now a Knight, or Observer, or a Good King knows who’s the Prince. Scum has to kill the Knight first if they want to get rid of the Prince.</p>
<p>If they try to convert, then kill Prince, it’s obvious whether Obs/Knight was converted because if Knight wasn’t enforcer than he would’ve protected Prince. If Obs was converted he’ll have to make stuff up.<br>
If scum claims something protective/observer, they can’t kill the Prince if they don’t want to be confirmed scum. A Good King surely would send a guard to protect the Prince, right?"</p>
<p>This is one of the infinite examples VFR does. Start watching what VFR gives to BD, instead of crying about what it gives to scum. It’s a great way for BD to try and deduce what the hell is going on. "</p>
<p>Something that isn’t from the wall of text, if Reaper uses Chilling Touch on a BD and he gets lynched, you know for sure Reaper is in the game and that makes Killer/Offensive claims scummy, but those roles are semi-confirmable as stated above, based on their Journals and their actions.</p>
<p>Also not said in the big post, if BD has lost majority, then that’s perfect time for Prince or Knight (for example) to shine! They can scumread the voting information, deduce 2 guys are super scummy, then Execute or Cold Steel them right!? Losing lynching via a fool isn’t as bad because most evils would vote a Fool guilty, while BD shouldn’t. Also, Killing Classes and RB’ing scummy people would be incredibly helpful to ensure the scum doesn’t snowball if possible. How to deal with a Krazy Evil King (or kek for short) is something I’m too slepy to commit the brain power to right now.</p>
<p>Whichever side is active <em>ALWAYS, ALWAYS</em> has an advantage over the side that is playing passive. If BD is VFCing (I like the term “scumhunting” because that’s what it is at it’s core), than Evils have to also be active and proactive or else they lose.</p>
<p>Watch the videos I linked if you haven’t did those look boring and unfun to you? Or is sitting around waiting for a lucky RB/Jail/Cold Steel/Investigation and just doing nothing more interesting.</p>
<p>“B-But you can totally scumread the baddies! You don’t have to wait for an Invest result!”</p>
<p>Want to know an amazing way to scumread people with high accuracy? VOTING PATTERNS! If people are just waiting for those lucky rolls so to speak, than it isn’t that scummy for someone to be silent early on because there’s hardly anything to discuss.</p>
<p>I just want to wrap this stuff up here. It seems you muted the thread while I was halfway done typing this typo-filled gibberish D=! I just wanted to somewhat complete it anyway. I’m too sleepy =oP (Tried to make a derpy emoticon there).</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ropestringface">@RopeStringFace</a> I think that statement was uncalled for and not very relevant to this discussion. People that make those sweeping generalizing statements almost always consider themselves exempt from being (in this case, an idiot themself) because of special pleading or what-have-you.</p>

            <p>By the way, just a side note because it pissed me off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My quote</strong>: “most people are idiots.” being currently the dumbest ‘contribution’ to your own thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Norm’s response</strong>: you have said things like this many times. this particular statement has not had it’s reasoning provided; this is pure dogma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never once called “most people” idiots. I have a lot more respect for people that this. You can’t say shit like “oh he said it so i can say it” because it doesn’t work that way, even if I had said something like that, which I’ll say again, I have not.</p>
<p>I’m curious to thinking, do you think that anybody who doesn’t VFC is an idiot? Because more than “most people” don’t use VFC. Mainly because “most people” like to enjoy the game and not have it ruined by constant trials and prolonged games of just guessing if somebody is telling truth or lie one after another. I bet “most people” actually prefer not VFC’ing. “most people” I know actually hate VFC, that we mock those who attempt it ingame.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is, by saying “most people are idiots” you are insulting the general population of Throne of Lies and I still haven’t seen an apology.</p>
