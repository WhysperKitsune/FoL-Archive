    <title>My Knight changes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/my-knight-changes/32382</link>
    <description>* Replace armored with
 
&gt; Savior - if you are attacked at night, then you will be the only one affected by the attack(ex: If a CL eradicates you, then you will be the only player to die).  Note: If multiple players with this passive die because of the same attack, then only players with this passive will die. 

 Armored helps a bit, but it&#39;s not enough.  
* Add a new passive:

&gt; Retaliate - If you are killed at night, then you will kill your attackers and everyone who visits you.  Bypasses night immunity

This is to help against defiling and fire walls.  

* Change cold steel so that it kills both the BD and you if you attack a BD.  This is just a small nerf to balance out the two new passives.  This is also to prevent other players from being confirmed by the knight.

* Rename Sacrifice to Bodyguard since cult leader already has an ability names Sacrifice</description>

            <p>savior I have no objections to. Seems perfectly reasonable as a passive.</p>

<p>That’s why I made it unique, to reduce the chances of the unseen dying to it.  I do like it being a limited use day ability instead of a passive though.  Is the other passive fine?</p>

</aside>
<p>Phys sheriff pali agreed on. You got the rest of my “like 3 classes”</p>
<p>Observer, sure works great, so long as your log can avoid happening to have watched anyone who was visited or visited anyone on the night you are claiming to see things… in other words, only if BD is asleep, or doesn’t care for a log.</p>
<p>Hunter, wolf is pretty darn provable. It’s unique, meaning you set yourself up for CC if he claims it.</p>
<p>Princess, kind of… even faking your buddy getting a whisp is a vulnerability (anyone who visited you can point out the lack of info there). and the lack of knowledge of classes that haven’t public claimed if you are anything but MM or duchess.</p>
<p>I will however conceed that the return of the old CW returns him into this category. So we’re up to 4 solid fake claims.</p>
<p>Either way the key point is, knight has to stay fake claimable.  We need more fake claimable classes right now, not less.</p>
<p>far as the rest, I’m not a fan of them. I can’t say I like the idea of a landmine that litterally takes no actual skill or planning on the knights part. Maybe as a 1 or 2 time use daytime ability or something. You pointed out defile as an example of what it’s good for… can you really say it’s exactly fair to slaughter 2/3rds of the unseen for chosing to attack randomly? also involving zero skill or anticipation on the knights part.</p>

            <p>Observer is hard to fake and the Hunter can use wolf to prove. Also the Princess needs to know who visited her in addition to having a second unseen to back her up.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d say a 100% no to this one… knight is one of like 3 classes in the game that isn’t completely disprovable on claim. Making it unique makes it a fools claim.</p>
