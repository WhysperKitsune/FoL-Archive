    <title>Band-aid reward for NK</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/band-aid-reward-for-nk/51071</link>
    <description>What do you all think about a small gold reward for each kill before the NK dies? This devalues the &#39;win&#39; objective for NKs, but I do think this would give some satisfaction for simply taking out as many people possible. Thoughts? I also apologize if this has been suggested.</description>

            <p>It’s not a big deal if you lose. If you play for the gold, you are doing it wrong. You should play because it is fun.</p>
<p>NK doesn’t win often, but it’s a great experience and helps the game flow.</p>
<p>The system is fine now.</p>

            <p>Alternative suggestion:  If the NK loses, give them 5 extra gold for every night they survived after the third, up to a maximum of 25 gold (so they get 70 total from 25 + the base 45 for losing, meaning winning always gives them more.)</p>
<p>That has zero chance of warping their goal (because an NK always wants to survive anyway), but rewards NKs who lasted to the end a bit better than NKs who died early.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I absolutely agree Biper. I have been trying to figure out a way to make NK somewhat rewarding for making it into mid / late-game because winning is very very difficult at the moment.</p>

            <p>It warps their main goal. Suppose I’m possessor. Sometimes I might not kill someone night one just to get the hypothesis of a reaper game going. With this strategy, a lot of delaying tactics might not be a good idea (for someone who wants gold)</p>
<p>Also, while this could be a counterpoint to my first argument, gold isn’t really that valuable in ToL. I know I play to win, not  for the upgrades.</p>
