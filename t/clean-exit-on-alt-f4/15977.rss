    <title>Clean exit on Alt-F4</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/clean-exit-on-alt-f4/15977</link>
    <description>Currently, alt-f4 crashes the game and one must go through the &quot;not responding&quot; dialog to exit.

Yes, I know, there&#39;s an exit button. However, it is standard practice for applications to exit cleanly on alt-f4, and many people (including me) use this method a lot.</description>

            <p>Also I noticed that clicking “X” top right-hand corner crashes as well.  I think this topic should be moved to bugs/reports</p>
