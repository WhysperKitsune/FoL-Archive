            <p>So… Psychics can link people in jail again, but I don’t see it in the patch notes?</p>
<p>Are other things getting through like faction checks?</p>
<p>We had a dude that claimed he checked someone in jail and he was fishy as hell even before that, so we assumed he was cheating.  But… maybe his check would land?</p>

            <p>Overall I like the changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will no longer receive messages saying someone tried to occupy them or change their target if it was blocked by the Court Wizard’s barrier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a step in the right direction, though I’m not sure why we can’t just remove these kind of notification in all cases. It does nothing but make occupying/redirecting classes too easy to confirm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snoop and Listen In removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a little sad, I think the Marshal does lose some personality.<br>
Also, Listen In was a really interesting ability, it’s a pity to see it gone.</p>
<p>Just a random suggestion, why don’t you give Listen In to the Seeker, in lieu of Identify (which feels pretty useless, an entire ability that does nothing but help you find Neutral players?).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability Snoop - Read a player’s journal. 2 uses. (This has been improved from the Marshal’s version. There are now two journal buttons on the right that will display the snooped players’ journals).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think this is an elegant solution, it feels very appropriate for a Social class. Guess I will have to start writing journals as evil though, up until this point I never wrote anything in my logbook when I was evil (I just used my private notes for everything).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I like the changes, but I still think that when you are healed multiple times you should only see one “You were healed” message, since currently it makes it easy to know how many healers are there in the game.</p>
<p>Also, its not in the patch notes but looks like psychic can link jailed targets now. Is this intended?</p>
<p>Edit: Also, Ive noticed you cannot use Noble Twin when someone is on trial, you have to use it before they are put on trial. Is this intended or a bug? You would think you could use it during a trial since the point of the ability is to give you an extra vote for pardon or execution.</p>

            <p>I think king should have allies replaced with one of nobles old abilities “Order” or “Royal Decree”. It makes more sense thematically to have the king control voting instead of being the best investigator in the whole court.</p>

            <p>The entire playstyle of the Cult is to be expendable and then get old members removed to make room for new people and to provide the Cult Leader with more killing power. It’s not meant to be a carbon copy of the Unseen except with weaker abilities and 4 people.</p>

            <p>Your argument for the cult being underpowered is only “they have limited uses”, but that’s hardly a handicap with how the cult is played. It seems that you’d rather have the cult be a different kind of faction without a sacrifice mechanism and have the classes have infinite use abilities, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to be a common complaint so it’s unlikely to change.</p>

            <p>the fact that the cult members are expendable means that they can go nuts during the day cuz they will die anyway. Its more fun that you would think.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you consider the cult to be underpowered (I’d even consider it stronger than Unseen in your average game) but as I said earlier, cult abilities are limited because they’re meant to get sacrificed further down the line. On top of that, Gaze tells the Cult what kind of cultist they will get if they choose to convert that person, which can be really useful.</p>

<p>The cult is underpowered because most of the cult classes are useless.  All of a faction’s classes shouldn’t have limited uses.</p>

<p>The cult is designed to have expendable members that need to be replaced often. The fact that all of them have strictly limited use ability’s except CL is how this is represented.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Late game this is actually fairly powerful. Say with four people: 2 BD (one being a noble), a neutral King and an Unseen, the Neutral King uses The Royal Finger on the non-noble, and the Unseen votes as well. The Noble is able to use this too give two pardon votes against their two executes, causing a pardon on that Blue Dragon member. If that member is capable of getting rid of the Unseen or the BD members get the King to vote with them, they just avoided a loss. It’s situational, sure, but an extra vote can really make a different.</p>

<p>This is a bit overpowered for a BD class.  A lot of players will have no journal or have multiple claims when they’re evil.  Just replace it with royal decree.  Also, it should be given back to Marshal.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s the fault of the evil player then. As scum, you should keep a journal with your “main” claim in it, and store any “side” claims in your private notes. It’s more effective that it might let on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should be unlimited.  The cult is underpowered, and gaze isn’t even that strong.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure why you consider the cult to be underpowered (I’d even consider it stronger than Unseen in your average game) but as I said earlier, cult abilities are limited because they’re meant to get sacrificed further down the line. On top of that, Gaze tells the Cult what kind of cultist they will get if they choose to convert that person, which can be really useful.</p>

            <p>Just a sidenote, it’d be better if you explain why you want these changes and not just say “this should be like that”.</p>
<p>Not saying anything in support or against your claims, just that you should provide some reasoning for them.</p>

            <p>I would say a better way to “control” an Evil King would be to remove Allies and to bring back Royal Bloodlines so that deduction becomes a part of the game, not full control under a Noble or Aristocrat</p>
<p>And if not even that, then some form of Private Matter or other Support/Social would be perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Without Allies, the King wouldn’t have that direct connection to Evils that you’re worried about.</p>
