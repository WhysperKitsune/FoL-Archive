    <title>Usage of VAC (Valve&#39;s Anti-Cheat System)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/usage-of-vac-valves-anti-cheat-system/682</link>
    <description>I feel people may begin to attempt cheating on Throne of Lies upon release, as it&#39;s client based. 

Perhaps VAC would be beneficial?

            <p>Ye. I bought ARK from G2A and it was sent to me as a gift copy.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="mention" href="/u/anon98616575">@anon98616575</a> bought me a copy of Armello (very nice of him), and sent it via a gift copy and Armello is a VAC-enabled game.</p>
