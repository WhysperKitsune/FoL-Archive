    <title>Is there a valid strategy in jumping N1?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/is-there-a-valid-strategy-in-jumping-n1/68507</link>
    <description>It seems to me that the worst action you can take that first night as Possessor is to jump to someone else. Even doing nothing (if you plan to claim a class that doesn&#39;t visit) seems marginally more viable. Is there some strategy in doing this that doesn&#39;t give away that it&#39;s a Possessor game?

I&#39;m asking because it might genuinely improve the class&#39;s win rate to just disable Facelift on D1 and Possession on N1.</description>

            <p>Agreed, never jump as a Paladin/Sheriff as they are not a threat to you and can help eliminate your other enemy - Cult or Unseen. you want the Paladin and Sheriff alive to some extent. They can clear you as NS and even the odds in your favor.</p>

<p>But if you are going to do it, might as well cramp up princesses, who are unconfirmable and are more of a threat to you than other classes in finding you. This is only beneficial if there are 2 Princesses, yes, but same counts for sheriff/paladins. How would jumping as sheriff/paladin change anything in the game? It is the same kind of gambit, but with a class that is less of a threat towards you.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this and yoloing into unguarded King N1 are the only two valid strategies I’ve seen so far that justify Possession N1.</p>
<p>They are still very risky and likely to backfire. Even a class that’s difficult to confirm, like the Knight or an Investigative class, can end up confirming themselves out of sheer luck (like a Knight killing an Assassin or a Paladin smiting a Cult Leader).</p>
<p>I wish we had more accurate statistics so that we could see, for example, if using Posession N1 drops your chances of winning to like 1%.</p>

            <p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>Facelifting yourself as difficult to confirm classes such as the Knight can cause BD to mislynch real Knights. Facelift twice as a Knight and real Knights are going to need to convince everyone that it is a Possessor game. If they don’t come forward with that information immediately and wait until they are on the stand to claim, they are going to die 100%.</p>
<p>Facelifting and Possessing early to manipulate BD’s graveyard information could be beneficial. However, it reduces your flexibility late game, and prevents you from avoiding heat if you run out of Possess uses.</p>
<p>You’re trading late game flexibility for early game chaos. I’m unsure if that is worth it or not. Could be.</p>

            <p>How does that logic not apply to any of the other classes? Why does that specifically account for sheriff/paladin? If you must jump night 1, there are much better choices, because of the reasons I stated. Why would you ever jump N1 as a paladin/sheriff, when you can jump as a princess, just to pick a similar example.</p>
<p>100% confirming it is a possessor game to evil N1 if you happen to pick the wrong faction investigative is also not stellar. Prince can also only execute N3 and even then someone is bound to claim it was a possessor jump, since a sheriff/paladin is always guaranteed. Not to mention the chance of evil dying, for sure confirming it is a possessor game. These jumps are more telegraphed than you are making them appear. Unless you commit to it and jump both N1 and N2 as a paladin, I would be hard pressed to believe a Prince would execute you immediately and that just assumes no unseen would die or gets poisoned. Vica versa for the reverse situation with sheriffs.</p>
<p>Lastly, the evil faction is also your enemy. The enemy of your enemy is your friend and since paladins/sheriffs cannot find you. Why would you kill them off early, unless BD is steamrolling, you should definitely hold of on this.</p>

            <p>I don’t get Possessor often at all, but I manage to stay alive a lot longer than other Possessors I come across in other games simply by spacing out my Possessions and establishing a credible claim on my first life.</p>
<p>Today I won a game as Possessor by pretending to be the Inquisitor for 5 days straight, even killing 2 people in the process (one of them was the Prince, I claimed I was redirected). The third person I jumped out of I facelifted them as Sorcerer and I just manipulated people into killing each other as I kept jumping straight into confirmed targets. People didn’t know it was a Possessor game until I killed the last BD.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s easy, I’m just saying the longer you wait to jump and the more comfirmed/trusted targets you jump into, the easier it will be for you to win.</p>

            <p>Best candidates are probably physicians, since they can screw you up lategame. Only a great idea if alchemist has openly claimed really, since they are one of the few neuts that can side with you and topple the king, the highest obstacle for Possessor, and you do not want to jeopardize Alchemist’s claim space.</p>
<p>Drunks that have “happy houred” are a good one too, jump to whoever got “happy houred”. You never have to explain your night action and Drunks are likely getting executed. Drunks are really bad for you since they can detect redirect immunity, stop you from jumping and are confirmable with royal blood. They are a prime target.</p>
<p>Princesses are of the same breed that trip you up with their invest skills that can actually find a Possessor fakeclaiming and they can confirm themselves with royal blood.</p>
<p>Sheriff/Paladins cannot find you and are trying hard to kill the opposing faction, which works in your favour, never try to frame these.</p>
<p>Hunter is way too obvious early game and instantly everyone will know it is a possessor game. Mystic is the same. Noble is self-confirmable, so also a bad idea.</p>
<p>Knights and Observers are your friends with the way puppet strings works, so also no reason to get them on somebodies radar. Observer’s can be tricky though and find you, so it is not super unreasonable to frame them. Knights are one of your valid fakeclaim, so never cull them.</p>
<p>Butler’s have the same arguments as drunks, except no royal blood, they can poison king, which is the highest obstacle and they can be a fakeclaiming Sellsword.</p>
<p>Court wizard is iffy. The same arguments apply for the Knight, but you must get rid of them before lategame, since that swap can be deadly. Would not recommend this one either.</p>
<p>Never jump as a neutral either, cramping the claim space of fellow neutrals who can side with you is just rotten and typically you gain nothing. Inquisitor jump can also not happen N1.</p>
<p>Jumping as evil is just a big giant signal to the evil faction that HELLO THIS IS A POSSESSOR GAME. And possibly framing a Sheriff, terrible idea.</p>
<p>Same idea applies to Prince.</p>
<p>But honestly, jumping N1 is just terrible in my opinion. You will need these jumps when you are in a bind later.</p>

<p>I’m asking because it might genuinely improve the class’s win rate to just disable Facelift on D1 and Possession on N1.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a 100% not happening. Even though i agree with you that it is dumb disabling it N1/D1 is even worse for the game</p>

            <p>Those are valid n2+, but making the wrong guess n1 can tip off everyone it’s a poss game, and you don’t really achieve what you’re after.</p>

            <p>I actualy like jumping n1/n2 with leaving n3 “just in case”</p>
<p>I try to disguise as pala/cult or sheriff/assassin in that cases.<br>
It actualy led to prince executing pala/sheriff claims if I jumped as “oposite” faction. Or cause “too many” pala/sheriffs.</p>
<p>Town wasting town hanging own people or wasting prince executions is good. Not always working tho.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that the worst action you can take that first night as Possessor is to jump to someone else. Even doing nothing (if you plan to claim a class that doesn’t visit) seems marginally more viable. Is there some strategy in doing this that doesn’t give away that it’s a Possessor game?</p>
<p>I’m asking because it might genuinely improve the class’s win rate to just disable Facelift on D1 and Possession on N1.</p>
