    <title>Lost all the option to use any of my abilities</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lost-all-the-option-to-use-any-of-my-abilities/68920</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Stepped up as Noble, becoming King. Abilities appeared to be available, but when used no effect occurred (finger pointing displayed no text and no change in the votes occurred, was unable to guard during the night phase). Additionally, I had no access to mystic chat, only being able to view it through chat history, being unable to respond. It appeared as though the game registered me as being dead, but I was still able to talk during the day and vote (though only once, with finger point doing nothing).

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I was supposed to be able to use my abilities.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Unkown, Noble stepped up on the third day, won by I believe 1 vote.

#### Comments:

None.</description>
