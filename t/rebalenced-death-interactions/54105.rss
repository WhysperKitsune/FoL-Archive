    <title>Rebalenced Death Interactions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/rebalenced-death-interactions/54105</link>
    <description>While I do agree that somethings were flawed that shouldn&#39;t mean it should be removed but reworked and rebalanced. Here are some of the flaws
1. Poss got screwed over
2. Psychic got a tad too OP
3. Reaper got nerfed a bit
4. DK was too OP

Lets fix em!


[details=&quot;Possessor Gets Screwed&quot;]
Go check out NightX&#39;s post about death interactions and go under Possessor! Link: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/dead-interactions/53222?u=htm
[/details]


[details=&quot;Call Of The Dead&quot;]
&gt;Add back a less OP version of Priest like so and don&#39;t give mystic back the passive cuz it doesn&#39;t fit

&gt;
&gt; [color=lab]The Priest, BD, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
&gt;  =
&gt; Passive 1: Call Of The Dead: same
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Blessings: bless a player with death immunity for the night, 1 use.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: My Dead Friends: Add a dead player&#39;s passive onto another person for the night, you can use a dead player&#39;s passives once, unlimited uses
&gt;
&gt; 2 of them can spawn in one game but it&#39;s very unlikely

&gt; [color=lapurple]The Soulcatcher, Unseen, Social :thought_balloon:[/color]
&gt;  =
&gt; Passive 1: Call Of The Dead: same
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Hex: hex a player removing all their passives at night, will not inform the player, 2 use
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Soul Catch: Catch a dead player&#39;s soul preventing them from coming back as DK, 2 use
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability 2: Kill And Catch: Catch a player&#39;s soul when he dies, preventing him from talking to the dead or come back
[/details]


[details=&quot;Icy Touch&quot;]
Keep chill as how it is right now because I love it!!!
[/details]
 

[details=&quot;DK OP&quot;]
Idk how to fix this one but again here is NightX&#39;s post https://forum.imperium42.com/t/dead-interactions/53222?u=htm and check out phys section
[/details]

I recommend you to look at Aquilion&#39;s post and NightX&#39;s post about death interaction
