    <title>King Night Immunity Bypassed</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-night-immunity-bypassed/23741</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I died through the King&#39;s guards.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I survive through the King&#39;s guards.

#### Steps to reproduce

* Have King guard you at night.
* Get attacked by two unseen members at the same time that night.

#### Full Story
I was playing as a Physician named &quot;partially AFK&quot;, working alongside the neutral King to figure out who was evil. Knowing that the King was at least worth healing, I went to heal him at night. However, I died that night, despite having received a message stating the King guarded me that evening. Immediately following the King guard message I was given the typical &quot;You were attacked last night&quot; message. Since the King&#39;s guards grant immunity for the night, I went ahead and tried to figure out how I died.

This game wasn&#39;t a cult game and the neutral killer was a possessor (who was dead) so empowerment through immunity wasn&#39;t possible. Ultimately, when the game ended, the unseen told me they had two members attack me at the same time, which bypassed the immunity buff. It seems that immunity is consumed by one attack, which is contrary to the &#39;guard&#39; description.

            <p>I think Sellsword if I remember correctly also has an ability to rebound target for anyone who voted for a member of the Unseen?</p>
<p>Again, might be wrong there, so don’t trust me there 100%</p>

            <p>Unseen cam bypass immunity with the Enforcer I believe.</p>
<p>I might be wrong there but Enforcer’s Bezerk overpowers the Assassin assassinations</p>
<p>I’m currently on mobile and can’t see the screenshots, but was there an Enforcer by any chance?</p>
