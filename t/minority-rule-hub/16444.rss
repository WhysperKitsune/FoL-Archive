    <description># Welcome to Minority Rule!
Credit for the original game idea goes to Ddynamo on the Town of Salem Forums.

## Gameplay
Minority rule is played in rounds. Each round, the host randomly selects a number of rooms equal to ⅓ of the living players rounded down (never less than two). You must choose one room to enter by sending the host your pick in a private message. When everybody has submitted a room, the players in the room with the most people are eliminated. However, most rooms also have a special effect of some kind, which can act either in your favor or to your detriment. Once there are less than three living players, everybody that is still alive is crowned a winner.

## Rules
1. Follow the global forum rules.
2. Respect the host and their decisions.
3. Send a room within a timely manner. The host may modkill you if you are holding up the game.
4. You may communicate privately with other players, but the host must be included in any such conversation.
5. Have fun.

            <p>I added a lot of rooms to the Facebook games I was hosting. See if you like any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Graveyard - If nobody picks this, 3 dead players are revived randomly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coliseum - If there are exactly two pickers in this room, they both die.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Divination - One random picker will gain the Divine status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Divine - You may choose to be told the amount of players in your selected room after everyone has chosen. You will not be told if it is Majority or not. You will be given the option to change your room. Once you use this ability, you lose your Divine status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ritual - All players who choose this room become Soulbound. If they lose this status, they will die.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normalcy - People who pick this room do not count towards the Majority unless they have a status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joker - If this room is the minority or tied for minority, everyone in this room loses their statuses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guardian - A random picker gains both the Saint status and the Bodyguard status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gemini - Two random pickers gain the Gemini status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gemini - You must pick 2 rooms per round. You die if either of your picks is a room that becomes majority.</strong></p>
