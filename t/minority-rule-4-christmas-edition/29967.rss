    <description># [color=red]Minority[/color] [color=Gree]Rule[/color] [color=red]Christmas[/color] [color=gree]Edition[/color]

Welcome to Minority Rule Christmas Edition!!! :christmas_tree: 

_The rules are pretty simple. I will present you a choice of several rooms—just choose one to enter! If you pick the room with the most people, you will all meet a horrible demise!_

[b][color=#0040FF]How to play?[/color][/b]
Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. if you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated. If there is a tie, then both rooms are considered a majority and players who picked both are eliminated.  The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. Do **/Join** to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me.

## Potential Rooms
**[color=skyblue]Air [/color]** - A random picker becomes light.
**[color=#801080]Betrayal [/color]**- If this room is tied for the minority, it gains infinite picks and becomes the majority.
**[color=black]Death [/color]**- Everyone who picks this dies, even if it is not the majority.
**[color=#DFDFDF]Dice [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status.
**[color=#BFBF00]Divide [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as half.
**[color=lightbrown]Earth [/color]**- A random picker becomes heavy.
**[color=#800000]Evil [/color]**- All pickers become cursed.
**[color=#FF00FF]False [/color]**- This room does nothing, but it takes the name of another random room.
**[color=##EFEFEF]Flux [/color]**- If this room is the minority, half of its pickers will change to the room with the second-most number of pickers in it.
**[color=#8000FF]Force [/color]**- A random person who did pick this will change to a random room in the current pool.
**[color=#BF0080]Gravity [/color]**- A random person who did not pick this will change to this room.
**[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]**- A random picker becomes a saint. All other pickers become cursed.
**[color=#800080]Illusion [/color]**- This room takes the effect of another secret item before the start of the round.
**[color=#808080]Insanity [/color]**- A random picker becomes insane.
**[color=#00BFFF]Life [/color]**- If nobody picks this, everybody dies.
**[color=green]Luck [/color]**- If this room is the majority, then one random picker will survive. If this is not the majority, then one random picker will die.
**[color=#000080]Majority[/color]** - If this room is the majority, the items with the second most votes will be the majority.
**[color=#FFBF40]Multiply [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as two.
**[color=sienna]Mundane [/color]**- This room literally does nothing.
**[color=dark]Murder [/color]**- One random picker becomes a Serial Killer
**[color=darkred]Mystery [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status. They are not informed which status they received.
**[color=#505050]Permanency [/color]**- If picked by anyone, this room will also be in the pool for the next round. Once this room is the majority, it is removed from the pool for all future rounds.
**[color=#509090]Protection [/color]**- All pickers are immune to death this round for any reason other than the majority. A random picker becomes a bodyguard.
**[color=#0080FF]Purity [/color]**- Everyone who picks this loses all statuses.
**[color=#FF0000]Rejuvinate [/color]**- Everyone who picks this becomes healthy.
**[color=#00EF00]Spite [/color]**- A random picker will becomes cursed.
**[color=Steelblue]Secrecy[/color]** - All pickers become cultists.

## Potential Statuses
[color=#408000]Bodyguard [/color]- Nobody who picks the same room as you can die for any reason other than the majority. If anyone who would die without your intervention is saved, you will die instead.
[color=Steelblue]Cultist[/color] - If there are any cultists, then there will be an item that only its members may pick. It will be denoted in [brackets].
[color=#804080]Cursed[/color] - You will die next round unless your status is removed or your death is prevented. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=lightbrown]Heavy[/color] - Your pick counts as two picks for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=#FF0000]Healthy[/color] - You cannot die for any reason except for the majority. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#808080]Insane[/color] - You must pick the majority or you will die.
[color=skyblue]Light[/color] - You do not count as a picker for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=Cornflowerblue]Saint[/color] - You are immune to death. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#0000BF]Serial Killer[/color] - A random person who picks the same item as you will die.

**Order of application goes:**
1. Effects of the Room
2. Existing Statuses
3. Majority calculated
4. New Statuses 

## [color=red]Special[/color]  [color=gree]Rules[/color]  

To celebrate Jesus&#39; birth there are a few special mechanics:

1. No one likes being alone at Christmas. Everyone pick a buddy and if they win so do you! The people who don&#39;t choose a buddy will be randomly allocated with each other. (If there are an odd number of players one player will start with no buddy but with the [color=green]Grinch[/color] status, which has exactly the same status effect as [color=Cornflowerblue]Saint[/color].)
2. Every round one room will be labelled as **[color=gree]F[/color][color=red]E[/color][color=gree]S[/color][color=red]T[/color][color=gree]I[/color][color=red]V[/color][color=gree]E[/color]** aswell as having it&#39;s normal effect. If you choose this room you will receive a tangerine :tangerine:. When it gets to the last two players alive (assuming they are not each others buddy in which case they would instantly both win), whoever has the most tangerines wins, along with their buddy of course. This is to reduce the chance of a tie which would result in 4 people winning. If the last two players have the same number of tangerines they both win, along with both of their partners.
3. You can share tangerines with your partner but only when you are both alive. If your partner gains a tangerine in a festive room but then dies that same round, the tangerine they gained that round and any other tangerines of theirs are lost when they die. If you wish to trade you must say so so in a PM including both of you and myself, or publicly here. Both of you must agree.
