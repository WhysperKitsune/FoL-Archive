            <p>Speaking of NKs, I’ve been wondering the potential for these 2 classes to be NK fake-claims. Both of these classes have quite situational confirming capabilities, both show as Killer/Offensive, one is occ immune and MU while the other one has basically toggle-able occupation immunity and can work if a Butler found you regardless if you’re a Poss or a Reaper. I’d imagine that they’d work better than a Knight claim.</p>

<p><strong>Curse of Lethargy (Night)</strong> - If the Forest Witch’s target is attacking this night, then their target will be immune from that attack. If the Forest Witch’s target is occupying or redirecting this night then their targets will be immune to their occupation or redirection. If the Forest Witch’s target is converting this night then the conversion will fail. If the Forest Witch’s target is conducting a faction check then their target will show up as a member of the Blue Dragon as their result, and if their target is an Actuary or Observer then they will receive either zero or no visits as their results. - Infinite uses</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Simple way to reword this:</p>
<p>Target player’s target will be immune to your targets action. Your target will see their target as Blue Dragon and won’t see visits. (Unlimited)</p>
