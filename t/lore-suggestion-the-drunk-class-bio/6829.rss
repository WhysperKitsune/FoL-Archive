Lore Subject: The *Hic* Drunk 

Lore:

The licentious Drunk. Quite often an uncle or cousin of the Prince or Princess, In other times a forgotten child of the previous King or Queen. Needless to say regardless of their ties to the royal family their blood is the only benefit they have as their claim to the throne long since passed them by in favour of their more versed and useful relatives. Often best friends with the nobles around the court the Drunk spends his time making merry with the staff and other denizens. His inebriation makes him the most trusting and carefree presence in the castle bringing joy to all but the butler who finds it most uncouth for the drunk to raid the castle larder disrupting his archive of wines and food. It should also be noted that the drunks attitude is responsible for the above average count of those with royal blood even if he does drown his own out with alchohol.

Sadly the Drunk never makes it very long in the castle as his affections routinely draw the attention of unsavoury individuals such as the assassin who despite accepting ale will often dispose of the Raucous Royal in the interest of their own factions goals, Assuming they don&#39;t get too drunk of course...</description>
