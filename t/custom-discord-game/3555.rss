            <p>when signing up to host a game always check with <a class="mention" href="/u/queen_alfa">@Queen_Alfa</a><br>
the FoL team (which manage games like this) received no word that this was going ahead and did not see it anywhere on the FoL signup sheet, I am locking this until I hear this was approved from a reliable source</p>
