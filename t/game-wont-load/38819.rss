    <description>#### What happened?

Title. When on the screen for graphical setting, this happened:

After that, the game did not load when play was clicked.

Here are my logs:

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The game should load, and the &#39;Select Monitor&#39; should come up with an actual monitor.

#### Steps to reproduce:

I&#39;m not certain how this happened, but hopefully the logs might indicate something.

#### Comments:

            <p>This seems to be an issue with Windows 10 (and possibly other operating systems) and Unity games. To fix this, you have to go into your GPU Control Panel. The following are instructions for Nvidia Control Panel, but while it should be possible with other GPU Control Panels it may be slightly different to navigate. Under Display &gt; Adjust Desktop Size and Position, you will find a menu for scaling. If it is not already, change the Scaling Mode to “No Scaling”, and Perform Scaling on: to “Display”. Then, try opening ToL up, and you should see it can now select your display, and it should open properly. If that doesn’t fix the problem, tick the box “Override the scaling mode set by games and programs”, and then try again. Hopefully this fixes it!</p>
