    <title>Occupation and Redirection Distinctiveness</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/occupation-and-redirection-distinctiveness/54004</link>
    <description>People complain about Butler being too boring or Court Wizard being too weak and etc.

Well, I think it&#39;s about time we make things more distinct and have it so occupation immunity and redirection immunity are two different things.

Classes that occupy:
- Butler
- Servant
- Invoker

Classes that redirect:
- Court Wizard
- Drunk
- Sage
- Alcoholic
- Invoker
- Ritualist

Redirection is usually better than Occupation for Scum, as they still get use out of their ability. however, Occupation is just swingy.

So I propose these changes for starters:


Court Wizard, Sage, and Ritualist, when using Tornado, will become redirect immune, provided that Tornado bypasses redirect immunity.</description>

            <p>Actually occupation is usually better than redirection for scum because the Ability’s they are trying to stop give information regardless of target.</p>
<p>However redirection is better for BD for the same reason.</p>
