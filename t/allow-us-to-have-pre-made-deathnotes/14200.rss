    <title>Allow us to have pre-made deathnotes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/allow-us-to-have-pre-made-deathnotes/14200</link>
    <description>Allow us to have pre-made deathnotes specific for each character.
So basically there will be a tab like classes but when you click on the Class it will pop up a deathnote just like you would have in-game. Once you have drawn the deathnote for that class once you get that class in-game on the deathnote screen there will be like a little switch that allows you to draw a deathnote or use a pre-made deathnote. It would be a pretty cool idea. The only problem I see with it is if you get the same role and other people are in the previous game but if you know that you just switch off pre-made deathnotes.</description>

            <p>I would prefer to just be able to load from a selection of death notes you have prepared yourself . not linked to a specific class . just your own gallery  you can scroll through</p>

            <p>I’ve actually gotten a lot better at doodling since playing this game. Also, drawing helps pass the time when there’s not a lot going on. I don’t think pre-drawn death notes would be a beneficial addition.</p>
<p>But a Journal that’s been filled out would be super beneficial. I wrote a macro for my Journal so it’s not an issue for me personally anymore but could help a lot of people.</p>
<p>My Journal Macro, It takes two seconds and two clicks of my keyboard to fill out my Journal:<br>

            <p>Would love that <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>A lot of people have suggested this too.</p>
<p>So I think dev is considering adding this feature to the game <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
