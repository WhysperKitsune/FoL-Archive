    <description># [color=lighblue]The Lord Commander (Blue Dragon Special)[/color]

*Passive:* Loyal Until Death - You keep an Elite Blue Dragon Banner at your door, so if a Mastermind or Cult Leader attempts to convert you, they will be prevented from visiting you.

*Passive:* Sworn Vows - Due to an Oath you made upon becoming a Lord Commander, you are unable to step up to become King.

**Day Ability [Support]:** Lock-down - You will extend the current day phase into the night by 30 seconds, the night phase will be shortened by 30 seconds. - 2 uses.

**Day Ability [Investigative]:** Honour and Prestige - Target a player. You will be informed if they have Royal Blood. - 3 uses.

**Night Ability: Sworn to Protect [Support]** - Target a player. You will prevent any visits to them. - 2 uses.

**Night Ability: Distinction [Investigative]** - Target a player. You will be told if they are Convertible or Non-Convertible. You will also be told if they were just converted. - Infinite uses.

*Additional notes:*
* Guaranteed to spawn and class is Unique.
* Special because it can investigate and support Blue Dragon.
* Distinction determines already converted players to be Non-Convertible.
* Sworn to Protect will notify the same as Merc protection.
* I know there are similarities to others classes, for example, Maid and Merc, I think this Class could benefit from those.
* This Class will give Blue Dragon it&#39;s power class back since Sheriff and Paladin can now be converted while still being balanced in the way that it isn&#39;t giving BD any definitive &quot;this is Unseen&quot; or &quot;this is Cult&quot;

*Lore:* 

&quot;In all my years of service to the crown, I never once broke my oath. I serve the Dragon until I die.&quot;

The Lord Commander was a renowned veteran Knight. After many years of loyally serving the Blue Dragon, he took up an oath and swore fealty to his kingdom. It was clear to some that the Lord Commander was more than just an ordinary knight, he was something quite unique.

While being a veteran in combat, he was too frail to raise a sword. Instead, he used his skills in identifying the weak minded and the royals he abode with. He also used his veteran skills to protect others from visits.</description>

            <p>If Mastermind sees “You could not convert your target” then it’ll make him a kill target for Assassin, same with Cult Leader seeing it, he’ll wanna kill them.</p>
<p>If they see “You were Occupied” then they’ll likely think twice about it.</p>
<p>The idea is to avoid being targeted because they can’t be converted.</p>
<p>Look way back at all the times Prince and Sheriff were involved in conversion attempts. They’d get killed off by the Assassin real quickly because the Mastermind would tell them, “Immune to convert” or something.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it is needless. Why can’t the lord commander be outed to them? They missed a night of conversion, they might as well be given a little information.</p>

            <p>I made it that way on purpose.</p>
<p>If they try to convert him, and they see “Your target could not be converted.” they’ll be like “immune, we’ll kill him.” whereas in this case they’ll think twice and just assume they got Occupied.</p>
<p>You’re only saying it looks complicated because you probably enjoy the simple minded things. It ain’t changing. So cross that suggestion off your list.</p>

            <p>I think you needlessly made the conversion thing for the lord commander complicated. Just make him immune to conversion.</p>

            <p>Enforcer doesn’t make Mastermind immune to Occupy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guarantees The Assassin will kill the target. Bypasses night Immunity, Occupying, and healing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But should a situation arise that a Ritualist makes Cult Leader immune to Occupy on an attempted Brainwash, then hey, they find Lord Commander on that rare occasion.</p>
