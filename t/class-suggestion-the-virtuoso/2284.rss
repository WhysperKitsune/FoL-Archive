    <description># [color=violet]The Virtuoso (Neutral Support)[/color]
_Immune to Conversion_

_**Passive:** Musical Soul - If the music dies, you will die (Being Occupied will kill you)._

_**Passive:** Inmate Harmony - You will play a sweet harmony for the Prince when jailed, thus, allowing the music to keep playing as if you were not Occupied._

**[u]Day Ability 1:[/u] Passionate Composition (3 uses)**
Your music will be loud enough to block out visits to yourself tonight.

**[u]Night Ability 1:[/u] Romantic Serenade (Infinite uses)**
Sing a romantic song to somebody tonight, they will be immune to Occupation.

**[u]Night Ability 2:[/u] Royal Melody (2 uses)**
You will play a sweet Melody to the court during the next day. All Royals will be immune to Day Abilities the next day.

**_[u]Goal: Don&#39;t let the music die.[/u]_** 

_Lore:_

_Here I am to tell you a story,_
_Of how I found such musical glory,_

_I found a little fiddle upon an old shelf,_
_Little did I know, it was carved by an elf,_

_Such fine craft work, with delicate sound,_
_I realized it wasn&#39;t ordinary, what I just found,_

_Onward to the Palace to test my own skill,_
_But should the music stop, it is me they will kill._

-Written by the Virtuoso

**The Virtuoso** was a being of peace and harmony, often crying upon declarations of love and delivering lovely sounds of music that come from the passion in their heart. Within the Royal Family, the King wanted somebody who could keep him happy. He found The Virtuoso very humble and thus, employed him to play every day and every night, and threatened his life if he should stop. The Virtuoso didn&#39;t stop, as an actual fact, they didn&#39;t want to stop playing the fiddle. 

Some nights the Prince would invite The Virtuoso into the cells just to hear the sweet sounds of The Virtuoso&#39;s melodies. However, The Virtuoso was once a known drunk, and should they be tempted, wine was always going to meet their lips. That is what they had feared among the King&#39;s staff. They feared that once the music stops playing, The King will have their head. The music must not stop playing.

Notes:
Musical Soul - The reason I made it possible to die from Occupation is because I wanted this Class to feel tough to beat. So think of it this way, the King is enjoying the music, and one night, it&#39;s not playing. The Virtuoso has failed to entertain, thus, being executed for failing to keep the King happy. 

Inmate Harmony - The Prince jailing the Virtuoso would have been an instant loss, so I made it seem like the Prince wanted to enjoy music while he jailed him, thus, keeping him alive because he&#39;s still entertaining the Royal family.

Passionate Composition - I wanted to create a way to prevent Virtuoso from being Occupied and Attacked, activated during the day because I wanted them to be able to use the, what I call, &quot;Ally Making&quot; Abilities. It could be seen almost like a &quot;Survivor Vest&quot; but I see it more of a &quot;You just can&#39;t visit me, thus, almost proving I am Virtuoso&quot;

Romantic Serenade - I&#39;m not entirely satisfied with this but I&#39;m calling the two Night Abilities &quot;Ally Making&quot; Abilities to help keep them alive. 

Royal Melody - Same as above, mainly to draw an alliance with the King too.</description>

            <p>I genuinely really like this one. This is one of the few roles I’d like to see added to FoL. Normally I’m against adding so many new roles to it <em>cough</em> Kings <em>cough</em> but the simplicity and balance of this role while remaining unique appeals to me.</p>
<p>The only thing I don’t like is the name tbh. Something like Bard would be more apt to its theme and also work within a castle better.</p>

            <p>Ah I see yeah I get it. I like it. I hate boring neutral roles who simply have to live but this has an interesting twist with enough utility to make it useful to both scum and to BD.</p>
<p>Honestly I way prefer this to alch  (comparing as basically same wincon) and would happily see alch replaced with this.</p>

            <p>Well, even if the virtuose plays a song, the jailor can’t choose <strong>not</strong> to roleblock him…you should precise that it makes the prince not roleblock you in the passive, if that’s what you were aiming for</p>

            <p>I’ll admit, I did toy with that idea, but I honestly really loved the idea of The Virtuoso being a more, “Play music for the King and his family” kinda deal (I see Nobles being part of the King’s family). So I imagine, that would liven up their morale, thus, stopping others from being able to, say, poison them or troll box them.</p>
<p>I also toyed with the idea of making Day Abilities usable during Trial, which I think would help Reaper’s Chill or Assassin Distraction. Perhaps it’s still a better idea, but at the same time, I felt more obligated to make this fitting for Forum of Lies. Perhaps, if Xblade and Boslof are interested, I will probably look into making alterations to The Virtuoso, there are so many possibilities with a Class that needs to survive with music.</p>

            <p>Yeah, although this can also help with evil and NK who doesn’t have occupy immunity and make it appears the Mercenary or Court Wizard is on them, except for the Royal Melody - wouldn’t be better to make day abilities unable to use instead?</p>
<p>Sorry late response.</p>

            <p>Actually, allow me to defend my Class against that…</p>
<p>Passionate Composition - to protect themselves from any form of Occupation or Attacks, thus, keeping them alive. Also a Day Ability because of the Night Abilities.</p>
<p>Romantic Serenade - usable if you want to form an alliance with somebody, example being Sheriff.</p>
<p>Royal Melody - for the King’s, I wanted something that allows this Class to, once more, form alliances, example, if you’re caught by Prince, just say “I’ll play a Royal Melody” and boom, ally gained. But mostly did this for the King</p>
<p>You can say it benefits BD, but in reality, it supports only itself in the majority of it’s abilities, by that I mean, forming alliances.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, if this Class was to betray their ally, Killers, Butler, Servant and CW can kill them.</p>
<p>With that being said, this Class could also be thrown out into the claimspace for scum.</p>
<p>“I’m Virtuoso, please don’t occupy me so I can survive” - granted, it would start looking sus, but that’s why you would ask them to use their Day Ability. Also, could easily work well with Assassin+Sellsword.</p>

            <h1><font color="violet">The Virtuoso (Neutral Support)</font></h1>
<p><em>Immune to Conversion</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Passive:</strong> Musical Soul - If the music dies, you will die (Being Occupied will kill you).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Passive:</strong> Inmate Harmony - You will play a sweet harmony for the Prince when jailed, thus, allowing the music to keep playing as if you were not Occupied.</em></p>
<p><strong><span class="bbcode-u">Day Ability 1:</span> Passionate Composition (3 uses)</strong><br>
Your music will be loud enough to block out visits to yourself tonight.</p>
<p><strong><span class="bbcode-u">Night Ability 1:</span> Romantic Serenade (Infinite uses)</strong><br>
Sing a romantic song to somebody tonight, they will be immune to Occupation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="bbcode-u">Night Ability 2:</span> Royal Melody (2 uses)</strong><br>
You will play a sweet Melody to the court during the next day. All Royals will be immune to Day Abilities the next day.</p>
<p><strong><em><span class="bbcode-u">Goal: Don’t let the music die.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><em>Lore:</em></p>
<p><em>Here I am to tell you a story,</em><br>
<em>Of how I found such musical glory,</em></p>
<p><em>I found a little fiddle upon an old shelf,</em><br>
<em>Little did I know, it was carved by an elf,</em></p>
<p><em>Such fine craft work, with delicate sound,</em><br>
<em>I realized it wasn’t ordinary, what I just found,</em></p>
<p><em>Onward to the Palace to test my own skill,</em><br>
<em>But should the music stop, it is me they will kill.</em></p>
<p>-Written by the Virtuoso</p>
<p><strong>The Virtuoso</strong> was a being of peace and harmony, often crying upon declarations of love and delivering lovely sounds of music that come from the passion in their heart. Within the Royal Family, the King wanted somebody who could keep him happy. He found The Virtuoso very humble and thus, employed him to play every day and every night, and threatened his life if he should stop. The Virtuoso didn’t stop, as an actual fact, they didn’t want to stop playing the fiddle.</p>
<p>Some nights the Prince would invite The Virtuoso into the cells just to hear the sweet sounds of The Virtuoso’s melodies. However, The Virtuoso was once a known drunk, and should they be tempted, wine was always going to meet their lips. That is what they had feared among the King’s staff. They feared that once the music stops playing, The King will have their head. The music must not stop playing.</p>
<p>Notes:<br>
Musical Soul - The reason I made it possible to die from Occupation is because I wanted this Class to feel tough to beat. So think of it this way, the King is enjoying the music, and one night, it’s not playing. The Virtuoso has failed to entertain, thus, being executed for failing to keep the King happy.</p>
<p>Inmate Harmony - The Prince jailing the Virtuoso would have been an instant loss, so I made it seem like the Prince wanted to enjoy music while he jailed him, thus, keeping him alive because he’s still entertaining the Royal family.</p>
<p>Passionate Composition - I wanted to create a way to prevent Virtuoso from being Occupied and Attacked, activated during the day because I wanted them to be able to use the, what I call, “Ally Making” Abilities. It could be seen almost like a “Survivor Vest” but I see it more of a “You just can’t visit me, thus, almost proving I am Virtuoso”</p>
<p>Romantic Serenade - I’m not entirely satisfied with this but I’m calling the two Night Abilities “Ally Making” Abilities to help keep them alive.</p>
<p>Royal Melody - Same as above, mainly to draw an alliance with the King too.</p>
