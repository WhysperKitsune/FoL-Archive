    <title>Crash on close in windowed mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/crash-on-close-in-windowed-mode/11612</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
When playing in windowed mode, if you click the close button, rather than the quit button, the game crashes and steam says the game is running. Then I am required to restart my computer to be able to start the game again.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I would assume the game should be able to be exited using the close button without the game crashing.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Windowed mode, use close button (x in top right corner). 

#### Comments:
Not game breaking, not urgent. Just a slight annoyance.</description>

            <p>Well… maybe the existence of a button called “Quit” means something. Maybe it means that it will actually quit smoother and not just try to terminate the game.</p>
<p>So basically in case you didn’t understand it, the quit button is there for a reason, press it. It’s not a bug if you decide to close the game your way.</p>
