    <title>Banning and Punishment</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/banning-and-punishment/7638</link>
    <description>even though i was banned, i fully understand that i was throwing the game. i&#39;m not complaining im here to say that im happy to see that the staff is actively reading reports bc usually when people get reported in games nothing ever happens. :)

however, it says one day ban and im not sure if that means come 12:00 AM ill be unbanned or if its a 24 hour ban that will last exactly 24 hours and i think it should be specified more clearly on the menu.</description>
