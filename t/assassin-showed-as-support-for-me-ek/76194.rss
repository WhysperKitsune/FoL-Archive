            <p>Kape is correct. Tailor effects aren’t <em>supposed</em> to alter typecheck results, but Assassin under a tailor effect returns as Physician for whatever weird reason, so you hit a tailored Assassin and viewed them as Support to a typecheck. You’re not immune to tailor effects as EK using Allies (in fact, no investigative ability is immune to tailor effects unless performed by an empowered Investigative class), although a tailor doesn’t stop EK Allies from finding the target as a member of the scum faction.</p>
<p>P.S. By the same token, typechecking a Timesnatcher while they use Dark Dimension will return Investigative, since the Timesnatcher erroneously displays as Princess while under the tailor effect.</p>

            <p>This would not be possible, since invests are before conversion. A n5 convert would show as not ally.</p>

            <p>Assassin was disguised by a Timesnatcher or Dutchess.<br>
Disguised Assassin returns Support.</p>

            <p>They likely to be converted N5 and become straightly Assassin.<br>
Check would came first then Convert, that why you got confusing result.<br>
This is not a bug, just some logics in game.</p>
