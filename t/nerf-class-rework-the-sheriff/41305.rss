    <title>[Nerf Class Rework] The Sheriff</title>

    <description>The Sheriff (Blue Dragon Investigative) - Unique, Unconvertable

Day Ability 1: Scout
If the target was converted the following night you will be notified the next day. (infinite uses)

Night Ability 1: Expert Investigation
Determine if a player is a member of the Unseen. (infinite uses)

Night Ability 2: Surveillance
Learn the names of the **classes** that visit you. Prevent visitors. (3 uses)

I believe this provides a bit of a nerfing towards Sheriff, it seems like it was too much of the Old CW but overpowered.

Thoughts?</description>

<p>This is better than the current sheriff, but it still needs changes.  Learning the names of players that try to visit you is fine, it’s the “you will be told when an unseen member visits” part that makes it OP.  And sheriff shouldn’t be unconvertable.  The only BD classes that should be unconvertable are prince and the king.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with this. That being said, I haven’t found Sheriff to be an OP influence on my games since he was updated.</p>

            <p>Honestly my problem with it is that it makes him confirmable. Even if he is unique and stuff having him be confirmable means you can’t CC him.</p>
