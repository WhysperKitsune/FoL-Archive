    <title>Court Wizard Rework to help the flood</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-rework-to-help-the-flood/54630</link>
    <description>Not sure why they wanted individual topics, but here we are. Just a copy paste from my comment on the thread.

An important part to consider when changing CW is that we want to keep him as a scum claim, since those are low, but we also want him to be useful to BD. I also want him to have slight protection to himself. He becomes a very obvious target once outed.

Court Wizard - Blue Dragon Support

No Passive

Day ability - Magic Empowerment: Increase the power of your magic to include yourself, along with your target. (2 uses)

Night ability 1 - Barrier: Protect your target from negative effects like conversion, occupation, and target redirection. Does not prevent death. Can’t target self or King. If the barrier does so anything (no one attempts to occupy or convert the target) feedback is given to the court wizard. (Unlimited)

Night Ability 2 - Magical Doorway: All visits to a single target will be redirected to another target of choice. Does not swap them. Can’t target self or King for either use. (2 uses)

The point of this rework keeps CW as a defensive class, giving him the ability to protect key BD roles, and also an option to protect himself, should he be concerned for conversion. This also is fairly easy to fake, and with Magical Doorway being limited to 2, you can’t spam it forever on Prince. And while it is unique, it requires players to visit your target before you can be “confirmed”.

Sage - Unseen Support

No Passive.

Day Ability - Magical Empowerment: Increase the power of your magic to include yourself, along with your target. (2 uses)
Night Ability 1 - Dark Barrier: Prevents the Assassin from being Occupied or Target changed for the night. (Inifinite Uses)

Night Ability 2 - Dark Doorway: Redirects all targets except the Assassin to another target of choice. Can target King for first choice, can not redirect players to King. This will redirect immune targets as well. (Thanks to firekitten for pointing out it didn&#39;t emulate fire wall enough) (2 uses)

These changes get rid of Tornado as a whole and lets Sage be better at pretending to be his BD counterpart. This also protects the assassin from Drunks and Butlers who could potentially find him out. Dark Doorway also emulates what Firewall already does, but makes it slightly better.</description>

            <p>I may have done something very similar to your day ability that might just help with that. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Let me get through all of these CW ideas, and then I’ll take a look at what I’ll do for my own suggestion.</p>

            <p>Thank you. That’s actually the basis for what I wanted from court wizard. All the classes are fairly powerful, especially when compared to their counter parts from games like God.</p>
<p>I too enjoy tornado, however there are a lot of players, especially new ones, that don’t see the potential of it, which is why doorway is so nice, as it emulates what tornado does (target redirection) except it can be used to protect key roles.</p>
<p>I’m not sure about buffing it to three, however, as it is a strictly better tornado. But I have no idea how this would play out in game obviously.</p>
<p>Edit: I think I enjoy it at 2 more, as the ability is powerful, and players have to think “do I waste doorway early to prove myself, or do I save it for big situations, like prince being outed?” I think that gives it a more interesting dynamic, and makes it harder to “prove” cw claims.</p>
<p>I also considered buffing it to do exactly as sage’s and have both deflect everyone, even immune targets, however that might be too powerful for a bd role.</p>

            <p>I just started reading through the CW idea flood, and I think this may be the best one I’ve yet come across.</p>
<p>Although I would in no way ever champion the idea of changing a full drive/transportation ability to a deflection ability like you have done here (changing Tornado, which swaps, for Magical Door, which deflects), that is largely because I love the high skill ceiling and amazing risk-reward potential of the ability.<br>
Since ToL is already buffing everything far past normal limits, however, I am okay with the idea. We will need to look at the Cult’s transports though.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a solid set of tweaks that should go a long way towards quelling the masses’ inane issues with the CW, while keeping its main purpose relatively intact. I’d probably give it at least 3 Magical Door uses though.</p>

            <p>They’ll know there is a sage, but not necessarily who it is. Currently we can figure out sage anyway by any player visiting the fire walled target, so I don’t think it’s that bad.</p>

            <p>That’s why I asked if it breaked redirection immunity, though people may then figure out it is a sage so maybe silently breaks redirection immunity since it is a 2 use.</p>

            <p>I actually haven’t thought of that. My original idea was dark doorway simulated wall of fire, but you’re correct that currently it wouldn’t stop king guards. I think making the sages break re direction would be better, however adding that to bd cw would not be good.</p>
<p>Happy hour would go through since it always goes through all immunities.</p>

            <p>You traded WOF arguably the most effective way to take out a prince , because not even the king can guard the prince with WOF, with a redirection that doesn’t bypass king guard and Assasin gets Occupy Redirection immunity</p>

            <p>No you’re whining that tornado is gone from court wizard, yet in this change it’s literally a better version of tornado that actually has application. You need to quit focusing on every tiny think you hate. There are a lot of good idea on other posts as well you’re just ignoring because they do one thing wrong.</p>

            <p>Alright did you even read the change? This is literally a better version of tornado.</p>
<p>Lets even look at your scenario. If you use the day ability to protect yourself, and also use it on your assassin, you can protect two unseen at once. Then if a knight attacks either of you, he gets sent to some random bd. And does the exact same thing as you claimed in your anecdote.</p>

            <p>While I agree, most players do not, and see tornado as a trolling tool. I aim to make a tornado like ability, but have its uses more bd favoring while limiting it to 2 uses so it isn’t spamable.</p>
