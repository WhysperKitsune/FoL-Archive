    <description>**Welcome to [TURBO] - Drinks &amp; Barmaids I**

This setup follows simple forum rules.
The setup will start once 7 players have signed up.
The setup will start on Night 1.

**Gameplay**

Days will be 10 minutes long.
Nights will be 5 minutes long.
All actions must be done in your rolecard except for the faction kill.
The town alignment is the [color=#FFD505]Yellow Poppy[/color].
The mafia alignment is the [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color].
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] automatically win once majority is reached.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] can only communicate during the night.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] do not share rolecards and will be in seperate threads therefore any feedback is personal.
The [color=#FFF1E6]White Primrose[/color] have a faction kill.
The only role that will receive ability feedback is the [color=#FFD505]Constable[/color].
Items grant players a day ability.
You will be told if you receive a [color=grey]Flintlock[/color] at the beginning of the day.


**Executions**

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
Executions will be plurality. Players are not lynched until the end of the day unless all votes are received. Any ties in votes will be determined a no-lynch.
If a lynch target has been decided via all votes being received but a player has not decided what they will do with a day ability (ect. **/nolynch Flintlock** or **/flintlock KyoDaz**) then the lynch will be delayed.
Feel free to ask any scenarios with lynches.

            <p>Look at this beast of a strategy. It’s superficially simmilar to the EpicMafia setup’s strategy but look! Everything’s flexible. There are worlds I can’t calculate because the strategy is still extremely and undeniably dependent on people, on the way people play the game.</p>
<p>Your strategy, your setup, is not based around that. It’s based on which of 5 worlds on the flowchart you live on. The interesting bit happens in the aftermath of there, not in the actual part where the strategy is employed</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Let’s run through Cop9 and then I’ll explain why it’s superior to this game.</p>
<p><font color="green"><strong>Cop<br>
Villager (N0)<br>
Villager<br>
Villager<br>
Villager<br>
Villager<br>
Villager</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Mafia Goon<br>
Mafia Goon</strong></font></p>
<p>The strategy is hypoclaiming. Every single player in the game essentially <strong>pretends</strong> to be the Cop. They all say “N0 - Icibalus”, as an example, and the real cop puts out their actual read out there.</p>
<p>Bam! We’ve now got an interesting strategy where every single player has to actively manufacture or create reads, and there is real stakes to everybody’s reads. Even the N0 Green Peeks that people drop to cover the cop.</p>
<p>Why? If you choose a mafia as your N0, the mafia will <em>probably</em> never kill you because they know your N0 peek isn’t correct, and therefore are more likely to kill the cop. Therefore we can assume that anybody killed by the mafia is much more likely to have chosen a villager as their N0, and all their cover peeks are probably correct.</p>
<p>The operative word is probably. Depending on how the mafia and the village acts, the strategy changes. Do the mafia start to try and trick the villagers by killing somebody who peeks one of them green as their N0 to try and stop themselves from being lynched? Or do they just go out and try to kill the Cop before they basically doom the mafia to be killed?</p>
<p>This isn’t just WIFOM, though. The villagers can <strong>read</strong> the thread, read people, figure out which world they live in by watching carefully the actions of people, how they drop their peeks, how they try and create accurate fake peeks.</p>
<p>In my next book i’ll explain why this is objectively superior to this setup.</p>

            <p>Gun should always be used inside of the cop ccs.<br>
Using it outside is just stupid. You aim for the most probable way of killing mafia as town.<br>
If the cop has died then there is social reads. The gunsmith is a clear. He can order shots if he wants to.</p>

<p>Then they’ve screwed their mislynch. What a shame. All having the gun does is give yourself immunity to it. Their partner is out there.</p>

<p>That’s another mislynch gone. They managed to mislynch TWICE without a single correct hit. There are literally also cops where the cop has an alignment check AND there is a cc.</p>

<p>Okay. Firstly, Cop9 is objectively superior to this if you want a good but complicated turbo with both strategy and reading.</p>

<p>N1 faction kill is Villager. Someone is gunned (does not matter who).<br>
D2 Apprentice CCs cop. Someone shoots inside the cops. This day guarantees Apprentice dies if the gun is in play. Let’s say Apprentice loses CC and gets shot.<br>
N2 Barmaid is left. Barmaid roleblocks gunsmith and kills cop, or vice versa depending on which clear they want alive left.<br>
D3 it’s lylo with Barmaid, Villager and Gunsmith.</p>
<p>How is this not balanced? And that’s if Apprentice loses CC.</p>

            <p>The game does not end instantly at all.<br>
A lot of the time it ends up in someone gunned, GS + cop alive. They have a clear and two mislynches before they lose.<br>
The game ends maximum of D3. Minimum of D2, and that’s if they miss their mislynches or barmaid gets lucky.</p>
<p>I think you also forget the point of the tag [Turbo].<br>
It is intended to end relatively quickly.</p>
