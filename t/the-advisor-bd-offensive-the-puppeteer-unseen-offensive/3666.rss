    <title>The advisor (BD offensive)/ The puppeteer (Unseen offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-advisor-bd-offensive-the-puppeteer-unseen-offensive/3666</link>
    <description>The advisor (Unique BD offensive)

Day ability (suggest): Your first target can only use thier night ability on your second Target (unlimited use. Does not work on the noble&#39;s crier. You can&#39;t force someone to only be able to use thier killing ability on themselves. (Assassinate, Posses, reap, erraticate, ect.) If you try then they will be able to use that ability on anyone.)

Night ability (tip): same but for day abilities 
(Works on everyone with a day ability)

The Puppeteer (Unseen offensive)
Same as advisor but Unseen.

Notes: 
- They will will be informed of this at the start of the night/day and can choose to do nothing if they want. 
- You can make someone target themselves
- does not care about occupy immunity 
- work&#39;s on ability&#39;s with no target. If it does then it will be as if the second Target used the ability. Examples: The psychic telepathy will have the next thing the target says be anonymous but it says their BD equivalent class says it rather than the Psychic. Neutrals have no equivalent and thus appear as themselves. The Prince can be made to jail himself (and will thus be immune to visits) and he can be make to kill someone other than his prisoner. 
- Basically when there is no target then replace the word &quot;you&quot; with the target (an Enforcer defending the unseen will give up his targets life to save the unseen)
- The cult leader can be made to sacrifice a BD 
- The MM can be made to make someone the assassin with dirty work (Not sure if it should piece convert immunity)
- The mercenary and sellsword can use rebound/revenge on your target even if they didn&#39;t vote his target or make someone else night immune with guard.</description>

            <p>They don’t actually have to attack the target tho. They are just not allowed to attack anyone other than the target. In the case of the knight and alch they could instead guard the target.</p>
<p>And I still don’t know what the goal would be.</p>

            <p>I don’t get it. What would the goal be? Remember that you cant force people to kill anyone. All you do is make it so that if they do they’re action that they are doing it on a specific person. Meaning that you can’t kill and you cant force someone else to kill. The main strength of the class is in either limiting someones options as unseen or if you are BD then letting someone do things that would normally be impossible.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the puppeteer should function as a neutral class that could be converted to an unseen with the intent to “puppeteer” the entire empire to their death… identical to the reaper.</p>

            <p>I’m not particularly sure when this would happen. As an advisor you wouldn’t want to do thisand as a puppeteer it would be smarter to just have the assassin kill the Prince directly if you know who he is. I guess you could stop the Prince from jailing and executing the assassin in the first place. But that is a specific use case with other problems.</p>

            <p>I’m curious how balanced people think this class is. I was thinking about making the abilitys limited use but at the same time he can’t make people useless and he can’t force people to waste ability uses. The primary purpose is to let other classes do things that they normally can’t.</p>

            <p>but its a no target<br>
i believe it says something along the lines of ‘you kill your prisoner. this goes through all night immunity’<br>
so shouldn’t it be ‘[x] kills your prisoner. this goes through all night immunity’<br>
(personally i think thats cooler)<br>
if you think not, then just list it as an exception</p>

            <p>The execution works as if the person you make him target is the Prince’s prisoner, even if he isn’t. This means it Peirces everything such as healing, night immunity and a Mercenary/CW.</p>

            <p>The advisor (Unique BD offensive)</p>
<p>Day ability (suggest): Your first target can only use thier night ability on your second Target (unlimited use. Does not work on the noble’s crier. You can’t force someone to only be able to use thier killing ability on themselves. (Assassinate, Posses, reap, erraticate, ect.) If you try then they will be able to use that ability on anyone.)</p>
<p>Night ability (tip): same but for day abilities<br>
(Works on everyone with a day ability)</p>
<p>The Puppeteer (Unseen offensive)<br>
Same as advisor but Unseen.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will will be informed of this at the start of the night/day and can choose to do nothing if they want.</li>
<li>You can make someone target themselves</li>
<li>does not care about occupy immunity</li>
<li>work’s on ability’s with no target. If it does then it will be as if the second Target used the ability. Examples: The psychic telepathy will have the next thing the target says be anonymous but it says their BD equivalent class says it rather than the Psychic. Neutrals have no equivalent and thus appear as themselves. The Prince can be made to jail himself (and will thus be immune to visits) and he can be make to kill someone other than his prisoner.</li>
<li>Basically when there is no target then replace the word “you” with the target (an Enforcer defending the unseen will give up his targets life to save the unseen)</li>
<li>The cult leader can be made to sacrifice a BD</li>
<li>The MM can be made to make someone the assassin with dirty work (Not sure if it should piece convert immunity)</li>
<li>The mercenary and sellsword can use rebound/revenge on your target even if they didn’t vote his target or make someone else night immune with guard.</li>
</ul>
