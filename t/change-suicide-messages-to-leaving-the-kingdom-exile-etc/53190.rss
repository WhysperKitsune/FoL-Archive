    <title>Change &quot;Suicide&quot; messages to leaving the kingdom/exile/etc</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-suicide-messages-to-leaving-the-kingdom-exile-etc/53190</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve never been the kind of person to care about trigger words or anything like that, but I have a friend who won&#39;t play this game because seeing the message &quot;You have taken your own life&quot; reminds them of actual suicidal impulses. Games like this are meant to be an escape from stuff like that.

I didn&#39;t think much about it before, but wouldn&#39;t it be easy to just change the message to &quot;You have left the kingdom&quot; or &quot;You have given up your position in the court&quot; or &quot;You have gone into exile?&quot; That makes more sense to me from a lore perspective too, ESPECIALLY with the changes in 1.1. 

Let me explain: we now have seven classes in the game that can commit suicide (Butler, Merc, Scorned, Inquis, Knight, CL, MM). Why would an inquisitor or scorned kill himself after achieving their objective? It makes more sense for an inquisitor to just leave the court to find magic users elsewhere, not commit suicide.  A butler or knight would probably renounce their position before committing suicide, too. Resurrect and Call of the Dead also got removed from the game, so changing suicide to leaving wouldn&#39;t conflict with any abilities. It just seems like an easy change to make the game have a more party-appropriate atmosphere.</description>

            <p>Thanks again for all the positive feedback and constructive criticism. At the time of writing, this is the only suggestion I could find with an “extremely high” like to post ratio, so that really makes me hopeful that it’ll actually be implemented. If any Imperium staff have seen this thread, I’d be overjoyed to get some feedback from them.</p>
<p>I’m not picky about what the suicide messages would be replaced with – whether the scorned just disappears as a vengeful spirit or leaves the kingdom doesn’t make a big difference to me. I just think it would be a LOT more satisfying to the player if winning the game meant peaceful retirement instead of “I WON, TIME TO KILL MYSELF!”</p>
<p>As for the other classes, Darkness explained it best with the examples he listed out. Like he said, a lot of cases are really morbid. The character feeling like they’ve failed shouldn’t be equivalent to suicide for them. Just giving up on their objective and disappearing from the game is enough.</p>

            <p>They could change Scorned to be a vengeful spirit that disappears like UncannyLuck suggested.</p>
<p>Maybe Inquisitor can have a message pop up saying he died peacefully of old age but was satisfied, knowing he did his duty to the Church in the end by hunting down the Sorcerer.</p>

            <p>True… I just hope it’s reaper that gets it, cuz he’s the one that needs it most.</p>
<p>Well in any case my REAL point was that we can come up with a lore reason for Knight killing himself and not his target if we try hard enough.</p>

            <p>With the exception of the knight I agree with all of these.</p>
<p>With the knight I’m sure that we could have it instead give the target a message and have the lore be that he actually attacked them but their response made it clear they were good. So since he thinks he just killed a BD he kills himself however he’s also dumb and stupid and wrong ect because the guy he attacked is alive.</p>

            <p>I have personally never felt it being triggering or out of place with the theme of the game, but I’d be indifferent to a change honestly.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the responses everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>otherwise you’ll know they just left rather than being killed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Butler already gets a notification at night saying “You are going to kill yourself because you poisoned a good king” the night before he dies, so the only thing they have to write in the log is “I’m killing myself because I made a mistake”. So, no change there, just saves the player from writing a literal suicide note.</p>
<p>It does affect the gameplay for knight, but a knight should already write “CS [X]” the night they do it, and if he dies that night and his target doesn’t, the most reasonable thing to assume is he tried to CS a BD. The only thing that my idea would change is a fringe situation where he’s attacked the night he tries to CS, AND his CS target wasn’t BD. Before 1.1, he could tell this info to the psychic or use it as a death knight, but now he’s just going to take it to the grave.</p>
<p>The only method knights have of finding information is CSing a death immune class and then telling people about it the next day. Giving everyone the info that he did, in fact, try to CS a BD, seems like a decent exchange for his life.</p>
<p>But, if Imperium doesn’t want to give the knight this slight buff, I would be okay with knight staying as it is. In this case, maybe the suicide message could be changed to “You have admitted your treason to the court and have been privately executed,” something like that, so his corpse still shows up.</p>

            <p>Note:I don’t have a problem with the suicide message just it doesn’t feel thematically correct. This has nothing to do with my personal shit.</p>

            <p>The correct response is “kill myself”, because otherwise you’ll know they just left rather than being killed.</p>

            <p>orangeandblack5: “Not a fan of this for BD but it’s fine for the Neuts”</p>
<p>Knight: “I almost killed an innocent person, but discovered the truth in time. Should I…”<br>
A) Kill myself<br>
B) Renounce my knighthood and leave the kingdom [Gameplay effect: this will notify players that a CS failed due to the target being BD, giving a slight buff to Knight class]</p>
<p>Butler: “I just poisoned my King and he was Blue Dragon. Should I…”<br>
A) Kill myself<br>
B) Flee the kingdom because I committed treason against the crown [Gameplay effect: notify everyone that the Butler murdered the BD king, which is something that any Butler already puts in his logs already, unless they are gamethrowing]</p>
<p>Also, the Fool’s gameplay goal is to get himself executed, but that’s probably because he’s a fool, so I don’t think he’s actually suicidal, he’s just an idiot or an attention seeker, maybe wants to go out in a blaze of glory after being ignored all his life (he does seem to live in an outhouse). So it makes sense for him.</p>
