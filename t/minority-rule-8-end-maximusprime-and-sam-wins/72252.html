Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me.</p>

<p><font color="springgreen"><strong>Order of application goes:</strong></font></p>
<p>Effects of the Room<br>
Existing Statuses<br>
Majority calculated (Death from majority happens here.)<br>
New Statuses</p>
<h2>Extra Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>This game will be played on your own. No partners. Sorry.</li>
<li>Each round one room will have a tangerine in it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/tangerine.png!v=9" title=":tangerine:" class="emoji" alt=":tangerine:">. If there are 2 players left alive at the end whoever has the most tangerines <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/tangerine.png!v=9" title=":tangerine:" class="emoji" alt=":tangerine:"> wins. If both have the same it is a draw.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hippo’s Changes</h2>
<p>There are several changes within the rooms and statuses this time. The aim was to try to reduce RNG a bit (only in a few rooms where it wasn’t necessary) and make more rooms present interesting scenarios. There is still the same amount of rooms. Look at the Change Log in Minority Rule 7 for precisely what was changed.</p>
<p>The way the game works is fundamentally different in this one. The rooms will be drawn in an order, and if multiple rooms are tied for majority only the room first drawn (highest up on the list) will be eliminated.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Example</summary>
<p>Rooms are drawn in a hierarchy. For example in round 1 the rooms could be:</p>
<p>1: <strong><font color="Cornflowerblue">Holy </font></strong> (4 people chose this)<br>
2: <strong><font color="lightbrown">Earth </font></strong> (3 people chose this)<br>
3: <strong><font color="black">Death </font></strong> (1 person chose this)<br>
4: <strong><font color="green">Luck </font></strong> (4 people chose this)</p>
<p>Normally both everyone in  <strong><font color="Cornflowerblue">Holy </font></strong> AND everyone in <strong><font color="green">Luck </font></strong> would be eliminated as they tie for the majority. However, with the new hierarchy rules ONLY the people in <strong><font color="Cornflowerblue">Holy </font></strong> are eliminated as it is higher up than <strong><font color="green">Luck </font></strong>.</p>
</details>
<p>This will make the game last longer so you do not need so many people, and reduces the chance of a draw. It should also make the game more tactical hopefully, which is the main aim of most of the other changes.</p>
