    <title>Perhaps A new Mystic Ability. (Possible dead gossip)</title>

    <description>Give this ability to mystic: 

Abyssal Dreams: 
1 Use, Day Ability

&gt; See all gossip results of the dead players found the night before the day this ability was used. Unable to be used before D3. But also can&#39;t read any evil or neutral feedback. Any defiled targets still will not show their results.

&gt; Reason Why I feel like this should be a ability.

I Feel sorry for the investigatives and everyone else with leads that die. That is of the blue dragon factions. I know. No dead interaction. But I felt like this would be mainly a very interesting ability to add. I know. These are horrible. But, I wanted to try and make a possible chance to make BD investigatives die with the possibility of hope</description>
