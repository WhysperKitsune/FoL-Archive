    <description>Sometimes it&#39;s expedient to bus someone who just got converted when you are their team member.  But currently the rules prohibit that and they usually won&#39;t let you.  However some would allow themselves to be bussed, or at least I would, so I&#39;d like there to be some notification when you convert someone if they are okay with you bussing them ... Like if you&#39;re MM and about to get executed for no leads, you just converted someone and you need to bus them to regain credibility.</description>

            <p>rather than “to the account”, perhaps some kind of marker in the interface that can be toggled at any point in the day or night. Maybe 3 states to it.</p>
<p>IE the 3 states it can be toggled to would have the implications of</p>
<p>“I highly opposed being bussed”<br>
“If you believe it is in the best interest of the side you may bus me”<br>
“I strongly encourage you to bus me right now”</p>

            <p>The marker should only show after they get converted, to prevent only trying to convert those with the marker.</p>

            <p>I might’ve not been clear in the OP but I’m proposing a setting associated with a user’s account that notifies unseen when they’re converted if they’re okay with being bussed</p>
