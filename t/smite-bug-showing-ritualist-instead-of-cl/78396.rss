    <title>Smite bug showing ritualist instead of CL</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/smite-bug-showing-ritualist-instead-of-cl/78396</link>
    <description>#### What happened? Smited CL, CL showed up as ritualist instead of CL (he was a converted phys)

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? CL showing up as CL when smited

#### Steps to reproduce: Convert turned CL tries to convert someone and gets smited

#### Comments: There was a scorned ingame, might be a bug with scorned disguise. I asked the scorned to confirm or deny that he disguised the CL that night but he didn&#39;t answer
