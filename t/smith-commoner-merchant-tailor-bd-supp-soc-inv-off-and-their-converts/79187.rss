~~This is a WIP. Still missing the Smelter convert, but it shouldn&#39;t take that long to do, right?~~ 12 days later, he&#39;s here!
Made in like 3-4 hours.
Originally I planned on making a BD Killer + convert too, but yeah, it proved too difficult.

Please give feedback ~~and ideas~~ :)</description>

</aside>
<p>Can target self <strong>and won’t consume a charge if you do</strong>.</p>
<p>Right now it negates it’s own effect because using it consumes a charge but then the effect itself gives it right back. So it needs to not consume a charge when self targeting in order for it to work properly.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d like to note that immunity bypasses were removed.</p>
<p>You could substitute the intended effect by having it be “they will be occupied and their target will become occupy and redirect immune that night”</p>
<p>This also has the benefit of making the ability more versatile, which is fine because I consider the class highly situational at the moment.</p>

</aside>
<p>Note that I’m going to assume the answer to all of my questions are no.</p>
<p>Against Unseen this class is fine, since while it usually confirms the assassin if marked it won’t confirm the MM or the converts if applicable.</p>
<p>However against the Cult this is sometimes OP. If you check the starting CL then not only can you match the Kill visits up to determine that they are in fact the CL (which by itself would be fine) but more importantly you can retroactively determine who the converts are (players that weren’t attacked but were visited).</p>
<p>It’s not fundumentally a problem, but there may need to be a failsafe of some sort to ensure that you can’t immediately out the entire cult minus 1 with just 2 ability uses.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sure, but I don’t think a Support class should have an easy to confirm ability like that. And generally I think we can both agree on mechanical confirms = not good. At least heals require you to be on the right target on the right day, this just requires someone to have used a limited use ability. Which isn’t extremely hard to arrange, really.</p>
<p>I know you mentioned whether or not it should work on killer classes, and I think it shouldn’t. Giving Hunter more bears, Prince more exes, Assassin more 2F1s, and Poss more Jumps all seem a bit too powerful. Especially since Prince would be an easy one to hardconfirm with, since they can just exe a neut n3.</p>
<p>If someone were to use their first use of a limited use ability, such as Prince exeing n3, and you use the ability on them N3, would they still lose a use?</p>

</aside>
<p>I somehow missed this when I wrote most of my initial post. Would they just not have the ability to step, or would votes for them just be nullified? Because if they <em>can’t step</em>, then there’s some big hardconfirm problems here. Fakeclaiming most royals is already pretty hard.</p>

<p><s>This is a WIP. Still missing the Smelter convert, but it shouldn’t take that long to do, right?</s> 12 days later, he’s here!<br>
Made in like 3-4 hours.<br>
Originally I planned on making a BD Killer + convert too, but yeah, it proved too difficult.</p>
<p>Please give feedback <s>and ideas</s> <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
