<p>You are an <font color="#FF8000"><span class="bbcode-b">Augur</span></font>!</p>
<p>Death can never come too soon, for you there is new life in death. Those that die around you are merely wandering spirits, waiting for your guidance underneath your spiritual light. You offer repentance to all who dwindle on this plain of existence.</p>
<p>During the Action Phase, you may ask any dead players up to three questions divided (question length = 100 characters). The dead player may respond to each question(20 characters).</p>
<p>Once per game, during the Action Phase, you may message the moderator of the current game and ask 1 question about someone who is already dead. Questions against anyone who is currently alive will be ignored. The Moderator will not lie about what they tell you; the information is correct.</p>

<p>You are a <span class="bbcode-b"><font color="#BF0000">Barbarian</font></span>!</p>
<p>Across the land, your name is whispered in fearful corners and shouted from the peaks of mountains. Mighty conquerors seek mighty trophies, and the Palace is certainly a worthy trophy.</p>
<p>Three times per game, during the Dinner Phase, you may intimidate one player, preventing them from acting (challenging), however they must accept all challenges made against them. PM the Moderator to use this power.</p>
<p>If you intimidate a player, the intimidated player will be announced at the beginning of the Challenge Phase.</p>

<p>You are a <font color="#0A0A0A"><span class="bbcode-b">Blackmailer</span></font>!</p>
<p>Your hobby is certainly dirty- in that you dig up dirt. Research and preparation are the keys to success. Before you entered the Palace, you were already familiar with every tidbit and secret embedded in the past of the other players- secrets that will make them cringe in fear and do your bidding.</p>
<p>During the Dinner Phase, you may blackmail one player. PM the Moderator to use this power.</p>
<p>Blackmailed players must partake in a challenge during the Challenge Phase, or will die.</p>

<p>Steel flows like water under your steady gaze and steady flame. The pounding of your hammer crafts works of art and workers of war. One of your weapons in a hand guarantees victory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Action Phase, you will be notified of the intended winner(s) of the accepted duel(s).</p>
<p>Three times per game, during the Action Phase, you may change the winner of a duel. PM the Moderator to use this power. You may use this ability once on yourself.</p>

<p>Entertaining is your bread and butter, you live and breath laughter and lightheartedness. Capable of soothing even the loudest of mobs into a quiet peace and calmness. You will do anything to prevent death, including changing your act when it occurs.</p>
<p>When a player dies by non-execution your position on the duel/dance list is randomized (Credit to Blackajack for this one)</p>
<p>Once per game you may choose to entertain your fellow guests and force a skip of the current voting phase and preventing that the MAA Shot, Poisoner’s Poison and the Current execution from taking place.</p>

<p>All these poor people attempting to fool their way to riches, you have, and always has, been an excellent murderer. By detecting weakness in the group, you can spread fear with one simple line - Who done it?</p>
<p>Once per voting phase, you may shoot one person. They will not survive the shot unless they are the Soldier. If you shoot the Soldier, the Soldier will kill you instead.</p>
<p>You can only shoot losers of duels/dances.</p>
<p>Additionally, you also gain an additional shooting every time you defeat a player in a duel or dance.</p>
<p>The shooting is silent, meaning it does not reveal your role.</p>
<p>You cannot store more than 1 shot at a time.</p>
<p>You start off with one shot.</p>

<p>Perfect pitch, perfect playing… perfect music. Hands dance across strings and keys as the notes rise and fall. No matter the tune, no matter the tempo, every song ascends to perfection in your grasp. Yet with a single twist, that song becomes an instrument of death.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Action Phase, you will be notified of the intended winner(s) of the accepted dance(s).</p>

<p><em>You may tap into your power, your passion to release your inner fire, and allow the heat of your ethereal flames to destroy your opponents in a duel.

<p>Each dinner phase you may choose between 3 positions: Fire, Nature and Water</p>
<p>When you’re in the Water position you are moved to the top of the dance list and bottom of the duel</p>
<p>When you’re in the Fire position, you are moved to the top of the duel list and bottom of the dance</p>
<p>When you’re in the Nature you take a neutral stance in the middle</p>

-Players may still join a backup queue once the game begins</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>-The last player standing is the victor.<br>
-A player’s role is not revealed when they die (of course, if their role was guessed you will know it).<br>
-Players may PM other players during the game as long as the moderator is included.<br>
-Dead players cannot post, but moderator discretion may permit a final post or a pre submitted last will.<br>
-Actions, gifts, and guesses are sent to the moderator.<br>
-No quoting/fake quoting mod messages</p>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>-The game itself has four phases.<br>
-Discussion is permitted and encouraged throughout all phases.</p>

<p>-The Challenge Phase lasts 72 hours, or until all players have challenged or nochallenged and all pending challenges are resolved.<br>
-The game begins on this phase.<br>
-Players may “/challenge” other players to dances or duels.<br>
-Once issued, the challenged player must choose whether to “/accept” the challenge or use a “/deny” (all players begin the game with a deny).<br>
-If the challenged player does not respond by the end of the Challenge Phase, the challenge is automatically accepted.<br>
-Each player may only challenge once per Challenge Phase (even if the challenge is denied), but can be challenged multiple times.<br>
-If a player does not wish to challenge, they may instead “/nochallenge”. This allows the phase to end earlier. Players must still choose whether to accept or deny challenges.<br>
-The results of the challenges will be posted at the end of the Action Phase (see Action Phase).<br>
-The victors of duels and dances are determined by which player’s roles are higher on the respective list (see below), plus any interfering abilities.</p>

<h2>Action Phase</h2>
<p>-The Action Phase lasts 24 hours, or until all actions have been received.<br>

-At the moderator’s discretion, players may begin selected gifts (see Voting Phase).<br>
-The results for duels and dances will be posted at the end of the Action Phase.</p>
<h2>Voting Phase</h2>
<p>-The Voting Phase lasts 48 hours, or until a 90% majority has been reached or until all players have voted.<br>
-The Voting Phase will still occur during the first round, but no players will be voted and no execution will occur.<br>
-Any player who lost a duel or dance during the past Challenge Phase is a valid vote target.<br>
-The player with the most votes at the end of the phase will be executed.<br>
-If there is a tie, there is a revote. If the votes are still tied, no player is executed.<br>
-The Court Jester, Man-at-arms, Royal, and Poisoner act during this phase. The Royal may also PM an extra vote.<br>
-Players may also select gifts during this phase (see below).<br>
-For each challenge participated in (no matter if won or lost) the player earns one gift. Gifts are revealed at the end of the Voting Phase.</p>
<h2>Gifts</h2>
<p>Extra Deny- Grants an extra deny to deny a challenge (see Challenge Phase) (each player starts with one deny)<br>
Extra Switch- Grants an extra plate switch to swap plates (see Dinner Phase) (each player starts with one switch)<br>
Free Guess- During the upcoming Dinner Phase, you may make a guess as to a player’s role. If you are correct, they will be executed. You may only choose one of this gift per round.<br>
Guess Immunity- You are not a valid guess target during the next Dinner Phase.<br>
Premium Food- Your plate cannot be switched except from by the Thief and you are not a valid Poisoner target during the Voting Phase (you can still be poisoned if your plate is switched)<br>
Gift Reserve - This gift can be redeemed at any point later in the game for a gift of your choosing. You can only hold up to 3 of this gift at a time.<br>
Lottery Ticket - If you are the only one to take this gift, you get 2x the amount of gifts.</p>
<h2>Dinner Phase</h2>
<p>-The Dinner Phase ends after 24 hours, or after all players have switched or noswitched.<br>
-Each player is given a plate of food.<br>
-You may “/switch” the food of any two players, consuming a plate switch (each player begins with one plate switch).<br>
-If somebody has switch plates with you, you may not take it back directly and have to switch/noswitch again<br>
-At the end of the phase, each player eats the food in front of them.<br>
-Players who eat poison food will die (excluding the Soldier).<br>
-The Barbarian, Blackmailer and Nymph act during this phase. The Thief may secretly switch plates during this phase.<br>
-In addition, if you received a free guess as a gift, you must use it during the Dinner Phase. If you are correct, that player will be executed at the end of the Dinner Phase. All attempted guesses are revealed at the end of the Dinner Phase.<br>
-If you do not have a free guess, you may still make a guess as to another player’s role as normal. However, if you are incorrect, you will be executed.</p>
