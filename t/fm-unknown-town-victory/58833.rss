    <title>FM - Unknown (Town Victory!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fm-unknown-town-victory/58833</link>
    <description>## :gun: [color=darkblue]Forum Mafia - Unknown[/color] :houses:  
&lt;small&gt;Hey, it&#39;s not a uPick! Hosted by Marluxion!&lt;/small&gt;

## [color=lightskyblue]What&#39;s different?[/color]
Essentially nothing! The only major difference from normal forum mafia is.. You don&#39;t know the roles. The full role list has been hand picked by me. 

Things to note; There will be no form of conversion or bastard mechanics. (No, Ici. A fool/jester is not a bastard mechanic.) 
There will also be no cops with inherently altered results such as an insane cop. 
There will also be no vanilla citizens, to keep things interesting for those who dislike them.
Every role will be some form of an already existing standard role. I will not be creating custom classes for anyone. 
You may leave a journal for when you die in your rolecard. Death Notes are also a thing because why not. 

### [color=violet]Gameplay[/color]
Days will last 72 hours and Nights will last 24.
The mafia WILL have a night and day chat.
Majority is in effect like usual. 
Don&#39;t angleshoot like a nerd
Don&#39;t nightpost or twilightpost.  


#### The Game will consist of
[color=green]11 Members of the Town[/color]
[color=red]4 Members of the Mafia[/color]
[color=gray]4 Neutrals[/color]

### Rolelist :scroll:
It seems a janitor has cleaned the role list! We&#39;ll search for it as the game progresses!

<p>Plus I was asleep while he became drunken loose cannon. You know that took 2 hours for Day 3 to end? Ridiculous.</p>

</aside>
<p>He would still lose sooner or later, dousing now means we still hang him. Igniting while we’re clever enough not to kill anymore townies - it is you who didn’t held the agreement and kill the jailkeeper anyway, yet you are not expecting him to be jailed and thought PKR would dealt with us by now, who’s the komaeda now? Certainly not him in that picture.</p>
