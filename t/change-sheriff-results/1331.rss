    <title>Change Sheriff results</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-sheriff-results/1331</link>
    <description>I was playing sheriff for the first time and when I got my first result, the text was a little hard to read but I saw purple text saying &quot;Black Rose&quot; so I assumed they were a member of the Black Rose. Later, I realized I have been reading it wrong and it said my target **was not** a member of the Black Rose. This needs to be changed. 

My suggestion is if your target is a member, just keep it that way. If they are not a member, the result should be &quot;_______ is not a member of the Black Rose&quot; without the purple text.</description>
