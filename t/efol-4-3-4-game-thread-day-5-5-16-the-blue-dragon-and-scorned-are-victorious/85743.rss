## Rules

Follow the [Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244), and the [Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926). Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.
Wisdom of the Mod will be used heavily for this game in order to ensure a quality game experience.
Alts are *not* allowed.

## Gameplay

* Days are 48 hours long or until an execution ends it, Nights last 24 hours. The first day is an exception, it lasts only 24 hours and has no execution.
* You will be provided a DM with your classcard by the host, send your actions there.
* Unseen/Cult will talk through a special Discord server or forum message.
* All other private messages will take place through the forum.
* Flavor, if it exists, is not alignment-indicative.

## Executions

* To accuse someone say “/vote [player]”. Please make the life of the hosts easier by bolding it, and pinging an active host: `**/vote [player] @host**` and `**/unvote @host**`
* Should the votes reach majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.
* When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.
* Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.
* Voting “no execute” is an option.
* You may self vote.

## Picking a New King

* At the start of d2 and every day phase after a king dies, a king election takes place. There will not be an election if there are 4 or less players alive. 
* When the king dies a 12 hour period starts. In this, players may vote *in their class PM* for who they want to become the next king. 
* Voting for execution may take place simultaneously. If a majority execution takes place before the end of the 12 hour period, the election instantly resolves. 
* Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned king. If votes are tied, a king election will be held the next day to determine it.

## Action Results

Ask the hosts if you have any questions.
The [feedback list](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/forum-of-lies-hosting-feedback-list/75082) works for most results.


Night abilities will be processed in following order/priority:

1. Visit Prevention
2. Occupation
4. Bus Driving (target swapping)
5. Killing
6. Protection
7. Miscellaneous Effects (like Bounty)
8. Investigation 1 (Faction checks, type checks, etc)
9. Conversion
10. Investigation 2 (Every kind of investigation which checks for abilities used *this* night)

In case there are conflicts on the same level (example: two drunks bus drive the same people), all these conflicting effects are canceled.

(thanks Geyde)

## Journals

DM the host what you want on your journal. When you die, the last update to your journal will be revealed to everyone. It has a limit of 1000 characters.

            <p>you thought you caught someone in a lie, and you did on marl (kinda idr what he was doing)</p>
<p>looked like you wanted to own wind too</p>
<p>dont rly blame you altho i vaguely remember thinking winds skepticism towards marl was indicating that they knew they were redirected</p>
<p>might be misremembering but rereading the game might make me sad</p>

            <p>i think your handling of your class on D2 was a tiny bit awkward</p>
<p>mostly in the sense that i feel like you made it exceedingly obvious that you were a drunk who swapped geyde n1, and when you pushed windward and they outted they were redirected off of geyde n1, letting them know who they had actually checked might have been good?</p>
<p>although i probably only think this because they ended up shooting their greencheck and you had no real reason to think they were prince over any other invest</p>
<p>come to think of it this isnt really a criticism at all</p>
