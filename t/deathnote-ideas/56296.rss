    <description>I know this wouldn&#39;t have a huge impact on the game but I&#39;d like to see a sort &quot;Deathnote Gallery&quot; where you can post deathnotes, view other deathnotes, add the deathnote on your deathnote, and like deathnotes

This is kind of how I think it would work

You would be able to press a button in game on you&#39;re deathnote called &quot;Post&quot; where you would post your deathnote, after the game you would able to confirm post or delete

You would be able to browse deathnotes and then if you find a deathnote you like you would be able to like it and add it to a favourite deathnotes which  you can use in game but if you do then uneraseable text will be on it saying who made it 

The username of the player would also appear on the post

Of course there should be a report button to report player&#39;s who post inappropriate things

It should also be completely blocked in a time of a deathnote contest so no one steals other people&#39;s stuff

There should also be a color subcategory for searching through it imo

You could also do the same thing with Logs/Journals</description>

            <p>I would love to see a deathnote gallery, assuming it is heavily moderated.</p>

            <p>Interesting idea, in my opinion. I’m not much of a deathnote artist or connoisseur myself, but I can see this possibly being added to the game. Of course, I would like the suggestion more if the typos were amended, but to each their own.</p>
