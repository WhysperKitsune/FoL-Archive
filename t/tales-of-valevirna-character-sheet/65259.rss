    <description>Welcome to the world of Valevirna, a place of magic and wonder. In Valevirna all forms of magic exist, and a few select mortals can harness this magic to better ends. You are one of these mortals. Or perhaps, you are immortal? An elf? A vampire? A werewolf? In Valevirna, anything and everything can exist. You can be anything you want to be. Keep in mind, however, that this takes place in a classical fantasy setting, in other words, this takes place in medieval times.

Additional information: When Mary and Johnathan Black had a child, they called that child Lily, she grew up strong, however, Lily Black was stolen from her crib in the night by Fae, and in her place was left a changeling baby, this baby grew up living the life that was taken from Lily Black, she, like her parents, were none the wiser. When she turned 18 the fae came to take her back, but she fought back, and killed those who came to take her, after that she spoke to the old witch woman of her village, who taught her how to utilise her magic. She still lives with her human parents, keeping them safe from harm should the fae ever come for her again.</p>
