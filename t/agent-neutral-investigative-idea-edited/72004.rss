    <title>Agent [Neutral Investigative Idea] *edited*</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/agent-neutral-investigative-idea-edited/72004</link>
    <description>This is a class idea that functions similarly to an alchemist in the sense that they need to pick a side to win, but with investigative and support themed abilities instead of the tools that the alchemist has. Instead of the alchemist using heals, kills, truths and tars, this class will solely rely on investigations, tests, and listening.

**WIN CONDITION**: Survive.

**[PASSIVES]**

- **Conversion Immunity**

**[DAY ABILITIES]**

[2 uses] - **Eavesdrop**
Listen in on the prince and his prisoner for the night.

[2 use] - **Undercover Work**
Listen in on the evils for the night. (Doing this will also notify you if you are listening to the CULT or UNSEEN)

**[NIGHT ABILITIES]**

[2 uses] - **Hide**
Grants death immunity by hiding from attackers.

[3 uses] - **Test Alignment**
Investigate a player. 
If they are Blue Dragon or Unseen/Cult, then you will only discover their faction.
If they are Neutral, then you will discover their class.

**Summary**: The Agent is a neutral investigative class that solely relies on gathering information in the game to survive. Much like how the Alchemist is allowed to stay alive due to his healing capabilities, many would like to keep an Agent alive because of how much information they are capable of obtaining. Not only is Test Alignment the strongest investigative ability in the game, but it allows the Agent to give information to either side, evil or blue dragon, to achieve his victory. In addition, seeing the classes of his neutral allies will allow him to potentially team with the Neutral Killer, if he discovers him. He must survive by any means necessary, and that means betraying whoever he needs to, like a true double agent.


Let me know what you guys think! Nothing is ever perfect for a first draft.</description>

            <p>The first couple of abilities, or even any one of them specifically make the agent unique to any other class and very much confirmable. There is absolutely no room for it to fake-claim<br>
Having a 5 use faction check also makes it very hard to deal with as evils.</p>
<p>The only way I can think of to counteract this is to give it tools to make it less inclined to help BD and make it more difficult for the agent to reliably out information</p>
<p>Give it no death immunity, as well as being unhealable.<br>
I’d expect this class to have similar win-rates as alchemist, if not a higher win-rate because it hasn’t really got a way in which it can actively hurt BD.</p>
