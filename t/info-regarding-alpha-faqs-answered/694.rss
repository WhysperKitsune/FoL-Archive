    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/info-regarding-alpha-faqs-answered/694</link>
    <description>[color=red]**EDIT:** **Alpha is LIVE!** We&#39;re still sending out keys, so np if you didn&#39;t get one yet -- join us on Discord @ https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB[/color]
**INFO REGARDING ALPHA! FAQ&#39;s Answered below:**
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/3870c87b2ec2d21e642a1a87e6509c64fd5e1a8a.gif&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;294&quot;&gt;

## &quot;YES, ZOMG! FINALLY!&quot;

* Alpha will most likely come **March 31st** (yep -- in just a couple days) -- likely released **at night EST.** Because we&#39;re **incredibly** on-time, there&#39;s no room for error: so we will just say &quot;Friday Night&quot; for now :slight_smile: we&#39;ll let you know if this changes.

* Make sure you add **noreply@imperium42.com** / **noreply@throneoflies.com** to your email contacts to ensure your keys don&#39;t get thrown to spam: Your key(s) will be sent via email.

* We&#39;ll be sending out keys in 2 cohorts: Backers first (to ensure our key distribution system works -- even that is in alpha, haha), **then** Veterans. Not too long, after (few hours, perhaps).

* Your initial keys are for **Alpha/Beta**, so although our [Steam Store](http://throneofli.es/steam) page shows **Summer 2017**, alpha/beta users will see it accessible immediately. So once you get your keys, you can play (that&#39;s why we&#39;re waiting for last second).

* YES, you can stream! All we ask is that if you run into &quot;not-so-funny&quot; bugs, let people know it&#39;s a super early technical Alpha.

* For the latest news (and if you want your questions answered fast), join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB) server.

* There is a **START MATCH NOW** button in case you want to start with less than 16 players, however, population should not be much of a problem except within the first few hours of launch (people need to install the game, etc). It&#39;s recommended you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB) server to arrange for matches if there&#39;s a population issue. However, we are sending out **~3,000 keys**. This is was a big reason we did the &quot;[Veteran Status](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/VeteranStatus)&quot; promo was for +population :thumbsup:   

* If a [Veteran](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/VeteranStatus) does **not** receive an email, it&#39;s likely they were disqualified by the [Veteran Status eligibility](http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/VeteranStatus) (**TL;DR:** You unsubscribed from us or caught cheating the system).

* We have already made efforts to translate the [Steam store page](http://throneofli.es/steam) and [Wikia](https://tol.wikia.com) into multiple languages, however Alpha (in-game) will **start with English only**. We will add more soon enough! If you play during Alpha, please only speak English until we add non-English matchmaking options.

* No drawing penises in the deathnotes ;D [it&#39;s in the ToS](https://www.ThroneOfLies.com/legal/terms.html) you&#39;ll be agreeing to before entering the game. Will penises and dickbutts happen anyway? Unfortunately, yes -- sheath your eyes. We&#39;ll later add a &quot;NSFW/Blur&quot; button to blur the deathnote for YOU, and if x clicks, blur for everyone. We don&#39;t have time to deal with NSFW reports right now, however just please use your own judgement and keep our community awesome. **If we get excessive reports from 1 person, we will enforce the ToS**.

* We will likely setup some &quot;judges&quot; later to assist in reports, but not during Alpha. In fact, most reports will barely be monitored during Alpha -- let&#39;s hope for the best and we&#39;ll start monitoring more during beta.

* You can party with friends during Alpha! This is one thing that we tried extra-hard to allow for as early as alpha. First, add a friend to your friends list in the lobby by either your nickname, username, or email (really easy to find people). You get unlimited friends. Later, you can add a note about them to help you remember who you added. When you invite someone, it&#39;ll pop up as an invite on STEAM. Later, we&#39;ll find a way to add a dramatic popup button. When you add a friend, the other person does not get notified (for now) -- you just &quot;add them&quot; and that&#39;s that. 

* When you accept a Steam invite to a game, the host will jump right into a room and start queueing, but will reserve a slot for your friend -- so make sure to only join when ready. We&#39;ll add a staging room later.

* **If you registered with FB**, you must first use your username + password to login &gt;&gt; then you can 1-click with Steam login. Sorry about that -- FB is not working in this current version of Unity (Unity bug, not ours).

* **When you first login in any form, your Steam account will be auto-linked.** This means that after your first login (in any form -- even email+pass), you can login with Steam.

* Report  bugs in #feedback-suggestions category with [BUG] title.

* Initial Alpha testing is for **technical testing** -- you &lt;del&gt;may&lt;/del&gt; will experience bugs during this phase. The purpose of Alpha testing is to stress test our servers, kill gamebreaking bugs, and finish implementing core features. Beta+ will be more-polished and feature-filled.

* You will receive your backer stuff and customization features patched in &quot;soon&quot; -- but not initially. Everyone will be given something random, for now (for armor+weapon).

* These keys you can give away, but are not permitted for resale. _This means you_, G2A.

* For backers -- your &quot;backer bundle&quot; will arrive in a separate email and will be a promo code for use in-game or our website. To ensure Alpha was released on time, we decided to deliver this separately -- we asked in priority feedback section of the private backers Discord server if that&#39;s what they prefer, and the backers have spoken! It won&#39;t be long -- you can&#39;t do anything with gp or customization during initial launch, anyway -- that&#39;ll be patched in.

Enjoy ;D

            <p>Just to clarify: <strong>Alpha is LIVE!</strong></p>
<p>There was a confirmation email sent out a while back that would confirm you were a veteran if you were reading that email. I can do checks later, but <strong>we are still sending out keys</strong>. If you haven’t received a key yet, we’re still sending it out in waves to ensure nothing breaks.</p>

            <p>I believe that I signed up before the veteran deadline, but I’m not sure, as I don’t know how to check if I am a vet. (can’t remember when I signed up, was a long time). I haven’t received a key or anything, so I’m confused.</p>

            <p>Also – for backers – your <strong>“backer bundle”</strong> will arrive in a separate email and will be a promo code for use in-game or our website. To ensure Alpha was released on time, we decided to deliver this separately – we asked in priority feedback section of the private backers Discord server if that’s what they prefer, and the backers have spoken!</p>
<p>It won’t be long – you can’t do anything with gp or customization during initial launch, anyway – that’ll be patched in.</p>

<p>This will be good for both Alpha + Beta. Release will be separate keys sent later (they won’t let us get release keys yet because, well, it’s not released!).</p>
<p>It’s technically called a “Steam Beta” ToL build, but it’s for “ToL Alpha+Beta”.</p>
<p>(There’s a CHANCE the key will also work for release – Steamworks is a bit vague on the wording, which I can’t quote because of NDA but we’ll see later – no big deal)</p>

            <p>I asked this question before, Xblade said the keys will auto update upon Release to Release because “that’s manageable on the game” or something, I forget his exact words.</p>
