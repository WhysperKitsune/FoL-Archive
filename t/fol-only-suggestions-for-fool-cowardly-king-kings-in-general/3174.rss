    <title>(FOL Only) Suggestions for Fool/Cowardly King/Kings in General</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fol-only-suggestions-for-fool-cowardly-king-kings-in-general/3174</link>
    <description>So, I was thinking recently that as the community has started to become more serious, I think we need to rethink a few of the ~~roles~~ classes. First up, Fool - As seen below :-

&gt;The Fool
Neutral Wildcard
Poor Fellow (Passive) - If you are executed, no-one may be executed for the next two days
Surprise Mojo (Night) - Occupy a player - Infinite Uses
Foolish (Night) - You will frame yourself tonight, you will appear evil to investigative classes - 2 uses
Your objective is to be executed for Treason 

The main issue is with the &#39;Poor Fellow&#39; passive. It punishes players for doing what they should be doing - killing the scum. This is considered a &#39;Bastard&#39; role because of that, and frankly, shouldn&#39;t be included in a serious social deduction game. However, the Fool has a loveable place in the community, and with some tweaking can still be a threat, but not horrendously busted as it is now

**Poor Fellow**: If voted for execution, those who condemned you to death (Voted Execute) will be unable to perform an action the following night and day. They also for feel too downhearted to vote the following day. Players unable to vote this way will not count towards that days majority

Next is this guy 

&gt;The Cowardly King (Unofficial Class)   
Neutral Special
Pass The Torch (Passive) - If you die, a new King will arise
Regrets (Passive) - If you are executed, the regret of killing an innocent coward will weigh upon everyone. The first person who voted up the cowardly king will die tonight. The King will also choose an heir from the grave who will be instantly made King and you will win if they survive.
The Royal Finger (Day) - Your vote for today counts as 2 votes - 1 Day Cooldown
Decide Fate (Day) - You may change the result of a trial - 1 Use
Dead Rage (Night) - When dead send a message it will be shown in the morning - 2 use
Guard! (Night) - Choose a player, they will not die tonight (Includes you) - 3 Uses
Your objective is to remain alive until the game ends

For the most part, I&#39;m OK with this ~~role~~ class as it stops people hating on neutral kings &#39;Because they are neutral&#39;. However, it has no mechanism for dealing with a Neutral king &#39;Gone Rogue&#39;. I suggest adding the following passive

**Tainted**: If you vote to execute two Blue Dragon players, or use Force Verdict to execute a Blue Dragon Player, you will become a Tainted King.

Tainted King will be the same as  a Cowardly King except without the &#39;Regret&#39; passive - and the butler will not feel guilty about killing them 

Now onto my general King suggestion. The King is a bit of a protect Class in game, a bit too much in my opinion. I feel it needs the following passive added to all Kings.

**Tyrant**: If force verdict is used, the King may be voted for treason as normal, regardless of game day (IE: Before Day 4)

Any feedback on this will be appreciated :)</description>

<p>agreed, but this is the reason there are knights and the prince. FoL is based on ToL, and fool is in ToL; fool probably won’t be removed there.</p>

            <p>It’s not against the rules to say role though but we are more than obliged to correct the usage.</p>
<p>It’s the arguing we don’t want. So if someone corrects your word usage from role to class, there’s really no need to go all “I don’t care blah blah role blah class” <em>lookingatyounorm</em></p>

</aside>
<p>There is a difference between role and class.</p>
<p>Role implies they have one job.</p>
<p>Class implies it has multiple skills/tools.</p>
<p>But Xblade has also stated numerous times he would much prefer the use of Class over role to differentiate his game from those that use role.</p>
