    <title>Small sorcerer change suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/small-sorcerer-change-suggestion/29715</link>
    <description>I think sorc should passive should be changed so besides knights and night immune targets she will not attack members of the unseen/cult. She will still not know who the unseen/cult is but at least she won&#39;t be able to randomly kill them, and she will still lose a night if she accidentally targets one of them. If this would make her too powerful she could be nerfed somewhere else, like making her dust single target again or removing her immunity to poison/bleeding.</description>

            <p>Fun fact. MM + Assassin + Convert + Merc + Merc + Sorc + Evil king = 7 effective Unseen out of 16. If an Unseen and Sorc both killed someone then they have majority right off the bat.</p>

            <p>I just hate that Inq keeps his abilities more than anything.</p>
<p>It’s crazy terrible in a cult game where you can’t ever kill him with your limited killing ability and he just goes down the line killing and outting everyone.</p>
<p>And honestly… even if he didn’t exist, I don’t think Sorc would win that much.  The Win Condition isn’t exactly easy.  I’ve seen it happen like once ever and it was pure dumb luck and stupidity from the BD that it happened.</p>
<p>Sorc needs a way to get a message to Evil, not that it matters since half the time they bus the Sorc anyway.</p>

<p>I’ve seen alot of MM who out the sorc after failing to kill/convert them. The sorc/ evil should find and wishper each other and work togethor. then the sorc win rate will increase.</p>

<p>That doesn’t change my point.  Hardcounters shouldn’t even exist.  They are easy to win(especially if they hardcounter an evil class), and are overpowered against the class that they hardcounter And Town of salem is a very different game from throne of lies.</p>

            <p>You don’t know if they are immune or not however. Just that you didn’t attack them.</p>
<p>You either</p>
<p>A: Kill them (unless they were healed)<br>
B: get the message that you felt danger and didn’t attack as a result<br>
C: Hit the inquisitors night immunity.</p>
<p>Anything else looks exactly like those 3 options.</p>

            <p>While I don’t think Sorcerer particularly needs buffing either, there is a large difference between not killing the unseen/cult and knowing who they are. With the former, you waste a night, and don’t know that the reason you didn’t attack is because the were unseen/cult or if they got guarded or were night immune (a quality Mastermind already has anyway).</p>

            <p>Sorcerer already has some big advantages. You almost might as well make it an unseen/cult class with those changes</p>

            <p>I think sorc should passive should be changed so besides knights and night immune targets she will not attack members of the unseen/cult. She will still not know who the unseen/cult is but at least she won’t be able to randomly kill them, and she will still lose a night if she accidentally targets one of them. If this would make her too powerful she could be nerfed somewhere else, like making her dust single target again or removing her immunity to poison/bleeding.</p>
