    <title>Am i in the wrong here?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/am-i-in-the-wrong-here/8094</link>
    <description>I come from epic mafia and i was a pretty good mafia player. But last ToL game i played, every single player in the game disagreed with me, i guess its ok to question yourself. Everyone said i misplayed.

Here is what happened.

I was princess and got the report &quot;10 is killer or offensive&quot; night 1.

I wispered this to king day 2.

King decided to check 10. He wrote in his will &quot;N2, checking 10 to confirm if bad&quot;

King was visibly new and thought i said 10 is bad, but thats obviously not what i said.

But then, King died during n2. When people saw that will, everyone instantly voted 10, because obviously that did seem sus from their point of view.

But during the trial, the guy claimed drunk. So i insisted really hard to pardon him, because quite obviously, there is literally 0 reasons to think hes lying so far (Drunk is offensive).

He actually turned up being the assassin. Everyone said i was insanely suspicious because i defended the assassin.

I decided to Wisp during the night to prove my innocence, but i was role blocked.

Next day, i tried to explain the story, but 14/16 lynched me.

After the game, i tryed to explain to them why lynching someone that claims drunk ONLY based on a killer or offensive report was dumb, and nobody agreed with me (except the king).</description>

            <p>Drunk is incredibly bad fake claim, as drunk is easily provable. Did assassin have a good will?</p>

<p>Oh, in his logs – gotcha. EIther way. Ever play that whisper game in elementary school? Where you whisper through about 10 people then say at the end what was said? I think it’s called waterfall. One bit of misinformation can lead to catastrophically changing events.</p>

            <p>Looks like stacks of miscommunication. You did fine lol, just bad luck. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The King started the domino effect. The King shouldn’t have even revealed you, just shared the info (even though he shared the 1/2 wrong info)</p>
