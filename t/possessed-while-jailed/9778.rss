    <title>Possessed while jailed</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessed-while-jailed/9778</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was possessed while jailed as mercenary and died to a bear visiting the hunter

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Well - I assume that I was meant not to be able to visit while I was jailed

#### Steps to reproduce:
Jail mercenary and possess him to visit a hunter using bear ability

#### Comments:
Now - I&#39;m can&#39;t say for sure this is a bug - but it if it&#39;s not, then it should be, since you aren&#39;t supposed to be able to visit while jailed.

            <p>The logs get reset every time you run the game. Given your previous answer, I’ll assume you don’t have the logs. However the bug here is pretty clear. Thanks for the report! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
