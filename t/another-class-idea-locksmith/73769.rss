    <title>Another class idea... locksmith</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/another-class-idea-locksmith/73769</link>
    <description>The locksmith
Neutral offensive, unique

Passive 1:Focused, cannot be occupied or redirected at night

Passive 2:saddened, become a drunk without RB if prince died,this won’t happen if you’ve won

Day ability 1:Super lock,uses 4 keys to automatically let someone escape, (1 use)

Night ability 1:Crafter, optain 2 keys, a key can be used in jail to leave,it appears where abilities are and allows you to leave instantly, gaining you abilities and making prince unable to exe you

Night ability 2:Scatter, give keys out randomly in this order, evil,BD,NK,Neutral, you cannot give yourself a key with this. Gives key to anybody:who is not killed the night,who is not reaped.

Victory condition:live to see two people escape.

I made this because my other idea had a comment saying prince was to strong. I think this would be good if trapper was added. Or maybe just good on it’s own</description>

            <p>I agree that prince needs a nerf, but it shouldn’t be a hardcounter.  Hardcounters are a broken concept.  The only nerf prince needs is making happy hour work on him</p>
