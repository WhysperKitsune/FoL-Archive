    <title>Small_Tank has exploded. They were</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/small-tank-has-exploded-they-were/87324</link>
    <description>I gave up.
Truth to be said, I wanted to just go away.
But considering the number of problems, it would create to people... I think I need to explain this and inform you.

eevee account is blocked (authorization keys deleted).
eevee_bot had all API keys removed.
And this account will go to Derps, as they wanted it.
@SirDerpsAlot password from discord.

Altho I guess tank is also an issue for moderation to handle, as it&#39;s no longer needed to test eevee bot.

@DatBird @Geyde - I edited queue to remove myself and put you in charge of certain games as per previous discussions.

**Chapter 1 - small tank engine failure**

Why?
Well forum... you killed me once.
Look, this tank is not afraid of death. It should stopped working 4 times by now. And by that I mean I was in situation where medically I had 15% or below chance to survive unscratched.

Some of you know I had a stroke last year.
Altho I never gave exact date to not associate it with certain person or event.

Truth to be told night before I was working on raport comparing data from NATO long range bioparticles radars from eastern US and eastern EU, requested by counter bio-terrorism unit leader.
Which is obviously stupid, cause if Covid was bioterrorism, it would start from China and not someone spraying virus in EU and US.

So having some time before delivering the report, I decided to relax on forum for a moment... and was involved in a big drama.
Stressed, tired, with high blood pressure due to drama... you can see where it&#39;s going.
So I fainted in front of a military hospital.

I mean... it&#39;s covid fault.
Working overtime to make sure everything is working was definitely not healthy.
But if I found relax I was searching for on this forum, maybe I wouldn&#39;t fall.

---

**Chapter 2 - patching up the tank**

Tank is not an easy thing to fix, right?
So... I staied in the hospital for few weeks.
Hey, I even got a postcard from orange, who wished me to get back to health.

But I also thought about what happened and... I realized that forum is just not as fun as it was.

Don&#39;t misunderstand me, I play mafia for 12 years, both in professional club and over the internet.
I organized events, plaied in international tournaments and tried teaching people. Both irl and over the internet. I did NOT get bored.

But back in the days biggest drama was privatization between Chubby and PKR or Jammy&#39;s rebellious attitude. (Which actually cause big drama).
But like... issues were rate in between and handled.

Now everyone game has few of ad-hominem attacks.
And while most of them are pretty weak... they still hurt people and make worse atmosphere.

It might be me noticing it, as I went through high-end cultural education... which despite being obsolete and mostly non-used and me using an &quot;everyday culture&quot; level... it just put my borders a bit higher when it comes to what is acceptable.

So I did what every other tankist would do.
~~Chosing different route and not enter forum which nearly killed me~~
Tried to defuse the mines.

Started small, tried to help people, teach them how to scumread and convince others without need for direct attacks. How to acusse someone&#39;s arguments and actions, not person. And... showing them what&#39;s going on on the forum.

But things got worse.
Someone was adding the powder to mines to give more and more strong explosions.
Murder threats, telling others to kill themself, dramas based on cultural / ethcnical / religious / political differences... you know. Big stuff.

I also hopped actual sapper squad, armed with banhammers will come and defuse the mines.
That happened... rarely.
And you know, there is a polish saying &quot;Don&#39;t touch shit or it will start smelling&quot;.

Somewhere along the way I learnt that reviewers deny certain games, just so theirs favorite can happen faster. That GMs and mods straightforward say they don&#39;t care about rule breaks at games/forum they look after.
That tank is now stuck in middle of minefield and no help or rescue is gonna come.

Many times talk with people, mods, reviewers etc. happened, trying to figure out what to do to help the situation of more and more people just... quitting the site due to toxicity.
Like for example event together with MC where people form MC decided to never play on this site again.
See the problem?

---
**Chapter 3 - Don&#39;t fix tanks if you don&#39;t know how**

Well, due to lack of help... I went further and started to make drama out of drama.
More than once placing mods in position where they HAVE TO react.

To be fair, I don&#39;t hold much respect to current moderation, considering corruption around the queue and reviews and decisions.
But it&#39;s about them doing nothing, or doing stuff directly hurtful to community and our reputation, not them personally.

But hearby I would like to apologize for all the dramas caused by me recently.
Altho more than once I was told that no action would be performed otherwise.
More than once no action was performed regardless and it led to weird consequences. Which people apologized that they didn&#39;t react when I asked for it, but... if you cared earlier, it would just not end up catastrophic.

I think our main issue right now is not caring.
Not caring about reviews, games, other people, site etc.

It got to a point where people prefer to gamethrow hammer themselves to get themselfs out of game, even if there are very strong possibilities they wouldn&#39;t die otherwise.
Yeah, I&#39;m talking about NUF.
I won&#39;t be here after this pots, so it doesn&#39;t even matter.

---

**Chapter 4 - Tank explodes**

So I gave up.
That&#39;s it.

I gave up with trying to fix this site.
And tbh I gave up somewhere around chapter 3 of this post, with explaining all the things happening along the way, like SFoL 65 and many, many other situations.

I tried.
I failed.

And I leave as this forum is not safe for my health anymore.

Like... I&#39;m tired and I got bigger headache than I had on stroke day due to today&#39;s drama.
But I will be fine, I&#39;m on double dose of emergency pills.

But tank... tank has finally exploded.
And it&#39;s last wish is not to completely stop all the arguments, it&#39;s natural to be angry.
But at least try to target persons decisions and not themself / theirs religion / culture / LGBT stuff.

Bye forum, I loved you. And I put a lot of effort to make sure you keep running.
But we usually love stuff we can&#39;t have, right?
Sigh.

<p>Yeah, I agree that at least something like this would be good. Perhaps even a monthly report that just states the total number of reports/flags. Then maybe saying total number of warnings given out. That might be a good compromise instead of a detailed public log of warnings.</p>

</aside>
<p>My wording may have been confusing. It’s not necessarily that making the results public is a bad thing. That’s a separate issue that I wasn’t really addressing. I was more saying that the discussions on how to handle a situation don’t always need to be a big public affair, but that perhaps some members could take part in the internal discussions.</p>

            <p>It’s made public only due to automation. If I couldn’t automate it or had the time to do it, moderation on Discord would still be private. Even then, that’s me setting up the system.</p>
<p>Remember that if it doesn’t say Staff beside their name, they are volunteers. Public moderation by hand is extremely time-consuming (as is making it automated).</p>
<p>Warnings will almost never show in public moderation - not only because it’s time consuming, but because it’s just that: a warning. Even then, no one should be discussing specific moderation actions unless it’s in private (and yours) or generalized for public (without any hints of directing inquiries towards a certain case).</p>
<p>If volunteers run out of time to do public moderation, we may not even have public moderation logs. We’re pretty lucky to even have what most other forums lack.</p>
<p>In regards to the line, the rules are as clear as it gets and it is written. The only time for line judgement is for someone generally dancing the line of the rules that knows better, and is seeing how far they can push.</p>
<p>Edit: Public moderation == logs*</p>

            <p>If something gets flagged a chat automatically opens between moderators and whoever flagged it, so moderators can easily let flaggers know it’s worth something (and might already, I did in my time, but again it was very underused <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:">)</p>

</aside>
<p>From memory, I’m fairly sure the forum automatically holds some statistics on certain disciplinary measures. A slap on the wrist for something very minor that mods do without an official warning, probably not.</p>

            <p>Maybe fireworks show is an extreme way of saying it, but my point is, on these forums a lot of disciplinary action (and seemingly other stuff) is done super privately while other things are made public. Meanwhile, on the ToL Discord, all disciplinary action is made public.</p>
