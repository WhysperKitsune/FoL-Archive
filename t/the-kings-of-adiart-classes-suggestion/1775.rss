<p>We had the same idea but different names for it.<br>
I had Fool King. I had a different idea for Mad King however.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s a pretty good suggestion.</p>

            <p>Why would the good King kill the butler ? Can you explain ?</p>
<p>Also, what I would like to see in the game is Mad king so butler wouldn’t just randomly want to kill king.</p>
<p>I also agree that there should be more kings implemented because it’s what makes Tol unique.</p>
<p>However I can’t see any of this being implemented soon.</p>
