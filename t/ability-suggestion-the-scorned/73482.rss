&lt;big&gt;**The Scorned**&lt;big&gt;

*Neutral Social*

**Tricking Mask (Passive)** - Immune to death at night once. Appear as [color=DodgerBlue]Blue Dragon[/color] in the first 3 nights.

**Hidden (Passive)** - Immune to most occupation and redirection. Player attemped to occupy or redirect you will believe they were succeed. You will know who you was attemped redirect to.

**Trollbox (Day)** - Make a player seem to said somethings. Infinity Use.

**Distracted (Day)** - Slient a player and prevent their day ability for 20 seconds. 3 Use.

**Frame (Night)** - Make a player seem susp for the night. Infinity Use. 1 Night Cooldown.

**Disguised (Night)** - If your target would be executed on trial tomorrow, they will appear as chosen class. 3 Use.

*Win condition:*
-Live long enough to see 3 [color=DodgerBlue]Blue Dragon[/color] got executed.
[/quote]

In my opinion, Scorned rn have a very bad winrate since they have to see up to 3 BD got executed if they want to win. So this new scorned suggestion is easier to achieve the win but also need more deduction to make BD mis-exe.
