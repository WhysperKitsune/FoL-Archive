    <title>[Class Suggestion] Torturer (Neutral Killing)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-torturer-neutral-killing/44239</link>
    <description>[b]Torturer[/b] - The Prince&#39;s faithful assistant... who isn&#39;t so faithful...

Passive 1:
**Black Hood** - You are immune to murder, bleeding, and poison.

Passive 2:
**Skeleton Key** - If the Prince decides to execute you, you will kill him instead.

Day Ability:
**The Rack** - Find out the exact class of your &quot;Executioner&#39;s Axe&quot; target tonight, if they survive the attack for any reason. (2 uses.)

_^ Dual usage to find information, and ensure Prince doesn&#39;t die TOO early on you. ;) Prince will be told he was healed from the attack._

Night Ability 1:
**Executioner&#39;s Axe** - Kill a player, even if they are jailed. (Unlimited use.)

_^ All other normal blockages can still apply._

Night Ability 2:
**Iron Maiden** - Cause whoever the Prince has jailed to begin bleeding. (4 uses.)

Comments: Just a random idea. An &quot;anti-Prince&quot; Neutral Killer who can still be powerful enough if Prince is killed. Since Prince is guaranteed in all rounds, I figured this could work.</description>

            <p>Black Hood is just immunity, so that’s essential. Skeleton Key is interesting, but I’m not sure what to think of it. The Rack is an interesting way to investigate. Iron Maiden is a slow death, why not just kill instead?</p>
<p>My main problem with this is that it loses half of its powers if the Prince dies. You also easily murder it, which doesn’t help. I personally would rather not have a class that relies this much on another.</p>
