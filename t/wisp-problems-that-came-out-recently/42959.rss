    <description>**What happened?**
Both mm and cw visited the princesss, the barrier protected the princess, 
She wisped me and it only said the cw visited her.


In another game, me(physician) a knight and an assasin visited the princess, and the wisp only showed me and the assasin, so she was sure that i was the knight the whole game.


**Whats was supposed to happen**
Princess wisp should show almost everyone but inquisitor</description>

            <p>I’ve had several issues with MM and CL convert visits not shown on either Will-o-wisp or Observer follow. Is that actually a feature to avoid CL or MM being busted?</p>
<p>In the past I remember those been seen on either wisp or follow.</p>
