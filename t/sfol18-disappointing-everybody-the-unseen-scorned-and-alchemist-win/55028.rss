    <description># Welcome to SFoL18: Disappointing Everybody
&lt;small&gt;You were probably expecting Regicide.&lt;/small&gt;

### Rules
1. Follow the [Global Forum Rules](http://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-rules-please-read-first/244)
2. Be respectful to the moderators and your fellow players.
3. Don&#39;t be inactive. If you do not post within a 24-hour period, you will be prodded. Failure to respond to a prod within 12 hours or receiving two prods will result in your removal from the game.
4. Do not quote/screenshot private host messages.
5. Don&#39;t throw the game. Always play with the intent of helping your faction win.
6. No editing or deleting posts without express moderator permission.
7. No posting after majority is reached or at night. We may not always lock the thread; when this occurs, the honor system will be used. Repeated or egregious failure to comply will result in your removal from the game.
8. Direct all game and game mechanic-related questions to the hosts **in your class card PM**. Questions asked publicly in thread are unlikely to receive an answer.
9. It&#39;s a game - have fun!

### Joining
- Simply express interest in joining
- Common methods of joining a game include replying with&quot;**/in**&quot; or &quot;**/join**&quot;.

### Gameplay
- Days will be 72 hours long, or shorter if majority is reached.
- Nights will be approximately 24 hours long. Extensions will not be granted for forgetting to send in an action.
- Actions are performed by sending myself and my cohost a message on the PM I will send you with your class.
- The members of the Unseen will be given a Discord chat with which to communicate at night.
- The Psychic/Illusionist&#39;s targets will communicate via private messages that my cohost or myself will create.
- In general, feedback will be much less prevalent than in normal FoL. For example, you will not be informed if your target is occupy immune if you attempt to occupy them. If you have any questions on this matter, please follow rule 8 and ask us directly in your class card PM.
- All classes used will be found in the first reply.
- The Cult have been disabled for this test because I can&#39;t be asked to come up with new Cult Alts for all of my changed classes.
- Rules [u]and classes[/u] are subject to change until the game begins. In fact, please do provide feedback on some of the class changes!
- When you recieve a class card, you will have 24 hours to confirm that you have recieved it. Failure to do so may lead to your replacement by more active players.

### Executions
- To accuse someone, say &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;.
- To rescind your vote, say &quot;**/unvote [player]**&quot;.
- To vote for no lynch, say &quot;&quot;**/vote NoLynch**&quot;.
- Making your vote obvious (bolded, on their own line, etc.) will make it less likely to be missed by us.
- Vote counts will be given whenever the moderators are available to do so. You may request one by pinging both my cohost and myself.
- A majority vote is defined as half of the remaining number of players (rounded down), plus one.
- When majority has been reached, the day ends immediately. Please cease all posting until a moderator returns to officially end the day.

### After The Night
- You will be told what happened to you in your PM, and day will begin.

### Journals and Death Notes
- Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed.
- Death Notes will be allowed, but are subject to the discretion of both hosts, and will preferably be images.

            <p>I think the Alch claim was a risky move, but one that may have paid off given the high priority of taking out Physicians</p>
<p>Especially since you may have been able to bait out a scum Physician claim</p>
<p>Not a move I’d consider genius, but not one that was bad either, I guess</p>
