    <title>Throne goes FREE to play Dec 18th!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/throne-goes-free-to-play-dec-18th/85006</link>
    <description>üì£ I am excited to announce that *Throne* will be going **FREE** to play with our target relaunch date of __December 18, 2020__ @ 6pm EST! :tada::tada: 

As always, we continue our commitment to no loot boxes, no pay-to-win.

This means many exciting things, such as lower queue times, new faces, and better offpeak timezone support, (We &lt;3 you, too, EU/Aussie players)!

As we grow, we want to thank all our veteran players that helped us reach this point: We‚Äôll be tossing our premium players the exclusive &lt;Veteran&gt; title (that will be the 1st title to stand out by more than just words) as well as the exclusive Veteran avatar. We urge our current veterans to take advantage of the premium goldflow/prices before we switch over~

--
:moneybag: **Claim 1,000gp** shortly after the relaunch by simply pre-registering with your email here:

&lt;https://toli.es/goldpromo&gt;

**Current Users:** After pre-registering, be sure to update your email in your in-game ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù section if you skipped out on email during registration via the newsletter sub section.

**Users awaiting F2P:** In-game, be sure to use the same email used in the pre-registration link above. Then *wishlist* us @ https://store.steampowered.com/app/595280

            <p>It‚Äôll definitely help. From experience of what happened over at ToS, axing free to play was a necessarily evil in the face of invading bot swarms but starved them of new players and caused a number of headaches for the expansion.</p>
<p>The downside is the influx of newcomers will be positively <em>awful</em> at the game initially, which may rub the vets up the wrong way, so it‚Äôll be an interesting test of the community. But speaking in advance as one of those newcomers, I‚Äôm looking forward to it. <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Our prices are stupidly cheap while premium (so much that‚Ä¶ even if we <em>remained</em> premium, I‚Äôd still raise the prices). We‚Äôd also charge a small ‚Äòcourt fee‚Äô per match, charged once confirmed in-game on d1. Which isn‚Äôt a <em>big</em> deal because you still get gold whether you win or lose, but at least it‚Äôs some sort of ‚Äúconsumable‚Äù and discourages leavers while alive.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre hoping for folks to buy gold for aesthetics. We‚Äôre adding 2 more tiers. We‚Äôll later add more to the customization shop (and certainly higher quality than we had before).</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm torn on this. I like that it‚Äôs more players, but it will also result in a lot more gamethrowers and toxicity. Just look at town of salem. Lots of players, but there is almost always at least one gamethrower/toxic player. I think it will be fine for a year or so, but after we get more popular you should revert back to pay2play</p>
