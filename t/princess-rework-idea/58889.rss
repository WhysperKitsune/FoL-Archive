    <description>&gt; ## [color=steblue]The Princess[/color]  :mag_right: 
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Investigative [/color]**
**Royal Blood (Passive)** - As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.
**Will O&#39; Wisp (Day)** - Tells you if the target attacks anyone tonight. Only detects attacks that count as visiting. - 2 uses
**Flirt (Night)** - Check to see what Class Type the selected player is.You will receive two results, one of which will be their real type, and one won&#39;t be.  - Infinite uses
**Woman Intuition (Night)** - Check what player is capable of. - 2 uses
*Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

&gt; ## [color=purple]The Duchess[/color]  :mag_right: 
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Investigative[/color]**
**Royal Blood (Passive)** - As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.
**Bat Eyelashes (Night)** - Determine the target&#39;s class type and faction. - Infinite uses
**Dark Wisp (Night)** - Uncage a dark wisp, making Unseen appear as not suspicious to investigative roles. - 2 uses
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

Since The Princess is overall the weakest investigative class in the game and there already came some ideas for reworks i thought i made a thread about it as well.

The most noticeable change is moving Will  O&#39; Wisp into day abillities and adding new night abillity that is i  believe fit to Princess. It can determite which types of abillities (Except passives) player have. Their names  have from class types.
Possible feedback:
- [Name and Number] have [Class Type] abillity and [Class Type] abillity.



All Class Types Abillities:

- Killer: (Execute, Cold Steel, Wolf Companion, Nightshade Wine, Emerald Potion, Ruthless Efficiency, Reap, Puppet Strings, Possess, Magic Missile, Circle Of Death, Assassinate, Nightshade Poison, Eradicate, Rupture)
- Offensive: (Serve vine, Concentrated Wine, Debauchery, Happy Hour, Spike Traps, Snare Trap, Drug, Defile, Mind Warp, Mental Blur, Bewilder, Chains of Corax, Strings of Mithras)
- Support: (Defend, Inoculate, Heal, Self Care, Magic Barrier,  Tornado, Stoneskin Potion, Crimson Potion, Hide, Gather Darkness, Wall Of Fire, Dirty Work, Frenzy, Teleportation)
- Social: (Political Pressure, Noble Twin, Maid Spy, Snoop, Telepathy, Private Matter, Link Minds, 
Conduit, Frame, Magic Dust, Magic Cloak, Dark Wisp, Facelift, Icy Touch, Trollbox, Distract, 
Brotherhood, Cult Pressure, Cult Spy)
- Investigative: (Scout, Expert Investigation, Flirt, Will O&#39; Wisp, Follow, Window Peek, Find Magic, Foresight, Watch Carefully, Bat Eyelashes, Expose, Probe, Gaze, Identify)
Notes:
- &quot;Convert&quot; would be an Offensive abillity because otherwise it would bust MM/CL pretty easily.
- You probably want to ask &quot;Why feedback is depends on RNG?&quot; The problem is that there is thin border between being reasonable and OP. Revealing 2 abillities would tell way much too much about possible class.

The Duchess:
- Since Duchess is the pretty weak investigative compare to Marshal or Nightwatch, buffing her main abillity that would also see target&#39;s faction would be more helpful to teammates.
- Originally this idea was came from another thread that was created by @NuclearBurrito 
Link:
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/duchess-and-nightwatch-buffs-reworks/57703?u=twil1ight

Possible Feedback:
- [Name and Number] is [Faction] [Class Type].

Any feedback/suggestions are apprieciated as always.

Have a nice day!</description>

            <p>Princess is a high skill cap class. You need imagination and a lot of experience in reaction testing to get the most out of Flirt. A smart Princess is a Duchess for BD.</p>

            <p>You misunderstand me. The ability is random because feedback you get is random. If someone has multiple abilities, I only get feedback from one of them at random. Like say a reaper claims knight. You could use woman intuition and get back that they’re a knight with a social ability. Or get back their a knight with a killing ability.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why it needs changes.  There should be risk to using it.  Also, knowing if a player killed someone is not deduction.  I know about possessor and mind warp, but illusionist is rare and possessor doesn’t appear often enough to make people doubt it.</p>

            <p>How is it useless again? Confiming claims in late game or gathering some info from potential scum i wouldn’t call that “useless”. Also who said you need to use it every night until  you will run out? Seriously if you’re just randomly use it night 1 how it suppose to give anything useful when the game just started?</p>

            <p>It still contains rng, which makes the ability unreliable. While it’s okay for abilities to be tampered with, if an ability can basically randomly give you useless feedback, it makes it unfun to use.</p>

            <p>Yeah, we do need some more possible fakeclaims.</p>
<p><em>But we also need Mastermind and Reaper to have royal blood immediately</em></p>

            <p>I think that’s best achievable through making more classes easy to claim.</p>
<p>When all you’ve really got is Princess, Knight, and Sheriff, with the occasional Hunter or Physician claims, those three claims are looked down on</p>
<p>If there were, say, seven easy fakeclaims? Now none of them can be instant-exe claims, or else you’d just be executing everybody that claims and catching few scum in the process <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I’d say the ideal goal, rather, is to get Princess to a level where it’s not a solid strategy to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Princess claim in 2018, exe guys</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but also not confirmable whatsoever. Kinda like sheriff.<br>
She must be more valuable but also</p>
<p>Mastermind royal blood <strong>WHEN</strong></p>

            <p>I think that WoW should have 3 uses. The ability itself is good though.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Princess as-is is pretty perfect imo</p>
<p>The only thing that could be changed is WoW but I don’t think it really needs it because its main ability is already great</p>
