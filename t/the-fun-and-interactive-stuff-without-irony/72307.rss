    <title>THE FUN AND INTERACTIVE STUFF without irony</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-fun-and-interactive-stuff-without-irony/72307</link>
    <description>Ok, usually feedback around here is more &quot;I dislike this&quot; sided than &quot;This is nice&quot; sided. As I think both ways are equally important, I decided to make this thread to show what I find FUN and INTERACTIVE ~~and WITHOUT THE IRONY PART OF THE PHRASE!~~ and what puts a smile on my face when I happen to play it in the game. I will try to make it short as well, as no one never read my long-ass threads. 

I LOVE HUNTER
Hunter is most of the time free to act as he wants. Basically the only BD class allowed to lie for almost the entire game, as well. His easy confirmability let you pretend to be any thing early in the game, but be free to actually claim your class later when needed. His arrow passive is absolutely gorgeous and has both direct and indirect impact in the game, which I find nice. Bear attacking killer is the most satisfying thing ever. I love to be agressive as heck while playing Hunter, surviving until the end and being the fear for both attacks, conversion and trials. It requires skill; deception and abilities-timing-management, his results are satisfying as hell. Do I need something else? Absolutely not. This class is legit my favourite. 

I LOVE OBSERVER
The most flexible, thought-inducing and dangerous Investigative class in the game. With a little of luck you can find NKs, evils, converts, fake-claims and can have one of the most complete logbooks regarding useful information. Although Peek is a very direct and pretty powerful abiloity to my like, Follow is a 10/10 ability in both power and fun level. Usually I dislike OP stuff, but when they are fun like this? Me gusta. 

I LOVE NEW ALCH
I still dislike how some people play them (like claiming d1 and giving away truth results, but yeah, people can do as they want), but to me Alch games are always so fun. I can side with evils, bomb like crazy, heal myself to hell and prevent the shit out of the non-siding guys. He is much more fun now, not just a &quot;hey let me live until the end and I heal you&quot; class. THE TRUE NEUTRAL POWER.

I LOVE NEW FOOL
He had no change in his abilities, but his passive now is so much more fair. It has direct and indirect effects as well, what is always good. It is punishing for those who were conscious about their actions but did it anyway, while letting other people free to act. Well I could do an entire thread about how Fool interacts nice with the game right now, but I will countain myself and say he is my favourite change from last patch.

I LOVE THE NEUTRAL KILLERS
NKs are usually classes with pretty unique mechanics and the way they change the game&#39;s flow are also pretty different from one to another. Every NK feels fair to me at this point, equally fun as well. It all comes down to a good strategy. 

————————————————————

I could do that all day but I am tired of writing already, these recent days are kinda dull to me. 

Well, after some time thinking about what I like in the game, my conclusion was deducing and lying. This is why I hated so much whisper meta (I hate it less now, probably gonna make a thread about it) and why I hate other non-interactive and very direct classes. I like to cause chaos, I like to NEED to lie in order to win. There is no fun in just clicking randomly all game and reporting what you do. Let me lie!</description>

            <p>Playing against Hunter is what makes this game skill based. Thing is people do not expect BD to lie, so when they do evils are suddenly lost. With time, they learn Hunter is there to get them. He is all about coordination with the group and a bit of luck, but hey, he is also playing the “luck and coordination” game, so wins the better.</p>
<p>I do not see a problem to play against Alch. Unless he just joins BD right away and out evils, then this is indeed lame.</p>

            <p>That’s nice, but you are, for some of these classes (Alchemist and Hunter), only describing one side of the coin - how it feels to use a class…<br>
What do you say about playing against these classes?</p>

It proposes much more strategies than just one day without trial, it makes killers (even if they did not voted up Fool) think about if they should attack that following night or not, as it could potentially out them. It has so many interactions that I cannot even start listing or it will be way too long.

<p>Alright, but it should last longer than one night.</p>
