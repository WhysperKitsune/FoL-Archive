    <title>Inquisitor Night Immunity</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inquisitor-night-immunity/47835</link>
    <description>I was Inquisitor. I was outed by evil kings will on n2 - So I asked for someone to guard me as I knew I was going to be attacked by the Sorcerer.

That night I was attacked and lost my night immunity. King told me he had guarded me that night.

The next night I attacked and killed the sorc (VERY lucky play). He also attacked me - It said I was attacked but I didnt die. King had guarded me again.

If the kings guard prevents me from dying on n2, shouldnt it have saved my night immunity on the first night he guarded me?

Not sure on this one.</description>

            <p>Yeah I know - He assured me (Even after the game) he had guarded me 2x. So all I have is his word. Anywhoo - its not a big deal, just was curious.</p>

            <p>The thing is, you also don’t know if the king has guarded you as the guards are silent. You only know when you’re attacked</p>

            <p>Maybe he only guarded you the second time?</p>
