    <title>Wrong Deathnote appeared on DK kill</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/wrong-deathnote-appeared-on-dk-kill/50521</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Myself being a Deathknight, I killed the Assassin while guarding an Observer. I had knowledge who the MM, the Assassin and the N2 Convert were, so I wrote a Deathnote and put their numbers on it. Said Deathnote did not appear on my kill, however. Instead, a random Deathnote (maybe the Physicians?) appeared that I had not seen until then.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The Deathnote I drew/drafted should have appeared, saying who the MM, the Assassin and the N2 Convert were.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Not sure what exactly played into this. So I am giving the full list of actions:
1. Start as a Drunk. 
2. Debauch the Assassin on N1 but also get reaped at the same time. 
3. Talk to the Psychic while the MM also gets linked. Tell them who the Assassin is. 
4. Psychic gets converted that very same night, my own body appears on Day 3.
5. Draw a Deathnote that reveals the entire Unseen Team. 
6. Get reanimated Night 3 by a Physician. (That Physician might or might not have drawn a Deathnote) The Assassin dies in Jail. 
7. Guard the Observer that was outed on Day 4 and kill the converted Psychic while doing so. 
8. A random Deathnote appears, which is not yours and does not belong to anyone that has killed before. There is no Alchemist in game and the NK is dead already.

#### Comments:
Game was played at around 00:00 CET.</description>
