    <title>Assassin as Non-Unique Class</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassin-as-non-unique-class/47491</link>
    <description>How about to changing &quot;Assassin&quot; into non-unique role?
As i see so far there wasnt a strong reason why he&#39;s a unique. 
I would like to recognize as buff one of the Mastermind&#39;s abillities callled &quot;Dirty Work&quot;
It was very situational abillity which is almost never usable in actual game.
With this change, the Mastermind may change into Assassin in mid(After night 3)/late game making there is 2 Unseen with KP with reasonable drawback(No futher convertions/night immunity).
What do you guys thing maybe there is something i don&#39;t know about it?</description>

<p>We can just make it that after using a nightshade and 2 for 1 by one of the assassins those will locked for 2nd assassin.</p>

<p>I know that, i actually was thinking about add some more spice to Mastermind making a possibility with allowing aggresive strategies with limied Unseen Squad.</p>

<p>In theory it looks like but im not about practice thought…<br>
1.The best solution i thing it would be making that poison and 2 for 1 applied for both Assassins(Basicaly if one of the Assassins used 1 poison there only 3 remain)<br>
2.“Potential” is good word here, with this is making more efficent Unseen’s type of Cult with limited members in mid/late game. We can’t say who is right in this without testing out.</p>

            <p>Imagine if on the same night both assassins use 2-for-1, Sorcerer kills someone, Inquisitor kills a magic user, king orders the execution of someone and an alchemist bombs. An unlikely situation but that would be half of the total players dead in one night. Add any knights cs’ing a bd and suiciding and game is pretty much over.</p>

<p>Dirty work is situational on purpose. It’s ment for situations where you should win but conversion isn’t an option</p>
<p>Ex: Going into night with a lone MM vs 2 CW’s who know each other.</p>
<p>Other situations are not ment to be handled with the ability. Plus having 2 assassins could have problems with 2for1 and nightshade.</p>
<p>Tldr the ability is just a tool for streach cases and is not ment to change the overall balence of the game.</p>
