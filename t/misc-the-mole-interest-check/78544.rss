    <description># The Mole - Interest Check
**10 Players**

# Roles

**9 [Color=Green]Candidates[/Color]**
&gt; Have to find out who the mole is, and answer the most questions correctly in the **Final**.
&gt; In the event of a tie, whoever was fastest will win.
&gt; In the event they also have the same time, the **Final** is done again, with different questions.

**1 [Color=Red]Mole[/Color]**
&gt; Has to sabotage the **Tasks**. Cannot be **Eliminated**. Gets told what all tasks and the solutions are at the start of the game.
&gt;
&gt;If in the Final neither **Candidate** answers more than 10 questions correctly, the mole wins.

# Phases

**Interview (Before the game starts)**
&gt; Before the game starts, I will ask each player 1 question, [spoiler](&quot;Do you want to be the **Mole**?&quot;)[/spoiler].
&gt;
&gt;There&#39;s no point in lying here yet, so please don&#39;t. After the interviews, each player will be assigned their **Role**.

**Task Phase**
&gt; Lasts 48 hours at most.
&gt; Each **Task Phase**, several games/puzzles will be held. 
&gt; Completing these tasks will grant the **Candidates** **[Color=Gold] (Symbolic) Gold [/Color]**, which will go into a shared money pool.
&gt; Once all of them are done, the **Elimination Phase** begins.

**Elimination Phase**
&gt; Each **Elimination Phase**, an **Elimination** will be held:
&gt;
&gt; Lasts 24 hours.
&gt; Each candidate will receive **8** questions about the mole. (From this cycle.)
&gt; Whoever gets the worst score is eliminated.
&gt; In the event of a tie, whoever was slowest will be eliminated.
&gt; In the event they also have the same time, they do the **Elimination** again, with different questions.
&gt;
&gt; Once it ends, another **Task Phase** begins.

**Final (Endgame)**
&gt; When there are only 3 **Players** left, the **Final** will begin.
&gt;
&gt; Both **Candidates** will receive **20** questions about the mole. (From the entire game.)
&gt; Whoever gets the best score wins the game.
&gt; In the event of a tie, whoever was slowest will be eliminated.
&gt; In the event they also have the same time, they do the **Elimination** again, with different questions.

# Terminology

**Gold**
&gt; Purely symbolic (obviously).
&gt; Can be used to compare who did the best in challenges.

**Immunity**
&gt; During some challenges, it will be possible to win **Immunity**, meaning you are guaranteed to
&gt; survive the next elimination.

**Wildcards**
&gt; During some challenges, it will be possible to win **Wildcards**, turning incorrect answers into
&gt; correct answers.

**Notebooks/&quot;Mole Books&quot;**
&gt; Basically your classcards. If you want to write anything you think could be worth remembering, do it
&gt; here.

# Rules:

1. Follow the Global Forum Rules
2. If you haven’t posted content in 24 hours you’ll be prodded for inactivity. If you do not respond to that prod in your classcard after 24 hours you will be forcefully replaced out.
3. You can privately message anyone that is not eliminated, as long as you add me.
4. Do not quote private host messages. This includes copy and pasting them into the chat.
5. If you want to write anything down, do it in your Notebook/Mole Book
6. Post as much as you want in a row. Honestly I’m not strict on this rule.
7. Do not use big letters during the game. This is unless it is stated otherwise.
8. You are allowed to leave the game at any time, but please don’t unless you absolutely have to. If a player is annoying or angering you just ignore it or come talk to me. I don’t bite, ya know.
9. Do not edit or delete made posts
10. Do not like posts in the thread and do not post in the thread if you are eliminated. I understand if accidents happen for posting in the thread.</description>
