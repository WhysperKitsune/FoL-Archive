    <title>Scorn Abilities after Win</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/scorn-abilities-after-win/19416</link>
    <description>Currently, when the Scorn meets their win condition, their abilities lock and you&#39;re just a talking head for the remainder of the game. I would like to see the Trollbox remain open for use after conditions are met, as it can be used as a strategic social tool. Being a neutral, you sometimes align yourself with one side or the other, and I&#39;ve had scenarios where one side contacted me and offered to execute one of my targets in exchange for me giving them a +1 vote on acc/exe. 

When the inquisitor has met his win condition, ALL of his skills currently stay active, and they typically will end up assisting the BD to a win in any cult game. Why not let the Scorn play out their game helping those who helped them?</description>

            <p>Agreed. Would give BD a reason to kill them. Would also make Scorned more fun.</p>

            <p>Leaving a character with no goal in the game ( ie they already won ) is something to be avoided. It produces kingmaking, a gameplay burden fellow board game players would be quite familiar with.</p>
<p>Both Inquisitor and Scorned need some incentive (perhaps additional gold per player that lives/dies at the end of the game) or their abilities removed, which already works in case of Scorned.</p>
<p>The main reason why its a difficult problem to solve is that this game promotes anonymity of players, so having players make deals with either faction (I often try this as scorned/inqui, it sometimes works as scorned actually) to stay true to that faction after they have helped you achieve your win condition is not a real thing. You don’t really have to honor it. But I try to every time, because it’s boring to just “You won, now wait for 15 minutes.”. If it were a real thing, then their gameplay after their goal finishes would be their potential bargaining chip instead of just mere kingmaking. You could argue it’s their goal to end the game as fast as possible since they won already, but I don’t really find that so compelling.</p>

            <p>hey! Kitliz said that not me <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But yeah IMO people who no longer have a win condition having a strong influence on the rest of the game, is more of a random factor that steps on the skill of everyone else in the game. To me it’s a huge negative for the game as a whole.</p>

<p>Honestly my opinion is the oposite, I think inquisitor should lose his abilities after the sorc dies. Part of the point of scorned, is to give some other possibility for an immune neutral to be that isn’t the neutral killer… Trollbox is a self confirming power.</p>
<p>While scorned can take a side after he’s won… it’s more or less to leave the ?? over his head for if he’s actually a scorned or some other scum.  Him being able to take a side is kind of an unintended side effect of that part of him. You leave trollbox in you kill the possible excuse of claiming a won scorned as any other evil, as it takes 2 seconds to test it.</p>
