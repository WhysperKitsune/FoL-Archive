    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Invoker</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-invoker/2919</link>
    <description>&gt; I have become one with Corax&#39;s weapons of choice. I am his puppet, and you will be mine.

The Invoker was a little girl once. Family, friends, a happy life... Almost.

The little girl kneels beside her bed, just as her parents taught her. She closed her eyes and clasped her hands, praying to whatever god was out there. 

She pushes her mind and probes everywhere and everything, searching for any sign of a divine presence. Then, something reaches out, and it grabs her brain.

&gt; Hello, Little Girl... You are searching for a benevolent being... Someone to help you.. Allow me, I&#39;ll give you everything you need. I only ask that you help **me** in return...
&gt; Do you accept my gift...?

**_The Invoker stands in the corner of the room, her eyes a deep red color, as she moves her hands in quick, fluid movements, as if she is moving a marionette. On the other side of the castle, the Reaper finds that he is unable to control himself, as he brings his scythe down on an ally._**

As her eyes fade to their normal blue, she grins, telling her leader that the deed is done, and she returns to the altar, ready to serve Corax forevermore.</description>

            <p>Thank you! I noticed most of the cult didn’t have any lore, so I’m writing out my ideas, and, thanks to your feedback, I’ll go back through and edit them to make them flow better.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it fits-ish. I feel like it starts with more of a background for a unseen backstory. Then flips to cult. I imagine the cult and having little poems or pieces or Documents. Then it kind-of jumps around. I would recommend smoothing the edges of your writing to make it flow more.</p>
