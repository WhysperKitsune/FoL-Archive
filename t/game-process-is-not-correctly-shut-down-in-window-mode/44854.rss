    <title>Game process is not correctly shut down in window mode</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/game-process-is-not-correctly-shut-down-in-window-mode/44854</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

The game process is not correctly closed then you start the game in fullscreen mode switch to window mode within the game and then close it with the close screen with the X button. Windows for example shows a program has stopped working as it appears to not be closed but instead seems forcefully closed for windows.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Game process should properly be exited, like it does when you start it in window mode.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Start game in full screen. Open options. Untoggle full screen. Apply changes. Click on the windows X (to close the window from the OS side).

#### Comments:

Minor bug as I doubt people encounter it naturally.

Version 1.0.18e1

Looks like some event listener is missing there or looks for the wrong call. Something is just still working although it should just end the process.</description>
