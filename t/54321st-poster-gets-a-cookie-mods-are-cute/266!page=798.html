Summary</summary>
<p>A lawyer died and arrived at the pearly gates. To his dismay, there were thousands of people ahead of him in line to see St. Peter. To his surprise, St. Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where the lawyer was, and greeted him warmly. Then St. Peter and one of his assistants took the lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the line, and into a comfortable chair by his desk. The lawyer said, “I don’t mind all this attention, but what makes me so special?”<br>
St. Peter replied, “Well, I’ve added up all the hours for which you billed your clients, and by my calculation you must be about 193 years old!”</p>
<p>A lawyer and a physician had a dispute over precedence. They referred it to Diogenes, who gave it in favor of the lawyer as follows: “Let the thief go first, and the executioner follow.”</p>
<p>The Pope and a lawyer find themselves together before the Pearly Gates. After a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective professions, ol’ St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly station. After passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides to show them to their new lodgings. Only a brief flight from the welcome, Pete brings them down on the front lawn (cloud-encrusted, natch) of a huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings. This, Pete announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least until the end of time.)<br>
“Hot Dang”, the Pope says to himself, “If he’s getting a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs!”. They take flight once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear more and more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with Brownstone houses. Pete indicates the third walk-up on the left as the Popes new domicile and turns to leave, wishing the pontiff his best. The Pope, in a mild state of astonishment, cries out “Hey Pete! What’s the deal here? You put that lawyer-feller in a beautiful estate home and I, spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with this dive?”<br>
Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replies,“Look here old fellow, this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many times and religions. We’re putting you here with them so you guys can get your dogma together. That other guy gets an estate, because he’s the first lawyer to make it up here!!”</p>
<p>Carlson was charged with stealing a Mercedes Benz, and after a long trial, the jury acquitted him. Later that day Carlson came back to the judge who had presided at the hearing. “Your honor,” he said, “I wanna get out a warrant for that dirty lawyer of mine.” “Why ?” asked the judge. “He won your acquittal. What do you want to have him arrested for ?” “Well, your honor,” replied Carlson, “I didn’t have the money to pay his fee, so he went and took the car I stole.”</p>
<p>“You seem to have more than the average share of intelligence for a man of your background,” sneered the lawyer at a witness on the stand.<br>
“If I wasn’t under oath, I’d return the compliment,” replied the witness.</p>
<p>A judge in a semi-small city was hearing a drunk-driving case and the defendant, who had both a record and a reputation for driving under the influence, demanded a jury trial. It was nearly 4 p.m. and getting a jury would take time, so the judge called a recess and went out in the hall looking to impanel anyone available for jury duty. He found a dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told them that they were a jury.<br>
The lawyers thought this would be a novel experience and so followed the judge back to the courtroom. The trial was over in about 10 minutes and it was very clear that the defendant was guilty. The jury went into the jury-room, the judge started getting ready to go home, and everyone waited.<br>
After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of patience and sent the bailiff into the jury-room to see what was holding up the verdict. When the bailiff returned, the judge said, “Well have they got a verdict yet?”<br>
The bailiff shook his head and said, “Verdict? Hell, they’re still doing nominating speeches for the foreman’s position!”</p>
<p>A woman and her little girl were visiting the grave of the little girl’s grandmother. On their way through the cemetery back to the car, the little girl asked, “Mommy, do they ever bury two people in the same grave?”<br>
“Of course not, dear.” replied the mother, “Why would you think that?”<br>
“The tombstone back there said ‘Here lies a lawyer and an honest man.’”</p>
<p>The defendant who pleads their own case may have a fool for a client, but at least there will be no problem with fee-splitting.</p>

<p>These two guys, George and Harry, set out in a hot air balloon to cross the Atlantic Ocean. After 37 hours in the air, George says “Harry, we better lose some altitude so we can see where we are.” Harry lets out some of the hot air in the balloon, and the balloon descends to below the cloud cover. George says, “I still can’t tell where we are, lets ask that guy on the ground.” So Harry yells down to the man “Hey, could you tell us where we are?”. And the man on the ground yells back “You’re in a balloon, 100 feet up in the air.” George turns to Harry and says “That man must be a lawyer.” And Harry says “How can you tell?”. George says “Because the advice he gave us is 100% accurate, and totally useless.”<br>
That’s the end of the joke, but for you people who are still worried about George and Harry:<br>
They end up in the drink, and make the front page of the New York Times: “Balloonists Soaked by Lawyer”</p>
<p>For three years, the young attorney had been taking his brief vacations at this country inn. The last time he’d finally managed an affair with the innkeeper’s daughter. Looking forward to a exciting few days, he dragged his suitcase up the stairs of the inn then stopped short. There sat his lover with an infant on her lap! “Helen, why didn’t you write when you learned you were pregnant?” he cried. “I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married, and the baby would have my name!”<br>
“Well,” she said, “when my folks found out about my condition, we sat up all night talkin’ and talkin’ and decided it would be better to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer.”</p>
<p>God decided to take the devil to court and settle their differences once and for all. When Satan heard this, he laughed and said, “And where do you think you’re going to find a lawyer?”</p>
<p>Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, an honest lawyer and an old drunk are walking down the street together when they simultaneously spot a hundred dollar bill. Who gets it? The old drunk, of course, the other three are mythological creatures.</p>
<p>A lawyer named Strange was shopping for a tombstone. After he had made his selection, the stonecutter asked him what inscription he would like on it. “Here lies an honest man and a lawyer,” responded the lawyer. “Sorry, but I can’t do that,” replied the stonecutter. “In this state, it’s against the law to bury two people in the same grave. However, I could put ‘Here lies an honest lawyer.’” “But that won’t let people know who it is,” protested the lawyer. “Certainly will,” retorted the stonecutter. "People will read it and exclaim, “That’s Strange!”</p>
<p>At a convention of biological scientists one researcher remarks to another, “Did you know that in our lab we have switched from mice to lawyers for our experiments?” “Really?” the other replied, “Why did you switch?” “Well, for three reasons. First we found that lawyers are far more plentiful, second, the lab assistants don’t get so attached to them, and thirdly there are some things even a rat won’t do. However, sometimes it very hard to extrapolate our test results to human beings.”</p>
<p>A certain lawyer was quite wealthy and had a summer house in the country, to which he retreated for several weeks of the year. Each summer, the lawyer would invite a different friend of his (no, that’s not the punch line) to spend a week or two up at this place, which happened to be in a backwoods section of Maine. On one particular occasion, he invited a Czechoslovakian friend to stay with him. The friend, eager to get a freebee off a lawyer, agreed. Well, they had a splendid time in the country - rising early and living in the great outdoors. Early one morning, the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian companion went out to pick berries for their morning breakfast. As they went around the berry patch, gathering blueberries and raspberries in tremendous quantities, along came two huge Bears - a male and a female. Well, the lawyer, seeing the two bears, immediately dashed for cover. His friend, though, wasn’t so lucky, and the male bear reached him and swallowed him whole. The lawyer ran back to his Mercedes, tore into town as fast has he could, and got the local backwoods sheriff. The sheriff grabbed his shotgun and dashed back to the berry patch with the lawyer. Sure enough, the two bears were still there. “He’s in THAT one!” cried the lawyer, pointing to the male, while visions of lawsuits from his friend’s family danced in his head. He just had to save his friend.<br>
The sheriff looked at the bears, and without batting an eye, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and SHOT THE FEMALE. “Whatdya do that for!” exclaimed the lawyer, “I said he was in the other!”<br>
“Exactly,” replied the sheriff, “and would YOU believe a lawyer who told you that the Czech was in the Male?”</p>
<p>It had to happen sooner or later. Lawyer Dobbins was wheeled into the emergency room on a stretcher, rolling his head in agony. Doctor Green came over to see him. “Dobbins,” he said, “What an honor. The last time I saw you was in court when you accused me of malpractice.”<br>
“Doc. Doc. My side is on fire. The pain is right here. What could it be?”<br>
“How would I know? You told the jury I wasn’t fit to be a doctor.”<br>
“I was only kidding, Doc. When you represent a client you don’t know what you’re saying. Could I be passing a kidney stone?”<br>
“Your diagnosis is as good as mine.”<br>
“What are you talking about?”<br>
“When you questioned me on the stand you indicated you knew everything there was to know about the practice of medicine.”<br>
“Doc, I’m climbing the wall. Give me something.”<br>
“Let’s say I give you something for a kidney stone and it turns out to be a gallstone. Who is going to pay for my court costs?”<br>
“I’ll sign a paper that I won’t sue.”<br>
"Can I read to you from the transcript of the trial? Lawyer Dobbins: ‘Why were you so sure that my client had tennis elbow?’ Dr. Green: ‘I’ve treated hundreds of people with tennis elbow and I know it when I see it.’<br>
Dobbins: ‘It never occurred to you my client could have an Excedrin headache?’<br>
Green: ‘No, there were no signs of an Excedrin headache.’<br>
Dobbins: ‘You and your ilk make me sick.’ "<br>
“Why are you reading that to me?”<br>
“Because, Dobbins, since the trial I’ve lost confidence in making a diagnosis. A lady cane in the other day limping …”<br>
“Please, Doc, I don’t want to hear it now. Give me some Demerol.”<br>
“You said during the suit that I dispensed drugs like a drunken sailor. I’ve changed my ways, Dobbins. I don’t prescribe drugs anymore.”<br>
“Then get me another doctor.”<br>
“There are no other doctors on duty. The reason I’m here is that after the malpractice suit the sheriff seized everything in my office. This is the only place that I can practice.”<br>
“If you give me something to relieve the pain I will personally appeal your case to a higher court.”<br>
“You know, Dobbins, I was sure that you were a prime candidate for a kidney stone.”<br>
“You can’t tell a man is a candidate for a kidney stone just by looking at him.”<br>
"That’s what you think, Dobbins. You had so much acid in you when you addressed the jury I knew some of it eventually had to crystallize into stones. Remember on the third day when you called me the ‘Butcher of Operating Room 6’? That afternoon I said to my wife, "That man is going to be in a lot of pain.’ "<br>
“Okay, Doc, you’ve had your ounce of flesh. Can I now have my ounce of Demerol?”<br>
“I better check you out first.”<br>
“Don’t check me out, just give the dope.”<br>
“But in court the first question you asked me was if I had examined the patient completely. It would be negligent of me if I didn’t do it now. Do you mind getting up on the scale?”<br>
“What for?”<br>
“To find out your height. I have to be prepared in case I get sued and the lawyer asks me if I knew how tall you were.”<br>
“I’m not going to sue you.”<br>
“You say that now. But how can I be sure you won’t file a writ after you pass the kidney stone?”</p>
<p>A Russian, a Cuban, an American and a Lawyer are in a train. The Russian takes a bottle of the Best Vodka out of his pack; pours some into a glass, drinks it, and says: “In Russia, we have the best vodka of the world, nowhere in the world you can find Vodka as good as the one we produce in Russia. And we have so much of it, that we can just throw it away…” Saying that, he open the window and throw the rest of the bottle through it. All the others are quite impressed.<br>
The Cuban takes a pack of Havanas, takes one of them, lights it and begins to smoke it saying: In Cuba, we have the best cigars of the world: Havanas. Nowhere in the world there is so many and so good cigar and we have so much of them, that we can just throw them away…". Saying that, he throws the pack of Havanas through the window. One more time, everybody is quite impressed.<br>
At this time, the American just stands up, opens the window, and throws the Lawyer through it…</p>
<p>A lawyer’s dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and steals a roast. Butcher goes to lawyer’s office and asks, “If a dog running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog’s owner?” The lawyer answers, “Absolutely.”<br>
“Then you owe me $8.50. Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today.” The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.50.<br>
Several days later the butcher opens the mail and finds an envelope from the lawyer: $20 due for a consultation.</p>
<p>Q: How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
A1: It only takes one lawyer to change your light bulb to his light bulb.<br>
A2: You won’t find a lawyer who can change a light bulb. Now, if you’re looking for a lawyer to screw a light bulb…<br>
A3: Whereas the party of the first part, also known as “Lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “Light Bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entry way, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties. The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction, this point being non-negotiable.</li>
<li>Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local and federal statutes.</li>
<li>Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“New Light Bulb”). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable. NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by any or all persons authorized by him, the objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “Partnership.”</li>

<p>A young lady goes to see a lawyer regarding a minor matter. After consultation, he notes the bill will be $100. She gives him a crisp $100 dollar bill and leaves. Sitting back, the lawyer gives the bill a flick and notices that the bill was so new and crisp it had another $100 dollar bill stuck to it. Now he was facing the age-old ethical dilemma, should he keep it himself or split it with his partner?</p>
<p>A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see walking down the side of the road. Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him. There would be a loud “THUMP” and then he would swerve back on the road. One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitchhiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over. He asked the priest, “Where are you going, Father?” “I’m going to the church five miles down the road,” replied the priest. “No problem, Father! I’ll give you a lift. Climb in the truck.” The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road.<br>
Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road, and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However, even though he was certain he had missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud “THUMP.” Not understanding where the noise came from, he glanced in his mirrors. When he didn’t see anything, he turned to the priest and said, “I’m sorry Father. I almost hit that lawyer.” “That’s okay my son,” replied the priest. “I got him with the door!”</p>
<p>Five surgeons were taking a coffee break and discussing their work.<br>
The first said, ‘I think accountants are the easiest to operate on; you open them up and everything inside is numbered.’<br>
The second said, ‘I think librarians are the easiest to operate on; you open them up and everything inside is in alphabetical order.’<br>
The third said, ‘I like to operate on electricians; you open them up and everything inside is color-coded.’<br>
The fourth surgeon said, ‘I like Engineers…they always understand when you have a few parts left over at the end…’<br>
The fifth one said, 'I like to operate on lawyers; they’re heartless, spineless, gutless, and their heads and their butts are interchangeable.</p>
<p>A lawyer got married to a woman who had previously been married twelve times. On their wedding night the settled into the bridal suite at their hotel and the bride said to her new groom, “Please promise to be gentle,…I am still a virgin.”<br>
This puzzled the groom, since after twelve marriages he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomenon.<br>
The bride responded…<br>
My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, “It’s gonna be great!”<br>
My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation.<br>
My third husband was from Field Service who constantly said that everything was diagnostically “okay,” but he just couldn’t get the system up.<br>
My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, “Those who can… do; those who can’t… teach.”<br>
My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department who said that he had the orders, but he wasn’t quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver.<br>
My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.<br>
My seventh husband was from Finance And Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn’t sure whether or not it was his job.<br>
My eighth husband was from Standards And Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.<br>
My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, “I know I have the product, I’m just not sure how to position it!”<br>
My tenth husband was a psychiatrist and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.<br>
My eleventh husband was a gynecologist and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.<br>
My twelfth husband was a stamp collector and all he ever wanted to do was philatelate. … God I miss him!<br>
So now I have married a lawyer, I know I’m finally going to get screwed.</p>
<p>Diogenes dusted off his lamp and set out once again, this time looking for an honest lawyer. After a few months of this, a friend asked him how he was doing. “Not too bad,” said Diogenes, “I still have my lamp.”</p>
<p>A man shot her husband dead. A preacher who saw the shooting asked, “Woman, why did you shoot your husband?” “Because he was a lawyer and an evil man. He was going to move to Anchorage!” “Woman,” said the man of the cloth, “You cannot stop a lawyer from going to Anchorage by shooting him.”</p>

<p>A minister died and to his chagrin found himself at the gates of Hell. The Devil greeted him, checked in his book and announced, “Yes, there is a place for you here,” and walked with the minister to his assigned place in hell. On the way, they passed a palatial suite, where the minister saw a crooked lawyer he had known, and the crooked lawyer was making love to a beautiful woman.<br>
The minister was troubled, but walked on with the devil. The devil ushered him into a tiny, cramped rocky cell. It was too much for the minister. “I admit I sinned when I was alive, but why am I sent to this cell for eternity when that crooked lawyer gets to spend eternity making love to a beautiful woman?”<br>
“Who are you,” said Satan, “to quarrel with that woman’s punishment?”</p>
<p>The local United Way office realized that it had never received a donation from the town’s most successful lawyer.<br>
A local volunteer called to solicit his donation, saying “our research shows that even though your annual income is over a million dollars, you do not give one penny to charity! Wouldn’t you like to give back to your community through The United Way?”<br>
The lawyer thinks for a moment and says: “First, did your research show that my mother is dying after a long, painful illness and has huge medical bills far beyond her ability to pay?” Embarrassed, the United Way volunteer mumbles, “Uh, no.”<br>
“Secondly, that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair and is unable to support his wife and six children?” The stricken United Way volunteer begins to stammer an apology but is cut off.<br>
“Thirdly, that my sister’s husband died in a dreadful traffic accident,” the lawyers voice rising in indignation, “leaving her penniless with a mortgage and three children?” The humiliated United Way volunteer, completely beaten, says simply, “I had no idea.”<br>
The lawyer then says “…and if I don’t give any money to THEM, why should I give any to you?”</p>
<p>“You’re a high-priced lawyer! If I give you $500, will you answer two questions for me?” “Absolutely! What’s the second question?”</p>
<p>A surgeon, an architect an a lawyer are having a heated barroom discussion concerning which of their professions is actually the oldest profession. The surgeon says: “Surgery IS the oldest profession. God took a rib from Adam to create Eve and you can’t go back further than that.”<br>
The architect says: “Hold on! In fact, God was the first architect when he created the world out of chaos in 7 days, and you can’t go back any further than THAT!”<br>
The lawyer smiles and says: “Gentlemen, Gentlemen…who do you think created the CHAOS!!!”</p>
<p>An old man was on his death bed. He wanted badly to take all his money with him. He called his priest, his doctor and his lawyer to his bedside. “Here’s $30,000 cash to be held by each you. I trust you to put this in my coffin when I die so I can take all my money with me.”<br>
At the funeral, each man put an envelope in the coffin. Riding away in a limousine, the priest suddenly broke into tears and confessed that he had only put $20,000 into the envelope because he needed $10,000 for a new baptistery. “Well, since we’re confiding in each other,” said the doctor, “I only put $10,000 in the envelope because we needed a new machine at the hospital which cost $20,000.”<br>
The lawyer was aghast. “I’m ashamed of both of you,” he exclaimed. “I want it known that when I put my envelope in that coffin, it held my personal check for the full $30,000.”</p>
<p>As the lawyer woke up after surgery, he said" “Why are all the blinds drawn?” The doctor answered: “There’s a big fire across the street, and we didn’t want you to think the operation was a failure.”</p>
<p>Two lawyers walking through the woods spotted a vicious-looking bear. The first lawyer immediately opened his briefcase, pulled out a pair of sneakers and started putting them on.<br>
The second lawyer looked at him and said, “You’re crazy! You’ll never be able to outrun that bear!”<br>
“I don’t have to,” the first lawyer calmly replied. “I only have to outrun you.”</p>
<p>A doctor and a lawyer in two cars collided on a country road. The lawyer, seeing that the doctor was a little shaken up, helped him from the car and offered him a drink from his hip flask. The doctor accepted and handed the flask back to the lawyer, who closed it and put it away. “Aren’t you going to have a drink yourself?” asked the doctor. “Sure; after the police leave,” replied the lawyer.</p>
<p>At the height of a political corruption trial, the prosecuting attorney attacked a witness. “Isn’t it true,” he bellowed, “that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case?” The witness stared out the window as though he hadn’t hear the question. “Isn’t it true that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case?” the lawyer repeated. The witness still did not respond. Finally, the judge leaned over and said, “Sir, please answer the question.” “Oh,” the startled witness said, “I thought he was talking to you.”</p>
<p>Two law partners leave their office and go to lunch. In the middle of lunch the junior partner slaps his forehead. “Damn,” he says. “I forgot to lock the office safe before we left.” His partner replies " What are you worried about? We’re both here."</p>
<p>A man in a bar stands up and proclaims, “All Lawyers are ASSHOLES!”<br>
A man at the front of the bar stands up and says, “Hey! I resent that!”<br>
So the first man asks, “Why, are you a lawyer?”<br>
“NO! I’m an asshole!”</p>
<p>The following four jokes are contributed by Ken Laninga, God help him… If you want a collection of all kinds of jokes, check out Ken’s Jokes…</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, a lawyer and a doctor were discussing whether or not they would donate, after death, their brains to science, and what sort of price they would ask for their estates, in return. The lawyer said that after his illustrious career in jurisprudence, he would ask for $100,000. The doctor said that, having saved thousands of lives with his skill, he would demand $200,000. Saddam insisted on at least a million dollars for his brain, because it had never been used</p>
<p>A salesman stopped for gas at a very old general store. While he was paying for the gas and an orange soda, he spied a dusty brass pig high on a shelf. He asked the old man behind the counter if he could take a closer look at the pig, but the shop keeper said that wasn’t a good idea. The salesman pressed the issue, and finally the old man gave in and climbed a ladder to retrieve the brass pig.<br>
After dusting it off, the salesman took a liking to the object. He took a long time in convincing the old man that, no matter what, he wanted the pig. They settled on $20, and the salesman drove off with the brass pig propped on the dashboard.<br>
About two miles outside of town, he looked in his rear view mirror and noticed a pig trotting down the road behind him. He thought that this was a bit amusing, until another, and still another pig joined the first. As he drove, more and more pigs joined in and followed him. The faster he went, the faster they ran.<br>
The salesman sped on at nearly a hundred miles an hour and got a bit of a lead on the throng of pigs that were in hot pursuit. He began to realize that this was what the old man was trying to warn him about. He came to a bridge over a river deep in a gorge, stopped, rolled down his window, threw the brass pig over the side, and sped off.<br>
He was astonished as he saw the pigs in his rear view mirror. They got to the bridge, and stormed over the side, down to their deaths on the rocks far below.<br>
The salesman drove back to the bridge and peered over the edge at the pile of pulverized porcine pursuers that plummeted over the precipice. He got back in his car and headed back to the stop where he bought the pig only minutes earlier.<br>
The old man was expecting him, and already had the $20 bill in his hand. “I told you it was nothin’ but trouble. Want your money back?” he asked. “No” said the salesman. “I just wanted to know if you had any brass lawyers.”</p>
<p>The lawyer is standing at the gate to Heaven and St. Peter is listing his sins:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defending a large corporation in a pollution suit where he knew it was guilty.</li>
<li>Defending an obviously guilty murderer because the fee was high.</li>
<li>Overcharging fees to many clients.</li>
<li>Persecuting an innocent woman because a scapegoat was needed in a controversial case.<br>
And the list went on for quite awhile.<br>
The lawyer objects and begins to argue his case. He admits all these things, but argues, “Wait, I’ve done some charity in my life also.” St. Peter looks in his book and says,“Yes, I see. Once you gave a dime to a panhandler and once you gave an extra nickel to the shoeshine boy, correct?”<br>
The lawyer gets a smug look on his face and replies, “Yes.”<br>
St. Peter turns to the angel next to him and says, “Give this guy 15 cents and tell him to go to hell.”</li>
</ol>
<p>One day, a man is walking along the beach and comes across an odd-looking bottle. Not being one to ignore tradition, he rubs it and, much to his surprise, a genie actually appears. “For releasing me from the bottle, I will grant you three wishes,” says the genie.<br>
The man is ecstatic. “But there’s a catch,” the genie continues. “What catch?” asks the man, eyeing the genie suspiciously. The genie replies, “For each of your wishes, every lawyer in the world will receive DOUBLE what you ask for.” “Hey, I can live with that! No problem!” replies the elated man.<br>
“What is your first wish?” asks the genie. “Well, I’ve always wanted a Ferrari!” POOF! A Ferrari appears in front of the man. “Now, every lawyer in the world has been given TWO Ferraris,” says the genie. “What is your next wish?” “I could really use a million dollars,” replies the man, and POOF! One million dollars appears at his feet. “Now every lawyer in the world is TWO million dollars richer,” the genie reminds the man. “Well, that’s OK, as long as I’ve got MY million,” replies the man.<br>
“And what is your final wish?” asks the genie. The man thinks long and hard, and finally says, “Well, you know, I’ve always wanted to donate a kidney.”</p>

<p>Lawyer: “Mr. Smith, you’ve told us all about your injuries. But according to the accident report, you told the investigating officer at the scene that you were not injured at all?”</p>
<p>Smith: Well, let me explain. When the officer arrived at the scene, he first looked at my horse. He said ‘Looks like he has a broken leg,’ and then he took out his gun and shot the horse. He then came up to me and asked me how I was doing. I of course immediately said “I’m fine!”</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the FBI, and the CIA are all trying to prove that they are the best at apprehending criminals. The President decides to give them a test. He releases a rabbit into a forest and each of them has to catch it.</p>
