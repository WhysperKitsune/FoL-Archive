    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Watchful/Avenger - Neutral Invest/Killer</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-watchful-avenger-neutral-invest-killer/11494</link>
    <description>The Watchful - Neutral invest (unique)

Passive 1: Underdog - When a faction is eliminated you will become the Avenger and join that faction
If more than one faction is eliminated at once then it does NK&gt;BD&gt;Unseen/Cult.
Passive 2: Over prepared - You are night immune once

Day ability: Glare - You cannot be targeted by day ability&#39;s for the rest of the day (they will not be told that it failed) (2 uses)

Night ability: Snoop - Learn your target&#39;s faction and class type (4 uses)

Avenger - Unknown Killer

Passive 1: Invincible -You cannot die at night. No exceptions. Not even prince execute.
Passive 2: Untouchable - Anyone that uses a day ability on you will die at the end of the next night. You know who will die this way at the start of the night. This does not pierce night immunity.

Night ability 1: Kill your target, Pierces night immunity (unlimited)
Night ability 2: Kill everyone that visits you. (3 uses)

Goal: You are a member of the faction you joined as the watchful. Eliminate the other factions.

Notes: While this is not a class you can claim on the stand it is definitely an interesting case of where even if you know their class you might not know what they are trying to acheave.</description>

            <p>The Avenger would not be Neutral Killer.<br>
It would be Unknown Killer.(no thats not a joke; unknown is a category for the ingame class cards; currently only used by king)<br>
It can be of any alignment, not necessarily Neutral.</p>
