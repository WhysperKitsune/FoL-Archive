    <description>_Walking through the castle of Adiart,_
_I&#39;ve seen what lies behind the walls,_
_You couldn&#39;t imagine what I found,_
_Listen: because this is not a lie!_

Behind the walls of Adiart,
I met the Princess, she was gullible,
I sang a story to her I just poetized,
She was surprised, like I.

She helped me to find the King,
Because she believed my story
I sang to him what&#39;s behind the walls,
He was surprised, that I dared to lie.

His Majesty told me,
- After he knocked me out of Adiart
&quot;Go and see for yourself,
What is in my kingdom,
And if you dare to lie again,
You shall die as a fool&quot;

_Walking through the castle of Adiart,_
_I met some cultists_,
_Whom I didn&#39;t mind,_
_Because I was scared to die._

- They were praying to their gods,
I asked: &quot;What&#39;s with the chant?&quot;
They said: &quot;Get out young fool,
Before we kill you, 
You would be a great sacrifice,
To our god: Mithras&quot;

I ran out of the room of my demise,
Then I met the Hunter of the wild.
I asked him how&#39;s the catch,
He told me, I&#39;ll be the bear&#39;s snack.

_Walking through the castle of Adiart,_
_I&#39;ve learned what the Purple Rose meant,_
_It&#39;s the Unseen, Adiart&#39;s secret,_
_You wouldn&#39;t believe, how evil they were._

- Every single one of them had black blood,
They weren&#39;t good people, like I said,
I told their leader, the Mastermind:
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just take the throne?&quot;
Her answer, froze my blood:
&quot;If you think that&#39;s so easy, 
Why don&#39;t we just tell the king,
What this new Bard thinks?&quot;

I left the Unseen, I was afraid,
That they would out me, 
To their king.
Instead I ran out of the castle,
To tell you, my grand finale

_Walking through the poor,_
_I am singing my song,_
_And I bring a promise:_
_I&#39;ll go back to Adiart,_
_End this misery,_
_And show you the path._</description>
