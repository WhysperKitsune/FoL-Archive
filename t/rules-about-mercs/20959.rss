    <title>Rules about mercs</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/rules-about-mercs/20959</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s specifically in the game rules or just one of those common sense rules. If not please add to the official rules about mercs. To many times I have a merc and when they whisper me to tell me they are my merc and they want to know my class. This is fine btw. Most also ask me if I&#39;m good or evil. This is because of the &quot;all classes side with BD&quot; meta. I literally had a merc out me as unseen because I was acting evil. He said he was siding with BD. I was actually a legit BD drunk when executed in that scenario but still holds its value. Too many times mercs claim they can side with evil or BD because they are neutral. 

It needs to be stated definitively in the rules or class card that mercs don&#39;t take sides and outting your contract no matter what side they are is grounds for throwing and reportable.</description>

            <p>Well I believe it’s a double edge sword. If you blatantly say you are saving for your second contract and your target dies while you are it is throwing because your condition says ensure your current contract survives. It doesn’t say or mean so nothing so you can pick and choose contracts to survive. Hence the reason it is random at first.</p>
<p>Now if you “save” those guards because you don’t feel a threat, then that is different. It’s all in intent and honestly I don’t think anyone would ban you for either. It’s just proper etiquette and game play to follow your win condition. That’s why I like merc. You don’t choose a side ever. Just play your class.</p>

            <p>It is okay, but if you know they are about to be attacked, you need to guard, but if not, you can save your guards.</p>

            <p>I never ever guard my first contract as I save them for my second who I can choose late game  and is therefore more likely to survive. Is that against the rules aswell then?</p>

            <p>Well you aren’t following your win condition and that is 100% throwing. Also called collusion. You one objective is to ensure the survivability of your contract.</p>
<p>Letting them kill your target is 1) you picking a side and 2) equivalent to bussing. No-one will ever kill a merc for guarding their contract lol. Besides there are ways to kill the target. I have never been asked nor ever asked a merc to throw his game by not guarding. Nownif someone asks you if.you have guards left and you don’t then they kill him so be it but at least you used your abilities to uphold your win condition.</p>
<p>That’s like asking an BD king to not guard himself or another target because eventually your gonna kill that target anyways…</p>
<p>Also side note here: this may happen already as I have never made it to a second contract. I die or my first survives the game (this is the case 89% of the time) but the merc should get 4 more guards and a kill every new contract. Thia will further more promote newbie mercs to stick by there win condition.</p>
<p>This is me hoping but I would love to see the merc go to night immune. One because he isn’t a threat to any side, two this will ensure he is around to help his contract and three it gives NKs the abikity to claim who are night immune or even scorened/fools. If converted it should stay. The only way into execute them.</p>

<p>He didn’t die because of me so on to the next target. Now If someone blatantly says they are attacking your target tonight and you don’t guard if available, that’s throwing because you aren’t trying to save your current contract with your ability</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree on that. I’d say any scenerio in which you know saving your target jeopardizes your survival, is fair game to not avoid. If it’s day 4 and the confirmed hunter asks you to clear the way so he can kill your target, and BD is also saying that they will. you should probably stay out of the way… just as if everyone’s calling out your target to be executed… you back them there too. your target is almost certainly going down one way or the other, the only thing you’re changing is whether it’s ideal for them go kill you first.</p>
<p>I’d say if a group really wants your target dead, you probably should stay out of the way… but you should not be the one to make everyone want your target dead.</p>

            <p>I’m not even saying that much. Your win condition is for him to survive. If he is guilty and up on trial. I’m not pardoning either. He didn’t die because of me so on to the next target. Now If someone blatantly says they are attacking your target tonight and you don’t guard if available, that’s throwing because you aren’t trying to save your current contract with your ability. Two differences there. I will however execute anyone who votes my contract whether he is good or bad and even if he dies because how often does a need get to do that…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’d suppose the point of contention is whether intentionally shifting to the backup option for a win condition is acceptable. IMO I’d say it shouldn’t be. This isn’t to say you should get yourself killed covering for a doomed target, but having your target alive, and having the ability to shift to a second target, is more or less more universally better odds than throwing out your odds. They say don’t put all your eggs in one basket, having them in 2 baskets, and intentionally throwing one basket in the trash… is pretty inarguably bad advice.</p>

            <p>I remember also being told if your contract gets called out you can silently accept their fate and vote execute and then get a new one, but you can’t call out your target.</p>
<p>It is similar to the rules for busing a fellow unseen/cult except they are always considered to be unwilling to get bused.</p>

<p>Well that doesn’t make sense. As a player you have to try and win the game.<br>
I was in some games when my target lost (last bd left) and i’ve won. As a merc you have to keep your target alive.</p>
<p>By your sense if your target is a fool you should help him get executed.</p>

<p>Yeah, going against your contract is absolutely against your win condition and thus breaking the rules. Second your contract dies, can do what you want, but up until they die, you work for them.</p>

<p>As merc, its not about “going by your win condition”. You have to go by your contract’s win condition, even if it means you are very likely to lose the game.</p>

            <p>Yeah, going against your contract is absolutely against your win condition and thus breaking the rules. Second your contract dies, can do what you want, but up until they die, you work for them.</p>

            <p>Thanks that is what I thought but like i said, it’s not clear enough. It happens too much. Tired of mercs taking sides no matter what their contract is.</p>
