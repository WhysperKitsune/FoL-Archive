    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/tol-quits-after-entering/79403</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

After I enter the game and click the log in button, the game crashes

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The game was not supposed to crash

#### Steps to reproduce:

1: Click the Log in button
2: Crash

#### Comments:

This has happened repeatedly ever since the Windows 7 Support update. I have yet to play a game of ToL.</description>

            <p>Have you tried changing your resolution or playing in windowed/fullscreen.<br>
Have heard that playing around with those options fixes the weird crash.</p>
