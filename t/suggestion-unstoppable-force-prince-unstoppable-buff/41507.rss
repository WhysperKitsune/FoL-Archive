    <title>[Suggestion] Unstoppable Force (Prince Unstoppable buff)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-unstoppable-force-prince-unstoppable-buff/41507</link>
    <description>Im sick of prince getting eliminated Night 1 or Night 2.

Prince needs a buff to Unstoppable.

**Unstoppable Force** (Replaces current Unstoppable passive)

**Immune to death at night once**, also **immune to occupation and target changing**, **people who tries to occupy the prince will think they succeed**. the Prince **will appear as Support/Social to the Seeker and the Duchess (Only Support)**

Explanation:
Prince is without a doubt the most powerful class in Blue Dragon and probably the most powerful in the game.
But whats the point on having the Prince in the game if he always dies too soon or gets investigated by evil factions Night 1?

With this, prince will have more time to get information and probably a physician/knight guarding him.

Thats all. hope you like my idea :D</description>

<p>Maybe we can give CW soulbind?</p>

<p>The only time a Majority faction member should have night immunity is if they were guarded by king</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why does it need to be just the king? Giving night immunity is an ability that could work on other classes too (not existing ones. I mean for passable new ones or possible reworks of existing ones.) Also the hunter is a thing and can get night immunity.</p>

            <p>I just mentioned this in another thread, but if your problem is the Prince dying randomly in the first few nights, I’d suggest having a way to replace him instead.  My suggestion:</p>
<p>If the Prince dies before N4, the Princess has a button that she can use to silently turn into a Prince to replace him.  Only one Princess can do this per game (first come, first serve, when there’s more than one.)</p>

            <p>I disagree with the entire post. BD Shouldn’t have any form of night immunity outside of hunter, Prince showing as not occupy immune is bad for BD since most evils don’t show as occupy immune. Him showing as support/social also makes no sense. Everyone would know the prince shows as support/social if the change is made so it would effectively be pointless.</p>

            <p>I disagree that the Prince needs extra protection. It’s why the Knight, Physician, etc. are in the game - they should be guarding the Prince if there’s any indication of who it is. As for n1/2, evils just get lucky by killing Prince. It sucks for BD but it adds variety. If Prince dies early, advantage Evil. If Prince survives to late game, advantage BD. We shouldn’t force the Prince’s security via self-protection. There are plenty of other BD roles to work with despite Prince being the strongest, and the Prince’s mortality means that we have to adapt to the situation at hand. Being death immune once is a humongous buff since those other roles can still defend him before and after that extra life.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything except for the Prince appearing as Support/Social.</p>
<p>But I definitely think he should be immune to death at night once because right now all the Evil Kings hunt him down and kill him Night 4.</p>
