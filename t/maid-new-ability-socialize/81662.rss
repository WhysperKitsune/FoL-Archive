    <title>[Maid - new ability] Socialize</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/maid-new-ability-socialize/81662</link>
    <description>Add a new day ability to Maids:

Day ability - Socialize (1 charge)
At the beginning of the night you are given a new random matching partner from among the living players, except the king, your Matchmake ability will match with this target.

It happens from time to time that a Maid hits a matchmaking with a target that is either matching all (Merc or Alch) or incomp with all (Fool, Scorned, NK*) which effectively makes the Maid&#39;s matchmaking for the next day useless, as you know the result and you wont be able to deduce anything from it. So it would be a nice little assist to once per match to reset your matchmaking partner. It will reset to a new player at random among any living player, except the king.</description>

            <p>Maid has a lot of obstacles though. Royals as incomps, neuts as either always incomp/match, evils matching.</p>
<p>I completely agree that N1 is the maid’s strongest point as they effectively get 2 people’s worth of investigating. I’m not sure a cut of the N0 match-target is entirely fair though, but worth considering.</p>

            <p>this would absolutely need to be paired with some sort of maid nerf, probably  along the lines of “the maid doesnt start the game with a n0 starting match”</p>
<p>maids already the strongest invest, this would just make her stronger</p>

<p><strong>Rumor (Day)</strong> - Target player will be “last checked” in regards to Matchmake. Cannot be used day 1. - 2 Uses.</p>

<p>I’d agree with this change.</p>
