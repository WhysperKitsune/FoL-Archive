    <title>[Priest Rework Suggestion] Priest - Unknown Social</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/priest-rework-suggestion-priest-unknown-social/13915</link>
    <description>Priest - Unknown Social (starting Priest is always BD. Priest in not guaranteed or known to all by default)
Passive: Head - All church members know your class and cannot kill or faction check you. (Does not stop assassin/CL poison/bleed) Church members and only church members can convert you.

Passive: Pass the Touch - If you die then the oldest non-unique member becomes the new Priest. They keep their faction.

Day ability: Recruit - Invite someone to the church. If they accept then for the rest of the game they can chat with the other church members. You cannot accept the invitation as a unique class if there already is one in the church other than the Priest. (Unlimited. There are a max of 3 other members)

Night ability 1: Veto - Remove a church members Occupy immunity and Occupy them tonight (Unlimited)

Night Ability 2: In the light - Reveal your class to everyone at the start of the day. You gain an extra vote until you die.

Goal: Same as factions. Survive if neutral

Notes: 
To be clear. Being recruited into the church does not change your class or ability&#39;s. All it does is tell you who the Priest is, Who the other church members are and lets you talk to them at night.</description>

            <p>Eh</p>
<p>I’m not sure I want a neighborizer either way tbh</p>
<p>It’s not that I think the role needs changes really badly, it’s that I don’t think I’ll enjoy the gameplay it will bring when it spawns</p>

            <p>It just adds a characteristic. The church is basically a neighborhood. They know who the other members are but not their class or faction. And they talk to each other at night. Not sure if the Unseen/Cult that join should talk to both the church and thier faction or just the church</p>

            <p>What qualifies a member of the church? Does it change one’s class or just add a characteristic</p>
