    <title>(Class Suggestion) (NK) Warrior of Chaos (NI) Warrior of the Light</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-nk-warrior-of-chaos-ni-warrior-of-the-light/54477</link>
    <description>So it&#39;s like inq/sorc, if WoC appear, then WotL will appear too.

Warrior of Chaos (Neutral killer)
Passive 1: Gifts of Chaos. Immune to occupation, conversation and target change. Death immune.
Day ability 1: Seduce: Make target a sinner. 3 uses.
Night ability 1: Blood for the Blood God! Attack target, if drunk tryed to debauch you or if butler tryed to occupy you, instead kill them.
Night ability 2: Demonic rage: Attack target and everyone who visit then, this attack will bypass night immune. You will also attack everyone who visit you. 2 uses, 1 night cooldown, can only be used if warrior of the light is dead.

Warrior of the Light (Neutral investigative)
Passive 1: Pure soul: Immune to occupation, conversation and target change. Death immune. 
Day ability 1: Lay on hands: Target will no longer be a sinner (if he was). If target was cult, then he will die tonight, this would not count as visiting and will bypass heal/immune/prevention (jail or merc protect) 2 uses.
Night ability 1: Trial of the light. Check if your target is a sinner, (Sinners are: Anyone that killed someone who is not cult, cult, warrior of chaos, target of seduce) 
Night ability 2: Last trial. Attack the target if he is a sinner, this attack will bypass night immune, if target is not a sinner, you will kill youself. 3 uses. 

So WotL need to kill WoC, while WoC need to kill all major factions.

(P.S. This idea might be bad and one more inq/sorc combo might be a bad idea too)</description>
