    <description>I&#39;ve complained about this before, but I&#39;m gonna make a more extensive argument here.

Butlers/Drunks should not know if their target is immune.

# It mostly targets Neutral Killers

Neutral Killers are some of the hardest classes win with, by necessity. However, we still need to give them every advantage possible, as they are a 1 man team.

There is a reason you can&#39;t be found as a Possessor from a Sheriff checking you night one.

While being targeted by a Butler or Drunk isn&#39;t an insta loss, it makes most claims suspicious. Knight or Court Wizard? Despite how suspicious the claims are, it makes it much less likely to be believed if you are immune.

Another thing to note is that the notifications have been removed from Mastermind because of this. And Mastermind is much better off than a Neutral Killer.

If we don&#39;t want notifications for Mastermind, we shouldn&#39;t have them for anybody.

# It makes Court Wizard a negative utility

One of the reasons being immune isn&#39;t insta death is because of the Court Wizard&#39;s barrier.

However, this just makes the Court Wizard interfere with Drunk/Butler. If they make someone occupy immune, then Butler and Drunk get false feedback, **because of an ally**. This is just another damper to the Court Wizard.

# Butler and Drunk are fun to play without this knowledge

I play the game a lot, and I don&#39;t like Butler or Drunk more because of these notifications. While finding the Assassin and a select couple other classes is part of the Drunk&#39;s uniqueness, finding immune classes certainly isn&#39;t.

Debauch carries the Drunk all on it&#39;s own, while Happy Hour is a good ability and the Drunk would be less without it, Drunk would still be a good class.

Now on to the Butler. While Serve Wine is a clearly inferior to Debauch, the Butler makes up for it in all sorts of other ways. Party is a useful self defense mechanism that gives the Butler options the Drunk doesn&#39;t have. And Nightshade Wine is an interesting and useful dynamic.

# Suggestions for the Butler

If you still think the Butler is too weak, there are all sorts of other interesting abilities that could compensate for this lack of investigation power.

First, a more potent and less confirm-able Nightshade Wine. Nightshade Wine confirmation is one of the biggest hindrances to the Servant, and it can be easily overridden by any healer. Thus my suggestion, make Nightshade Wine completely silent and unhealable. This makes it a dangerous but effective tool for the Butler to use, while also helping the Servant.

Second, a new ability. A renamed Pants on Fire would be a nice new ability for the Butler, and is a good offensive ability.

Like this for example:
&gt; Day Ability: Drugged Wine: If your target uses a day ability today, they will instead use it on them self. 3 uses.</description>

</aside>
<p>Well I’d say the thing is the debatable utility. CW delays a conversion, of course the utility of that is a lot more of a mystery that people can’t put their finger on, namely because nobody really knows how often it happens. in an unseen game n2-(day first unseen caught) if you assume your first barrier was not a succesful guess of the unseen’s target, barrier is all drawback no gain. As you could be preventing the assasain from hitting the drunk, or you could be making a non immune BD appear immune, or you could be making someone immune who is immune, but when they are called out on their immunity you think you need to vouch, because you possibly caused a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The conversion immunity is the benefit and it is a damn strong benefit, the occ immunity is usually the drawback. because their are few non occupy immune classes that you can be semi-confident are actually BD.</p>

</aside>
<p>for me at least, I won’t call out an occupy immune until after the prince is outed or dead. However once the prince is dead, I’m pretty quick to call it out. If a CW was involved I like to imagine they are smart enough to point that out.</p>
<p>Oh and of course I won’t call it out if there’s no reason to think there is an evil occ immune, say a cult game with reasonable certainty that the NK is dead.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve complained about this before, but I’m gonna make a more extensive argument here.</p>
<p>Butlers/Drunks should not know if their target is immune.</p>
<h1>It mostly targets Neutral Killers</h1>
<p>Neutral Killers are some of the hardest classes win with, by necessity. However, we still need to give them every advantage possible, as they are a 1 man team.</p>
<p>There is a reason you can’t be found as a Possessor from a Sheriff checking you night one.</p>
<p>While being targeted by a Butler or Drunk isn’t an insta loss, it makes most claims suspicious. Knight or Court Wizard? Despite how suspicious the claims are, it makes it much less likely to be believed if you are immune.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the notifications have been removed from Mastermind because of this. And Mastermind is much better off than a Neutral Killer.</p>
<p>If we don’t want notifications for Mastermind, we shouldn’t have them for anybody.</p>
<h1>It makes Court Wizard a negative utility</h1>
<p>One of the reasons being immune isn’t insta death is because of the Court Wizard’s barrier.</p>
<p>However, this just makes the Court Wizard interfere with Drunk/Butler. If they make someone occupy immune, then Butler and Drunk get false feedback, <strong>because of an ally</strong>. This is just another damper to the Court Wizard.</p>
<h1>Butler and Drunk are fun to play without this knowledge</h1>
<p>I play the game a lot, and I don’t like Butler or Drunk more because of these notifications. While finding the Assassin and a select couple other classes is part of the Drunk’s uniqueness, finding immune classes certainly isn’t.</p>
<p>Debauch carries the Drunk all on it’s own, while Happy Hour is a good ability and the Drunk would be less without it, Drunk would still be a good class.</p>
<p>Now on to the Butler. While Serve Wine is a clearly inferior to Debauch, the Butler makes up for it in all sorts of other ways. Party is a useful self defense mechanism that gives the Butler options the Drunk doesn’t have. And Nightshade Wine is an interesting and useful dynamic.</p>
<h1>Suggestions for the Butler</h1>
<p>If you still think the Butler is too weak, there are all sorts of other interesting abilities that could compensate for this lack of investigation power.</p>
<p>First, a more potent and less confirm-able Nightshade Wine. Nightshade Wine confirmation is one of the biggest hindrances to the Servant, and it can be easily overridden by any healer. Thus my suggestion, make Nightshade Wine completely silent and unhealable. This makes it a dangerous but effective tool for the Butler to use, while also helping the Servant.</p>
<p>Second, a new ability. A renamed Pants on Fire would be a nice new ability for the Butler, and is a good offensive ability.</p>
<p>Like this for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability: Drugged Wine: If your target uses a day ability today, they will instead use it on them self. 3 uses.</p>
</blockquote>
