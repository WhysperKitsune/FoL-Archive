    <title>[Misc] Blood on the Forums V: Ides of Blood - Good Wins!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/misc-blood-on-the-forums-v-ides-of-blood-good-wins/84948</link>
    <description>The time has come for the reckoning of the Ides of Blood! Your Storytellers today shall be @Amelia and @EliThePsycho  

For those of you just joining us, I have a quick rundown of the things you&#39;ll need to know. Some of this stuff is actually helpful no matter how much experience you have with BotF, so I encourage you to brush up.

[details=&quot;Character List&quot;]

This game will be running the homebrew script known as Ides of Blood. Made by Stitchface on the clocktower discord. Give him a shout while you’re here. In this script, the clockhand plays a major part in the Good team’s information, and if they can track it down, they’ll have found the Demon. Team Evil, however, is a dangerous yet fragile threat, able to kill many in one night via the Secondhand or Wendigo, or perhaps spread confusion by the Viceroy or Bogman. They can manipulate the clockhand to their advantage, securing their own victory if Good cannot coordinate and piece together their information.

Townsfolk:
[color=29b6f6]**Chieftain**[/color]: You start knowing an in-play Outsider. Each night (but not the first), you learn if the clockhand is an Outsider. [+1 Outsider]
[color=29b6f6]**Blasphemer**[/color]: You start knowing an in-play Townsfolk. Each night (but not the first), you may choose to invite death. If you invite death while you are the clockhand, you die.
[color=29b6f6]**Diviner**[/color]: You start knowing which Demon is in play as well as a player who is not the clockhand.
[color=29b6f6]**Trapper**[/color]: On your first night, choose a player (but not yourself). Each night (but not the first), you learn if either of you (but not which) is the clockhand.
[color=29b6f6]**Poacher**[/color]: Once per game, at night (but not the first), choose a player. You will know if they or their closest living player below them is the clockhand (but not which).
[color=29b6f6]**Stargazer**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), you learn the clockhand’s alignment.
[color=29b6f6]**Soothsayer**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player. You learn their character. If the clockhand is evil or yourself, you will malfunction.
[color=29b6f6]**Bloodletter**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), you may choose a player. You learn their alignment and a player is bloodied. Or choose no one. 1 Townsfolk starts bloodied.
[color=29b6f6]**Stalker**[/color]: Each night, learn if the closest living player below you is a Minion.
[color=29b6f6]**Ambusher**[/color]: You start knowing an in-play Minion. If you die at night, learn a player who is a Minion.
[color=29b6f6]**Warrior**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), learn if you are bloodied. You are triaged at night.
[color=29b6f6]**Medicine Man**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), Choose 2 players (but not yourself), they are triaged tonight.
[color=29b6f6]**Reveler**[/color]: Once per game, publicly declare yourself as the Reveler. If you do, the Demon and another player will malfunction today and tonight.

Outsiders:
[color=29b6f6]**Wicked**[/color]: If you become the clockhand, you turn evil and the Demon learns who you are.
[color=29b6f6]**Urchin**[/color]: The first time you become the clockhand, the Demon may choose to move it again. You start bloodied.
[color=29b6f6]**Right Hand Man**[/color]: Each time your closest living player below you is executed, a player malfunctions from now on, even if you are dead.
[color=29b6f6]**Apiarist**[/color]: If you die, either 1 player dies or 3 players are bloodied tonight.

Minions:
[color=red]**Eclipse**[/color]: You start the game knowing a Townsfolk player. This player will malfunction. The first time you or they become the clockhand, you may move it again.
[color=red]**Viceroy**[/color]: Each night, you see the Grimoire and may choose to make the closest living Townsfolk player below you malfunction tonight and tomorrow day.
[color=red]**Secondhand**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player. They are bloodied. Chosen clockhands die instead.
[color=red]**Effigy**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), you may choose yes or no. If you choose yes, you die. [+1 Outsider]

Demons:
[color=red]**Retrogradus**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player, they die. On your first night, a player malfunctions tonight and tomorrow day. [The clockhand moves up the list]
[color=red]**Bogman**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player, they die. The clockhand and the player below them malfunction if they are Townsfolk.
[color=red]**Wendigo**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player, they die. Or, choose 3 players, they are bloodied. All Minions start bloodied.
[color=red]**Sasquatch**[/color]: Each night (but not the first), choose a player; they die. Once per game, you may choose two players.

Townsfolk and Outsiders start good-aligned, Minions and the Demon start evil-aligned. There are no neutral parties in Ravenswood Bluff.


[/details]

[details=&quot;Town Composition&quot;]

This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the composition of the game at each possible player count.

Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons

5: 3/0/1/1
6: 3/1/1/1
7: 5/0/1/1
8: 5/1/1/1
9: 5/2/1/1
10: 7/0/2/1
11: 7/1/2/1
12: 7/2/2/1
13: 9/0/3/1
14: 9/1/3/1
15: 9/2/3/1

Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Revelers at the start, for example).

Certain characters may contain parts of their ability which modify the game composition by adding or removing certain character types. Be sure to take notice of these.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Phase Length&quot;]

Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.

12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.
12 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.
24 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.

The night phase will last for no more than 24 hours. If all relevant actions have been submitted and processed, Storytellers reserve the right to begin the next day early.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Storyteller&quot;]
The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors (those abilities which use the words &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot;, or in some other way leave ambiguity as to exactly how their effect plays out). Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.
[/details]

[details=&quot;The Fabled&quot;]
The Fabled aren&#39;t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters can be found below.

[color=yellow]**Angel**[/color]: Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.
[color=yellow]**Buddhist**[/color]: Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.
[color=yellow]**Doomsayer**[/color]: If more than four players live, each player may publicly invoke the Doomsayer once per game to cause a player of their own alignment to die.
[color=yellow]**Fiddler**[/color]: Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.
[color=yellow]**Hell’s Librarian**[/color]: Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.
The following Fabled character must be added before the game begins; please speak to the Storyteller if you wish to see it added.
[color=yellow]**Revolutionary**[/color]: Two neighboring players are known to be the same alignment. Once per game, one of them may register falsely.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Scum Info&quot;]
On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Malfunctions&quot;]
The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the class is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning class’ ability simply does not have any effect.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Nominations and Voting&quot;]
Once the discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will formally announce the opening of the nomination phase. Players must be nominated before they may be voted on that day. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day. Beyond this, nothing limits who may be nominated; dead players may be nominated, and even the host (although be warned that executing the host is an instant evil win).
When a nomination is opened, an accusation and defense will be presented, and then the storyteller begins to track votes for that nomination. The players may precast votes, but the votes will lock in a clockhand format. Starting with the player below the nominee on the list, and working downwards, the votes will be locked if they are cast. As an example, take the following five players;
&gt; Alex
Brianna
Cameron
Derek
Ellen

Brianna is nominated. Cameron’s vote will be locked as soon as he places it, because he is the first person below Brianna on the list. Derek may cast his vote before Cameron, and may alter his vote if Cameron has not yet voted, but once Cameron has voted and had his vote locked, Derek’s vote will be the next to lock, and if it is placed when Cameron’s vote locks, then Derek’s vote will lock however it was at that time.
Any votes that are not cast by EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players, and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. If there is a tie between two or more players for the highest count of votes, the day will end with no execution. The Storyteller may only declare an early end to voting if it is no longer possible to tie or exceed the highest nomination.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Whispers&quot;]
Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Whispers to your neighbors (those seated next to you) do not have to be announced. Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Death&quot;]

When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak (I believe the common nomenclature for this is &quot;flipless and deathless&quot;, if that helps). They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of the game. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability on a given night will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect (such as causing another player to malfunction) will end upon the death of that character.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Victory&quot;]

Good wins by eliminating all Demons (Minions do not necessarily need to die for Good to win, but eliminating Minions can be helpful). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (regardless of either player’s alignment). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain class abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the class list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win simultaneously), Good wins.
[/details]

[details=&quot;The Clockhand and Bloodying&quot;]
**The Clockhand**: In this script, many characters reference the clockhand in their abilities. But what is this clockhand? It’s a token of sorts that starts on the Demon. For every day that passes, it moves 1 player down the list. The clockhand, however, does not know they are the clockhand. If it happens to land on the Urchin, Eclipse, or the Eclipse’s known player whilst their abilities are active, either the Demon in the Urchin’s case or the Eclipse in their case may instantly move it again. If the Retrogradus is in play, the clockhand always moves up the list, even if the Retrogradus leaves play or malfunctions. If the Good team can narrow down the clockhand, they’ll be right at the Demon’s doorstep! But the Evil team has ways to bypass it or even manipulate it to their advantage.

**Bloodying and Triaging**: Many characters also mention bloodying on their abilities. What is it, you may ask? It’s a status that can be inflicted on you, and once it is it will permanently stay in a similar manner to death. You will never know you were bloodied. It has no visible effects by itself, but if you ever get bloodied a second time, you will die. That is where triaging comes in. It functions as a sort of half protection. If you would die while you are triaged, you are instead bloodied. If you would be bloodied while you are triaged, you are not bloodied. If you would die while both triaged and bloodied, however, you will still die.

<p>Oh man, were you really thinking about that?

            <p>Yeah, I was mentioning that besides some of the mech info, the fact that you were Wicked and outed and then coordinated town was a big factor.
