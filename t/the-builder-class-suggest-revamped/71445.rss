            <p>I have another tiny bit of constructive <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:"> criticism.  Isn‚Äôt Stable too confirmable?  Since it confirms the Builder to the entire court.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt you mean under construction?  Anyway I love this idea!  Super original, the only thing I‚Äôm unsatisfied with is the name ‚ÄúBuilder,‚Äù I would like to see it changed to something that reflects the concept of a treasonous or rejected builder.</p>
