    <title>3 people left, Alch, Reaper, King. Reaper insta loses during day cycle</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/3-people-left-alch-reaper-king-reaper-insta-loses-during-day-cycle/17771</link>
    <description>What happened: Daytime rolls around, CL dies to reap. Reaper, Alchemist, and Me (King) still alive, game automatically ends as Cult/Alch win without any discussion/voting.

What was supposed to happen: A standard day transpires with the lying liars and the lies they tell trying to kill the rogue elements blocking their win condition.

Steps to reproduce: Possibly because I was replacement king? Also was converted Cult. Have you, reaper and unsure if it&#39;s reliant on another neutral being the 3rd wildcard all I know is no one else was apparently reaped, and the game just ended in a Cult/Alchemist win, and Reaper loss.

Comments: None other than the info provided. IGN: OneOfUS if that is helpful to find the game. Have never had that outcome in the 120 hours I&#39;ve played and have seen many 3 player standoffs with reaper in the mix.</description>

            <p>I had something similair happen. Reaped king, reaper (me), alch and MM. I reaped the alch, and then only scorned won during the day, even though it should have been me and MM leff. I got robbed of my reaper win &gt;:(.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’m 100% aware of what can happen, the fact is, it wasn’t even allowed to transpire, it was just cult/alchemist wins.</p>
