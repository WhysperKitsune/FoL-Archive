    <title>How to stop D4 king executions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/how-to-stop-d4-king-executions/40221</link>
    <description>Allies was a bad Ability for the game and it is a good thing it was removed. However it did serve a purpose and that was making the starting king not an instant exe.

My solution to this would be to remove starting Neutral king and have it be 66% good king instead. That&#39;s the same as everyone else and thus is as trustworthy as everyone D2. 

What ideas does everyone else have?</description>

            <p>I think cancelling Royal Blood only for BD the day after the execution of a Good King would be nice, so if there’s an Unseen or Cult with Royal Blood, they could reveal as an Evil King if stepping up would give Unseen the extra vote they need to turn the game in their favor.</p>

            <p>That’s because king usually isn’t BD and everyone else usually is. If the probabilities were the same to start then the premise would be false. Also my point is that if king is useless then why would you take to time to make your BD into one?</p>

            <p>But I think the point here is that kings are going to be almost 100% useless and exe’d d4 no matter what. I don’t think making the king factions start different percentages will help, but would rather have a king a chance to live then for them die 100% every game. Just won’t be fun to spawn as king.</p>

<p>Hey Boslof, I’ve been giving it some thought, and I think the King needs a bit more tweaking before launch.</p>
<p>Order is potentially strong on the King, but they need to live for a decent amount of time for it to reach its full potential. However, without Allies, I don’t see this happening very often.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - removing Allies is AMAZING. However, which is more valuable - Order, or a confirmed BD King? I’d be willing to bet that our Day 4 King executions will jump up by a lot once this patch hits, simply because Order isn’t really worth it.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much you’ve read of my “Some Ideas” mini-megathread, but I think that the solution to this is to give the starting BD King a few special mechanics. If you give the starting BD King an ability the BD will be unwilling to lose, and you punish the BD for incorrectly executing a BD King, the regicide rate is unlikely to spike as much. My personal suggestions are below, but pretty much anything works as long as it achieves this end goal.</p>

<p>BD Boon: Starting Good King’s guards protect against conversion as well as kills.</p>
<p>BD Punishment: If a Good King dies to public execution or Butler, the royal bloodline is useless and royals may not step up early.</p>

            <p>Allies was a bad Ability for the game and it is a good thing it was removed. However it did serve a purpose and that was making the starting king not an instant exe.</p>
<p>My solution to this would be to remove starting Neutral king and have it be 66% good king instead. That’s the same as everyone else and thus is as trustworthy as everyone D2.</p>
<p>What ideas does everyone else have?</p>
