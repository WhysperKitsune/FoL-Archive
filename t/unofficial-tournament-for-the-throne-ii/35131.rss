            <p>I got asked to join a few times I think, people see 878 hours and think it means I’m some kind of ToL god or something, Id have joined if term wasn’t starting, I wouldn’t be able to give it the attention it deserves. Ill probably be browsing streams to make sure no ones screwing around watching people they shouldn’t be though.</p>
<p>I certainly support the idea of tournaments and other community events. Why I ran my Christmas fundraiser thing, was hoping others would be inspired to do more of that kind of thing too. Good luck with all this, it’s quite the undertaking, but you seem capable and it sounds like you’ve done it once before.</p>

            <p>Ya, this idea came from my need to satisfy my competitive side. Moving from Town Of Salem to  Throne Of Lies was overall really positive but I missed ranked mode a lot. Figured others felt the same way and decided to craft something that would allow high skilled players to demonstrate and validate their skills.</p>
<p>I hope others are inspired by this and create similar events, so I can flex my own TOL skills <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>That was the only thing I’d thought of so far, but its too late to change that sort of thing now even if you were going to. I like what I’ve seen so far, and hope it all goes well, everyone enjoys themselves. And no, you didnt come across as rude at all, dont worry. I was concerned that I had come across as rude, why I tried to clarify it was only a suggestion. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Wish we had more of this sort of thing.</p>

            <p>Not at all! I like being challenged, it is the only way for improvement and I want to make this tournament the best experience it can be for viewers and players alike.</p>
<p>If you have any more suggestions/ critiques don’t hesitate to voice your opinion.</p>
<p>Sorry if I came off as rude, not my intention at all!</p>

            <p>Yeah, obviously a bit short notice I suppose. I’ve heard nothing as to whether its official or they just liked the idea, I’ve not really been paying much attention to this until a day or so ago. In any case my statement was mostly intended as that I cant really tell you what to do on any of this, just suggest ideas, as this is your tournament not mine. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I didn’t want it to come off as me trying to make you do something, that’s all.</p>

            <p>I would qualify this as an official tournament. The developers are handing out free keys to participants, contributed 50 dollars to the prize pool, and have posted it on the social media platforms. Seems like a stamp of validity to me <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Names have been a really hot topic in the tournament discord. I choose to not restrict names because I did not want to be authoritarian and names hold an element of strategy in their own way.</p>
<p>I will be exploring forced auto-generated names for future tournaments but for the moment you can use whatever you wish because it is too close to the tournament start time to mess with the rules.</p>

            <p>That too, just too many possible ways to abuse that sort of thing. But this isnt an official tournament far as I know, so its just a suggestion. Up to the host far as I know.</p>

            <p>Haha ya I’m just doing tournament stuffs right now so saw your message.</p>
<p>So only one “camera” because didn’t want to take away from people signing up, 150 people have so far.</p>
<p>I am the “camera” and I will just be playing the game like normal, no huge 300 IQ plays, just basic fundamentals to not mess with the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>I have 100+ hours so I’m not a scrub or anything <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I hope with these many questions you have signed up by now or their might not be enough room left!</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>I’m going to test run this psycho king point system and make changes if necessary after this tournament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You receive the points of your ending class. Same thing applies with conversions, doesn’t matter that you were once BD only your final role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fool bonus is a good idea but I ran into some problems balancing fool in the first tournament, its win rate was high than expected, so I am a little tentative to apply more point opportunities to that class.</p>
</li>

            <p>mhhm I still don’t see the point in making the NK get punished in his points for stepping up to become psycho king. He gets 20 points if he stays NK and and 17 if he steps up. i think the points should be equal.</p>
<p>Also another question: So if any other Neut steps up to be king, do they become the Neutral King points? What if they already completed their first win condition beforehand (Scorned/Inq killing their target) and manage to survive till the end as Neutral king. Do they only get the the King points, the original Neut role points  or both ? What if they die as king ? No points at all or only the points from their first completed Win condition?</p>
<p>Also shouldn’t the fool get bonus points for getting exed in the first 3 days ?</p>
<p>What I also don’t understand is the 14 players+ 2 cameras. So 2 of the players in the game will be afk each round? What if these 2 players get crucial game roles ?</p>

            <p>Well, this isn’t the only media that it was advertised on. It was posted by the devs on discord, twitter, facebook so it had a lot of exposure compared to the first one.</p>

            <p>The player receives the points regardless of death so,</p>
<p>Ex. I am a hunter, I die N1. BD ends up winning the game, I still receive my 10 points for winning with my faction.</p>
<p>The original cult leader holds to that same idea but with the extra incentive to survive the entire game to get more points,</p>
<p>Ex. Cult Leaders dies N2, Cult wins, 11 points<br>
Ex 2. Cult Leaders survives entire game, cult wins, 12 points.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>So overall I really don’t have enough data to make an educated decision about psycho king because it is so new. But my philosophy of psycho king having fewer points than NK was based around:</p>
<ol>
<li>I personally think if NK gets to the king slot they have a better chance to win the game (No data to support that)</li>
<li>I think the tournament meta will benefit more from having less psycho kings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also about Neutral getting more points if they win together is a good idea and I’ll look into it for the next tournament.</p>

            <p>Can you further clarify the rules?</p>
<p>Do you have to survive to the end to get points if your faction wins?<br>
For example, does the original cult leader have to survive for him to get points, or does he get bonus if he does?</p>
