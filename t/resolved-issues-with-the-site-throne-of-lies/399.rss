    <description>What happened: I saw the Dev update video #6 and wanted to join the site https://www.throneoflies.com/ to get the game on steam without having to pay when it will be released.


What was SUPPOSED to happen: I clicked to register button on the site but it gave no response at all, same goes for &quot;Login&quot; button


Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Go to https://www.throneoflies.com/
2. Click to &quot;register&quot; or &quot;Login&quot; button
3. see how they don&#39;t work like they should</description>
