    <title>Scorned TB fail</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/scorned-tb-fail/24995</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Scorned. I don&#39;t see my TB&#39;s appear in chat. Others seem to.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should see my TB.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Get a scorned game and Trollbox someone.

#### Comments: The very first trollbox of the game, i saw, but the rest didn&#39;t show up for me.</description>
