<p>Arctic didn‚Äôt scumread Appel, unlike Gorta, Worse, and me, so that‚Äôs a good look for him right now. He still hasn‚Äôt really done anything wolfy from what I can tell, unless he‚Äôs just really good at evading suspicion, but I still think because of his long D1 push on me and then D2 on Cloned/me, he‚Äôs very much still a townread. I could maybe see him as scum when paired with others, but nothing he‚Äôs posted individually strikes me as scummy.</p>

</aside>
<p>He threw a <em>lot</em> of sus on Gorta for that vote on Silviu. And the thing is, I see a lot of consistency in what Arctic says. He hasn‚Äôt backed off of Gorta and he started out by being sus of everyone, which is probably a better (and less wolfy) way to start off than to trust everyone, unlike what Kiro was doing. As a townie, it‚Äôs not good to trust everyone in the beginning because it not only puts you at risk, but it puts everyone else at risk for your misreads and misvotes. Arctic has been very careful and abstained from all the voting (although that can be a case in itself - he hasn‚Äôt voted on anyone despite pushing).</p>
<p>But in comparison, Gorta, on the other hand, has been inconsistent and we‚Äôve all seen it. Appel commented on it, Cloned mentioned it, and I also brought it up a couple of times (see my post above). I know I‚Äôm not supposed to confbias here, but the level of inconsistency in Gorta‚Äôs statements far exceeds what I see in Arctic‚Äôs statements <em>because I haven‚Äôt caught him being inconsistent without stating his reason for a change of opinion</em>.</p>

<p>He made a good point here, too, imo. Kiro really didn‚Äôt say too much about Gorta and still hasn‚Äôt. Kiro was so totally focused on tunnelling Cloned that he didn‚Äôt give much of an opinion on anyone else, which basically just says to me he was avoiding interaction with the other wolf. On the other hand, I saw Arctic questioning Kiro‚Äôs behavior, but I didn‚Äôt really see Kiro interacting with him, either. So basically, what I draw from this is that Kiro‚Äôs been distancing during the game from his scum partner.</p>

<p>then again what is the likelihood that we have 2 protective PRs?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Once Kiro outed as a protective PR, Arctic changed his mind and decided that the protective PRs were more sus than I was because of the low likelihood of two protectives. This makes me think that <em>if</em> he were scum with Kiro, and we pretty much know at this point Kiro is scum, he wouldn‚Äôt tell Kiro to claim protective PR. He would either tell Kiro to claim some other kind of PR, or he would tell him not to claim PR at all. As Worse pointed out, Kiro could have felt forced to claim PR because I‚Äôm a tracker and would see that he was taking night actions and was therefore not VT, but unless Arctic was setting up a kind of pointless two-day bus on his teammate, this doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.</p>
<p>The point of Kiro claiming protective PR was to throw the sus on Cloned, not me, and Cloned died N2, which blew Kiro‚Äôs cover. If Arctic had really been setting up the bus that long, then he would have to guarantee none of us would ever suspect him and be very meticulous at covering his tracks. And for that matter, he could still bus Kiro but tell him to claim a different type of PR, and not the same type of PR that he was planning to kill N2 because that would defeat the entire purpose of claiming protective PR.</p>
<p>The thing is, if Kiro had claimed investigative, we would have had a tracking chain and probably a role check instead of a protective chain, and while the investigators can track each other, they can‚Äôt kill each other. My being the only investigative claim in the game has made me the ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù target, meaning that the real protective claim was guaranteed to be on me and would have to die first.</p>
<p>But the truth is, Kiro is almost definitely a rolecop. A mafia alignment cop wouldn‚Äôt make sense as we only have two factions in the game, a parity cop wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the same reason, a killer PR would definitely not make sense (and we would have lost by now), and so only a rolecop or a protective would be left. Of course there‚Äôs a chance Kiro could be a mafia doctor, but what‚Äôs the purpose of having a mafia protective if nobody can kill you? Town doesn‚Äôt have a vig or I‚Äôm pretty sure someone would‚Äôve been shot by now.</p>
<p>For that matter, yes, I think Kiro could‚Äôve made a panic claim and just had to claim <em>some</em> kind of moderately feasible PR and hope the game went in his favor and not against him, but I really doubt that Arctic in particular would have advised Kiro to claim protective. As unlikely as it was to have two town protectives, most of us agreed it wasn‚Äôt totally impossible (but also that one of them was fake).</p>

<p>He suspected Gorta more than Appel throughout D2, but also said it was less likely Gorta was scum than Appel based on his earlier reason with Gorta thinking Cloned was protective.</p>
<p><em>But if Kiro was a rolecop, and he checked Cloned and not Arctic as he claimed, I suppose mafia would have known for a fact that Cloned was a bodyguard.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, Kiro immediately said (along with his doctor claim) that he healed Arctic N1 because he thought he was the most likely to be killed. Why did Kiro think Arctic was the most likely to be killed? Would it have made any sense for him to bluff and claim to be on his scum partner as a fake protective as opposed to claiming to be on one of the outed PRs who were, from a town point of view, much more important (sorry VT) and need protecting? Remember that Kiro has also been hard townreading Arctic and not just me, and if Kiro is distancing with his co-scum, this doesn‚Äôt add up.</p>

<p>Maybe he has a good point here, maybe he doesn‚Äôt.

<p>And yet he still questioned why Cloned seemed to prefer voting out Gorta. He didn‚Äôt just go, ‚Äúok we vote out Appel‚Äù because it would have been easy at that point to vote and mislynch. He stopped to question <em>why</em> Cloned would choose Gorta over Appel, and then he himself didn‚Äôt place a vote on either of them. Oddly enough, neither did Kiro because Kiro was so intent on voting Cloned. I feel like if both of them were wolves, one of them would have voted on either Appel (to make the voting go faster and since that‚Äôs where most of the suspicion lay) or one of them would have voted on Gorta (to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that, once Appel flipped town, one of them would be ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù by a vote on the right person). But the fact is that neither of them voted, and the votes on Appel were slow and last-minute, so it‚Äôs not like the wolves would have outed themselves by having one vote on Appel. This basically tells me that only one of Arctic and Kiro could be a wolf because it‚Äôs weird and a bit counterproductive for both to abstain, and we know that to be Kiro. There had to be a wolf pushing on either Appel or Gorta there, and nobody placed a vote on Gorta even for the sake of a townread bonus.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not confbias, at least, since Arctic was also fairly convinced Worse was the remaining scum for multiple reasons. But could Arctic be scum who‚Äôs choosing between framing Gorta and Worse? Why not just pick one instead of being indecisive, unless he‚Äôs really just being meticulous enough to pick the one with the weakest counterarguments?</p>

          <p><s>I literally ISO‚Äôd every single one of his posts I‚Äôm sorry</s></p>
<p>But yeah, basically - I don‚Äôt see any scumslips, I don‚Äôt see any wavering or jumpy opinions/votes without a good explanation, and I really don‚Äôt see anything there that smells like a wolf. Not that I should be talking; I‚Äôm town and I went through the entirety of D1 being wolfy (and even soft admitted I have a tendency to do that) so wolfy behavior isn‚Äôt everything to me.</p>
<p>But I took notes throughout the whole game and I just ISO‚Äôd both Gorta and Arctic, and came up with maybe 1-2 questionable statements at most in Arctic‚Äôs ISO, and a heck of a lot more in Gorta‚Äôs, so I‚Äôll let my interpretation speak for itself. I know confbias is a thing, but I‚Äôm also capable of taking a step back and looking at things a second time. If I read something the first time and immediately think, ‚Äúthis is really towny‚Äù, I‚Äôll go back and analyze later and ask myself, ‚Äúif I were confbiased in thinking this were a wolf instead, how would I interpret it?‚Äù and then write down what I see.</p>
<p>Literally the <em>only</em> way Kiro/Arctic could be a team is if they megadistanced and planned to bus Kiro from the start of the game, but also not too soon, and to give Kiro 3 days to live in order to confirm Arctic as locktown.</p>
<p>Which is, actually, a really elaborate plan and kind of seems like too much work as well as being very risky if Kiro gets bussed D2 for claiming protective being on his scum partner. That‚Äôs just a weird play, but I guess this game has been full of weird plays tbh.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, that‚Äôs another good point. You can totally have a non-pushy wolf, but the other wolf needs to be effectively pushy, and Kiro mostly pushed on his kill target <em>which is not a smart move if your partner isn‚Äôt pushing on anyone at all</em>.</p>

<p>Which is, actually, a really elaborate plan and kind of seems like too much work as well as being very risky if Kiro gets bussed D2 for claiming protective being on his scum partner. That‚Äôs just a weird play, but I guess this game has been full of weird plays tbh.</p>
