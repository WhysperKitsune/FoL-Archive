          <p>Hey, I wrote 2 idea for lore to the Alcoholic. The first one is more simple, while the second is a bit longer and more dramatic.</p>
<ol>
<li>The debauched Alcoholic</li>
</ol>
<p>The Drunk always had control over how much he could handle, but as more of his friends died to either the evils of the kingdom, or the executions of the people, he slowly lost control over the bottle, and it did not go unnoticed. The only thing he ever wanted, was someone who would not judge him for what he was. As the sun falls and the moon rises, he got visited by a friend, someone who said he believed in the Drunk, but only if the gave in to the bottle. The Drunk missed a place where he knew who he could trust and decided to be debauched by the bottle, ironic is it not? As the sun rose, he was a new man, He was an Alcoholic.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Last stand</li>
</ol>
<p>“I was not always like this, I once had a family who believed in me, friends who trusted me and Member of the Royal Blue Dragons. But times change as life passes by, People you thought you knew, suddenly turns out to be traitors, murderers or super naturals creatures. Whenever you found them, it was like you lost a piece of trust to your allies. Too the Blue Dragons”</p>
<p>It had been a long and heartshattering day in court for the Drunk, They hanged his Family without hesitation. As the only royal blood left in the Kingdom other than the king, the Drunk was alone, he turned to the bottle as he always does, but this night it was different. As he realized he was alone, the only friend he had left was the bottle. As he was finishing his second bottle it knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“I’m in sorrow, leave me alone”</p>
<p>“I know how you feel, the feeling of guilt and anger too your own faction for killing they own. But you can help us avenge the death of them”</p>
<p>Influenced by the sheer force of the 2 bottles of rum, he responded:</p>
<p>“What do you offer?”</p>
<p>As the Drunk said the words a letter was slit under the door.</p>
<p>It was a letter with a black rose on it</p>
<hr>
<p>Quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>My English is not good so they will be spelling mistakes</li>
<li>The lore is not perfect but it hangs together</li>
<li>If you have any suggestion or feedback I’ll happily take it</li>
</ul>
