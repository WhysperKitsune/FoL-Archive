    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorcerer-buff-rework/56048</link>
    <description>Was thinking about this - the deck is really stacked against Sorcerer. They need to get rid of Inquisitor, since the Inquisitor is their biggest threat... but doing so tips the hand that the Sorcerer is in play. They also either have to hit Inquisitor twice, or hope someone else hits Inq same night as they do. So, I had a thought - it makes Circle more powerful, but also requires the sorc to survive a bit longer. 

Circle of Death (Activates N5; 2 charges) - The Sorcerer creates a Circle of Death, unleashing a barrage of magical energy that randomly targets three players, bypassing healing, guards, and death immunity. 

It doesn&#39;t make them a direct threat to the Inquisitor, but it does make them a threat that can wipe out 6 players in 2 nights, dunno if it can be coded to favour BD/Neuts over Unseen/Cult.</description>

            <p>As long as it isn’t RNG it isn’t truly luck. And just because it is often random doesn’t mean it always is.</p>
<p>This is especially true with limiting Ability’s such as CoD where the ability is usually used deliberately.</p>

            <p>I can understand that - and the only reason I made it RNG is because of how powerful it is - I figured ticking off 3 numbers would be a little much, especially if the Inquisitor/Prince is outted. I do think a lot of the game - barring, you know, catching logs that don’t match up, is still luck based as much as skill. Drunk is a fairly decent example, as they’re just throwing out Debauch and occasionally hitting a target.</p>

            <p>Generally RNG in abilities isn’t good for the game, as it turns from skill to luck in how the game turns out. I wouldn’t be in favour of Circle being changed like this.</p>
