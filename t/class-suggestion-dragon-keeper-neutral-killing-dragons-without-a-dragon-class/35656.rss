    <title>[Class Suggestion] Dragon Keeper (Neutral Killing, Dragons without a Dragon class.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-dragon-keeper-neutral-killing-dragons-without-a-dragon-class/35656</link>
    <description>**Dragon Keeper**

Portrait: Bootleg Daenerys. :) Maybe a red-haired, fiery warrior woman with a young dragon on her shoulder? Gotta have them crazy eyes.

Since there are questions about how a &quot;Dragon&quot; class could work - what about a &quot;Mother of Dragons&quot; who uses their pets as weapons to attain power?

Passive 1:
**Royal Blood** - As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. (Should this class become Neutral or Psycho King?)

Passive 2: [GIANT DRAGON FANGS ICON]
**Lizard Food** - Every two players you kill will give you one additional use of your “Iron Drake” day ability. Gotta keep your pets fed for them to perform!

Day Ability: [IRON WINGS ICON]
**Iron Drake** - You will be immune from death the following night, also curing Bleeding/Poison. (2 uses, recharged with “Lizard Food” passive.)

Night Ability 1: [FIREBALL ICON]
**Flame Drake** - Choose a player to kill. Visitors to your target are Wisped to you. [You see the visitors to target.] (Unlimited uses.)

Night Ability 2: [FROST CLOUD ICON]
**Frost Drake** - Choose a player to kill. Other players will be prevented from visiting your target. [Prevents saving/watching target, etc.] (2 uses.)

Lore:
As the fairy tale goes, a valiant prince must save a princess from the dragon. No one saved this princess, so she befriended her captors and became a trusted caregiver to the offspring of its kind. Now, she has returned to make the kingdom remember her name.</description>

            <p>That might be correct but playing alone is by far harder than playing in a faction.</p>

            <p>There are only 3 Neutral Killing classes… compare that to the ton of BD/Unseen/Cult classes and number of NK can’t be the problem…</p>

            <p>I feel in general having too many neutral Killer classes around is not really helping the game progress and makes it even harder for new players to get into the game.</p>

            <p>Neutral Killers without permanent death immunity tend to be fairly weak, but the additional of Flame/Frost drake effects as well as Lizard Food do somewhat offset the balance. However, since Frost Drake is already limited uses, I would make it either occupy the target as well, or prevent visits to the target rather than occupying visitors, just to make it a little bit more powerful.</p>
