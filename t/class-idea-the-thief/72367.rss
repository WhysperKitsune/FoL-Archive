            <p>i agree peaple would want to kill him. BD cult unseen nk all of em prehaps a wincon like steal X things with an ability and make it so they acutally lose a charge of the abillity if possible so he is a little more harmefull and therefore a little less passive in the game and you can edit secret stash to in edition return all stolen charges or to just return the stolen charges</p>
