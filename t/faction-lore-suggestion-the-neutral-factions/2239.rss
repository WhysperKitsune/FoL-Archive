    <title>[Faction Lore Suggestion] The Neutral Factions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-lore-suggestion-the-neutral-factions/2239</link>
    <description>&quot;For all of our lives, we&#39;ve been ignored. But NOW, they will pay attention to us, as we have all the power now... They will finally acknowledge us as members of the court... But we don&#39;t only want that, we intend to overthrow the Blue Dragon, whom are always focusing on killing the Unseen. We must become leaders of the court! They will eternally regret messing with us!&quot;

This is rumored to have been said during one of their meetings, however, nobody knows for sure, as the scout we sent disappeared the following night.</description>
