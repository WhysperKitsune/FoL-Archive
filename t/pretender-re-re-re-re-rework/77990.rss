</aside>
<p>Uh…? what?</p>
<ol>
<li>why can it be delayed but not healed? delays are a form of healing this is confusing and annoying, I already dislike that Physician/Chronomancer are randomly more useful/less useful depending what NK spawns this would be even worse.</li>
<li>how does this benefit Pret? I’m guessing they might get A extra vote upon becoming king</li>

</aside>
<p>Why is this not usable until N4? this is stupid kings will just guard n4/n5 by n6 pretender has a half and half chance that their will be 6+ players left not including the kills on that night and eks can easily avoid this by N6.</p>

</aside>
<p>Haha here’s the problems, too many intensive to side bd, you know what they say, all neuts side bd.</p>
<p>Anyway this just lets pretender act like current pret with a less better invest ability prets are still going to out and guess what bd aren’t going to care, still let them win aslong as they keep their promise not to attack.</p>
<p>Pretender isn’t going to ever work with a “survive as neutral king”</p>

            <p>Seems too OP. Too much kill power with the bleed ability, and the usurper passive combined with dirty blood is OP. You’re basically guaranteed king when you step late game.</p>
