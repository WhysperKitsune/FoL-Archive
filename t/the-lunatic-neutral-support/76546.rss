    <title>The Lunatic (Neutral Support)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-lunatic-neutral-support/76546</link>
    <description># For many years, The Lunatic has searched for someone to burn the world down. After leaving the cult for their fanatic obsession with two all-powerful gods, he now helps someone who will see the world burn, starting with Adiart.

&gt; # The Lunatic (Neutral Support)
&gt;
&gt; ## Passives:
&gt;
&gt; **Fanatic:** Always death immune when being attacked by the Neutral Killer. Not death immune if attacked by other killers
&gt; **Insanity:** Occupy and Redirect immune.

&gt; ## Day Abilities:
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability 1:** [I don&#39;t have any ideas for a day ability yet]
&gt; **Day Ability 2:** [I don&#39;t have any ideas for a day ability yet]
&gt;
&gt; **Suicide (Inf use, always able to be used):** Sacrifice yourself to give the Neutral Killer an Empowerment based on their class (See Notes)

&gt; ## Night Abilites:
&gt;
&gt; **Helping Hand (1-3 uses):** Help the Neutral Killer by giving them a small empowerment (See Notes)
&gt; **Fanatic Killing (1-3 uses):** The Neutral Killer will kill their target(s), bypassing triggering protective classes, Death Immunity, Jail, and Occupation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Suicide (Inf use, always able to be used):** Sacrifice yourself to give the Neutral Killer an Empowerment based on their class: (See Notes)

&gt; ## Notes:
&gt; **Effects of Suicide:**
&gt; Reaper - You lose half a soul when being attacked + gain an additional soul.
&gt; Possessor - Gain 1 use of Possess, and whenever you possess someone you choose what the exhume results will be
&gt; Sorcerer - Walking Bomb bypasses Healing and you will be able to transfer a bomb onto the king
&gt;
&gt;**Effects of Helping Hand:** 
&gt; Reaper - The Target&#39;s body will fall in 2 days rather than in 1 day.
&gt; Possessor - You will also kill the person you use to kill the other person.
&gt; Sorcerer - Your Magic Missile will bypass healing, and any knights on your target will attack them instead of you.
&gt;
&gt; The Lunatic will always know who and what the Neutral Killer is, but not vice versa.
&gt;
&gt; The Lunatic&#39;s Wincon is to have the Neutral Killer win the game.
&gt;
&gt; If The Lunatic becomes the King, they automatically become the Psycho King, keeping their previous goal.

<p>When a reaper reaps someone they die and are effectively taken out of the game. However since they are still seen as alive to others then they could be executed AND the majority to get someone on trial stays the same while if the person was seen as dead it wouldn’t. This is why reaper wins in a 3 v 1 if it reaps someone that night because The reaper can’t be placed on trial due to majority being 3 and there’s only being 2 other people</p>
