    <description>Prove It!

A list of things than can be really proven ,

Noble Can prove with whispers only in cult game , or a game where the assassin died the previous night . or a game where a mm has died post turn 3 and another unseen has also died since mm died . 

Priest . A priest claim can be verified by a lack of counter claim . Priest is always present and always BD . A priest can also confirm himself by ensuring that he lets who he resurrects know his number prior to resurrection . 

Prince . A prince claim can be verified by a lack of a counter claim . Its usual in prince claims to allow the prince to live and then the real prince to jail the claimer , this protects the prince from identification.

Knight . A knight cannot be confirmed 

Psychic. Can be confirmed using a psychic message only in cult game  or a game where the assasin died the previous night . or a game where a mm has died post turn 3 and another unseen has also died since mm died . 
Can also be confirmed if allowed to live for the next day to send mind link to specific players etc. , although this can be exploited by an overnight conversion.

Princess . Can only be confirmed by sending an overnight Will o Wisp to a trusted source . Although this can be exploited by an overnight conversion, this can although back fire on mm, cult leader. It is possible an evil could also occupy the princess stopping the wisp . 
 
Butler . In very late game against cult you can prove yourself to a good king by poisoning them . Also possible early on if you are confident that there is a healer . 

Mercenary . Very easy to prove with either guarding target or offering contract . Only valid though if the contracted is proven . 

Hunter can be proved if no hunter counter claim and proof of a wolf attack on a proven source .</description>
