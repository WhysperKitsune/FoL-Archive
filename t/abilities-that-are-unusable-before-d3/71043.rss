    <title>Abilities that are unusable before D3</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/abilities-that-are-unusable-before-d3/71043</link>
    <description>Personally, I dislike the concept of locking an ability until a certain time period.  I think it&#39;s a very clunky solution to balance and gamethrowing problems.  I also think evils should be able to target themselves and their allies with all of their abilities. 

In some niche cases, a killer can predict he will be swapped with his target and himself.  At the moment you&#39;re only counter is to do nothing (if you&#39;re Assassin or Cult Leader) or attack anyway and just hope you&#39;re not swapped (if you&#39;re NK). 

This is especially annoying if you&#39;re trying to convert someone and know you will be swapped with yourself.  Of course it&#39;s a niche case, but still.  

Regarding the main topic, which is abilities like Prince exe, Knight CS, and Smite not being usable until N3.  It&#39;s very annoying to jail someone acting like a Fool N1, because now you&#39;ve got a confirmed evil in prison but you have no way to kill him safely for 2 more days. 

Knight CS.  If three people claim alchemist D1, why shouldn&#39;t he be able to coldsteel the most suspicious of them?  Just because it&#39;s D1 doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make a judgment on which is the most suspicious.  And it&#39;s **very** often you find an evil D2 who might be a Fool but the Knight still can&#39;t kill him for another day. 

Paladin Smite.  I admit that locking Smite until N3 was a **VERY** good move balance-wise.  However I still feel uncomfortable with it and feel there are better solutions.  Such as letting Smite be used any night but not usable again if you miss with it.</description>

<p>Agreed, the new maid spy discourages whispering too much.  And the old maid spy wasn’t really that bad, it just needed to work like sheriff’s scout(meaning it remains until you change targets)</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Smite would be even worse without the lock.</p>

<p>I agree.  I don’t like the lock but I think it should stay unless a better solution is found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paladin is already a boring class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Paladin is fun because of Smite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about yolo smites?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yolo smites are unlikely to work, if by yolo you mean random.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the very least it shouldn’t affect both the paladin and their target.</p>

<p>I think it used to be like that, but was changed probably because all Paladins only ever used it on themselves. And it wasn’t fun to smite someone only to get converted yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can kill the CL without you even knowing who the CL is. You shouldn’t be able to kill scum like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it would be worth considering forcing the Paladin to correctly identify the Cult Leader in order to kill him with Smite.  But I do think Smite is very low on the list of abilities that need changing.  I would rather Maid Spy be reverted but usable on King.</p>

            <p>And here’s another issue:  It’s a bit redundant since we already have physician for dealing with attackers.  Heal is better than defend overall.  Sure, defend can kill attackers, but it only works twice, only affects visitors, and doesn’t protect against poison/bleed.   We should only have one main class for protecting against attackers.</p>

            <p>They do need a bit of a rework, but they can be tricked by possessor.  There’s no way to trick smite.  All abilities should have a way to trick them and/or have risk involved.  Bear should just be changed so it’s one use but kills all visitors.  I’m not sure what to do with defend though.</p>

            <p>It is though.  Defend and bear can kill possessed players(though defend does need a bit of a rework.  It isn’t that rewarding currently).  Unless you’re talking about magic missile, but that’s scum so it’s fine.</p>

            <p>Direct killer/offensive ability’s for sure. However smite isn’t even the only risk free killer ability.</p>

            <p>Alright, but offensive/killer abilities should still have risk involved.  It’s why the old cold steel needed changing.</p>
