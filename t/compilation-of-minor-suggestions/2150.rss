    <description>1) **Put a cap on the amount of trials that can take place in one day** (4). This is because I have been in many games where ten trials take place and game takes forever from it. If you don&#39;t want to, another option is for each trial that does not end in execution to subtract 10-15 seconds from the remaining day&#39;s time.

2) **More easily claimable classes** for evils. At this point, there are so few good/neutral roles that cannot be confirmed that they are often executed on the spot. Butler, alchemist, princess can all be confirmed easily. Right now, claim space is mostly two: Observer/knight, both of which are convert able, and both of which are often executed on the spot without any other evidence.

3) **Increase duration of distract** (distract someone who is about to be voted) (silent first half of defense) (claims distracted) (did nothing but confirm there is a live assassin)

4) **Day ability for mastermind** This is less about balance and more about mastermind being incredibly boring

5) **Change priest to bishop** but change no mechanics of the priest; it makes more sense for a bishop to be in the royal court than a priest</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>actually, it is. each trial takes around a minute (correct me if i am wrong). I have been in games with about 8 trials in one day; that is 8 minutes needlessly tacked on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly feel like you’re exaggerating here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am trying to make sure that when roles are added, a decent number are hard-to-confirm blue dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only real <strong><em>Class</em></strong> that’s easily confirmed is Psychic. All the others have decent enough counters to be Unseen and ‘confirmed’ BD. Exhume/Unearth - Butler/Servant - CW/Sage</p>
<p>Aside Psychic and maybe Princess, nothing is entirely easy to confirm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rephrase: Cult wins so few of the times that I don’t even need to keep track to figure out that it is imbalanced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you keep track, you’d know things rather than going by your unreliable claim of “I don’t even need to keep track” - I have kept track. Majority of my games, Cult have won. Reliable source: My well written stats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From what I have seen, distract often edges players to consider the player more innocent, unless they were accused of being a neutral killer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distract is fine as it is. I don’t see there needing to be a change to it… it’s situational.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rephrase: non-servant evil classes can’t claim butler and expect to live long because of black wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, claiming Butler as Servant is your best tactic… it’s also common sense. If you claim anything else then you’re going to have a hard time convincing everyone you’re good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of having to add an entire new class just for evil players o be able to claim, the developers can instead just remove black wine to make butler a scum claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…If Butler and Servant can both Black wine, it’s already a scum claim… remove Black Wine from Butler and suddenly Butler claims becomes sus when it’s used…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only practicality it serves is to confirm the alchemist. Otherwise, it has no purpose and is entirely random.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LEAVE THE FUCKING ALCHEMIST ALONE <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/62b2837fb39a78fc23b9e62e362c58ec1284c79b.png?v=9" title=":alchemist:" class="emoji emoji-custom" alt=":alchemist:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Cult needs a buff I agree. A few months back when Knight/Princess/Butler had day abilities evil literally had no claim space. Now it is slightly better, and with the introduction of Scourge (or whatever it’s called) we should see BD make harder decisions over lynching.</p>
<p>Evils can claim Physicican, Merc, Priest, Knight, Observer, Princess, CW/Butler if prepared with other evils. I agree this is not loads, but I think it is not TOO bad.</p>
<p>I’d like to see Psychic nerfed cuz atm she OP as heck with the insta-confirmation and investigative ability in one but other than that I think everything is pretty balanced.</p>
<p>In FoL we have Squire which adds a lot of balance to Unseen claims as he is immune and can’t prove himself, so he is a good claim for Immune evils. I’d like to see him added at some point to main game as he is simple yet helps evils significantly.</p>

<p>Classes* they’re not roles. This is a balance thing and will be worked on during Beta. Also, scum claim space is mostly fine in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cult and Mastermind don’t need day abilities. Also, I’ve somewhat kept track of Cult/BD wins. I’ve had more Cult wins personally than I have BD. Same with Unseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distract is fine as it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No. Black Wine is great, because it allows you to still use your abilities while not Occupying someone that might be Sheriff or another BD investigative class. Also, Classes. There are no roles here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely not, Alchemist blur is fine, Neutral confirming themselves is honestly their only way of survival, and you’d be screwing over an Alchemist if you remove his blur, plus, he only gets 2 anyway.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Put a cap on the amount of trials that can take place in one day</strong> (4). This is because I have been in many games where ten trials take place and game takes forever from it. If you don’t want to, another option is for each trial that does not end in execution to subtract 10-15 seconds from the remaining day’s time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More easily claimable classes</strong> for evils. At this point, there are so few good/neutral roles that cannot be confirmed that they are often executed on the spot. Butler, alchemist, princess can all be confirmed easily. Right now, claim space is mostly two: Observer/knight, both of which are convert able, and both of which are often executed on the spot without any other evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase duration of distract</strong> (distract someone who is about to be voted) (silent first half of defense) (claims distracted) (did nothing but confirm there is a live assassin)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Day ability for mastermind</strong> This is less about balance and more about mastermind being incredibly boring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change priest to bishop</strong> but change no mechanics of the priest; it makes more sense for a bishop to be in the royal court than a priest</p>
</li>
