    <title>Dying players not indicated as dead on player list</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/dying-players-not-indicated-as-dead-on-player-list/9798</link>
    <description>#### What happened:
As the game went on and players were killed, some started talking in Graveyard chat but were still showing up as alive. I assumed this was a reaper but it happened to two players in one night. There was also no reaper in the game. 

#### What was supposed to happen:
Dead players indicated in red. 

#### Steps to reproduce: 
No clue

#### Comments: 
Apparently I can&#39;t upload an attachment
can I post the log somewhere?</description>
