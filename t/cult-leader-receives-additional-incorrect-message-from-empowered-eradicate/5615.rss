    <title>Cult Leader receives additional incorrect message from empowered Eradicate</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/cult-leader-receives-additional-incorrect-message-from-empowered-eradicate/5615</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
This all occurred on the same night:
-Player A (me) was the Cult Leader
-Player B was a Ritualist who used Strength of Corax
-Player A Eradicated Player C
-Player D (I believe a Physician) visited Player C
-Player A receives the same message that Player D received. I don&#39;t recall exactly what that message said (sorry!) -- it was whatever message pops up when you visit a player affected by empowered Eradicate -- something to the effect of &quot;You were attacked while visiting...&quot;

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Player A should not have received the message that they were attacked, because they were not actually attacked.

#### Steps to reproduce:
-Have a Ritualist use Strength of Corax on a target
-Have the Cult Leader Eradicate that target
-Have someone else visit that target the same night
-Compare the messages that the Cult Leader and the visitor receive.

#### Comments:
Apologies for not taking a screenshot. I didn&#39;t think of it at the time. :frowning:</description>
