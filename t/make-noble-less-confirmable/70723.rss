    <title>Make Noble less confirmable</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-noble-less-confirmable/70723</link>
    <description>At the moment, a Noble can prove he is not Apostle by throwing an extra vote to execute or pardon.  I propose we mitigate this confirmability by hiding the notification of the extra vote unless it actually decides the fate of the person on trial (hide it from the public, but let the Noble himself still receive a notification that his double vote was cast just so he knows it wasn&#39;t glitched or anything.  Like, &quot;You cast an extra vote to pardon.&quot;)

I think it&#39;s easy to see what I&#39;m suggesting but here&#39;s a couple of examples just in case I wasn&#39;t clear.

&gt; **EXHIBIT A:** 
&gt; Bob, Jim and the Noble vote to execute the person on the stand.  The Noble cast a second execute vote, but since this had no affect on the outcome of the trial, only the Noble got a notification that he cast an extra vote.  

&gt; **EXHIBIT B:** 
&gt; Bob and Jim vote to execute the person on the stand.  But the Noble cast two votes to pardon, resulting in a tie and therefore pardon.  Everybody gets a notification that a second vote was cast to pardon. 

This would improve the game in two ways.  First, it would prevent Nobles from proving they are not Apostles in Cult Games.  Second, it would mitigate the risk involved for an Aristocrat throwing a suspicious extra vote that is likely to have no effect on the outcome of the trial anyway.  

So say the Aristocrat wants to try to pardon the publicly confirmed Mastermind with an extra pardon vote.  Now he can do so reasonably safely, since if the Mastermind gets executed despite the Aristocrat&#39;s two votes to pardon, there is no proof the Aristocrat voted to pardon him.</description>

            <p>Good point.  Also, what if a Fool (or anyone else) refused to cooperate?  You can’t know if everyone cooperated so this sort of test would be extremely unreliable.</p>

            <p>That comes with a pretty hefty cost though, namely even if it is an apostle they had to mislynch to prove it (rather than the current system in which they can use a vote in which there is no reasonable assumption that it will be close as a harmless test)</p>

            <p>Well there would be some trials where votes don’t add up, I suppose it’s not that bad, it would introduce some courtroom drama of people arguing over the vote tally, something that doesn’t currently exist in the game</p>

            <p>Yeah, if 2 people vote exe and a third (the noble) casts two votes to pardon, without the notification it will show:</p>
<p>2 exe votes<br>
1 pardon vote</p>
<p>Yet the person will get pardoned, this will look like a bug when it’s really the double pardon from the noble deciding the outcome, so we have got to show the notification publicly in these situations</p>
