    <title>[Survey] How to make it easier for 1st-time players of the genre?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/survey-how-to-make-it-easier-for-1st-time-players-of-the-genre/2149</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not talking about people that&#39;s played other Werewolf/Mafia games, I&#39;m talking about someone COMPLETELY new to the genre: 

We have some issues where new players completely skip the &quot;Learn to Play&quot; buttons (Class Cards + Guide), play the game, and not know what to do. While some players will keep playing to learn more, others may quit being super confused (and still not look at the guide/class cards :stuck_out_tongue: ). **What can we do to help the new user experience?**

If you were _completely_ new to the genre, which of these methods of learning (if we were to &quot;throw it in your face&quot; for the first time playing) would be USEFUL, while not being ANNOYING? There&#39;s definitely a fine-line. We want to educate new players to &quot;at least know the basics&quot; before jumping in **so they aren&#39;t overwhelmed**. 

After all, 35+ classes and meta tactics while learning the game can be both intimidating and confusing for a new player! We want to force some type of tutorial (either a 1-click &quot;want to play?&quot; or something guided), but how far should we go?

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=6]
* First-time entering lobby, popup &quot;Learn to Play?&quot; option
* When anyone enters a room, 1st line of chat says &quot;Learn to Play while waiting (top-right)&quot; reminder
* First-time entering lobby, force a guided tutorial to the &quot;Learn to Play&quot; buttons
* Show one-time, guided popups PER-CLASS, in-game.
* Offer an offline tutorial of an &quot;ideal game&quot; as a simple class.
* Other....? Comment below, if you check this
[/poll]

^ Check as many as you believe you&#39;d actually be encouraged to do without finding it annoying.</description>

            <p>I meant so that the entire chat (and any stream snipers there) can’t see the streamer’s class<br>
They can turn it on in when not streaming, and they could always just not turn it off<br>
Plus I believe there’s a built-in tutorial for the first 3 games now</p>

            <p>I’d say for streamers it’s every bit as important if not more important. Streamers, youtubers etc… they should still either have played enough to know what they are doing, or learn what they are doing while streaming. If anything it’s more important for them to be familiar with the game, as they are already sacrificing a portion of their focus to give some entertainment to their audience.</p>
<p>It doesn’t give the game any good advertising having a guy get on “I have no idea what I’m doing, oops I killed my team haha, ooh look how mad everyone is”.</p>

            <p>Here are the things it took me a while to see as a new player</p>
<ol>
<li>You could get more info about your class by clicking on your portrait</li>
<li>First game I played I got jailed first time and got claim! typed at me . I had no idea what that meant and no idea that the guy could just kill me if he wanted to , and no idea that as a BD I could be honest with the prince and that if I was evil I should have a convincing lie prepared.</li>
<li>The importance of my journal was lost on me for the first few games and some people call it a will ( I think , unless this is something different, I suspect this might be a Town of Salem thing )<br>
4 . Acronyms  : As a fluid community game their are a lot of acronym’s used and a list of those would be useful . Older players forget that newbies have no idea that when a sherrif says that a player was NS what.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess you learn these things as you go a long when you quickly get lynched for not claiming to a psy etc but guidance on how not to look suspicious when you have nothing to hide .</p>
<p>Loading screen Tips !!! loading screens are a great place for Tips , people will read your tips if you put them on the loading screen as they cant be doing anything more fun whilst the game is loading . Some people will skip tutorials to get to the “fun stuff” .</p>
<p>What would be a really cool loading screen would be one that would show your class and class abilities as soon as they are determined .</p>
<p>Not sure at what stage the game knows what class you are but if its determined  pre loading screen and your loading screen tells you your class and abilities that would really give people a chance to familiarise themselves with the roles.</p>

<ol>
<li>Initially a player is given the option to complete a tutorial.<br>
2.If they refuse, and some of the statistics show lacking gameplay for the first 10 games, then they are reminded of the tutorial.</li>
<li>If they refuse again and their statistics for 30 games are bad, or if they initially refused and their first 10 games gave horrible statistics, then the tutorial is being forced upon them before they can continue playing.</li>

            <p>I agree. Optional tutorials are good. (On initial login perhaps)<br>
However, if someone statistically hasn’t played for a certain amount of time, or hasn’t played before then make it more recommended perhaps.</p>
<p>I personally think that a button which links to guides would be great too as then it allows people who aren’t confident, even if they don’t want a full on tutorial, to clarify some things.</p>
<p>For example player 1 has not played for a few weeks -&gt; Recommended tutorial (Still optional) pops up<br>
Player 2 has not played before<br>
-&gt; Recommended tutorial (Still optional) pops up<br>
Player 3 is experienced and has played recently<br>
-&gt; Tutorial pops up</p>
<p>Tutorial shows roles, buttons linked to the guides, different game modes (Explains differences)</p>
<p>Even include links to the forums and discord on the front page perhaps so that players know what’s available?</p>
