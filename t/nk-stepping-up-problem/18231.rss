    <title>NK Stepping up problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/nk-stepping-up-problem/18231</link>
    <description>Can we talk about how the NK needs to not be able to step up for king. Evil needs NK just like NK needs evil. When they announce they are poss and step up d4 it severely hinders the evil faction and puts them at a disadvantage. Now it&#39;s 12 or so bd, 1 or 2 scorned types, and some evil by d4 when he steps up. NK king always sides BD. Scorned wins always side BD. Inquisitors and mercs obviously side BD. Alch 95% of the time sides BD. 

It really a bad meta where everyone defaults to helping the BD. Maybe because it&#39;s hard to know exactly who is evil and no-one wants to take a chance and get putted for wanting to side evil. 

Anyone feel this?</description>

            <p>3 Jump possessors just suck to deal with. NKs really help the KPN which evil faction needs to win, but I agree - the best thing would be to remove the king’s invest powers - that is what kills the NK most.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s the problem with NKs right now.They are underpowered.Reaper dies really easily as he consumes souls like a madman so he will just die to constant attacks.Possessor can’t do anything with double psychics.Also NKs get investigated by kings ALOT and when you claim alch on stand they execute.Therefore to stop NKs from being king you would want NKs to get a buff.Preferably in the invest catagory(King shouldn’t be able to invest but maybe I have shit luck)The NKs kill ratio is fine.The other problem is with 2 psychics being possible possessor can never make a safe jump therefore resulting in a very unfun experience. Also once people become aware there is a reaper they stay aware.Also if evils need NKs so much why would they out them in Death Notes constantly.NKs becoming king is a strat.The other flaw with the plan is well what if BD are actual dicks?What if they just don’t vote you up and execute you later?This also happens a lot.The main downside to this for the BD is they lose the utility of lets say a sheriff just to execute you.I personally see nothing wrong with the strat because NKs are super underpowered right now,I would as a suggestion make it so reaper only consumes 1 soul upon death and possessor gets either 3 jumps or a way to deal with immunes.</p>

            <p>This is a major issue that impacts at least half of my games.</p>
<p>The NK is literally allowed to change their win condition, and doing so gives a huge advantage to the BD. Also, it’s very unfair to the player who is the original King, as the Reaper can just kill them whenever they want.</p>
<p>Becoming Neutral King should not be the primary goal for NK.</p>
<p>Please make it so NK simply can’t step up as King.</p>

Not being able to step up would serve as indicator(“They stepped up. They cannot be King”). No.</p>

<p>Any of those things works, but making them go from “I have to kill everyone else” to “I can literally afk if I really want to” to win is silly.</p>

            <p>Making any NK besides Sorc Evil King allows the Neutral Killer to team up with the Unseen/cult when time comes. No thank you. If NK gets King, then they should be simply a King who only wins with himself and other neutrals.</p>

            <p>I’m really starting to get triggered by nk settping up for king it is such a bullshit way to screw up the game for a lot of ppl. Imagine scorned, fool, evil faction how they get screwed in the process when nk easily just slide in the king slot and goes on his way and BD just magically forgive him.</p>
<p>THIS NEEDS TO CHANGED.</p>
<p>What I suggest is either prevent nk from stepping up or simply make nk become evil king then he wouldn’t be able to step annouce he’s nk and auto gets the position when his original goal is to kill everyone ! (which is pretty evil in itself)</p>

            <p>Lol I feel the pain a lot of little things like this ruining the game for people. Only the hardcore fans will play through which is fine but they don’t pay the bills. Something will give eventually if you can stick around. They have let thengame get away from being social deduction. Although whay can they truly do to meta gamers unless it’s in the TOS and bannable.</p>

            <p>Id like to venture a guess and say NK win rate is near 5% if that.</p>

            <p>I tend to kill the starting King ASAP as nk, then work from there. I sometimes become king if unseen/cult are getting rekt.</p>
<p>I won a possessor game jumping in time for a last 3 players standing with no king situation.</p>

            <p>I have better luck with Possessor, but double psychics does make it really hard when it pops up.</p>
<p>I like NK games, it’s a fun and rare challenge most of the time, but most people just take the easy win/quick loss.</p>

            <p>I have done it to as NK. It’s because right now NKs can’t win unless BD are extremely dumb and evil don’t help which is rare OR you play the late game and do nothing until turn 6. Very very very rarely do NKs win and when they do it’s reaper everytime. I was poss in a game with two psychics…how the fuck am I suppose to jump with that shit.</p>
<p>It’s a terrible strat and doesn’t aid deduction at all. Needs to go.</p>

            <p>I hate the practice.  I loathe it, in fact.</p>
<p>I had a game where the NK killed the king, then called themselves out.  I was Butler.  I poisoned him and just chain occupied the alchemist, but a drunk ended up deb me so he didn’t die.</p>
<p>It needs to be changed, because it basically hands a win to BD every time and almost half the games seem to have a NK angling to do this.  They kill the King, then they declare themselves NK and everyone votes them up, then BD wins.</p>

            <p>Can we talk about how the NK needs to not be able to step up for king. Evil needs NK just like NK needs evil. When they announce they are poss and step up d4 it severely hinders the evil faction and puts them at a disadvantage. Now it’s 12 or so bd, 1 or 2 scorned types, and some evil by d4 when he steps up. NK king always sides BD. Scorned wins always side BD. Inquisitors and mercs obviously side BD. Alch 95% of the time sides BD.</p>
<p>It really a bad meta where everyone defaults to helping the BD. Maybe because it’s hard to know exactly who is evil and no-one wants to take a chance and get putted for wanting to side evil.</p>
<p>Anyone feel this?</p>
