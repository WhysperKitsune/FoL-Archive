    <title>Make a psycho king night immune</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/make-a-psycho-king-night-immune/36924</link>
    <description>It&#39;s hard to win as a NK to begin with.  It&#39;s also very hard for a NK to become the king.  And it&#39;s [i]especially[/i] hard to win as a Psycho King.

Therefore, I suggest replacing the Psycho King&#39;s tenacity with Psychotic Tenacity, which grants all the usual benefits and also makes them immune to being killed at night (but not to poison or bleeding, so a butler can still get them.)  This wouldn&#39;t carry any real risk of outing the king, since they can simply claim to have guarded.

It&#39;d also prevent election as the Psycho King from being a downgrade, since currently the NKs that become the Psycho King are mostly night immune anyway.

Possibly, Psycho Kings should also have unlimited uses of guards, for the same reason.  It&#39;s already difficult to become the king as an NK, and any town foolish enough to make that mistake deserves to suffer a bit.</description>

<p>This was p much the intent behind the original suggestion. You shouldn’t need to not kill to guard yourself. If you’re concerned this is “overpowered”, don’t elect the NK as King lol</p>

<p>Psycho king’s guards should also have a different name, different abilities should not have the same name.  Executioner could work.</p>
