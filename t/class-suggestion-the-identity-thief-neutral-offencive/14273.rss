    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Identity thief - Neutral Offencive</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-identity-thief-neutral-offencive/14273</link>
    <description>This Idea may seem a little weird but hear me out

&gt;Identity thief - Neutral Offensive
Passive: Locked - If you die then your disguise will not change or be removed for the rest of the game
Day ability: Disguise - Chose someone to disguise as. If you are investigated you will appear as the person you disguised as. If you die you will be shown as having their class. You may only disguise as 1 player at a time and your disguise is removed if they die (Unlimited. Can be used at any time in the day kinda like jail)
Night ability 1: Lure - Redirect anyone visiting the disguised player to you (Unlimited)
Night ability 2: Mimic - Read the journal of the disguised player (3 uses)
Goal: Ensure that the disguised player loses

Note: If the disguised player dies before you do then you need to get another one. If they die after you than nothing happens.

How meany uses of Mimic does this class really need anyway?</description>

            <p>Yeah I mean, the disguised player that need to lose works the same way whether he dies, executed or lose against opposing majority.</p>
<p>Almost itâ€™s target like Scorned you must survive to see him in any means necessary to that target removed from the game.</p>
