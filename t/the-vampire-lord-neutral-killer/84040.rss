    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-vampire-lord-neutral-killer/84040</link>
    <description>Revised edition

&gt; **The Vampire Lord**
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; Undead: Immune to death (at night) and bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day Abilities:**
&gt; **Puppet**  (infinite uses): Switch between speaking as yourself, and speaking as your Thrall. Can be used an unlimited number of times during the day. You can vote when speaking as your Thrall.
&gt; **Desecrate** (2 uses): Your Thrall will appear as another class when they die tonight. (as opposed to the class that they actually were, if this ability is not used the Thrall will still flip as their original class)
&gt; 
&gt; **Night Abilities**:
&gt; **Enthrall**  (infinite uses): Attack target player, turning them into a Thrall. You will have access to their logs, and can write in night actions. The Thrall will die the following night. (Will fail if target is healed or delayed, as if they were attacked. Thrall death is unhealable.) *Does not count as visiting
&gt; **Command Thrall** (2 uses): Target your Thrall, using it to kill 2 people, as well keeping as keeping the Thrall alive for one more night.
&gt; 
&gt; (Thralls are quasi-reaped, the VL can talk through them with Puppet if he chooses to.)
&gt; If a Thrall is executed on trial, they will appear as a Thrall. Thralls have no night abilities, as they are technically classed as dead.</description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Iteration]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just to be clear, the Thrall player is dead, right? They cannot do anything, so they should just be dead.</p>
<p>Also to word the Enthrall so it doesn’t convert death immune targets (would be awkward if you could actually kill the MM through this by making him a thrall).<br>
"Attack target player. If they die, you raise them as a thrall.</p>
<p>For a neutral killer this one doesn’t hold much power over the court unlike Reaper and Possessor. Sorc got a “get-out-of-jail” card that is a band aid to assist late game, but is easily countered by Prince or Butler as there is no one else with this particular mechanic aside from King (and it’s often easy to discern).</p>
<p>You have Puppet to make your Thrall clear you, but considering you know this mechanic exists, if you or your Thrall ever gets suspected, the Court may just exe your Thrall, they flip Thrall and then they know to jail-exe you, given you are singled out through other info.<br>
You do get to vote for them, but does that give you access to both accusation and trial vote?</p>
<p>Let me suggest a few changes that could be interesting to play around with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remove Desecrate. The ability seems a bit like a tack-on that doesn’t really fit. It’s just to make some chaos by implicating the existence of either Herbalist/Possessor/Vampire. Unlikely to throw suspicion off you.</p>
<p>Changes to Enthrall: Instead of Thralls dying the next night, let them stay until replaced by another Thrall.</p>
<p>Changes to Command Thrall: Attack two target players, your Thrall/Familiar commits suicide at the end of the night. Requires a Thrall/Familiar to be used.</p>
<p>Introduce:<br>
Passive<br>
<strong>Familiar</strong>: If you are executed on trial, you will take the spot of your Familiar, if you have one. If you have a Familiar, Enthrall will kill the target and not replace your Familiar.</p>
<p>Day ability<br>
<strong>Dark Ritual</strong> (inf uses): Prepare a ritual to make your Thrall into your Familiar at the end of the next night. For this night, Enthrall will not raise the target as a Thrall to replace your existing Thrall.</p>
<hr>
<p>This means the Vampire has a defense in Court they have to set up. But the Vampire needs to keep the Familiar from getting executed or they lose their shield for 1-2 days, so they need to use Puppet to make the Court trust them.</p>
<p>If a Familiar gets executed during the day, the Vampire will need to Enthrall a new target the following night (and not get blocked - OCC’d/jailed/target healed or delayed) and use a day ability to set up the shield - at which point Court might execute the new Thrall or you, and first at the end of that next night, the Familiar is a shield.</p>
<p>If a Familiar gets attacked during the night, it’s even worse as the Vampire has to dodge through 2 days of trials before their scapegoat is ready at the earliest.</p>
<p>So it is a very powerful defense, as it essentially grants you another life, but it does require some setup and have risk of getting killed by Cultseen/Prince/Alch/Inq/Court/Knight.</p>

            <p>Probably not.</p>
<p>It would either be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Desecrate can’t be used if you have used Puppet at least once on the same day (like every other day ability, so this is probably the case)</li>
<li>Using Desecrate locks you out from using Puppet for the rest of the day</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to have the second day ability in case someone decides to remove their logs, or to make elaborate plays, but it is probably unnecessary in hindsight unless you want to fake it being a reaper game</p>
<p>In scenario 1 you would have to pretend your Thrall is reaped or just didn’t talk if you want to make them flip as something else, in scenario 2 you would just use the second day ability at the end of the day which is probably bad but there could be a case for there being an exception here</p>
