    <title>Journal format suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/journal-format-suggestions/7739</link>
    <description>Was wondering if you guys have found a good way to write your nightly logs in the journal so that they&#39;re easy to read and follow when you have to copy and paste them into chat. I&#39;m finding when I see peoples pasted journal I have to take time to distinguish what goes with which night and spacing runs together. I&#39;m trying to make nightly logs in my journal that are easy to read and don&#39;t all run together when pasted. For example:

[n1] flirt 12- social support. /// 
[n2] flirt 3- killer offensive. ///

Or 

[n1] flirt 12- social support..........
[n2] flirt 3- killer offensive...........

I found those work better than nothing but was wondering if anybody has come up with anything that makes it REALLY easy to read their pasted nightly logs. Thanks!</description>
