    <title>Clarification on Possessor Mechanics</title>

    <description>Hey all,

I just played a game as Possessor and jumped to Drunk. My question is: Would I have royal blood since I&#39;m in the Drunk&#39;s body?

The King died, and rather than risk not stepping up, I jumped again (into a bear, but that&#39;s another story lol).

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Yes, all this makes sense and is for the best - Possessor is already strong enough. Thanks!</p>

            <p>nope, the only things the possesor inherits, is the name, logs and appearence of his new host. possesor has no shortcut to being psycho king. beyond becoming psudoking by jumping into the king directly. (he inherits the crown, and prevents himself from being targetted by things that can’t target the king… but he’s totally screwed if bd suspects that and asks him to use finger to prove (as possesed king doesn’t have any abilities).</p>

            <p>Nope, you wouldn’t have royal blood. You’d think that you would since you’re in the body of someone with it buuuut nope.<br>
