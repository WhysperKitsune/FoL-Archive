    <title>A tangible set of classes that appear</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/a-tangible-set-of-classes-that-appear/43086</link>
    <description>Throne of Lies is very random. There is a random number of most Blue Dragon, making it hard to deduce things about people&#39;s classes. You only have uniqueness to run on, and few classes are unique. So I would suggest a list that you can use process of elimination. For example:

1 King
1 Prince
1+ Sheriff/Paladin
1+ Physician
1 Investigative
2 Support/Social
2 Killing/Offensive
0-2 Random

2 Cult/Unseen

1 Neutral Killing
1-3 Other Neutral

Or something similar. But this would give the Blue Dragon more ways to deduce who is evil, since it isn&#39;t chaos like it is now. There can be Physicians, or none. You can rely on nothing. I also recommend guaranteeing Physician, since both Cult and Unseen can get extra kills from Nightshade or Bleeding without healers.</description>

            <p>There is another way. Seeing if their actions line up with their motivations.</p>
<p>Also your thing about the knights only applies of a negitive result. You don’t die when you find Unseen or Neut.</p>

            <p>As Knight, you’re dead when you know that info. That’s not helpful for you. It basically super weak Sheriff’s one person, and then you might be dead. Some converted class do line up though, since there is no way to distinguish Alcoholic and Drunk without Sheriff.</p>

            <p>Princess: Willo-wisps for one and the fact that it means that the remaining evils will either have: predictable claims or claims that dont match up with your results. Also some converted classes don’t match up with their unconverted classes results.</p>
<p>Knight: Checks for night Immunity and alignment ect with CS and can check if the person is attacked and who attacked them.</p>
<p>The only BD classes where I can’t think of anything like this off the top of my head are: Prince, Psychic, Hunter and Noble. And they have other means of getting info.</p>

            <p>No. Physician is a pretty straightforward example, as well as Knight. And many powers are super weak. Princess is vague to point of being not too useful, especially when most evils claim their original class.</p>

            <p>and the problem is right now as it is, most claims are already confirmable, or at least narrowed down to that or the converted form of what it claims, from the classes own logs alone. Right now the only thing keeping BD from an 80% winrate, is new players that prevent more serious players from doing autowin strategies. You throw in one more layer of elimination though, we’ll easilly look at drifting to a 75% bd winrate with bad teams, 90% plus with good teams.</p>

            <p>The game as evils is to make a claim and hold it as long as possible. Pretty easy if any class claim holds. It’s about comparing people’s claims. All claims are faulty and can be disproven, but it’s part of the game’s challenge as an evil.</p>

            <p>It is hard to avoid counter claims when the class list, but I think this is much less of a problem with conversion, since if you are converted, you take up the same space. It’s harder as starting cult/unseen, since you don’t have the space, but I think deduction is an important part of the game. In addition, you can sometimes use your allies claim space. The biggest problem I think is Neutral Killing, with the possible exception of Possessor, since they are stuck space less.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to loosen it up a bit by merging Social and Support, as well as Killing and Offensive.</p>

            <p>Nooooooo.  This is a terrible idea (even though it strives to mindlessly copy ToS, ToS itself recently revised its Ranked list to make it less restrictive, precisely because they realized how many problems this sort of setup causes.)  The practical result of this is to limit claimspace for evils, which is already far too low.</p>
<p>This suggestion would make the game involve drastically less skill, since it would be far easier for BD to determine who people are by elimination.  It would make games more repetitive and less interesting, reducing tactical depth.  And the basic premise (that BD is currently having trouble deducing people’s roles) is flatly and completely wrong - it is, if anything, currently far too easy for BD to determine roles, and far too hard for anyone who starts without a valid BD role to put forwards a fakeclaim that can pass inspection.</p>
<p>Everything in this thread is awful; this is, the single worst suggestion I’ve seen on the forum.  Let it die its well-deserved death.  It would make the game worse in every way, without any benefits whatsoever, and the basic premise that it is attempting to achieve (making the game easier and less thought-intensive for BD by allowing them to mechanically brute-force solutions, while removing claimspace from evils) is actively <span class="bbcode-i">bad</span>.</p>
<p>PS.  I won’t be reading or responding to any replies to this post, since I feel that this suggestion is so awful and would do such severe damage to the game that it’s important to let the thread die due to lack of replies.  I urge everyone else to stop replying as well.  Suggestions that are so obviously terrible shouldn’t get discussions as if they’re something worth taking seriously, since the very act of seeing something discussed can convince developers that it needs to be addressed in some way, and this suggestion just needs to <span class="bbcode-i">drop dead</span> and be forgotten forever.  There’s nothing of value in this thread and, given that the suggestion it started with was so terrible to begin with, no hope that there could ever be anything, so we ought to just move on.</p>

            <p>More importantly in my mind is just how powerful it is to have a class be guarenteed. If you know a class exists and someone claims it unCCed then you know they are telling the truth (or that they are on a scum team with them which has the same effect as being that classes converted version exept it’s easier to prove).</p>

            <p>33/10 idea, put it into the game right now, on top of the currently spawning 9 random BD with the potential of 2 being Neuts</p>

<p>It makes it so that as town, if you follow the formula without making any mistakes, town has a 95% chance of winning. Of course in reality there is a 15% chance of 1 townie doing something really stupid or gamethrowing (I’m assuming high ELO ranked, obviously in ranked practice that’s closer to 40%), then a 4% chance of just a rediculously lucky alignment of roles to make town incapable of seeing through things, and a 1% chance that you can actually effect the game as evil, still leading to a really stale 80% town winrate.</p>
<p>All that being said, throne of lies currently is actually MORE vulnerable to PoE than town of salem… protected only by the lack of a ranked mode. With most classes leaving detectable events, only like 3-4 possible claims for anyone but the converted forms of classes. The last thing the game needs is something to make PoE more optimal.</p>

            <p>The solution is to have random Blue Dragons. That way there aren’t always 2 Social classes. It lends itself to deduction, without making it by the numbers. The list above should probably have more than 1 random.</p>

            <p>I think your misunderstanding what kind of effect this type of change would have. It would make the game a play by numbers game. While that might be fun for a bit it eventually gets to a point where the BD have solved the game even on the lower levels.</p>
<p>For example if there is 1 Butler claim and 1 Drunk claim then you know for a fact that one is lying. Simply have the drunk HH someone and evil found.</p>
<p>That may sound skill based but the possablety of both being good means that you have to either use a night to Investigate them (requiring the trust of the Investigator which itself requires skill from the scumreaders and from the invest claim) or you need to scumread them properly and see if any of them have done anything suspicious and act accordingly.</p>
