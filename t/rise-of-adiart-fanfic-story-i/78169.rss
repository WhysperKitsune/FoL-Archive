    <description>&quot;Teemo, will guide us all to salvation. All hail Teemo.&quot;

&quot;Did you hear? The war&#39;s getting fiercer... They say it&#39;s over in Meraki...&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s the town over! Man, we must pray to Teemo... pray that the war never comes.&quot;

Why do I still do this? This is not what I should be doing. Even physicians do more than me.
You heard me right. I&#39;m a preacher. By no means am I good at it, but I receive gifts everyday for &quot;hearing the voice of God&quot;. Seriously.

But Faith is all that keeps the people mentally stable in this era of war. I cannot refute this. If it be lies, I will use them to keep the peace in this village.

--------------------------

... &quot;Hmm?&quot;
The night had fallen, and I was but gathering herbs for the physician at the forest, who was swamped with work creating medicine for the plague that had recently spread. It had even claimed one person&#39;s life, I heard. 

But enough, there was the smell of blood in the air. Had the war spread here already? 
...
That&#39;s... a person!
He&#39;s injured badly! There was an arrow stuck in his shoulder... he&#39;s bleeding badly... 

I don&#39;t think I can save him.
I know next to nothing about medicine. I can&#39;t treat dying people. I&#39;m just a priest. The only thing I do is preach about being faithful to Teemo. And even so, I do not believe in that god.

_&quot;Priest Farnilus.&quot;_
???
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; I shout.

_To be continued._</description>
