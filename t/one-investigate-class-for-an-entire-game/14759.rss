I&#39;ve just played a game in which we only had one investigative class all game. He was converted n1. We didn&#39;t have a single observer, and we also didn&#39;t have a single princess. I could imagine how insane this game would have been if we also had an evil king.

I&#39;m wondering whether 2 investigative classes, whether sheriff/paladin, obs, or princess, should at least be guaranteed per game. I&#39;m not implying that a sheriff or obs should spawn, but maybe at least a princess or two?</description>

            <p>The real problem here is that the Blue Dragon team had a reduced chance to win, regardless of what happens, just because of the amount of each class that spawned. Being better at scum reading surely increases each player’s chance at winning, but no amount will make up for the fact that BD’s win chance was reduced the moment the game started.</p>
<p>Some games of ToL are decided extremely early on just due to RNG. A mastermind or cult leader can get unlucky with conversion attempts for days on end and continue the game with little chance for recovery. A non-BD can be found out N1 and get immediately executed, which can outright lose them the game or hamper the rest of their team. Prince can die N1, reducing the amount of executes that BD can use. And so on.</p>
<p>The games where this happens might be rare, but that doesn’t make them any more fun to have to sit through. And I can see this happening in my games multiple times a day, with someone being salty in the post-game chat for any of the above reasons. Improving the worst case scenario for all teams so that games are decided more by skill and less by luck seems like a good idea to me.</p>
<p>RNG of some sort is required in social deduction games like ToL to keep things different every game. But having extremely one-sided games because of poor luck is not fun for the unlucky ones.</p>

            <p>Just use your discussion period during the day phase to find the scum. It’s not that hard.</p>
<p>After all, even if you guarantee that more investigative roles spawn, they could always find nothing/be converted/die anyways.</p>
