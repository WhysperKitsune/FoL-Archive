    <title>[RESOLVED] Appealing this random 3 day ban</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-appealing-this-random-3-day-ban/11087</link>
    <description>What happened: Banned 3 days for making a bad joke about how black people always die in horror movies. which is true... stating this is neither racist nor egregious. A warning for a bad joke on someones FIRST offense is quite fair. As an African American man myself I really didn&#39;t see the toxicity in the joke to draw a 3 day ban.


What was SUPPOSED to happen: maybe a warning...? I apologize for the bad joke if it offended other lads. As an avid player I humbly ask you remove this ban and ill take it as a warning before further prosecution.</description>

            <p>I understand the conversion thing. I’m not arguing that. I didn’t think it would be a big deal in certain circumstances  and I was wrong. I apologized for making a bad joke. I apologized for offending anyone. I’m just frustrated because I didn’t see it as being said in an evil way to dictate 3 days. It’s all good. Thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>I was about to say I’d lift your ban, but your attitude isn’t exactly helping. If you want to make a joke about black people in horror movies, it’s on you to make it not appear racist. And you can’t ask for coversion under any circumstances.</p>

            <p>Well I find it disgusting you would ban a supporter for a MINOR joke that in your opinion isn’t funny. Ive seen far more egregious things said in this game and every other mod would agree. this is so miniscule a warning would’ve done. whatever cheers.</p>

            <p>I don’t see how the fact that the player’s skin being black makes it any better. There was no joke in that statement. You didn’t say, “he’s black so he’s gonna die anyways.” You said he’s black kill him.</p>
<p>Asking to be converted is against the rules. There’s no exceptions.</p>

            <p>yea that is a joke.pulling text doesnt constitute meaning behind the words ( i.e. i could mean the toons armor being black like a knight) and would never hold up in court.  that’s how we got into the conversation of horror movies etc as stated above.</p>
<p>Also asking to be converted is a good way to be killed as the fool. It also would make the evil players less likely to target me for death as it would be a waste after I got outed as being BD.</p>

            <p>I’m not being an ass. I genuinely apologize for the joke. I just don’t think it requires a 3 days ban. warn me and then ban me if it happens again imho</p>
<p>I have been thoroughly looking forward to playing every night after work. This game is way better than Town of Salem</p>
