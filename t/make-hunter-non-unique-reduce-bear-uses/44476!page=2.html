<p>Combining proving, self-protection, and killing into one role is a bad idea because it allows the Hunter to accomplish too much without relying on others and because the simple act of having the Hunter step up reduces the space where evils can hide while leaving them relatively little wriggle-room.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s why my solution would be to give other ways for people to bleed like that. If the hunter isn’s as easy to confirm then he either wont be trusted as much or they will put trust into someone other than the hunter.</p>

          <blockquote>
<p>The King is a good leader but he is also not necessarily BD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the point.  Throne of Lies is a game about deception, trust, and cooperation; if you want to take a leadership role, you should have to either convince people to trust you, or should have to rely on others to protect you, with significant room for deception in each.  The King should be as good as a leader as the game offers; anyone who could be a better leader - like the Hunter - is a mistake that is distorting the gameplay and should be corrected so they no longer have the ability to abuse their abilities in that fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually that is knight. He does those jobs much better than the hunter does due to determining who the obvious targets are and making them risky rather than just being a risky target himself. That and his cold steel is unlimited use and instant which make is less conformable and better at dealing with an immediate threat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Games like Throne of Lies have multiple classes that serve the same role, both because it makes gameplay more interesting and because it makes it harder for people to trivially deduce what’s going on.  The Knight and the Hunter are both Killer roles, and both serve that same basic purpose.  They are <i>not</i> Social roles, and shouldn’t generally serve to lead or unite the BD in even minor ways, since giving someone both the ability to kill, the ability to protect themselves, and the ability to lead results in individual people taking over the game and reduces strategic depth by making trust, deception, and cooperation less important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually. Scratch this. The leader of the faction is that factions most competent member. Any class should be capable of leading but just some are better than others. Remember that there is exactly 1 BD class that doesn’t have any of the traits I said were needed in a leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, but I think it’s particularly important to avoid leaders who can protect themselves, since that drastically reduces the amount of cooperation and trust that BD needs in order to win.  (The King should be top-tier and unique in that respect, since he’s sort of intended to be ToL’s big unique thing, and since there’s various factors balancing him out.)  I’d have no problems with Hunters being as good as eg. a Court Wizard at leading, but it’s something to be very, very careful about - not something to be celebrated and protected.  Changes that make the Hunter worse at taking a leadership role (and generally more reluctant to reveal, and less trustworthy when he does) are a good thing.</p>
<p>I mean, to some extent this is a matter of taste.  But I don’t think the ToS veteran was a good role overall, and it would be one I’d focus on revising into something else when making a new game.  It was absolutely never intended to be a leader, absolutely hurts the game when it manages to do so, and “leader Veterans” or “leader Hunters” are mistakes that ought to be corrected.</p>
<p>Do you feel having “power” roles is a good thing, in general? I think they serve one and only one purpose - they make it so it matters who evils target (since they want to find and kill them rather than less important roles.)  Power roles that can defend themselves don’t accomplish this and shouldn’t exist.  The game should rely on cooperation, trust, deception, and interaction between people, not on one showboating player in a super-class handling everything.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I feel that Throne of Lies is meant to have the King as the leader - that’s the basic concept behind the game and what makes it unique among social deduction games.  Having secondary classes that can act as leaders is generally a bad thing, and doing so should require multiple people working together.  The Hunter is utterly unfit to be a leader role in this respect, and his ability to do so should be completely and <span class="bbcode-i">ruthlessly</span> removed - cauterized out so not even the smallest trace of it remains.</p>
<p>I am absolutely opposed to the idea of leader-Hunters on every level.  It goes against everything about the role, it’s actively bad for the game, it leads to boring gameplay as soon as a Hunter is confirmed (which, in practice, you <span class="bbcode-i">know</span> happens very easily as a result of his uniqueness even when he doesn’t use bleeding).</p>
<p>I mean, let’s take a step back.  What do you like about leader-Hunters?  I’ve explained in detail why I think they’re bad for the game and why the Hunter should be revised in whatever ways are necessary to make that impossible (ideally, at the very least, starting with removing the ability of a bear to protect him from conversion - something what would force him to eg. rely on the CW, who could use the buff.)</p>
<p>You haven’t really explained why you like the idea of of them being able to lead beyond saying that you think it’s how it was intended (which I don’t think is true and which, either way, doesn’t really matter.)  Like I said, to a certain extent it’s a matter of taste (eg. do you like games with one person leading everyone else or not), but I’m curious what appeals to you about it - I pretty much took it for granted that everyone realized leader-Veterans and leader-Hunters are bad things that emerged accidentally from the way those roles worked and which ought to be removed if possible.</p>

<p>The Knight and the Hunter are both Killer roles, and both serve that same basic purpose.  They are not Social roles, and shouldn’t generally serve to lead or unite the BD in even minor ways, since giving someone both the ability to kill, the ability to protect themselves, and the ability to lead results in individual people taking over the game and reduces strategic depth by making trust, deception, and cooperation less important.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You seem to missunderstand. Being able to kill or defend yourself neciccaraly means you have the ability to lead. It’s simply the point of a BD killer. If you can figure out who is scum without social or Investigative powers than you can just call them out and have them killed during the day. The real point of targeted town night kills are to use as leverage. If you have leverage then you can force claims and if you can do that then you can lead.</p>

</aside>
<p>Leading is by far the most important and skill based thing you can do in the game. If only the King could do it then that would be locking out 15 other players from doing the most important task you can. In my mind the more ways for a class to be able to lead the better because everyone should at all times be trying to lead. This is because whichever faction has the dominant leader will win every time. Hunter is good because he is clearly designed to take the spotlight. This is itself good because dealing with a Hunter and not being delt with as Hunter can lead to some of the best mind game moment ever. That combined with the actual skill required to lead properly makes leading the most engaging part of the game</p>
<p>The reason why Hunter should be balanced to be a good leader is this:</p>
<p>If I am Unseen/Cult and I see someone leading I think “I should convert him and if I cannot I should kill him”</p>
<p>If I am good at scum reading and know the above I think “I cannot help much if I am dead so I will keep quiet for now”</p>
<p>this leads to everyone being silent and at best just feeding whispers to the king and letting the king do all the work. Now lets play this again but with the Hunter as a thing.</p>
<p>If I am Hunter I think “Hunter is good for leading so I will try and lead”</p>
<p>If i am scum I think “That person leading might be Hunter. We should convert someone else for now and bait out his bears”</p>
<p>If I am good at scumreading I think “If I try and lead they might think I am Hunter and be scared off. So I will state my suspicions and get my read killed”</p>
<p>If I am still scum I think “Oh shit! They have a strong leader in play and he might be hunter. I should try and speak up more myself so that I can take control from him or at least distract BD enough so we can get him to waste his bears and convert him!”</p>
<p>Basically the possibility of a hunter who is expected to lead encourages everyone of both factions to try and take to spotlight rather than shy away from it. The king is not the only one who should have the spotlight but rather he is the one that starts with it. Others trying to wrestle control over the leader position (not just the king position) is what makes the game fun and exiting. It is what gets everyone talking and stops the game from being a whisper fest of the king being the only one who can experience the fun of being the leader.</p>
<p>AKA: Hunter should be a better leader because that makes everyone a better leader. Everyone being a leader is inherently good.</p>
<p>However one thing we do agree on is his confirmability. I don’t think it should be MM/Assassin/CL but it should be possible for both factions to produce the hunter bleed message and thus make this entire thing more interesting by giving some doubt to his class when he finally does claim.</p>

<p>Well, obviously not!  If we removed the ability of the bear to block conversion, the Hunter’s ability to lead would be significantly reduced, since he could be converted at any time if not protected by a CW / Pally / Sheriff.</p>
<p>I don’t think we need more than one “claim or die” role.  That’s the Prince’s job.  Other people who want to play that game should be much weaker.</p>

All of that depends on <span class="bbcode-i">not being able to protect yourself</span>.  A power role that can protect itself is pointless.  The whole point of power roles is that they’re glass cannons - powerful but vulnerable and, therefore, they require coordination from the BD while rewarding intelligent play by evils.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hunter (which can protect itself) should not be a powerful role - that is to say, it shouldn’t be particularly more important relative to other BD roles.</p>

</aside>
<p>Ok, at this point we’re getting into subjective matters.  But I will say that I don’t feel that the Hunter actually causes other people to step up; I feel that roles like him generally encourage passivity among most other players.  Since he can do almost everything on his own, with just minimal input from investigatives and BDs willing to vote as he directs, you end up with games where most players contribute less.</p>
<p>To me, the ideal game shouldn’t have one individual leader among the BD, but a <span class="bbcode-i">group</span> (two or three or four people) who manage to determine that they trust each other and who then use their abilities, collectively, in intelligent ways to ensure a win.  This leaves room for evils, of course, to trick people and slip into that ring of trust - which is the point of the game!  If you want to guide the BD, you should have to work for it like that rather than just having it handed to you by getting some sort of boring “leader role” that inherently does everything.</p>
<p>Games where one person steps up and carries the BD are, to me, boring, uninteresting games, and I definitely don’t think the game should be designed to encourage them.  The interesting ones - and the ones that lead to deeper gameplay - are ones where you have lots of people interacting with each other, trying to throw together a plan while having to deal with the fact that not everyone they’re communicating with is necessarily on the same side as them.</p>

<p>He should be difficult to convert since he is one of the BD’s strongest assets. It’s a risk/reward situation for the Evils when trying to convert, which I think is healthy for his strength.  But it’s not easy to choose the right time to use the bears, so it requires risk assessment from both ends, which I think is a good and dynamic feature.</p>

<p>That’s the point.  Throne of Lies is a game about deception, trust, and cooperation; if you want to take a leadership role, you should have to either convince people to trust you, or should have to rely on others to protect you, with significant room for deception in each.</p>
