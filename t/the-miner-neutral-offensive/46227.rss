            <p>To be honest, this class’s goal is too survive, but has only negative utility for the BD. It’s like an Alchemist without the heals.</p>

            <p>Then this class needs serious buffs to give it better fakeclaim space or a way to aid BD more clearly, if you want to keep the conversion possibilities, because at the moment it can only barely fake a drunk log and it has no other protection from the court at day whatsoever. The occupy immunity only gives it a chance to claim butler/drunk/hunter. Hunter is already a tricky claim. He cannot occupy anyone, or poison the king and he cannot happy hour or consistently debauch people. He cannot claim miner, because in its current incarnation every sensible BD would execute all miner claims on sight.</p>
<p>I also disagree completely that scum should just be able to convert everything blindly with zero regard for target selection. They TOO need to apply social deduction for more than just finding the prince…, but that is another topic I suppose</p>

            <p>Because everything that doesn’t need conversion immunity (NK, Prince, King) should be convertible. It should be a loss for the Unseen/Cult to convert a neutral, but it just makes arbitrarily harder for Unseen/Cult.</p>

            <p>Why should this be convertible? There is already almost no reason BD wants this alive. Making this convertible just squashes that chance to zero. I also don’t see why his night skill needs a cooldown. He can at least fake a drunk log if that weren’t the case, although he cannot happy hour or step up for king.</p>

<p>The Night Action - “Hot Stuff!” - has a two day cooldown so players don’t abuse it, if you want, I can  reduce the number of uses.</p>
