<p><em><strong>Lore:</strong> “Adiart give me strength.”</em></p>
<p><em>The Baron was never always grumpy. He had seen dangerous times. Many people believed he had been at Adiart’s side during the war. Throughout the course of history, the Baron had commanded many armies, he had many victories on his belt, and held many accolades. It was no secret he held a grudge against the former King Adiart, because the seat of power had always been in his eyes. But he would never betray Adiart, loyalty like that does not waver. After Adiart’s passing, the new King that rose to the throne was naive and unpredictable. Most of the Blue Dragon would constantly contest the court and the Baron grew tiresome. He would make it his goal to end the Blue Dragon and form a new army of his own. Using the enemies of the Blue Dragon to his advantage, he could gain power.</em></p>

<p><em>The Thaumaturge was the strongest of all those born with magic in their blood. They always stood firmly on their beliefs that Dragons once roamed the skies as Gods, while they also believed that the Blue Dragon were the reason they no longer exist. However, rumours flew through the magical guild that the Blue Dragon have an ancient dragon held captive below Castle Adiart. The Thaumaturge would forge an unholy alliance with Blue Dragon’s enemies, ensuring their fall to release the Dragon.</em></p>

<p><strong><em><span class="bbcode-u">Goal: Don’t let the music die.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><em>Lore:</em></p>
<p><em>Here I am to tell you a story,</em><br>
<em>Of how I found such musical glory,</em></p>
<p><em>I found a little fiddle upon an old shelf,</em><br>
<em>Little did I know, it was carved by an elf,</em></p>
<p><em>Such fine craft work, with delicate sound,</em><br>
<em>I realized it wasn’t ordinary, what I just found,</em></p>
<p><em>Onward to the Palace to test my own skill,</em><br>
<em>But should the music stop, it is me they will kill.</em></p>
<p>-Written by the Virtuoso</p>
<p><strong>The Virtuoso</strong> was a being of peace and harmony, often crying upon declarations of love and delivering lovely sounds of music that come from the passion in their heart. Within the Royal Family, the King wanted somebody who could keep him happy. He found The Virtuoso very humble and thus, employed him to play every day and every night, and threatened his life if he should stop. The Virtuoso didn’t stop, as an actual fact, they didn’t want to stop playing the fiddle.</p>
<p>Some nights the Prince would invite The Virtuoso into the cells just to hear the sweet sounds of The Virtuoso’s melodies. However, The Virtuoso was once a known drunk, and should they be tempted, wine was always going to meet their lips. That is what they had feared among the King’s staff. They feared that once the music stops playing, The King will have their head. The music must not stop playing.</p>
