    <title>&lt;Suggestion&gt; Small Hunter rework</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-small-hunter-rework/49603</link>
    <description>Hi there,


I would like to suggest a slight rework to the Hunter, based on a game I had where I was converted by a target which I wolfed as hunter.

The night a player is wolfed, the hunter is convert immune from said player ON the night which they are wolfed. Please note I am not suggesting that this change make hunter like the drunk, where he redirects conversion to themselves and are _then_ conversion immune, but the Hunter is conversion immune if his wolfed target happens to attempt to convert him. 

It makes sense that you are wolfing someone you believe to be evil, to be converted by them seems a little unfair to the poor hunter.

Feedback appreciated :slight_smile:

            <p>If anything, it would go the other way around - make it so conversion roleblocks you.</p>

            <p>Hunter already gets 3 nights of immunity from bears.</p>
<p>While I see where you are coming from, the conversion mechanic leads to no solution out of screwing your future team.</p>
<p>It’s one of the game’s biggest weaknesses, but it is something we have to accept with the mechanic.</p>
