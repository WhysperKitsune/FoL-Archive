<p>So, I hit a bit of a snag, I play so differently to you all XD I need to somehow make 15 posts that are on topic, but I dont Scum any of you, I work more mechanically, so till someone dies your all pretty much neutral to me and will stay that way. Even if one person gets aggressive or defensive, or just goes meh when the fingers are pointed at them, none of that on Day 1 actually makes me feel any alignment one way or another.</p>
<p>As for me though, I am VT all the way! I have a vote, and can type. No clue if flavor text actually means anything so no point posting it XD</p>

<p>I’ve called this both towny and scummy, now I don’t think it’s alignment indicative. It’s not like mafia can’t claim VT.</p>

<p>This post feels like player salad. The nonchalant tone feels off. Normally, you’d attribute nonchalance to villagers, but there’s something odd about the way he’s <em>loud</em> about not giving a damn. It’s like he wants people to townread him for it.</p>

<p>I do not townread this. Do I scumread this? Well, I see no real scumhunting mindset. Starting with a selfvote must’ve been done with the intention to be funny, which is &gt;rand W in this context (I’mma get townreads for selfvoting haha funni), and following it up with declaring a random player a wolf comes across as performative. “Yes, I am totally scumhunting, look at me.”</p>
<p>I’d townread it if Ami straight up didn’t do anything. It would be better than <em>this</em>.</p>

          <p>Atlas is the other person who did the “I’m stupid” thing, but then compare Atlas’s ISO to BlueLance’s ISO. Atlas has been trying to contribute in their own way multiple times. BlueLance has never given a damn. Atlas’s declared “stupidity” goes so far as to question people townreading them, but still offering some takes (though the number of takes has dwindled as the game continued). BlueLance has just dipped after claiming VT. I think he wouldn’t present such complete disengagement as town. The two scumreads he does give looked like he picked names from a hat. Atlas’s reads don’t look like this.</p>
<p>The only reason I’m comparing them is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>both are new players</li>
<li>both have called themselves inept at the game in one way or another</li>
<li>both have given early reads</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet their approaches differ on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>Hard not W/W read on these two. I doubt they would both play the same “line” as partners, but differ so much in actual approaches.</p>

<p>rand to be TMI if Vul is a wolf (Eli hasn’t really been coming under much in the way of pressure, and the specific way that Vul spent a long time shading Eli before taking him out of the PoE is more likely to come from a wolf who’s like ‘I want to miselim Eli’ ‘never mind people don’t want to go for it so I will instead performatively clear him’ rather than a wolf who’s like ‘I want to bus Eli’ ‘never mind, people don’t want to go for it, instead of keeping him on the back burner and probably getting cred later for it I will reverse my read on him and tie us together even though my read wasn’t actually getting him killed’)</p>

<p>you know, you can generate content and solve by also pushing people rather than just towncasing them? given the context, this is much more likely for wolf vulgard to do anyway</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m noticing a pattern here. Blizer’s first contributions are pointing out “things to look at,” rather than looking at them himself and offering his opinions. Bolded the relevant parts.</p>
<p>The first take he does give that can be considered a read is the take on Hippo, initially leaning mafia, but shifting to a townlean with reservations.</p>
<p>He also hedges on me vs Marshal.</p>
<p>There’s also another problem. The problem is how he makes sure not to clear Hippo despite giving him a townlean.</p>

<p>This feels awful. This reeks of TMI. PKR was a villager and Hippo was pushing him. This is setting up to push Hippo after PKR does flip town. It’s like he knows he can give Hippo a townlean, because if PKR does flip, he can retract the townlean and flip on Hippo. Feels like planning forward.</p>

<p>Potential TMI on PKR. There’s also the post earlier where he talks about “people wolfreading PKR” as if he knows PKR’s town, but that’s more blatant and may not be TMI - could be explainable by Blizer not having a read on PKR at the time.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pay attention.</p>
<p>Blizer says he thinks PKR is TWTBAW and if he’s a wolf he’s being bussed. Sure, that’s fine.</p>
<p>But he’s already suggesting to look at who’s pushing him regardless of his flip. And that’s awful.</p>
<p>He does clear Arctic regardless of what alignment PKR flips, but he’s implying that 1. PKR might flip today (despite choosing to defend him at first - notice how easily he walks away from that when Arctic brings up a counterpoint) and 2. people on the wagon will have to be evaluated if it happens. The implication for 2. is that there will be mafia on the wagon regardless of PKR’s alignment. And that’s a very, very bold assumption to make.</p>

</aside>
<p>This comes literally two posts before. He is seriously considering the possibility of bussing. But when talking to PKR, he takes the stance of “I think PKR’s town but I don’t feel like I can defend him.”</p>
<p>This, again, feels like setting himself up to look better (“I told you PKR was town!”) and setting up future pushes on villagers (wagon formation on PKR at the time consists of me, Arctic, min and Hippo, all of which I think are town and two of which are confirmed town now). He does townread Arctic, but not any of the other three. He may not have known about min’s tracker claim at the time, given that he replaced in, but that doesn’t change his potential motivation.</p>

</aside>
<p>More setting up future pushes on villagers. More “getting the thread to talk about stuff” instead of voicing opinions himself. Also, notice how many of these suggestions of his would end with yeets on likely villagers. Here he pairs two likely villagers together, for instance. Previously, he suggests re-evaluating Hippo if PKR flips village, and Hippo is definitely town. He also suggests re-evaluating Eli, and looking at Wazza’s scumreads. Wazza’s scumreads still alive at the time were Atlas and Eli. Blizer really, really, really wants to shove Eli into the PoE. And Atlas as well, actually - I did not notice that when I first reviewed his posts.</p>

<p>I know this is on Derps, which makes things interesting, but it’s consistent with his play pattern so far. Blizer continues to push for re-evaluating. The interesting thing here is that he suggests Derps was spewed town by Marl, and the “re-eval” suggestion looks more like an afterthought here, as if he’s trying to keep his world consistent despite talking about his partner this time around. Which is a wolf thing to do.</p>

<p>Marshal looked so fucking bad it was not even funny with her EoD.

Now people who are TRing her wouldnt get heavily pinged by this behaviour because shes trying to push for someone to get yeeted in the PoE (Me), though it isnt a good look, <strong>whats more damming is her reaction to SDA voting lol over me, and how panicky her tone is surronding this specific vote and how she pinged and tried to get PKR to vote me at EoD</strong>. <strong>I think this alone is a very good look for SDA if Marshal is wolf here.</strong> Knowing that Im likely not getting yeeted at EoD, <strong>she moves onto and starts the PKR CFD, because she knows that she can atleast get this CFD and misyeet on PKR (YET AGAIN WHO IS MISYEET BAIT)</strong>, because <strong>PKR is wolfread by townies already</strong>, and she could pull it off succesfully as we saw. <strong>I personally think this slot is wolf, and along with lol should be the yeet of the day.</strong></p>
<p>lol EoD was bad aswell, with one of the biggest pings being him saying we should let the yeet be randed which is just fucking awful as a suggestion. Their votes on me and PKR is also just absolutely garbage as I stated prievosuly, with no build up on these slots, and hell even TRing and defending these slots beforehand before just flipping on them. Aswell, I believe he Had TMI on CRich flip as i pointed out earlier. This slot should die, and is up with Marshal as my preffered yeet today.</p>
<p>TLDR: Marsh and lol both had awful EoD. SDA looks to be town if Marsh is wolf based off of Marsh’s reaction towards SDA and his vote on lol at EoD. Marshal/lol should be PoE for today, with eli and vul sprinkled in, and are slots to re-eval</p>

<p>Blizer kicks off the day with a pre-established agenda. He… pushes Marshal… because Marshal defended lol… instead of pushing lol. The argument is that Marshal defended her wolf partner, lol.

<p>Also, he has the gall to claim PKR was a misyeet with this “I told you so” wording, yet the day prior, he was like “it’s inevitable, look at PKR voters after he flips” until it was him on the chopping block. Awful, awful, awful, awful, <strong>awful</strong>.</p>

<p>I would say Derps and Marshal as i have stated are T/W here imo based off that EoD i feel like</p>
<p>Argument that Derps had TMI using “Gut Reads” exists there and is not the best look, but Marshal’s behaviour surronding it, and what she did as a response (Pinging PKR for his voted, then proceeding to CFD onto that Wagon, btw, with your vote on that wagon already) and because PKR was already in multiple peoples PoE’s she got that CFD succesfullly in that case</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I bring up how Derps’s EoD3 is wolfy and he says this. He’s hard pushing Marshal over Derps and using Marshal’s behavior (Marshal is likely villa btw) to defend Derps. He doesn’t actually have anything to say about Derps’s posts, and while he acknowledges one thing Derps did that might’ve been wolfy, he disregards it in favor of his Marshal push. The Marshal push which is, once again, <em>only there because Marshal defended Blizer’s other wolfread.</em> And instead of pushing that wolfread first to see if his world is correct, he pushes the defender, who could very well be V defending a wolf. I know he argues that the way Marshal defended lol made them look like partners, but this is still a very wrong and awful way of going about things.</p>

<p>also bruh<br>
i’ve been pushing for derps to die for a lot of today, far before I was towncored and before he was really starting to pick up any other form of wolfreads. I’ve literally led a wagon on the guy, I think it’s uncharitable to say I don’t give a shit about who we kill when i’ve more or less buried someone today and have been pushing them to die. Even if he flips villager you can’t say I ‘didnt give a shit’, I owned it brah.</p>

<p>Pay attention.</p>
<p>Blizer says he thinks PKR is TWTBAW and if he’s a wolf he’s being bussed. Sure, that’s fine.</p>
<p>But he’s already suggesting to look at who’s pushing him regardless of his flip. And that’s awful.</p>
<p>He does clear Arctic regardless of what alignment PKR flips, but he’s implying that 1. PKR might flip today (despite choosing to defend him at first - notice how easily he walks away from that when Arctic brings up a counterpoint) and 2. people on the wagon will have to be evaluated if it happens. The implication for 2. is that there will be mafia on the wagon regardless of PKR’s alignment. And that’s a very, very bold assumption to make.</p>
