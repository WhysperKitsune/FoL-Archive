            <p>My opinions? Cool idea. Just needs to be slightly tweaked.</p>
<p>Passives:<br>
Fulfilled: If you have successfully killed 3 of your bounties, you are conversion immune.<br>
(This is to prevent converted to lose to help my conversion idea down below)</p>
<p>Burn Bounty should be a day ability. They will be alerted that their bounty has been burnt.</p>
<p>Night Abilities:<br>
Undercover: 2 uses. You gain night immunity for the night.</p>
<p>(Alch and Merc have their own survivability abilities. Neutrals need this imo)</p>
<p>I think it should be convertable but can only be converted if he hasn’t won already:</p>
<p>The Hitman: Unseen Support<br>
Win Condition: Kill the BD and all those who oppose the Unseen</p>
<p>Passives:<br>
Focus: Occupy immune</p>
<p>Day Abilities:<br>
Reject: 1 use. Show a fake alert that the bounty was burnt to your previous client.</p>
<p>Night Abilities:<br>
Patch: 1 use. Shows all Unseen as not suspicious to Sheriff.<br>
Loyalty: 3 uses. Will kill the target for the Assassin. (This is for protecting the current assassin if he is trusted by BD)</p>
<p>Feel free to rework my own ideas.<br>
In Cult, it would become the Invoker obviously.</p>
