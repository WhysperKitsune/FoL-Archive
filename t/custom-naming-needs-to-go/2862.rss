    <description>Custom Names
= 
**Why they need to be removed** 

There are few things that I would be upset if they changed, this is beta and I&#39;m always open to changes and accept them with open arms... but NOT this. Custom games are toxic in my opinion and add literally nothing to the game. I love this game, and I love how it has unique things that separates itself from other games. The easiest to make the comparison to is Town of Salem. I believe this change is a step down in quality and makes the game more similar to ToS... in a bad way. Here are my reasons as to why this addition truly makes me sad/ disappointed. 

**Reason #1:** 
It motivates people to refer to other players by their character name instead of their player number. 
- This game is about strategy/ deduction/ lies etc. The most efficent way to discuss this is by refering to players by their numbers. The second that patch released and everyone could name themselves... that very next game people started calling people by their names... in chat/ journals/ everything.

- I HATE in ToS... or now in this game... when people say that they occupied &quot;Ziggy&quot;, so now I have to go look at the player list and scan down it till I find &quot;Ziggy&quot; then see what his player number is.
- When I read peoples death journals and its filled with random names that I now have to organize through and see what number is what. 
- When people make claims saying that &quot;Tom Cruise&quot; visited &quot;Ned Stark&quot; and now I have to put that through my number filter and see who is who. 

**Reason #2:**
What you name yourself can actually impact the game.
- When those times come (usually at the start of the game) when you have to pick a random person to kill/ target... someone with a name that stands out has a higher chance to be targeted compared to someone named &quot;Alan Wright&quot;.
- I have played ToS and died night 1 or 2 and once the killers were dead asked why they killed me, and my names have some times been a factor. 
- I&#39;m not saying that this happens every time... but it can and it has, and people who played ToS know that is true.

**Reason #3:**
Adds nothing to the game from a strategy stand point. 
-  It takes away from certain mysteies. If you are in a lobby of people playing multiple games together, and there is the same guy that names himself &quot;Deodat Lawson&quot; in back to back to back games... that gives you an insight and in my opinion loses the mystery of the part of the game that &quot;anyone could be anyone&quot;.
- Now I know that that guy from last game is that guy, this might not give any strategy aids... but it just feels bad.

**Reason #4:**
Opens up to a more &quot;childish&quot; environment along with various &quot;inappropriate&quot; names
- This game is a more advanced/ difficult/ complex/ mature game than ToS... adding this naming system makes things feel more juvenile. 
- You can make names like &quot;Poo poo face&quot;, &quot;Bing Bing Bing Bong&quot;, &quot;Big D&quot; just to name a few, this adds an immature and childish vibe that again... feels bad.

**Reason #5:** 
Ruins my &quot;immersion&quot; 
- I am referring to this being a social deduction game in a medeval setting where people are plotting murder and death... it doesn&#39;t feel that way AT ALL when I am playing along side people named Pikachu, Evil Presley, Big Rick, and I Love Lamps.
- The whole game feels different when there are a huge variety of names ranging from cartoon characters all the way to Donald Trump

TLDR:
-
It is my opinion that adding custom names to this game is a huge mistake. It takes away from the mystery and setting of the game istelf while adding nothing. The random names are childish and belong in a cartoon game like ToS. 

Please post if you feel the same, or disagree completely. I am interested to see what this community thinks.

Heres a poll

**Your thoughts on the new Custom Naming**

[poll type=regular public=true]
* I Hate them

Thanks for the feedback!

<p>Yes it is very close… but if the most efficient system is for people to use the numbers… that just adds one extra step of having to find the name, then see the number… just an annoying extra step to always have to do, even if they are right next to each other.</p>

</aside>
<p>Okay, here’s where i severely disagree with you. This is <strong>not</strong> a reason to remove custom names. In fact it as much of a reason to get rid of custom names for you, as it is a reason to keep them for me.<br>
Here’s what i mean:<br>
I refer to people by their in-game names regardless as to whether or not there are custom names, and for me that is the most efficient system. them referring to people by their number just adds that one extra step of having to look through the name/number sheet, find the number, and convert it to the name. even if they are close together in the sheet and the chat posters, it’s just an annoying extra step to have to do.</p>
<p>yes, the wording was on purpose</p>

            <p>I just saw the last thing you said in that post, I never saw a section about Boslof saying that this specific name thing was permanent and not up for discussion.<br>
This being a beta I just wanted to say my peace about a game I have been very active and involved in. I will take down the Poll and not continue to discuss this topic.<br>
I apologize</p>
<p>Edit: just tried taking it down and it said I was not allowed to</p>

<p>There is a very slim chance of there being a Ranked mode in Throne of Lies. It won’t work entirely in a conversion based game.</p>

<p>I can see how it looks contradictory. I am meaning that it doesnt add anything to the substance of the game or quality of life. It adds nothing positive to the strategy aspect, the name of your character should not effect the outcome that you will be the target of a random killing… and when naming your character you shouldn’t have to be thinking about “i dont want to have too cool of a name that stands out”<br>
All of that just feels bad is what I’m trying to say, which is why I’m so passionate about removing it.</p>

<p>There is always going to be something you don’t agree with people on, I feel that creating this post will cause somewhat unnecessary drama and I’m going to monitor this thread.</p>
<p>But it has been noted by Boslof himself that custom names is staying and I heavily advise you don’t make a big deal out of it, as the mods do not like an angry Boslof, we do what we can to ensure he is at his happiest. By that we mean, please, drop it. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

            <h1>Custom Names</h1>
<p><strong>Why they need to be removed</strong></p>
<p>There are few things that I would be upset if they changed, this is beta and I’m always open to changes and accept them with open arms… but NOT this. Custom games are toxic in my opinion and add literally nothing to the game. I love this game, and I love how it has unique things that separates itself from other games. The easiest to make the comparison to is Town of Salem. I believe this change is a step down in quality and makes the game more similar to ToS… in a bad way. Here are my reasons as to why this addition truly makes me sad/ disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Reason <span class="hashtag">#1:</span></strong><br>
It motivates people to refer to other players by their character name instead of their player number.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This game is about strategy/ deduction/ lies etc. The most efficent way to discuss this is by refering to players by their numbers. The second that patch released and everyone could name themselves… that very next game people started calling people by their names… in chat/ journals/ everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I HATE in ToS… or now in this game… when people say that they occupied “Ziggy”, so now I have to go look at the player list and scan down it till I find “Ziggy” then see what his player number is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I read peoples death journals and its filled with random names that I now have to organize through and see what number is what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When people make claims saying that “Tom Cruise” visited “Ned Stark” and now I have to put that through my number filter and see who is who.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reason <span class="hashtag">#2:</span></strong><br>
What you name yourself can actually impact the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>When those times come (usually at the start of the game) when you have to pick a random person to kill/ target… someone with a name that stands out has a higher chance to be targeted compared to someone named “Alan Wright”.</li>
<li>I have played ToS and died night 1 or 2 and once the killers were dead asked why they killed me, and my names have some times been a factor.</li>
<li>I’m not saying that this happens every time… but it can and it has, and people who played ToS know that is true.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reason <span class="hashtag">#3:</span></strong><br>
Adds nothing to the game from a strategy stand point.</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes away from certain mysteies. If you are in a lobby of people playing multiple games together, and there is the same guy that names himself “Deodat Lawson” in back to back to back games… that gives you an insight and in my opinion loses the mystery of the part of the game that “anyone could be anyone”.</li>
<li>Now I know that that guy from last game is that guy, this might not give any strategy aids… but it just feels bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reason <span class="hashtag">#4:</span></strong><br>
Opens up to a more “childish” environment along with various “inappropriate” names</p>
<ul>
<li>This game is a more advanced/ difficult/ complex/ mature game than ToS… adding this naming system makes things feel more juvenile.</li>
<li>You can make names like “Poo poo face”, “Bing Bing Bing Bong”, “Big D” just to name a few, this adds an immature and childish vibe that again… feels bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reason <span class="hashtag">#5:</span></strong><br>
Ruins my “immersion”</p>
<ul>
<li>I am referring to this being a social deduction game in a medeval setting where people are plotting murder and death… it doesn’t feel that way AT ALL when I am playing along side people named Pikachu, Evil Presley, Big Rick, and I Love Lamps.</li>
<li>The whole game feels different when there are a huge variety of names ranging from cartoon characters all the way to Donald Trump</li>
</ul>
<h2>TLDR:</h2>
<p>It is my opinion that adding custom names to this game is a huge mistake. It takes away from the mystery and setting of the game istelf while adding nothing. The random names are childish and belong in a cartoon game like ToS.</p>
<p>Please post if you feel the same, or disagree completely. I am interested to see what this community thinks.</p>
