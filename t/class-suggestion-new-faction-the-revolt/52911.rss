    <title>[Class Suggestion] New Faction: The REVOLT</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-new-faction-the-revolt/52911</link>
    <description>New faction: The Revolt.

This is a conversion faction like the Unseen or Cult, based on the concept of a group of people who want to take over the kingdom and usurp the rightful royal family.

The factions starts with a Warlord and a Henchman.

The new player who is converted **always becomes a Toady**, unless the Henchman is dead or has become the new Warlord, in which case the new player will become Henchman. (Just like how you become Assassin if there&#39;s no Assassin.)

Faction cap would probably be the standard 3 players.

Faction gets its own standard night chat like Unseen and Cult get.

If a Revolt member becomes King, they become Evil King.

The counter to the Revolt is the Accuser. Please remember Sheriff, Paladin, and Inquisitor are already counters. Complaints of &quot;hard counters suck&quot; will be ignored. Please respect the existing game as it is being developed. XD

----

Classes:

----

**Warlord** (REVOLT)

Passive:
**Unblinking** - Immune to occupation on nights you aren&#39;t attacked. Immune to attack on nights you aren&#39;t occupied. In other words, you can only be occupied or killed at night if you are both attacked and occupied at the same time.

Day Ability:
**Usurp** - Force the King to use Royal Finger on a target of your choice. Does not use up any charges of King&#39;s ability. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Coup de Grace** - Select a player to kill, adding 1 charge to your &quot;Treason&quot; night ability. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Treason** - Convert a target player to the Revolt. (2 starting uses. No cool down, but needs to be recharged with murders.)

----

**Henchman** (REVOLT)

Passive:
**Opportunity Knocks** - You will become the new Warlord if the current Warlord dies.

Day Ability:
**Wanted** - Place a bounty on a player&#39;s head. The target dies after two nights, bypassing Death Immunity, unless they are guarded by a Knight, King, or Mercenary. (4 uses. **STOP KILLING KNIGHT CLAIMS! XD**)

_^ For example, if you are marked as &quot;Wanted&quot;, when a Knight guards you that night, it would say something like: &quot;You were guarded by a Knight, King or Mercenary. You are no longer in danger.&quot; - In terms of lore, no one wants to collect on your bounty because they see you&#39;re likely to be guarded against them._

Night Ability 1:
**Scapegoat** - Carry out the Warlord&#39;s work for him. You will appear as the visitor, and you will take any negative effects from the visit, such as Hunter&#39;s Bear, Knight&#39;s Guard, etc. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Insider** - Discover the class type of a Blue Dragon, or the exact class of a Neutral, depending on which you&#39;ve targeted. (3 uses.)

----

**Toady** (REVOLT)

Passive:
**Servitude** - If the Henchman dies or is promoted to Warlord, you will become Henchman.

Day Ability:
**Ear Plug** - Prevent a player from hearing others for the rest of the day, including not being able to hear whispers to them. They can still see whisper notices, votes, etc. and can still talk though they don&#39;t see others&#39; chat. (4 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Boot Lick** - Heal a member of the Revolt of bleeding or poison. Includes Evil King. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Annoy** - Redirect one player to another, simultaneously occupying the second player. How annoying... Bypasses immunity. (4 uses.)

----

**Accuser** (BLUE DRAGON)

Passive:
**Rebuke** - If the Warlord tries to convert you, you will automatically prevent them. (Making him think he was simply prevented from converting you.)

Day Ability:
**Big Brother** - You will secretly hear the next 4 whispers that day. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**A Night in the Stocks** - Check to see if your target is a member of the Revolt. Usable after the first time the Warlord kills. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Rat Helmet** - If the player you select tries to murder someone tonight, you will kill them instead. If you attempt to kill a Blue Dragon, they will survive and you will lose any remaining uses of this ability. (3 uses.)

----

Hope ya like it. :open_mouth: As you can see, this is a super-simplified faction. Probably a good one for people to &quot;learn&quot; with, since conversions always create the same Revolt lineup.</description>

<p>Indeed, we did retract them - on the other side, the allegations regarding mod allegations also ended up being untrue. Misinformation all around.</p>
<p>However, since this has continued off-topic, I am going to lock this thread as warned earlier~ feel free to make a new one to try again.</p>

            <p>If you are reaper or MM or scorned or whatever you aren’t claiming a class you can’t fake. If you are converted from one of those classes then it’s too late anyway.</p>

            <p>Dude. What if someone asks for logs ANY time you’re evil? Like when you’re Reaper or Mastermind or Scorned? That’s such an unfair and irrelevant question.</p>
<p>You have fake logs. That’s the answer. That’s always the answer.</p>

            <p>Toady is fixed IMHO.</p>
<p>“Ear Plug” day ability now gives UNIVERSAL excuse to not use a day ability. If people think you’re faking, they’ll likely think everyone you use it on is faking, too. This means that people will either be too cautious to call you on your bluff, OR, they will be so reckless that you can use Ear Plug to get other people executed under suspicion of faking.</p>
<p>“Annoy” night ability now lets you redirect and prevent to someone else instead of yourself, and bypasses redirect immunity. This provides a UNIVERSAL claim that “I was redirected to someone and prevented.” Again, either BD will be too worried to call you on it, or they will be so stupid that they’ll execute other people you use this ability on.</p>

            <p>You could do what I did with my faction suggestion. I made 2 classes per type. Which classes are converted to where depended on which type but it for example gave Obs its own class and gave Princess and the hard counter another.</p>
<p>So Knight an Hunter would be one offensive class which is nothing like them. And there would be another which Drunk and Butler would become which is along the lines of the Invoker.</p>
<p>Psy and Noble would get their own classes.</p>
<p>Psy and CW share a converted class but merc gets a unique one.</p>
<p>ect ect ect.</p>
