    <title>[Suggestion] Longer days</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-longer-days/8761</link>
    <description>I often feel like the days are extremely short. here is a simple example. Let&#39;s say i am Paladin with a guilty report on 16.

First thing i will do is whisper the king about it, and give him some time to out it. This might take like 30 seconds. Then if he didn&#39;t (which happens often), i will out it myself. Then people often take easily 30 seconds to vote him up. 30 seconds is left. Now if for any reason we pardon him because he is fool, this gives us literally no time to do anything else.

What i would like is, instead make the days 4 minutes, but when at least 60 seconds of the day has passed, the king is allowed to end the day.</description>

            <p>I think it would be fun if the days sped up after X amount of time.</p>
<p>Maybe after a week (7 days) the days grow shorter because it’s winter time.</p>

            <p>I feel like it’s more fun with shorter days because it makes you follow your gut more, which I find fun. Also the games seem to be timed perfectly lasting average <em>20 mins</em> ??</p>
