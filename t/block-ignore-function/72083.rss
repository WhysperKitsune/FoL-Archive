    <title>Block/Ignore Function</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/block-ignore-function/72083</link>
    <description>Sometimes I&#39;ll get into a game with people who have a sense of humor I don&#39;t like, that I don&#39;t want to be matched with anymore

It&#39;d be nice to be able to block these people and be prevented from matchmaking with them in the near future.

I don&#39;t think these people deserve reports every time.

Sometimes it&#39;s younger kids who think spamming &quot;FUCK YEAH PICKLE RICK&quot; is funny. More power to them, I just don&#39;t want to play with them anymore.</description>

            <p>Ummm, well… I understand your concern, but I do not think TOL has enough players to do that. I mean you could report them, but I would not know how would that work.</p>
