    <description>## **Enslaver - Unique Neutral Killer**
**Passive (Intimidating)** If you die - your slave will die instead, attacker will get a target change notification, poison and bleeding redirects to slave
**Passive (Can&#39;t Touch This)** Basically the same as MM except no death immunity
**Day Ability (Royal Fall)** You can force a person with Royal blood to be your slave. Cannot be used if you already have a slave. Cannot be used on Prince, King or Pretender. Your target will lose Royal Blood, but you will get one. (1 use)
**Night Ability (Forced Slavery)** You enslave a target. cannot enslave royals or night immune targets (infinite uses)
**Night Ability (Order)** You order your slave to kill someone. Your slave cannot be redirrected, but they can be occupied, which will cause an attack to fail (infinite uses)

## **Slave - Unique Neutral Support**
**Passive (Dependence)** If your master will be attacked, poisoned or bled - you will take his place
**Day Ability (Trollbox)** - Basically the same (infinite uses)
**Day Ability (Last Opportunity)** On trial if your master is voted up you can force pardon it, can be used only if you had Royal Blood (1 use)
**Night Ability (Disobedience)** You can attack someone on your choice (infinite uses)

**Win Condition for both** -Defeat anyone who opposes you.

If slave becomes king he gets king day abilities, but same night ability

Idea is some kind of 3rd faction, with only 2 people alive at the same time. Disobedience can be used if Enslaver gets night immunity occupation bypass, or if he gets jailed, so you will attack on your own. Enslaver does not visit others directly, but instead, as possessor, makes his slave do the job.
Slave have abilities to defend his master from being executed, using trollbox or Last Opportunity

Also i think about changing Enslaver to Neutral Special, who will take NK place, but i think there will be too much &quot;neuts out&quot; if it&#39;ll happen

So what do you think about that one &gt;_&gt;</description>

            <p>Gonna think about it. I wanted to let Slave be active at day instead of night, and letting Enslaver to do all of the night work. About multiple slave types - i don’t think it’s a good idea. Investigative - what are investigatives for? to let leader know the info, i doubt it’ll work since the only thing enslaver can do with it - kill. Or replace slave. Killer - too much for a slave to be able to kill actually. If it’s existed it would be the same assassin. Offensive can work, socials are usually more active at day too and can manipulate others. Gonna think about it too</p>

            <p>a cool idea would also be making different types of slaves.</p>
<p>Investigative slaves<br>
Support slaves<br>
Killer slaves<br>
Offensive slaves<br>
Social slaves</p>

            <p>Also, I think we can get rid of the MM passive on him and turn the slave into more of a support.</p>
<p>Maybe a day tailor Ability thay disguises its leader to any BD class of their choice-2 uses? Maybe make it a prevent all visits to their leader.</p>
<p>Right now it seems kinda clunky, maybe also give it a night chat passive and instead of letting the slave also able to kill just make the slave more supportive</p>

            <p>I actually forgot to add it. He will become a Slave king, with same day abilities as king, losing trollbox and Last Opportunity, but having the same night abilities as Slave. By most evils i mean Mastermind and Cult leader - as leaders of their own faction they cannot be enslaved. Neutrals cannot be enslaved either. About uses - i forgot to add it to all the other abilities except Royal Fall, let me change that too</p>

            <h2><strong>Enslaver - Unique Neutral Killer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Passive (Intimidating)</strong> If you die - your slave will die instead, attacker will get a target change notification, poison and bleeding redirects to slave<br>
<strong>Passive (Can’t Touch This)</strong> Basically the same as MM except no death immunity<br>
<strong>Day Ability (Royal Fall)</strong> You can force a person with Royal blood to be your slave. Cannot be used if you already have a slave. Cannot be used on Prince, King or Pretender. Your target will lose Royal Blood, but you will get one. (1 use)<br>
<strong>Night Ability (Forced Slavery)</strong> You enslave a target. cannot enslave royals or night immune targets (infinite uses)<br>
<strong>Night Ability (Order)</strong> You order your slave to kill someone. Your slave cannot be redirrected, but they can be occupied, which will cause an attack to fail (infinite uses)</p>
<h2><strong>Slave - Unique Neutral Support</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Passive (Dependence)</strong> If your master will be attacked, poisoned or bled - you will take his place<br>
<strong>Day Ability (Trollbox)</strong> - Basically the same (infinite uses)<br>
<strong>Day Ability (Last Opportunity)</strong> On trial if your master is voted up you can force pardon it, can be used only if you had Royal Blood (1 use)<br>
<strong>Night Ability (Disobedience)</strong> You can attack someone on your choice (infinite uses)</p>
<p><strong>Win Condition for both</strong> -Defeat anyone who opposes you.</p>
<p>If slave becomes king he gets king day abilities, but same night ability</p>
<p>Idea is some kind of 3rd faction, with only 2 people alive at the same time. Disobedience can be used if Enslaver gets night immunity occupation bypass, or if he gets jailed, so you will attack on your own. Enslaver does not visit others directly, but instead, as possessor, makes his slave do the job.<br>
Slave have abilities to defend his master from being executed, using trollbox or Last Opportunity</p>
<p>Also i think about changing Enslaver to Neutral Special, who will take NK place, but i think there will be too much “neuts out” if it’ll happen</p>
<p>So what do you think about that one &gt;_&gt;</p>
