    <title>Marshal&#39;s Probe debauched to King revealed King&#39;s faction</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/marshals-probe-debauched-to-king-revealed-kings-faction/70942</link>
    <description>I was Marshal, I tried to probe someone but got debauched to King, it told me King was Unseen!  So I just outed everyone publicly since we had numbers easily with Evil King and we steamrolled the rest of the game.  

And somehow the following night my abilities names and icons were Maid Spy and Gossip, but I targeted Maid Spy to a player and it worked just like Probe.</description>

            <p>I know that a mindwarped Paladin who is forced to test King will be told the opposite of King’s faction.  So presumably if a Paladin is forced to test king without being mindwarped, he can know King’s true faction.</p>

            <p>I can’t I didn’t take one.  All it would show is I’m Marshal according to the top-left corner of the screen, but my two abilities are Maid Spy and Gossip.  However when I clicked on “Maid Spy” it let me target a player like Probe does, and it told me the class of the person I targeted.  So it was still the regular Marshal abilities, just the wrong names and icons.</p>
<p>At least I know the first ability was Maid Spy.  The other one wasn’t Snoop, I presume it was Gossip.</p>
