    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Puppeteer, an offensive neutral class</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-puppeteer-an-offensive-neutral-class/54051</link>
    <description>**Outline:**
The Puppeteer will be a class similar to the inquisitor in the way that it spawns alongside a Possessor. Their goal will be to stay alive to see the possessor die. However, they do not have the ability to kill the possessor. Instead, they will exploit the possessor&#39;s abilities to occupy him until he is found.

**Abilities:**
The puppeteer has no day abilities. He has two night abilites:
*Plaything*: (3 charges) Control a body the possessor used to inhabit to confuse (occupy) the possessor, bypassing his immunity. People who died on the poss&#39; first use of &#39;Possess&#39; can also be controlled.
*Playtime*: (2 charges, increases by 1 each time the Puppeteer successfully occupies the Possessor) Choose 2 or 3 people (I am not sure which to go for, or to have it depend on how many charges it has left, e.g c (charges) + 1 people) If one of them is the possessor, they will be occupied. The puppeteer will not be alerted if it was successful. The idea is to give to poss motivation to jump.

Passive:
*Focus*: A puppeter requires the utmost precision and focus. Immunity to occupation an target changing.
*Fair Play*: Can only be killed by possessor

**Other changes:**
Possesor should have a new day ability to counter the Puppeteer. This will be a day ability.
*Mind Field*: (3 charges) Set a mind tarp on a bosy the Puppeteer can control. This will occupy the puppeteer for 2 nights.This could work well with the possessor&#39;s ability to read whispers.
Possessor&#39;s &#39;Possess&#39; ability should be reverted to 3 charges.

**Notes:**
This will bring a little more strategy to the possessor and I think will balance out the fact that BD can&#39;t talk to the dead anymore in a nice, fun and interesting way.</description>

<p>Possessor doesn’t need a counter.  And he already got a pointless nerf by losing a use of Possess.  Why do you think Possessor is too strong?</p>

            <p>Sorry to say but part of the reason they got rid of the CALL OF the dead was because possesor shouldn’t fear mystic. Sorc only has a counter cause they can win with evils. We need to buff NK not nerf them</p>
<p>Why do you think we have NK as occupy immune</p>
