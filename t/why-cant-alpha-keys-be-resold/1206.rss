I mean, if you&#39;ve got X number of keys out there, not sure why it would make a difference to imperium42 about who owns them?

People who have extra keys are giving them away anyway, and now I can&#39;t ask for one without feeling like a parasite.</description>

</aside>
<p>The extra keys are meant to be given away: This is why we had them for so cheap (not for people to resell them). As for why it makes a difference to us, <a href="https://www.google.com.tw/search?q=g2a+indie+game+devs&amp;oq=g2a+indie+game+devs&amp;gs_l=serp.3...10547.10547.0.10953.1.1.0.0.0.0.78.78.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.0.0.8yTNKn3nztI">this is why</a>.</p>
<p>We also want people to <strong>use the keys – not hoard them to resell</strong>. This hurts the population that’s already low for closed Alpha/Beta.</p>
<p>Overall, we’re an indie company and we want people to grow with us that found us early. Also to enter contests means you have <em>some sort of connection</em> to us, and put forth “some type of effort” to get a key (meaning you follow a YouTuber that streams us, you follow our social sites or Discord, etc). Seems like a fair trade for a closed Alpha key.</p>
<p>Begging would also be <a href="http://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-rules-please-read-first/244">against our rules</a> (because begging is annoying and no one wants to see 100 posts of people asking for keys).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don’t beg for keys. If you follow us in as many places as possible, you’ll probably find a key. If not, give us a few months and we’ll be more enjoyable anyway (alpha isn’t necessarily fun - it truly is testing)</p>

            <p>1stly the alpha is meant for people who have backed the Kickstarter so we give them the alpha to thank them for having faith in the game and to make sure its bug free</p>
<p>2ndly if people only gave to the Kickstarter to make money by selling keys. that’s not a very nice thing to do. anyway most people have plenty of keys so most do giveaways and contests and most give them to their friends it’s only selling the keys for money that is what’s frowned upon but giving it as a gift is a nice thing</p>
<p>also asking for a free game is honestly kinda greedy, to be honest. if 1 person gets a free game what about x number of people who did not get one? is it fair on those people?</p>
