    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-class-bard-converted-class-minstrel-v-2/72753</link>
    <description>**Day Ability 1:** Hypnotize (2 Uses)
If [Target 1] uses an ability on you tonight, they will instead target [Target 2]

**Day Ability 2** Private Show (2 uses)
Abilities that target [Target] will also target you

**Night Ability 1:** Lullaby (Unlimited Use)
[Target] will be unable to attack



**Lore:**
Originally an apprentice under the Court Wizard, but was turned away after they failed to show any talent in the use of magic. It was only after they picked up an instrument that they found they had the ability to, quite literally, magically control peoples hearts and minds. They returned to the court, armed with their magical power, still loyal to their king. However, the hatred they harbor to the Court Wizard could be used to turn them against their formal allies...

**Comments:**
Might be a bit too much like the drunk?</description>

<p>Day Ability: Private Show; You and One target will can’t be visited for 1 night<br>
(Message you see: You will invite [Player] to a private show. You will instead invite [Player] to a private show. You have canceled your private show for the night.)<br>
(Message they see: You will receive a private show.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This makes the class instantly able to confirm itself. The notification is not needed and the day ability needs limited charges otherwise it’d be broken.</p>

<p>Somewhat weak for a limited-use ability, tbh.</p>
