    <description>**You’re about to die, cursed the moment you took the clickbait. Chances are, you’re not ready to die. So *Death* offers you a sadistic choice; if you accept his offer, he will extend your life by one week. You are immortal during this life time. However, you can extend it further, by killing.**
**Every time you kill someone, you gain another week of life. You will always know how long you have left. This means you can have a *long* life, of hundreds of years. Or it can end in a single week.**

**The cost -**
* **1** Soul (your own) :slightly_smiling_face:
**This means, once you die, you will not go to an afterlife, if you believe in one, yada yada. You won’t be reincarnated, if you believe in that. It just *ends.***

:skull: *Would you take the deal? How many would you be willing to kill? Let me tell you... **[It Gets Easier](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier)**.*</description>
