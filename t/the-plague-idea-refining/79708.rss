    <title>The Plague [Idea Refining]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-plague-idea-refining/79708</link>
    <description>The Basics:

Players are given 3 character cards. Whoever is the Plague will automatically have the 3 Plague Characters. Everyone else will have the others distributed normally.

&quot;Areas&quot; are places that players send their characters. You can&#39;t send 2 of your characters to the same area. Areas may or may not do something special if you go there.

If a Character&#39;s infection level reaches 5, they die. It will be announced who&#39;s characters die.


Sample Characters:

[details=&quot;Plague&quot;]
&gt; ## The Plague Doctor
&gt; When visiting an area, you will increase the infection level of all non-medicals by 1.
&gt; You cannot be infected

&gt; ## Patient Zero
&gt; You cannot die to the infection.
&gt; Your infection level cannot go below 1.

&gt; ## News Anchor
&gt; When visiting an area, if anyone has an infection level of 3 or more, everyone there will be quarantined. This includes yourself.
[/details]

The Plague wins if all of the Citizens are dead.

[details=&quot;Medical&quot;]
&gt; ## Doctor
&gt; You will cure everyone in the area if no Plague characters are in the area. 
&gt; You will reduce the Infection level of everyone in the area by 1
&gt; If the Plague Doctor is in the area, you will be infected.

&gt; ## Nurse
&gt; You will know how many people are infected in an area, and what the maximum infection level is.
&gt; If Patient Zero is in the area, you will be infected, and you will receive no results.
[/details]

[details=&quot;Citizens&quot;]
&gt; ## Citizen
&gt; You will know if you are infected if your level reaches 2.
[/details]

The Citizens win if the Plague is eradicated.</description>
