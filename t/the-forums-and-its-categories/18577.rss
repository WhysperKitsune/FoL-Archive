    <description># These Forums are a lovely place and full of interesting things! 
Class ideas, Forum games, Deathnotes etc. The one thing I&#39;ve noticed is misplacement for a lot of threads! We won&#39;t warn anybody for posting in the wrong area, but if it becomes a regular occurrence where we have to move a lot of your threads, then we&#39;ll kindly ask you to stop making threads for a while.

**I&#39;ll breakdown our forums into the more known categories.**

# [General](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/general)

The General section is for your average Throne of Lies talk, got a funny game to tell? Wanna talk about how much you enjoy a class? This is where you do it.

# [Classes/Lore](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/classes-roles)

You got a funky new Class idea? Or perhaps want to help tell a story about a class using Lore. This is where you&#39;ll do it.

# [Feedback/Suggestions](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/feedback)

Have an idea for the game and want to share it with everybody, this exists and is where you should be posting any Feedback or Suggestions regarding Throne of Lies! _We also just bumped it up from the bottom of our forum!_

# [Deathnote+Journal Gallery](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/deathnotes)

Saw a funny looking deathnote? Maybe you read someone&#39;s Journal and just had to share it. Post them here!

# [Bug Reports](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/bug-reports)

Been in a buggy situation and need it fixed, make sure you post about it here with your ingame logs! (You can actually get a more speedy response on the discord, but this works too)

# [Forum Matches](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches)

Wanna jump into Forum of Lies and want to play a game that takes up almost a week of your time, this is the place!

# [Off Topic](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/support)

Sick of the ToL talk and wanna talk about your day at school or work? Do it here!</description>
