    <title>[Investigative Class Suggestion] The Matchmaker</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/investigative-class-suggestion-the-matchmaker/70509</link>
    <description>So yeah, I haven&#39;t actually fleshed out a full class yet :stuck_out_tongue:  But what does everyone think about a class who determines whether two people are of the opposite gender?  It wouldn&#39;t have to be strictly about gender of course, we could have some classes who match to the same gender, and even some wildcards who match to any gender.  

I was just trying to think of a way to create an investigative class revolving around gender without it being weird, and I think the Matchmaker concept works right?</description>

<p>The Maid (Unofficial Class)<br>
Blue Dragon Investigative<br>
Service (Day) - Check if the target player has Royal Blood. - 2 uses<br>
Poke Around (Night) - Look in someone’s chambers to determine their class type. - 2 uses<br>
Matchmake (Night) - Try to ‘hook up’ 2 players, you will be told whether they are compatible or not (see below). - Infinite Uses<br>
Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.<br>
Compatibility:<br>
Members of opposing Factions are not compatible<br>
Members of Neutral Factions are compatible with every Neutral Faction that they can win with<br>
Royals are not compatible with each other that would be weird<br>
The King and Fool are not compatible with anyone<br>
The Mercenary is compatible with her target no matter the faction</p>
