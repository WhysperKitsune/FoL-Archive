    <title>Disguise doesn&#39;t work on apostle?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/disguise-doesnt-work-on-apostle/75406</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Was scorned. Disguised apostle as possessor N1. Showed up as apostle when executed.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Apostle showing up as possessor when he got executed.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Disguise apostle (#14) as possessor when playing as Scorned(#5) on N1 ? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a random bug, but it lost me the game pretty quick.
