    <title>Buffing The Cult</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/buffing-the-cult/50807</link>
    <description>Cult needs an ability like Herbalist&#39;s Defile.  I would like to give Ritualist a day ability to choose the class they will appear as if Sacrificed by the Cult Leader.  This will make the class and their passive so much funner to play, and encourage the dead Ritualist to stick around to see the confusion their ability causes.  The current Will of Mithras passive by itself is almost never useful.

An alternative idea is to give them a day ability that defiles themselves if they are executed that day on trial.  This would be an interesting and unique addition to the game.

I also think Invoker&#39;s Bewilder should be able to be used on ANY player, and prevent them from using their day abilities.  In fact I think allowing Bewilder to target any player would be the single best way the game could be improved right now.  The next step would be to give it to Unseen.</description>

            <p>What I would do is add a new Class to Cult (The Unused Killer slot) that can be used in place of Cult Leader’s current sacrifice ability.<br>
Where this Killer can attack someone but will die that night (Even if Occupied or the attacked was immune,)<br>
But then we have to change the Eradicate numbers… which is a mind-boggler.</p>

            <p>They can’t balance the two lobbies separately; that would be absurd, making it harder for new players to switch to the vet lobby and generally making the game twice as hard to balance in general.  They’d have to use the same rules, which would mean that the changes you’re suggesting for the vet lobby only would also have to be assessed for impact in the noob lobby.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Dividing up the player base doesn’t just lead to longer wait times, it also makes the game as a whole more difficult to balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>League of Legends has millions of players but I find a match on Throne of Lies way faster anyway, so doubling the wait time isn’t something that will make me complain.  And the game is not balanced right now, and people who enjoy noob-stomping are actually asking for it to stay this way, so the devs can focus on balancing the vet lobby (and ignore the noob lobby which is more-or-less fine according to the noobs).</p>

            <p>Rather than giving it to the Ritualist, I would suggest making it a basic part of all sacrifices.  Sacrifices don’t happen enough as-is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t find noob-stomping as fun as playing against equally skilled players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that we have to design and balance the game around how it’s actually played.  If it’s divided up into two lobbies, which one does it get balanced for?  (Yes, I know you’re going to say “vet’s lobby” - but the noob lobby would also have to be playable, interesting, and fun.)</p>
<p>Dividing up the player base doesn’t just lead to longer wait times, it also makes the game as a whole more difficult to balance.  If you put something in with the argument that “well, this works fine in the vet lobby” and it’s utterly unfun in the noob lobby, the game will suffer.</p>

            <p>The cult is mostly fine I think. This is a buff used to a rarely used power, so I don’t really see why not.</p>

<p>The cult just needs a complete rework.  The classes themselves aren’t that useful and the cult is to reliant on the CL.  It also should actually be more focused on conversion.  The CL’s conversion mechanic is the same as the mastermind’s.</p>

<p>I really don’t think cult need a buff, personally. Their ability to constantly swap leadership and the maximum of 4 members make them powerful enough already in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The main issue with the cult is that the classes themselves aren’t that useful.  Factions shouldn’t be reliant on a single class.</p>

<p>I think there should somehow be a bigger incentive to sacrifice their own members.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe  when a cult member gets sacrificed they could become an undead equivalent of their class?  They would be a bit stronger than the normal classes, and could possibly modify the normal class’s abilities.</p>

<p>I was also thinking, Paladin Smite should not be usable night 1.  If successful, it always reduces the Cult to a single player.  Compare that with Sheriff scout, which only resets the Unseen to their original numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed.  Paladin and sheriff just need complete reworks.</p>

<p>Also I feel Sheriff/Paladin should be merged into one class. Why should it know the opposing faction?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Or they could be reworked into having different roles.  Sheriff would be based around class/faction checking while magic barrier would be given to Paladin, which would be based around that.  I agree that sheriff and paladin need changes though.</p>

            <p>I can remember it being used once as well.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%.  This would make for some interesting possibilities.  Scorned and Fool could have a day ability that makes their frame do Unseen OR Cult!</p>

            <p>Yeah, but dying to smite = fewer cult members which is exactly what you don’t want.</p>
<p>I’d be happy with Will of Mithras getting used more - I think I’ve seen it used like once?</p>

            <p>The KPN is the same in either case. And I don’t ALWAYS do it. I have a random number generator on hand when I play this game.</p>
