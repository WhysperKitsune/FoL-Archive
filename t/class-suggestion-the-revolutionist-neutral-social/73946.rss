<p>Taking up a BD spawn was to help with their win condition, since taking up a neutral spot would make him have to always side NK.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could note that this class could only spawn when 3 non-NK neuts spawn.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not sure that neutrals <em>should</em> be a faction. They are neutral, after all. They don’t always win with each other, and in some cases need to kill each other in order to meet their wincon.</p>

            <p>Added the unique, I knew I missed something when writing that out.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a class that can make the Neuts into a proper faction.<br>
Taking up a BD spawn was to help with their win condition, since taking up a neutral spot would make him have to <s>always</s> most of the time side NK.</p>
<p>Might scrap the survive part and keep the 2 neuts win, but not a big fan of doing that…</p>

            <p>An incredibly swingy class dependent on what neuts spawn.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The survive 'til [x] clause is incredibly difficult to meet considering there are so many mechanics that make this wincon swingy and unfun to play.</p>
<p>When SS spawns, you are a proxy SS.<br>
When Inq spawns, you are an anti-BD neutral.<br>
When Pretender spawns, good freaking luck. That role is difficult to win with already AS the Pretender.</p>
<p>This class spawning makes it incredibly difficult for BD to win, as not only do they lose a player, but the scum faction gains a player in many cases.</p>
<p>This design ends up being either too unfair for BD, or too unfair for the Revolutionist depending on what changes. In other words, I don’t think this class works conceptually.</p>
