    <title>The Exiled Prince (Neutral Social Class)</title>

    <description>Neutral Social Class
Exiled Prince
Objective: Live to see a King dethroned and claim the throne as your own!

Abilities:
Passives:
Royal Blood
Faithful to the Kingdom: Appear as Blue Dragon for the first 5 days

Day time: (limited)
Sway allegiance! (1 or 2 people?)
Force other player(s) to accuse the king of treason. (They cannot rescind their vote for this trial).

Neuts out! (or &quot;Out With the Old, In With the New&quot;)
Force other neutral players to vote you as king (they cannot

Night time:
Side with me! (limited)
Make another player appear as neutral at night.

(maybe another ability?)

Could use some adjustment in terms of ability usage, but might fill the void of the old Noble class that the devs might have been going for with vote manipulation. It might also give a king a reason to be useful (regardless of faction) or they might be put up for execution letting the exiled prince try to claim the throne!

With Royal Blood, the Exiled Prince will have to claim a class that they can hide behind to appear as a normal BD with Royal Blood and be able to convince others that they should vote for him. Even with the Sway Allegiance ability, they would not be guaranteed a spot for the throne without gaining some trust from other BD.

The Side with Me! ability is there to make king checks potentially kill allies of either side while hunting for the neutral killer, making him susceptible to being executed for treason. 

Or it just might get more neuts killed :( #neutsin</description>
