    <title>More clarity in what is an occupation</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/more-clarity-in-what-is-an-occupation/19347</link>
    <description>Was just seeing in a bug report, someone was having an issue with not knowing debauch being an occupy for the purposes of the mastermind&#39;s redirect. I do think skills of which occupation immunity should have something in their description to make it clearer to new players, that debauch is actually an occupy.

In fact, I do admit, I don&#39;t even know if say things like CW&#39;s tornado etc... counts as an occupy for those purposes either. So yeah absolutely could use some better clarity on that.

Credit to splorch for pointing this issue out.</description>
