    <title>Game Showed me everyone else&#39;s choices</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/game-showed-me-everyone-elses-choices/22230</link>
    <description>I got revived as a deathknight, but then disconnected. When I reconnected I could see everyone else&#39;s choices (ex. &quot;You will have a guard watch over you tonight&quot;), except all the text was in white as opposed to the usual yellow. 

I even saw that &quot;[2] _Name_ will assassinate 10 tonight&quot;, so I guarded him as a deathknight and killed the assassin, winning the game for the BD. 

In addition to this I saw everyone else&#39;s choices, even the dead chat&#39;s predictions of who will die tomorrow.

This was my second game in the 1.0.11d1 patch, haven&#39;t seen it since</description>

            <p>Gonna guess this is a bug in the new chat restore on reconnect function. It restored <em>everyone’s</em> chat to you.</p>
