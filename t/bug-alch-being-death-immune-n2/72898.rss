    <title>[BUG] Alch being death immune n2</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-alch-being-death-immune-n2/72898</link>
    <description>I was playing as alch and without using the stoneskin potion I was death immune, at first I thought it was merc since there was a merc claim but they turned out to be sellsword, also king confirmed he didn&#39;t guard me n2 so I don&#39;t know what happened.
