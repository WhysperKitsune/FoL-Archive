    <title>[Buff] Give Possessor a force-vote ability</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/buff-give-possessor-a-force-vote-ability/70414</link>
    <description>Like the title says, I think the possessor could use a day time force-vote ability like the one the Noble has. It fits the theme of the possessor controlling people and gives him a win condition for when few enough people are left.

Currently the possessor is strong early on, but once you&#39;ve got a handful of people left it&#39;s really hard not to get voted out which makes his early success kinda irrelevant.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Meh, if it were up to me here’s how I’d design the Possessor.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="navy"> The Possessor </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray"> Neutral Killer </font></strong><br>
<strong>Driven (Passive)</strong> - Immune to occupation at night and immune to target changing. Also allows the user to see the contents of all whispers during the day.<br>
<strong>Blackened Shield (Passive)</strong> - Immune to death at night.<br>
<strong>Marionette (Day)</strong> - Force a player to accuse another player and prevent them from voting further. - 3 uses<br>
<strong>Ethereal Leap (Day)</strong> - Choose a target, and if the user is executed at daytime they will use posses on their target, bypassing healing, prevention, and night immunity, while also consuming a charge of Possess if they still have one. If the user survives the day then they will not be able to use any of their abilities during the night and will instead leap into their chosen target. Ethereal Leap is usable during the night if the user is jailed, taking effect regardless if the Possessor is executed by the Prince or not. - 1 use<br>
<strong>Puppet Strings (Night)</strong> - Control a player and force them to kill another. You will also see whispers to and from the controlled player the next day. They will not be aware that they were controlled. Note that they still act normally that night; this does not replace their action. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Possess (Night)</strong> - You will take over a person’s body, leaving your old one behind. Your target can not be healed. The old body will keep the class and logbook you had before. Your first victim will appear as a class of your choice to everyone. The second will appear as the first victim’s class. Additionally, when you possess a player, you will receive their deathnote. Additionally, you will gain your target’s passive while in their body. - 3 uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from making him far more slippery than the current iteration and giving him a very strong late-game similar to the Reaper, and countering the poss code strategy as a whole, the new Possessor also dis-encourages the whisper meta and can also fake-claim Noble as long as the King doesn’t die.</p>

            <p>He already has enough staying power earlygame. His problem is that he cannot win in endgame scenario’s. Either against scum with passwords, or a lone king that can just guard and doublevote him out. The former is kind of the Possessor’s fault for not killing a balanced amount of scum/BD. The latter is something that should be fixed in my opinion. Your suggestion is not going to achieve that. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>Would it be bad to give him a ability that makes him unvoteable for that day so he can jump away the next?</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p>Day Ability 2-Faceless (new name plz)-Make yourself unvoteable for today-1 use</p>
<p>Honestly that would be a great buff imo</p>

            <p>Make it work such that forcing the target to vote the king is possible and Possessor can finally win in the endgame scenario. Fits also with Possessor archetype. Don’t give it too many uses though or it will become similar to a reaper chill endgame scenario that will skyrocket Possessor’s winrate. He has most trouble at the endgame as opposed to earlygame, where he can always jump away from a bad spot.</p>

            <p>Agreed.  Would this be good?</p>
<p>Bribe(3 use)(day) - Control your target’s vote or accusation.  Prevents them from voting and accusing for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Political Pressure should also be changed to this.</p>

            <p>Make possesor have that.</p>
<p>And also make sure that you can use day abilities before other people can officially start voting. Like a 5 sec in between day starting and able to use day abilities and voting</p>

            <p>Like the title says, I think the possessor could use a day time force-vote ability like the one the Noble has. It fits the theme of the possessor controlling people and gives him a win condition for when few enough people are left.</p>
<p>Currently the possessor is strong early on, but once you’ve got a handful of people left it’s really hard not to get voted out which makes his early success kinda irrelevant.</p>
