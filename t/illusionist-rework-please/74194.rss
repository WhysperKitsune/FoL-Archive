    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/illusionist-rework-please/74194</link>
    <description>So new Illusionist is not fun.  I was converted midgame when the last investigative died.  I had literally nothing to do the rest of the game.  Just exist.

Please buff Mindwarp or replace Mental Blur</description>

            <p>MindWarp does need need to be reverted imo.</p>
<p>But Illusionist doesn’t need a complete rework, just mental Blur change</p>
<p>Like I said many times Mental blur feels like a ability out of beta that somehow still got into the final version of the game.</p>

            <p>Thematics != lore.  Each class should have a single theme that its abilities are focused around.  Prevents it from being too confusing and helps future balancing.  If every class was a JOAT then what would be the point of having class types?</p>

            <p>I see that it would be far more fun too, but I’m not sure there’s a way to do it within the UI of the game. If you make it so the Illu can type the feedback instead then it requires full knowledge and correct spelling of the system messages, or else it would be found out. You would also have to put in player names yourself, wrong targets would mess it up.</p>
<p>If you can find a way to do it, then /support 100%</p>

            <p>What about a slightly more simplified version: Mental Blur makes the target think they were occupied (ability still succeeds/fails normally), and all feedback they would receive is received by the Illusionist instead. Occupy immune players would still see their abilities feedback, but no other feedback (heals, attacks, etc.) and would see that somone tried to occupy them.</p>
<p>It would mean all occupation feedback would need to be changed to include mental blur though.</p>
<p>Mystic and Illusionist are now occupy immune (I believe?) so it could make butler a viable fake claim.</p>
