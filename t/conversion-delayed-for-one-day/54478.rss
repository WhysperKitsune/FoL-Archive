    <title>Conversion delayed for one day</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/conversion-delayed-for-one-day/54478</link>
    <description>Playing as Mastermind, I converted a Sheriff. That player was still displaying a Sheriff portrait (even though he was &quot;Marshal&quot; in the list) and could still use Sheriff abilities for a day. Then I got exed (:() and he became an Assassin normally.

At the end of that game, the table displaying player names was also completely bugged (it was just a list of &quot;Player name, Start Class, Final Cass, User name&quot; repeated 16 times). Gold was displayed as &quot;you earned %GP% gp&quot; instead of the amount I won.

            <p>IIRC he tried to use Scout, but I’ll have to confirm with him. Normally I would have been able to ask him tomorrow since I talk with him regularly, but now he’s abroad for a couple of weeks, so I won’t be able to get more information about that bug for a while <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
