    <title>Assassin&#39;s distract ability changes</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassins-distract-ability-changes/35403</link>
    <description>I think assassin&#39;s distract ability is probably one of the weakest abilities in the whole game, 10 seconds without talking is not that useful, and you cannot use it while someone is on trial. I have some suggestions to make the ability better:

- Suggestion 1: Make the person not know they have been distracted and instead of being unable to send messages, no one else will see the messages they send for its duration. 

- Suggestion 2: Make the distracted person unable to hear what others say as well as not being able to talk for the duration, like a mini reaper chill.

I understand this could be a buff for the assassin who might be in an ok spot right now, but I think distract should feel rewarding since it has a lot of potential, and if it turns out too powerful you could lower its uses or the uses of his other day ability to compensate.</description>

            <p>I feel like it would fit in well on Marshal, with the inclusion of being able to use it on trials.</p>

            <p>I think Assassin is in a good place right now. That being said, Distract is kind of useless. I rarely see anyone use it, whereas I’ve been victim to some really well-timed Chills. Poisoning during the day is a really strong ability - distract could be taken out of the game and the Assassin would still be pretty strong.</p>

            <p>Distract does serve a purpose at the moment, if only a small one. It increases the amount of time BD must give to people presenting logs, since if they are slow they can claim to have been distracted by the assassin. But even if that is the ability’s only purpose, then I think it should be changed to make it actually usable. The current text may as well read “you cannot poison anyone today”.</p>

            <p>I mean, it is balanced, but I don’t think it’s because of Distract - does anyone ever use it?  At all?</p>
<p>If Assassins are fine but Distract is underpowered and never used, it might make sense to remove it from Assassins (where it isn’t doing anything) and give it to a class that needs it more, possibly buffing it in the process.  There’s no point in wasting an ability somewhere where it’s not accomplishing anything.</p>

            <p>Does the Assassin as a whole really need to be buffed, though?  I mean, you mentioned that you recognize it might not need it, but…  isn’t that the main thing to consider?  Distract IMHO isn’t supposed to be a strong or impactful ability.</p>

            <p>I’d really like it if “Distract” would be useable during trial. 10 seconds might be enough to prevent someone from posting logs and forcing an execute.</p>
