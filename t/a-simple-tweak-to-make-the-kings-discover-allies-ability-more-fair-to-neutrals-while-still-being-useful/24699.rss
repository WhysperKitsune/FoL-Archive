    <title>A simple tweak to make the King&#39;s Discover Allies ability more fair to Neutrals while still being useful</title>

I believe the way the ability used to be months ago was pretty solid until it was able to identify exactly what faction a player was from.

My suggestion is basically to revert it back to that for all King&#39;s and possibly tack on discovering whether or not they have Royal blood, too.

Image example in table form of a King checking a particular player and the result they get depending on their faction:
![kingtable|690x154](upload://zZ7m4e3BImmF5go8y2vCLkn9jli.jpg)

This would be much more fair to Neutral&#39;s and possibly boost Neutral Killer&#39;s win-rates slightly too. I&#39;ve seen too many games where a King finds a neut with their check and immediately puts them up for trial the following day. &gt;.&gt;

_Side note: Yes, this would make Neutral King&#39;s MUCH less useful for investigating, but most of the ones I see just guard themselves anyway and let BD/Unseen slog it out until they can vote with the majority to determine the winner._</description>

            <p>based on that table, neut king would be useless. This would just make BD lynch all neut king claimers</p>

            <p>I liked royal blood king sort of. Finding royal blood did shit for the game. Also kings were boring as fuck all to play. Not.to mention with the kings out d4 meta it really made playing king dumb and boring. Alot of early leavers who were king. I wouldn’t play 30 minutes in a game where I did nothing and had no real control since everyone looks to king on this game on how to wipe their own ass.</p>
<p>I said it awhile back. King checks and basically all investigators checks should allow you to check 2 or 3 people and it says whether one of them is evil or none of them is evil. It should never say whether someone is neutral and it should never say 2 or 3 were evil. If all were evil on check then you only get one confirmation l. Use deduction to find who.</p>
<p>This makes the game rely on princesses and outted evil to find that NK.</p>

<p>Or we could just… not let King investigate</p>

</aside>
<p>While I agree with you orange, and honestly I thought the game was much better in the 3 days of “royal blood”. We can’t have nice things…</p>
<p>That being said, I do preffer my old suggestion of just lump Neuts and BD together. This form kind of creates the evil king trap. IE evil king can’t even take the chance of whispering a fellow cult/unseen, as that might be an alc/merc/inq/NK. Also he can’t risk calling anyone out, as if he is the accuser of an actual neutral he’s proven evil king.</p>
<p>My personal preference (assuming we can’t get rid of investigations without having the change reverted on us) would be to make the kings checks semi-sheriff/pali like. with only 2 in 16 things to hit… it isn’t exactly going to be shocking when he doesn’t find things half the time.</p>
