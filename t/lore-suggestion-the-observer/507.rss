    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Observer</title>

Lore Subject: The birds and the believes

Lore: The faithful observer always in the hawks nest. The Blue Dragon have long trained those who have the ability to see whether that be as a magician or a sightseer. The kingdom will often employ those in the habits of bird watching or in the rare occasion those who spy on their fellow townsfolk. The key to an observers craft is patience and an acute affinity with our avian feathered friends. An Observer in the employ of the king is required to have a sharp mind, analytical prowess and the attention to detail of an accountant. Known as the eyes of the king the observer serves as a deterrent for all matters of injustice either through their testimony or his log which is kept side by side with their will. Although most deem the observer as untrustworthy mainly due to their penchant of looking in the room of the prince or princess for less than noble reasons. As such proving his status to other members of the court has become a tiring but necessary part of his schedule one which a converted Black Rose Nightwatchman often uses to their unique advantage. 

Comments: Nothing too major here. Just an explanation of their attributes and typical behaviour patterns. Added in joke on them spying on royalty in their rooms for the Hyucks. Made mention of the Nightwatchman taking advantage of the dubious nature of a observer claim. Title is a play on the fact that an observer is hard to trust just on claim alone.</description>
