            <p>Nice! I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/b_psycho2">@B_Psycho2</a>, about the Mama part. I do think it could be updated to something like “An Alchemist’s Guide to Authentic Home-brewed Crimson Potion”. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wine_glass.png?v=9" title=":wine_glass:" class="emoji" alt=":wine_glass:"> <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It could, but I’m unsure you could legally change your last name at the time, and it’s highly unlikely anyone would. Especially to match their occupation.</p>
<p>Not trying to step on anyone’s toes here, but… you know. names.</p>

            <p>I think it’s very good, but I don’t exactly like calling the Alchemist “Mama Alchemist”</p>
<p>Don’t know what name would fit, but a name would do, given that Alchemist is a profession and not a name.</p>
