    <description># Problem?

I feel like ever since the introduction of Little Birds, BD&#39;s win rate has taken a hit. I would imagine this is mainly due to the fact that, without the whisper meta, it&#39;s pretty difficult for investigatives to coordinate with other BD without outting themselves. I certainly don&#39;t like the idea of open claim meta becoming dominant.

# Solution?

It seems like the most straightforward solution is to provide BD with some mechanism to share information anonymously (their class may be displayed but not their number).

 Currently, the Mystic can do this through telepathy and the prince can technically do it by asking their jailed player to relay info, but the mystic is not a required class and is capped at 1 per match and the prince method is pretty roundabout. Also both of these methods face the same big problem that king whisper meta had, they rely very heavily upon the skill of just one player.

The lightest touch solution would be to simply require a mystic in every game as it used to be. This way, each game would have a built-in mechanism for investigatives to share their important leads without outting themselves. Downside is that less experienced players may not fill the information sharing role very well.

Alternatively, a more radical solution that I could imagine is some sort of notice board that operates through a night ability allowing investigatives to anonymously post feedback results from one past night of their choosing. This solution would obviously have pretty far reaching implicaitons which I certainly have not thought through completely.


What do you think? Is anonymous information sharing between BD even a problem that needs solving? If it is, what do you think is the best solution?</description>

<p>Open claim != Mass claim</p>

</aside>
<p>True, but without an anonymous communication mechanism, it leads to a meta where investigatives will stay quiet until they are sure they’ve found an evil. This shifts the game towards luck because it’s basically chance if that sure-thing lead comes N1 or N6.</p>
<p>With anonymous communication, it becomes worth it to share less than 100% leads, such as finding someone k/o or an obs seeing a suspicious visit. With more leads that are non-conclusive being shared, it opens the game up to less chance and more strategizing.</p>
