    <title>Rainbow static death animation</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rainbow-static-death-animation/79510</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

1st, when looking at a death animation, it was essentially rainbow static.
When logging back in, I was booted out again

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to not crash and see the animation as intended

#### Steps to reproduce:
1: Look at a death animation
2: crash
3: Crash again by logging in.

#### Comments:
