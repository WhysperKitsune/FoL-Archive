[i]Welcome to Minority Rule! The rules are pretty simple. I will present you a choice of several rooms—just choose one to enter! If you pick the room with the most people, you will all meet a horrible demise![/i]

[Minority Rule Hub](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/minority-rule-hub/16444)

[b][color=#0040FF]How to play?[/color][/b]
Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. if you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated. If there is a tie, then both rooms are considered a majority and players who picked both are eliminated.  The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. Do **/Join** to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me.

[b][color=cyan]Length of phases:[/color][/b]
Phases will processed a short while after everybody picks a room. If after 48 hours you haven&#39;t made a choice, you will be prodded. If 24 hours pass after that without a selection, you will be placed in the super-secret Death room and modkilled in the most brutal of fashions.

## Potential Rooms
**[color=skyblue]Air [/color]** - A random picker becomes light.
**[color=#801080]Betrayal [/color]**- If this room is tied for the minority, it gains infinite picks and becomes the majority.
**[color=black]Death [/color]**- Everyone who picks this dies, even if it is not the majority.
**[color=#DFDFDF]Dice [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status.
**[color=#BFBF00]Divide [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as half.
**[color=lightbrown]Earth [/color]**- A random picker becomes heavy.
**[color=#800000]Evil [/color]**- All pickers become cursed.
**[color=#FF00FF]False [/color]**- This room does nothing, but it takes the name of another random room.
**[color=##EFEFEF]Flux [/color]**- If this room is the minority, half of its pickers will change to the room with the second-most number of pickers in it.
**[color=#8000FF]Force [/color]**- A random person who did pick this will change to a random room in the current pool.
**[color=#BF0080]Gravity [/color]**- A random person who did not pick this will change to this room.
**[color=Cornflowerblue]Holy [/color]**- A random picker becomes a saint. All other pickers become cursed.
**[color=#800080]Illusion [/color]**- This room takes the effect of another secret item before the start of the round.
**[color=#808080]Insanity [/color]**- A random picker becomes insane.
**[color=#00BFFF]Life [/color]**- If nobody picks this, everybody dies.
**[color=green]Luck [/color]**- If this room is the majority, then one random picker will survive. If this is not the majority, then one random picker will die.
**[color=#000080]Majority[/color]** - If this room is the majority, the items with the second most votes will be the majority.
**[color=#FFBF40]Multiply [/color]**- Everyone who picks this counts as two.
**[color=sienna]Mundane [/color]**- This room literally does nothing.
**[color=dark]Murder [/color]**- One random picker becomes a Serial Killer
**[color=darkred]Mystery [/color]**- Everyone who picks this is given a random status. They are not informed which status they received.
**[color=#505050]Permanency [/color]**- If picked by anyone, this room will also be in the pool for the next round. Once this room is the majority, it is removed from the pool for all future rounds.
**[color=#509090]Protection [/color]**- All pickers are immune to death this round for any reason other than the majority. A random picker becomes a bodyguard.
**[color=#0080FF]Purity [/color]**- Everyone who picks this loses all statuses.

**[color=Steelblue]Secrecy[/color]** - All pickers become cultists.

## Potential Statuses

[color=Steelblue]Cultist[/color] - If there are any cultists, then there will be an item that only its members may pick. It will be denoted in [brackets].
[color=#804080]Cursed[/color] - You will die next round unless your status is removed or your death is prevented. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=lightbrown]Heavy[/color] - Your pick counts as two picks for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.
[color=#FF0000]Healthy[/color] - You cannot die for any reason except for the majority. Once your death is prevented by this status, this status will be removed.
[color=#808080]Insane[/color] - You must pick the majority or you will die.
[color=skyblue]Light[/color] - You do not count as a picker for the next round. This status is removed afterwards.

            <p>The most unfun rooms I saw so far were Majority and Gravity.<br>
Majority is either False and screws everyone up, or a safe haven.<br>
Gravity influences people in other rooms and there is nothing you can do to avoid it.<br>
Then…<br>
Some rooms and combinations are just horrible when there only two left,<br>
especially Gravity/Majority(sry you can pick what you want, RNG will screw you), Anything/Death(obvious),<br>
Majority/Life(uhhh)</p>

            <p>Yeah Gravity dicked over a bunch of people in this game, but that’s kind of the nature of Minority Rule, everyone knows there’s a dose of RNG involved in everything.<br>
Might be worth looking into though.</p>

            <p>Hmm I still think that Gravity is one of the most unfair rooms in the game.</p>
<p>Even if you pick right…<br>
Gravity pulls you in for the loss sometimes.</p>
