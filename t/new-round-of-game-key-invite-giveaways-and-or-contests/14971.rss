    <title>New Round of Game Key/Invite Giveaways and/or Contests</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-round-of-game-key-invite-giveaways-and-or-contests/14971</link>
    <description>I know a lot of us missed the Alpha days when game keys were being given out but there has been an influx of new players and I really want to help spread the love of this game.  Also, what better way to think about doing new giveaways during the holidays coming up?

Do we have anything in the works for new giveaways?  I really want to give my friends an opportunity to play but they are procrastinating because of the $9.99 fee (I know its small but people are wanting to spend money on others thing right now like BF2, X-mas Shopping etc etc)

Edit TL:DR:  This topic is not mainly asking for handouts, I really want to spread the love on this game and I think with the holidays just around the corner, a new round of Contests and Giveways would be perfect!</description>

<p>Pls don’t beg for keys, then report someone that calls you out for it O_o</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rope, money is great, money also helps make a great game better, but we’re not doing it <em>just</em> for the money – although it helps all situations. Many other games only care about the money, while we care about both money AND the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve given away thousands of keys. We still do, just indirectly (yet everywhere – follow your favorite content creators or <span class="hashtag">#events</span> in Discord). If what we offer for 10 bucks isn’t worth it to you or not worth the time to seek out a key, perhaps this isn’t the game for you, mate. We’ve spent about 10 hours a day for the past 2 years making this game – what it’s worth to <em>you</em> is  a personal decision.</p>
</li>

            <p>RopeStringFace the devs gave free keys to veterans just for sticking around early on the games development. trust me they are not in this for the money they want to make a great game. getting money simply lets them work full time</p>

            <p>I am explaining why they don’t want to give away free keys. It is because they want to make money from the game they worked hard on</p>
<p>I am almost certain the only way they will give keys if it is to streamers so they will play the game and give it publicity (they might also give extra keys to the streamers to give away for free for more hype around the game)</p>

            <p>Are YOU  a commie? As far as I am concerned anyone asking for free keys (without planning on giving them away on a stream as that is pretty capitalistic) is a commie, and anyone supporting the beggars (you) are also communists.</p>

            <p>oh I’m not discounting money for the devs; that’s why suggestion <span class="hashtag">#3</span> would work, buy 1 game key get 1 free and this isn’t about communism or capitalism (I don’t know what country you are from but I am from USA where Capitalism is respected) this is about simple contests or giveaways, why you hating on contests/giveaways, you’re acting like this is a new strategy for most gaming companies, heck even the smallest of indie companies are doing it and I’m just suggesting something to tie in the holiday spirit, slow your roll dude because it’s coming across toxic man.  Nothing but love here &lt;3</p>

            <p>The game is recent but has many players</p>
<p>keys were given away because they didn’t have enough players, but now several games happen constantly. The devs want money, why give away the product they worked hard to make for free? this isn’t communism</p>

            <p>I’m not begging.  I was just asking about Contests and/or giveaways for more support of this game.  Most games do this to gain more support when they are new and they usually do like contests, giveways, social media contests etc etc, trust me if I had the money to buy everyone a key I would.</p>
<p>So back to the main point of this thread; suggestions below maybe?</p>
<ol>
<li>The best deathnote contest (Must be manually drawn and not macros) - Receive 2 free game keys</li>
<li>Social Media contest.  Like the facebook page =  1 contest entry, tweet the contest = 1 contest entry.  10 random winners will all receive 2 game keys.</li>
<li>ToL double gifts event.  If you purchase a game for a friend receive a free game key to give to another friend.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few suggestions for the Devs.</p>

            <p>I know a lot of us missed the Alpha days when game keys were being given out but there has been an influx of new players and I really want to help spread the love of this game.  Also, what better way to think about doing new giveaways during the holidays coming up?</p>
<p>Do we have anything in the works for new giveaways?  I really want to give my friends an opportunity to play but they are procrastinating because of the $9.99 fee (I know its small but people are wanting to spend money on others thing right now like BF2, X-mas Shopping etc etc)</p>
<p>Edit TL:DR:  This topic is not mainly asking for handouts, I really want to spread the love on this game and I think with the holidays just around the corner, a new round of Contests and Giveways would be perfect!</p>
