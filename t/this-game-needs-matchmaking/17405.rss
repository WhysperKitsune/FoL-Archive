    <title>This game needs matchmaking</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/this-game-needs-matchmaking/17405</link>
    <description>There needs to be a matchmaking type system in place. It is incredibly frustrating to play with new players or someone who is new to the class. Make a tryout test like heroes of the storm does with champs or something. I think this will decrease some of the toxicity. Right now the people are ruining the fun and the game. 

Side note: can you change princes exe to only exe if it&#39;s evil and if it&#39;s bd then they still lose their executes. Too many princes who throw by executing clear bd and even say it before executing.</description>

</aside>
<p>“Fun” is subjective, I find that esports tryhard kids ruin the “fun” of the game but that’s just my opinion.</p>

<p>Omnicent killers are worse than gamethrowers. Knight only works because he kills himself and even then I feel like it would be better if he just killed his target and didn’t die.</p>

<p>If it worked like that, Knights could gamethrow like hell. We don’t want to give people that opportunity.</p>
<p>But if we made Prince Omniscient, we’d have to make him suicide, and that’s no good.</p>

            <p>Also I want to say there should be a bigger delay between text inputs. Sometimes it is way to hard to keep up with chat because people can enter text multiple times in a second or two. That has to be limited to like once every 5 seconds.</p>
