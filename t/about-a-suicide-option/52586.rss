    <title>About a suicide option</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/about-a-suicide-option/52586</link>
    <description>I am nearly certain that have been suggesting multiples times, but I think there should be a suicide option for certain evils. in order to give there team a chance to keep fighting. 

One exemple is the mm,. if the mm is found night 2, he&#39;ll be executed day 4 and jailed two nights, essentially ruinning any chance the unseen might have to win this game.  But, if the mm leave the games, he will suicide night 3 and there will be a new mm, which is not found, (in the assassin in most cases.) which will give the unseen a chance to keep fighting for a win. Which is strange, because normally. leaving the game while being alive should be reportable, so in no occasion it should be a good move. 

Many players say its a good move to wait until day 4, to exe the mm, But i think this is a gamebreaking move. Its not always easy to claim classes and win when you are unseen, especially without the evil king, so without conversion you may as well give up.

another exemple, if when find we the assassin very soon, we can jail him 3 nights and if we have drunk or butler occupy him multiple times, which would give our investigatives many nights to find every members of the unseen. and the unseen, unless they someone how free the assassin or the nk come in the picture to assist them, will never be in the game, Because none of the other roles can directly kill the BD, only the sellsword can kill someone and her ability is limited to one kill. Also, as long as the assassin is not dead, the unseen will not gain new converts if they already has one.

What I am saying, here, is that we need to think about solutions, to prevent players from using strategy that would totally remove any chance the unseen or the cult might have to win. 
one option is to give evil classes ability to suicide, when they are caught.</description>

            <p>I mean, “random suicide out of the blue” would be pretty glaringly obvious gamethrowing, so I don’t think it would be hard to get them reported and banned if they keep doing it.</p>
<p>One advantage ToL has over ToS is that, since it’s not free to play, being banned actually means something.  They don’t need to design or balance around unambiguous gamethrowing; they can just ban the people who do it and they’ll stay banned.</p>

            <p>there always a spot availlable at the start</p>
<p>hoverer, we are talking a situation where assassin is found and become a liability to the unseen. you can’t convert because you already have a Marshal or Duchess or what ever, (that is not enforcer or sell sword, because these two classes can protect the assassin from the drunks and butler. but not from the prince)</p>
<p>at this point, the assassin killing himself, would grant the unseen a opportunity to kill as well as a window to converts some BD.</p>

            <p>Also the absolute limit on how long a single player can be prevented from doing actions is 10 days. That’s a long time sure but it requires:</p>
<p>2 drunks. One of which debs you 3 times (if you are assassin)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The prince to Jail you 3 times in a row</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>each of the 2 drunks to HH you one at a time</p>
<p>all in order</p>
<p>if you are a CL it needs to be a butler in step 1.</p>

            <p>we are simply taking about evils classes… here. which means</p>
<p>Mastermind<br>
Assassin<br>
Cult Leader</p>
<p>the lock on assassin is an annoying as the mm being found, as you cannot kill anyone, nor convert while the found assassin is alive, meanwhile, BD have tons of time to find you</p>

            <p>Okay, here’s the pros and cons from my perspective.</p>
<p>Pros:<br>
More people will suicide instead of going afk, which allows for faster replacement.</p>
<p>The mm will be replaced more regularly.</p>
<p>Cons:<br>
It’ll have to be a day ability, so sometimes you’ll think you’ll be jailed that night and suicide too early.</p>
<p>Having a suicide button will increase the amount of gamethrowing unseen.</p>
<p>It might not even be that effective, as a player who deduces you as the mm will be quiet about it until d4.</p>

            <p>It seems good, but we have to be extremely cautious with this. Otherwise important classes might just game throw by dying when it isn’t helpful.</p>
