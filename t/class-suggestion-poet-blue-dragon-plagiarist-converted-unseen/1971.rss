    <title>[Class Suggestion] Poet (Blue Dragon) &amp; Plagiarist (Converted Unseen)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-poet-blue-dragon-plagiarist-converted-unseen/1971</link>
    <description>**Poet** (Blue Dragon) - A prolific author capable of raising spirits and crushing egos.

Passive 1:
**Silver Tongue** - Your chat cannot be silenced or blurred.

Day Ability 1:
**Mocking Limerick** - Cause your target to lose confidence in themselves, preventing them of accusing anyone of treason for the remainder of the day. Single use, refreshed back to 1 use if a Blue Dragon is executed.

Night Ability 1:
**The Play&#39;s the Thing** - Single use. Convert a Neutral King to Blue Dragon. If the King is evil, this will of course fail and the King will secretly be told your name and class. (You are NOT told if your ability converted the King or not, obviously.)

Night Ability 2:
**Slings and Arrows** - Limited use. The next day, your target can be tried for treason at a reduced vote requirement. (For example, 2/3 or 1/2 the number of votes normally needed.)

Lore: The beloved poet laureate of a far off kingdom, your services have been lent to Castle Adiart in the hopes your beautiful words will soften recent dark events. Due to your skeptical, sharp nature, you are adept at manipulating political doings with a few simple statements.

Comments: Pretty self-explanatory, I guess. I like the idea of a class that can effectively manipulate the entire voting process based on what they believe to be true.


When the Poet is converted to Unseen, he becomes...

**Plagiarist** (Unseen) - An unrepentant liar and thief of others&#39; works.

Day Ability 1:
**Passed Blame** - Limited use. Any day actions used on you will instead happen to the player you select. (Does not include votes, etc.)

Day Ability 2:
**Red Ink** - Single use. You may edit the journal of a dead Blue Dragon member. (It displays correctly to everyone on the player&#39;s death, then immediately afterward you can edit it. Everyone will see your version when they click to check it again. Use to sneakily change numbers and names, or just to blank out information in total. Doesn&#39;t work on non-BD players.)

Night Ability 1:
**Misattribution** - Limited use. Anyone who would normally see the Unseen committing an act at night will instead see your target&#39;s name doing it.

Lore: Ousted by the royal family after an off-color joke about the Queen&#39;s undergarments, you have found yourself on hard times. Theft and cheap misdirection have taken the place of originality and cutting wit.

Comments: Not much to say here. A general &quot;sneaky piece of crap!&quot; role.</description>

<p>even thought you aren’t told I really don’t like this, noone should truly be able to know the king’s faction(except, like, if he was a Noble, but I digress) and although you don’t know for sure you have much better odd than others</p>
<p>also multiple poets doing this to multiple kings is ick</p>
<p>the rest is good though</p>
