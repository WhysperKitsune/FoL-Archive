    <description># Catgirl Bomb Nightless - Burnt Tail
![image|217x231, 75%](upload://em152y4jXPPSCEV18tKCbl9b19c.png)

**And its &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;sinners&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; hosts @Italy and @Amelia**
&lt;small&gt;(and alt modded by @katze)&lt;/small&gt;

# The Rules:

1. Obey the [Global Forum Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) and the [Forum of Mafia Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926)
2. Do not, under any circumstance, reveal your true identity or publicly speculate on the identity of a player.
3. Do not claim your flavor in the thread.

# The Setup:

**[color=green]9 Vanilla Town[/color]**
**[color=red]3 Mafia Goons[/color]**


[details=&quot;Example Town Classcard&quot;]
&gt; # [color=green]Town Catgirl[/color]
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;**[color=green]Vanilla Town[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;After defeating the doggirls, you have finally established yourself as the superior domesticated animalistic humans.
But now, they&#39;ve finally moved to take their revenge, and they&#39;ve planted bombs to back theirselves up, too!
Fortunately, you&#39;ve all devised a great plan to defeat them. Planting even more bombs!
At any point during the day, you may choose to kill the player seated in front of you by submitting **/detonate** in thread. You must wait 24 hours before doing this again.
&gt;
&gt;*You win when you defeat the doggirls.*
[/details]

[details=&quot;Example Mafia Classcard&quot;]
&gt; # [color=red]Mafia Doggirl[/color]
&gt;
&gt;![image|553x500, 50%](upload://gwNSFEGJYYjWeFBpGBNQreZTiIw.jpeg) 
&gt;
&gt;**[color=red]Mafia Goon[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;Ever since your defeat at the hands of those pesky catgirls, you&#39;ve been planning your revenge, and now you&#39;ve finally discovered a way.
Explosives!
At any point during the day, you may choose to kill the player seated in front of you by submitting **/detonate** in thread. You must wait 24 hours before doing this again.
&gt;
&gt;*You win when you reach parity with the catgirls.*
[/details]

# The Gameplay:

Days are 48 hours.

Eliminations are both plurality and majority. Voting yourself and no elimination are not a valid vote.

The game is anonymous. That means that every player will be on an alternate account. (and yes we&#39;re going to dress them up as catgirls)

Each player has a bomb, armed and ready to explode.

Everyone will be given a detonator to the person directly in front of them, publicly.

Any player may type **/detonate** and ping a host to kill the player in front of them.

Any player who detonates the person in front of them will be given the detonator that person held, and cannot detonate again for another 24 hours.

During pregame, the mafia may choose what detonators they want. They can take up to two mafia detonators, and if they do not pick, it will be left up to chance.

The game is nightless, meaning that there is no factional kill, and the day will immediately start after an elimination, or if the time runs out.

**If parity is reached, the game is immediately over.**

**Votes are not reset or locked in LyLo, nor are bombs disabled.**

<blockquote>
<h2>Professional Tip from your favorite katze:</h2>
<p>To make playing on an alt easier and reduce the chances of accidentally posting/typing on your main account, I highly recommend you do one of the following two things:</p>
<p><strong>A: Play this game (and other alt-games) on a different browser</strong> <em>(or in incognito/private mode)</em><br>
<strong>B: Use a browser extension such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox Multi-Account Containers </a>.</strong> There is probably an equivalent of this extension on Chrome as well, but I can only <em>personally</em> advocate for the Firefox one.</p>
<p>Regardless of which above option you choose (if any), I believe it is <em>nearly essential</em> to have a different site theme on your alternative account. If you use Dark mode, I’d recommend using Light, or Amber if you’re careful. I do not take responsibility for any blindness afflicted doing this.</p>
<p><small>This is doubly important if you are stupid like me and somehow post on the wrong account despite having a different theme and container.</small></p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Bonus tip from your local nerd:</h2>
<p>If you mute the game thread on your main account, and mute other threads on your alt account, you’re less likely to post on the wrong one</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>Bonus tip from an alt mod (that has dealt with a lot of alts) but not this games alt mod:</h2>
<p>Change the theme on the alt to make sure u know ur on ur alt</p>
