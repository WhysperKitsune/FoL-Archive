    <title>[UI/Interface Suggestion] Have a filter field on the classes menu</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ui-interface-suggestion-have-a-filter-field-on-the-classes-menu/5662</link>
    <description>I believe that having the option to type in certain keywords, names, abilities, etc and have it highlight matching classes would be a huge benefit to the game. 

The classes button in the main menu itself is denoted with a search icon, and the box with the class name to be in what looks like a search box, implying I could type something in to quickly find what I&#39;m looking for, it was disappointing to learn that I couldn&#39;t.

It would be quicker to figure out what classes are of a specific type or check to see which units are or can become occupy immune, so players wouldn&#39;t miss key information during daytime debates.

It would also massively help newer player, as it makes the task of trying to remember each role less daunting.

If this was already in the works, I do apologize for rehashing this topic. Cheers.</description>
