    <title>Expanding Assassin Promotion Time</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/expanding-assassin-promotion-time/3314</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a player by the name of MRSA and I bought the game on launch, I enjoyed it alot but there is one thing that seemed to bug me alot, people in the discord agreed with me too.

This is a buff to Unseen, not Cult, since this topic always applies there. 

My suggestion is expanding the time in which Mastermind can die, and the Assassin will be promoted to Mastermind. My reasoning for this is while Mastermind&#39;s investigation immunity lasts 3 nights, it&#39;s fine, it still feels justified to get caught out as Mastermind night 4 or night 5. The promotion period in which Mastermind can die and the Assassin will get promoted is the same as the investigation immunity, 3 nights. Rarely will the Mastermind die night 1 - night 3, as the only way they&#39;ll most likely get caught out is a bad lie, a neutral killer outting them, or a reaper choosing to bypass night immunity. But, when your Mastermind gets called out night 4, 5, or even 6, it completely cripples the unseen. They can no longer win except in very specific scenarios. It feels terrible to be Unseen and lose your mastermind night 4, since you are usually stuck with 2 members, and a slip up by one of them means death. 

The ideas proposed by the discord members and myself was to expand the assassin promotion time from 3 nights, to 5 or 6 nights. This ensures that the Unseen will be able to make it through early-mid game, and that if the Mastermind dies Night 7, it will be late enough in the game that the Unseen will have a chance, but not too late as to unseen are already dominating the courtroom. 

I could be missing some pivotal part of this balance, but from most people you talk to, this buff to Unseen is deserved, and it would be much more fun to play as Unseen with these changes. Please take some time to consider implementing this suggestion, and if not, tell us why, maybe we&#39;re all just bad at the game.

            <p>That is true. Maby it should just be a lone Assassin? It would accomplish all of the points it’s supposed to address still.</p>

            <p>I don’t think this is a good solution to your problem. Eliminating the MM does cripple the unseen but it also gives the BD counter play vs the Unseen. In a cult game conversations are almost impossible to stop and things can drag on too much.</p>
<p>I do however agree that the unseen should get a fighting chance without the Mastermind. I propose that the assassin should get a passive that gives him night and occupy immunity when the Mastermind is dead. This may not sound like much but hear me out.</p>
<p>A: It isn’t something that would completely undermine the cripple that is a MMless unseen.</p>
<p>B: it makes the Assassin harder to find (butler can’t just occupy people until there is no kill and drunk can’t redirect you.)</p>
<p>C: it makes Dirty work more usable. This isn’t the main issue that this is trying to deal with but it is important for a MM vs NK (particularly Poss)</p>
<p>D: When the MM is dead the Assassin is basically a NK. Not only that but he is easier to find than a NK. This buff would make him ALMOST (not quite) as dangerous as a NK.</p>

            <p>No. Unseen is already more powerful than cult, as cult don’t easily get reliable kills, and have a more hostile hunter in paladin.</p>
