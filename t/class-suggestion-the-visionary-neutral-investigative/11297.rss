    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Visionary (neutral investigative)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-visionary-neutral-investigative/11297</link>
    <description>The Visionary (Unique Neutral Investigative) 

Passive 1:
Prophetic dream: immune to death at night once (old priest ability).

Passive 2:
Neurosis: occupy immune at night.

Night Ability 1:
Blurry Vision: select 2 targets. You will be informed if they are members of the same fraction (cannot target self and King). Infinity uses.

Night Ability 2:
Crystal Ball: select a target. You will be informed of 2 possible class types of this target, one real, one fake. Basically the same as Flirt. 3 uses only.

Comments:
So idea of this class if to be a little bit unreliable source of information. Your blurry vision always give you SOME information, but you don&#39;t know if they are both BD, both Unseen/Cult, both Neutral, and when fraction doesn&#39;t match you don&#39;t know which one is suspicious. Your information must be completed with help of other players, that&#39;s why you are neutral investigative. Your first passive helps you to mess with Unseen early, as they must use 2 turns to get rid of you. Your second night ability helps you to impersonate Princess if you want. Your goal is obviously to survive. This class is Unique.</description>

            <p>I still think he is plenty powerful enough without the second ability.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of a neutral investigator and also the matched pair mechanic of Blurry vision</p>

            <p>Why? Because it may be Mastermind <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It can be reaper/possessor? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> this class can be easily abused, because of it ‘blurry’ nature… logs can be fabricated, you know.</p>
<p>Also as you know, you can never trust neutrals. Unseen can just ask The Visionary to side with them, instead of BD. But on the other hand if they really want The Visionary dead, they can use empowers or 2 turn kills. So I think it is generally balanced.</p>

            <p>I think blurry vision always gives very strong investigative information .<br>
It may not be as obvious but<br>
turn 1: 1 and 2 are the same faction , your gut here is that these are likely both blue dragon , but you cant be sure<br>
turn 2 : 3 and 4 are in different factions , oh so one guy here is likely scum and the other is possibly scum or bd .<br>
turn 3 2 and 3 are the same faction , now I am very suspicious of 4 .</p>
<p>Even in the following circumstance<br>
turn 1 1 and 2 are both same faction<br>
turn 2 3 and 4 are both same faction<br>
turn 3 5 and 6 are both same faction</p>
<p>As soon as anybody 1 to 6 dies you have investigated their partner already  … but has there allegiance changed since then …</p>
<p>If anything it looks more powerful than Sherriff</p>
<p>For me the issue with this design is I cant see a good reason why BD would ever want to kill this powerhouse investigator .</p>

            <p>Celeste_Ludenberg - thanks for your input <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> i guess i will try to make up some day ability, but it quite hard, because i want it to fit in this a-little-bit-unreliable theme.</p>
<p>RopeStringFace - because no other investigative is occupy immune, and you can distinguish between Visionary and Princess/Obs this way. But it doesn’t HAS TO be. This is just my proposition.</p>

            <p>This class has some potential but I do not believe this class is good enough at the moment for addition into the game. Personally, I would try adding a day ability to balance out the fact that essentially all of their night abilities may or may not give actual useful information. Right now, the Private Investigator class roaming around the forums is a better choice for addition. Sorry man, but its a good start.</p>
