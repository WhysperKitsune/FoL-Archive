            <p>Okay it’s a good addition don’t pay any attention to what I am about to say FOR this addition. People need to be careful about adding stuff that would protect the unseen/cult. Nerfs all the BD roles that can kill them</p>

            <p>Does the Death Enforcer count to the Unseen limit? So only Mastermind, Assassin and Death Enforcer “alive” at once?</p>
<p>Interesting idea though</p>

            <p>They’re trying to get rid of interaction with the dead right now. This won’t be implemented although it’s an interesting idea. Probably a bit too powerful though, I would only make him love 2 days but be able to guard twice or make the assassin’s attack bypass immunity(but not healing/knights/bears, so it’s a nerfed version) and guard once or just make him only be able to use one ability but live until he does.</p>
