    <title>&quot;History Log&quot; feature</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/history-log-feature/13338</link>
    <description>_I understand this feature has been suggested before, but I&#39;ve read them, and I&#39;m using greater detail_

Having little knowledge about how easy this feature would be to implement (clientside or serverside) it is my opinion that a somewhat detailed History of games be accessible in the Profile of a player (not a public history). 
_Some of this info could be similar to the End-game screen of each match._

Such a feature could include:
* **Date:** (of match)
* **Class played and Final Class**
* **Faction:** (Blue Dragon / Unseen / Cult / Neutral / King)
* **Number of Days / Nights in the match**
* **Night survived until:** (if dead)
* **Win or Lose:** (if goal is met, etc)
* **Kills:** (if applicable)
* **Heals:** (if applicable)
* **x abilities used:** (for each class)
* **Accusations:** (tally for successful and unsuccessful, depending on Faction)
* **Successful predictions:** (Predictions of Night deaths and Executions from the graveyard screen)

I don&#39;t see why this kind of information can&#39;t be kept locally with the game&#39;s data, per player. The format would be exclusively text-based, so very low bytes storage. Also, it&#39;s not strictly important information, and as such, a malicious player falsifying the information doesn&#39;t particularly have any influence to the gameplay. 

I believe that such a History Log would allow for ultimate bragging rights (if for someone potent at a particular Class), and also give players a suitable structure to their learning curve of the game.

I would thoroughly enjoy a feature like this, and I would love a History Log that I could share to my friends on the TOL Discord.

**Are there any other statistics that a History Log could contain?**

Thanks for reading.</description>
