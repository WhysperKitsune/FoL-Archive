    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-reapers-apprentice-neutral-invest/43222</link>
    <description>**Lore:** sent down by the reaper to help the Neutral killer to succeed his or her goal. 

**Faction**-Neutral
**Class Type**- Investigative

**Passive 1** - slowly dying - If the NK dies then he will take your place. He is not allowed to use his abilities for a day after taking your body. Also if the NK attacks you then they will be given a message that youre the reapers apprentice. The apprentice will then know who the NK is. 

**Day Ability 1** - soul snatcher - take a players night ability and use it tonight. 
- This will always take the unlimited ability unless they don&#39;t have a unlimited ability.
- If you take someone&#39;s night ability that has unlimited then they won&#39;t know you took one, but if there is a limit then you will be alerted that some of your soul has been taken. 
- If you take someone&#39;s soul for the third time then you gain their passive if they have one. This will count as your second passive and you can only do this once 
- unlimited uses 

**Night Ability 1** - full body swap - become a class of your choice(except any Unique classes) you will become that class for the next day and night. 

Notes: 
- if you become a BD member and are checked that night by an invest Ability then you will show up as BD for that night. 
- if you become a fool and get killed during the day that morning then you will win still. 
- 2 uses 


**Win condition**- help the NK win at all cost

Tell me what you think and if this would fit in with the game</description>

            <p>ToS or no, the core NK experience is the same. NK does not need allies, and the whole point is not too have them. Otherwise it’s like a game with cult and unseen, which could be a different game mode, but should not be the norm.</p>

            <p>This would have a random chance of spawning into games and it does mix things up. This class doesn’t directly team with the NK unless he finds the NK or the NK finds him. It’s a cool take on the game. This isn’t a TOS game by any chance and the Devs made that clear. They keep surprising me every update. Also what I’m seeing is that if we fixed this classes passive and win condition then it would be better?</p>

            <p>NK shouldn’t ever have allies, unless they can win with cult/unseen as well (like Alchemist). Even the possibility can have a chance to take away the NK experience, so I think this shouldn’t be added.</p>

            <p>I know what you’re saying but that doesn’t have to be the case in every game. This will spawn in randomly similar to alchemist,mercenary, and neutral classes like that. This is class was based off of the witch from TOS and how it’s a Neutral that wants to help the bad guys win. It worked well in that game and I assume it would work well here too. As of right now there is no such class so we won’t know until it happens.</p>

            <p>Yes, but it ruins the whole point of NK. NK is one man team. Giving even one ally changes the dynamic drastically.</p>

            <p>I don’t like the idea. The whole point of NK is being a one team trying to win. This takes away that key part of the Reaper, so I think it ultimately doesn’t work.</p>

            <p>Oh. What I was intending it to be was that he steals it during the day and at night it says what Ability it is,  for example “heal a player” from the alch and phys . It would give you one use of this ability and if you don’t use it then you’ll never be able to use it again, unless you steal it again during the morning. This would help them find out what kind of class they are or limit it down.</p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense but I also do like your idea for it</p>

            <p>It would be more streamlined.<br>
Like it makes sense to be a night ability as you are taking their night ability and targeting someone with it. So it would look like<br>
STEAL ABILITY BOX  TARGET BOX<br>
1-16                          1-16</p>
<p>Just would make more headache or<br>
You steal the ability in the day<br>
and<br>
a night ability that allows you to target who you want with it</p>

<p>I was debating to make him either offense or invest because if he selects someone random each day  and gain their night ability then they will find out their class based on their ability or sum it down the 2 or 3 classes at most.</p>

<p>Passive 1 - slowly dying - can hear the dead chat during the night. Also if the NK attacks you then they will be given a message that youre the reapers apprentice.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nobody but psychic and the person they link should be able to talk to the dead. Also give it night immunity and if the reaper empowers reap you he will be notified of your class.</p>

<p>Day Ability 1 - soul snatcher - take a players night ability and use it tonight.</p>

</aside>
<p>Good idea just needs to be a night ability.</p>
<p>All in all good idea, but needs some heavy tweaking in other areas</p>

            <p>I think this is more neutral offensive, rather than neutral investigative because that he takes abilities from others.</p>

            <p><strong>Lore:</strong> sent down by the reaper to help the Neutral killer to succeed his or her goal.</p>
<p><strong>Faction</strong>-Neutral<br>
<strong>Class Type</strong>- Investigative</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1</strong> - slowly dying - If the NK dies then he will take your place. He is not allowed to use his abilities for a day after taking your body. Also if the NK attacks you then they will be given a message that youre the reapers apprentice. The apprentice will then know who the NK is.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1</strong> - soul snatcher - take a players night ability and use it tonight.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will always take the unlimited ability unless they don’t have a unlimited ability.</li>
<li>If you take someone’s night ability that has unlimited then they won’t know you took one, but if there is a limit then you will be alerted that some of your soul has been taken.</li>
<li>If you take someone’s soul for the third time then you gain their passive if they have one. This will count as your second passive and you can only do this once</li>
<li>unlimited uses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1</strong> - full body swap - become a class of your choice(except any Unique classes) you will become that class for the next day and night.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you become a BD member and are checked that night by an invest Ability then you will show up as BD for that night.</li>
<li>if you become a fool and get killed during the day that morning then you will win still.</li>
<li>2 uses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Win condition</strong>- help the NK win at all cost</p>
<p>Tell me what you think and if this would fit in with the game</p>
