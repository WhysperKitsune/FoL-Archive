    <title>[CW_Contest] A Wizard Is Always Prepared</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cw-contest-a-wizard-is-always-prepared/56575</link>
    <description>First post but I hope to have more in the future on these forums.

Many of the complaints regarding the Court Wizard is the lack of interactivity as well as how dreadfully dull it is to play (and this is without discussing how dangerous Tornado is for BD). This rework hopes to expand on the Court Wizard by making him a Support role with unique (and limited) options.

&gt; Class Card Name : Court Wizard
&gt; Class Card Faction : Blue Dragon
&gt; Class Card Type : Support
&gt; 
&gt; **Abilities:** 
&gt; **Font of Magic (Day, 1/Game)**
&gt; Restores all uses of your Night abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eyes of Insight (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Make the target&#39;s Investigative ability succeed tonight and provide true results. Avoids misleads such as a Fool or Scorned&#39;s Frame, Sorcerer&#39;s Magic Dust, and such. **Does not affect MM&#39;s In the Shadows.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Spell of Sleep (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Make the target immune to Night Kills that Night and preventing them from taking actions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Magic Barrier (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Places a Magical Barrier on the target that prevents the next Negative effect that would afflict them. Lasts until a Negative effect is used on the target. Negative effects are effects that are not Killing Attacks (occupation, target changing, conversions, etc).

The reasoning for this is that the design space of a Wizard is vast and currently the Wizard itself has very little of it. For the power of having breadth of abilities, the Wizard now has limited uses of them and has to smartly decide when to use its **Font of Power** to maximize how many supportive abilities it actually has. Its abilities are difficult to confirm, which makes it a lot more difficult to use but on the other hand it has defensive and offensive options that a clever Court Wizard can make use of (such as using Barrier on a target then hitting them the next night with Spell of Sleep, allowing them to work without worry). The Wizard cannot do much on its own and requires some setup or clever deducing to make **Eyes of Insight** succeed.

However, every Court Wizard can be turned to darkness...

&gt; Class Card Name : The Sage
&gt; Class Card Faction : Unseen
&gt; Class Card Type : Support
&gt; Converted From: Court Wizard
&gt; 
&gt; **Abilities:** 
&gt; **Font of Magic (Day, 1/Game)**
&gt; Restores all uses of your Night abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Phantasm (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Make the target&#39;s Investigative ability always fail tonight and provide false results.
&gt; 
&gt; **Spell of Sleep (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Make the target immune to Night Kills that Night and preventing them from taking actions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Firewall (Night, 1/Game)**
&gt; Only allow the Unseen to visit the target that Night.

One of the largest complaints people have is the sheer power of the Sage, and this hopes to bring them down a little bit by limiting **Firewall**, but still retaining it as a counter to _Follow the Cop / Follow the Prince Voltron_ strategies and is the evil mirror of the **Magical Barrier**. **Phantasm** is used to help BD damage themselves and waste important night actions. **Spell of Sleep** has defensive and offensive value much like before, and allows for the Sage to help bluff itself as another role for a while.

Ultimately the game needs a Court Wizard, though the current iteration is less than ideal. While **Tornado** has some great power late game, it suffers as it makes the BD question their own information as well as being incredibly swingy. I hope at the very least you enjoyed reading this rework, and thanks for any feedback in advance.

**Version 2 Changes:**
&gt; * Detect Aptitude (Wizard) removed. Reasoning: Too weak in the current game and ultimately unfitting to the role of the Support Wizard.
&gt; 
&gt; * Blast Barrier (Sage) removed. Reasoning: Too much kill Power for Unseen when taking into account the power of Firewall. Firewall was basically already the opposite of Magical Barrier so there is no need for having two of the same (Especially having overlap with Spell of Sleep).</description>

            <p>I honestly am a sucker for symmetry in the BD and Unseen versions, but Blast Barrier (Unseen) can easily be cut as well as Detect Aptitude (BD). Leaving Magical Barrier as it is for both sides could be an option as well though with Sleep it may be overkill. Having extra killing power is a concern, especially with Firewall already being one of the best tools in the game; so I can concede that point.</p>
<p>I can see your point regarding overcomplexity though. Font in it’s current state makes the Court Wizard have to decide if it will last long enough to make use of all 8 of its spells, or if it’s worthwhile to use a couple of the bigger ones then Font for fast cycling. I think in terms of decision making it’s no more complicated than a new player being stuck on Prince or Possessor.</p>
<p>I’ll think on it more today and hopefully get a better ironed out version before the deadline.</p>
<p>Thanks for the review!</p>

            <p>There’s a limit of 2 night actions and 2 day actions, for the reason of preventing overcomplexitty. But I’ll put this aside for now as I review this class.</p>

<p>This may seem pointless but I’m actually KINDA a  fan of this idea, a role that cycles through 4 1-shot abilities, known as a Wizard in Mafia circles. Maybe make this a phaassive that restores all uses once all 4 have been used, having 2 day abilities and 2 night abilities, to make it more smooth.</p>

<p>Mind warping frames and bortherhoods and the like aren’t really prevelant to warrant this in the current state of the game. Mind you, if I’m judging the rework correctly a ‘weaker’ ability once per ability cycle is neccecary…</p>

<p>Classic ability seen in many games, for good reason. Kinda tiptoes the linec in being ‘Support’ but it has enough to be an interesting dynamic.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of this, certainly powerful enough that it makes up for being 1-shot</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, a pretty good mix of abilities. They should be changed to be 2 day and 2 night, and Detect Aptitude should be scrapped in favor of something better, but overall I’m pretty good with this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Same design idea as CW, but converts rarely live long enough to renew their abilities. Probably good enough for those rare cases though.</p>

<p>Wall of Fire is still just as nice of an ability to have on this Sage as well. It has been limited, naturally.</p>

</aside>
<p>Extra kill power on Unseen really isn’t a good idea, and that’s enough for me to not like this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall a pretty good ability, if the 4 night abilities thing is sorted out and the kill power is fixed this could be a lot of fun. I’m not certain how well it would mesh into ToL as it is currently.</p>

<p>I was a ritualist (same as sage pretty much)</p>
<p>A knight was going to coldsteel me, so I tornado him into himself.</p>

            <p>First post but I hope to have more in the future on these forums.</p>
<p>Many of the complaints regarding the Court Wizard is the lack of interactivity as well as how dreadfully dull it is to play (and this is without discussing how dangerous Tornado is for BD). This rework hopes to expand on the Court Wizard by making him a Support role with unique (and limited) options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Class Card Name : Court Wizard<br>
Class Card Faction : Blue Dragon<br>
Class Card Type : Support</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong><br>
<strong>Font of Magic (Day, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Restores all uses of your Night abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Eyes of Insight (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Make the target’s Investigative ability succeed tonight and provide true results. Avoids misleads such as a Fool or Scorned’s Frame, Sorcerer’s Magic Dust, and such. <strong>Does not affect MM’s In the Shadows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spell of Sleep (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Make the target immune to Night Kills that Night and preventing them from taking actions.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Barrier (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Places a Magical Barrier on the target that prevents the next Negative effect that would afflict them. Lasts until a Negative effect is used on the target. Negative effects are effects that are not Killing Attacks (occupation, target changing, conversions, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasoning for this is that the design space of a Wizard is vast and currently the Wizard itself has very little of it. For the power of having breadth of abilities, the Wizard now has limited uses of them and has to smartly decide when to use its <strong>Font of Power</strong> to maximize how many supportive abilities it actually has. Its abilities are difficult to confirm, which makes it a lot more difficult to use but on the other hand it has defensive and offensive options that a clever Court Wizard can make use of (such as using Barrier on a target then hitting them the next night with Spell of Sleep, allowing them to work without worry). The Wizard cannot do much on its own and requires some setup or clever deducing to make <strong>Eyes of Insight</strong> succeed.</p>
<p>However, every Court Wizard can be turned to darkness…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Class Card Name : The Sage<br>
Class Card Faction : Unseen<br>
Class Card Type : Support<br>
Converted From: Court Wizard</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong><br>
<strong>Font of Magic (Day, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Restores all uses of your Night abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Phantasm (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Make the target’s Investigative ability always fail tonight and provide false results.</p>
<p><strong>Spell of Sleep (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Make the target immune to Night Kills that Night and preventing them from taking actions.</p>
<p><strong>Firewall (Night, 1/Game)</strong><br>
Only allow the Unseen to visit the target that Night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the largest complaints people have is the sheer power of the Sage, and this hopes to bring them down a little bit by limiting <strong>Firewall</strong>, but still retaining it as a counter to <em>Follow the Cop / Follow the Prince Voltron</em> strategies and is the evil mirror of the <strong>Magical Barrier</strong>. <strong>Phantasm</strong> is used to help BD damage themselves and waste important night actions. <strong>Spell of Sleep</strong> has defensive and offensive value much like before, and allows for the Sage to help bluff itself as another role for a while.</p>
<p>Ultimately the game needs a Court Wizard, though the current iteration is less than ideal. While <strong>Tornado</strong> has some great power late game, it suffers as it makes the BD question their own information as well as being incredibly swingy. I hope at the very least you enjoyed reading this rework, and thanks for any feedback in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Version 2 Changes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detect Aptitude (Wizard) removed. Reasoning: Too weak in the current game and ultimately unfitting to the role of the Support Wizard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blast Barrier (Sage) removed. Reasoning: Too much kill Power for Unseen when taking into account the power of Firewall. Firewall was basically already the opposite of Magical Barrier so there is no need for having two of the same (Especially having overlap with Spell of Sleep).</p>
</li>
</ul>
