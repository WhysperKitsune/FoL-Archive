            <p>Abbility 1: Too much like 2 and not very usefull.</p>
<p>How about: Lucky Die: Pick a player and roll a dice during the day. If it lands on 6 imediately kill the player. If it lands on 1 you die instead.</p>
<p>Abbility 2: Roll a die during the night and pick a player.</p>
<p>1 - Lose any immunity/protection you have.<br>
2 - The player’s faction will be revieled to you.<br>
3 - Nothing will happen<br>
4 - You will roleblock the person you picked.<br>
5 - Your role will be revealed to the person you picked.<br>
6 - You will swap roles with the person you picked.</p>
