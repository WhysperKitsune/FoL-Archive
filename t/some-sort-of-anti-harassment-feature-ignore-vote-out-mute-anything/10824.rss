    <title>SOME sort of anti-harassment feature? Ignore/vote out/mute/anything</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/some-sort-of-anti-harassment-feature-ignore-vote-out-mute-anything/10824</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ll start out by saying I realize I&#39;m in the minority for being a female ToL player and/or a female gamer in general. ToL was, when I started a great player base / community. Lately the toxicity has been ramping up so extremely that it&#39;s literally a negative experience 50% of the time I play. There are racial slurs, disability slurs, slurs against women, profane names... There is a level of offensiveness that is to be expected in any multiplayer gaming arena; its par for the damn course. But as our game-gods, it is your responsibility to give us players a way to protect ourselves from other malicious players in your game - because you can&#39;t always mediate every single issue realtime for all of us.

I beseech you devs, PLEASE give us an ignore feature, a vote out of game, anything that we can do to protect ourselves against verbal assault / harassment / toxicity.

I know the trolls will leap on this statement, but idgaf because it&#39;s true - as of rn, I legitimately have no way to protect myself on your game if someone decides to harass me, or to stop someone from pushing me to a point of poor conduct because I can&#39;t escape their slurs and offenses. I would 1000% rather mute a toxic player than uninstall ToL or accept a ban just to feel basic emotional safety.

Please implement an ignore feature. I am only ONE minority gamer speaking. There are many on your game.</description>

<p>Oh but it would be abused, you say? Only once. Then they’d get banned for salty/false reporting… self-solving problem that kills 2 birds with one stone.</p>
<p>If more than a few players use this feature in a single game, it also obligates the rest of the players to /report the same offending player so that they may be released of their game-bligation and go on to join another, less toxic game. In the same vein, that would also serve as a counter-measure against false reports (as the false reporter would hopefully and reasonably be reported for game throwing by the remaining players).</p>

            <p>They would also have undercover mods in place whenever a mod plays a game, as they can report them and make sure someone sees it (maybe it should be someone else who was not in the game, to get an objective perspective, not really sure on the policy there)</p>

            <p>Let’s look at real life for a solution to the problem - the police.</p>
<p>Okay, from my research, they can’t seem to prevent all crimes. Sometimes, they will openly be in an area and only idiots will commit crimes in front of them, so they only prevent current crimes but not repeat offenses.</p>
<p>Oh wait, they also have undercover agents - they go around without looking like police to catch those dang repeat offenders.</p>
<p>Another tool they use is surveillance, so they can figure out who did a crime after they did it and stop repeat offenses.</p>
<hr>
<p>The devs have the surveillance down, they just need undercover mods and open mods to monitor games.</p>

            <p>In-game mod monitoring has a lot of merit. I don’t think anybody denies that. I just believe it to be too grand of a feat to accomplish. The :resources required: to :benefit: ratio is heavily skewed in the resources required side of things.</p>
<p>Maybe players that you report at the end of the game can be put on your own personal blacklist. This blacklist would not allow you to join games with that person if they are not yet banned.</p>

            <p>Understood. Thank you for your thoughtful response.</p>
<p>I agree with you. I would also go on to suggest that under duress, people’s judgment is frequently impaired as far as making the call shot to leave. That doesn’t excuse either party, really, and they should still absolutely /report the offender, but if someone were to leave a game due to extreme psychological stress, it is unlikely they would think to screenshot or write down the name of the offender before alt-f4’ing.</p>
<p>Ethically, I feel the burden of appealing a ban over a potentially triggering incident should not fall to the victim, but the offender. I just don’t know what solution to suggest, and commenters aren’t being very helpful with alternatives that would provide the same safety/escape function. (Seemingly mostly only attestations of why personal safety is a weakling’s interest and ToL is above that. I sincerely hope that’s merely a perceived implication.) <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I had hoped that opening the dialogue would result in a conversation about what IS possible.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your thoughtful reply. It was an appreciated departure.</p>
<p>And – I still think the notion of open /reporting to in-game functionality, even if only for the specific purpose of toxicity reports, has merit.</p>

<p>I appreciate analogies for when they work, but this is not one of those times. If somebody in the game is threatening you or threatening your mental or emotional well-being or otherwise endangering yourself somehow and you feel too uncomfortable to continue – you need to leave the game immediately. Your well-being is more important than a ban for leaving a video game. Hell, I bet your ban would even be lifted if a moderator went over your case and realized the reason you left.</p>
<p>You are not tied to your chair and forced to play Throne of Lies. It is your choice whether entering a game with 15 other random people from the world is worth the risk of finding someone terribly nasty. Imperium42 cannot force players to be polite, but we also cannot force policies that threaten the integrity of the game.</p>

<p>4 Cult members could literally silent Mute a BD player by themselves. Unseen can have 3 members and get a Neutral Ally or King as the final vote. Players could begin a meta where they automatically mute the King every single game, or start a meme where they mute player 1 every single game. I guarantee these scenarios would happen and would ruin the game. More players would be negatively affected by muting than the players being affected by toxic players.</p>

<p>Simplest solution suggestion yet:</p>
<p>Simply open /report feature to in-game access and if someone uses it and files a report against another player, lift the ban consequence on their Exit Game.</p>
<p>Oh but it would be abused, you say? Only once. Then they’d get banned for salty/false reporting… self-solving problem that kills 2 birds with one stone.</p>

In the same vein, that would also serve as a counter-measure against false reports (as the false reporter would hopefully and reasonably be reported for game throwing by the remaining players).</p>

            <p>Then what is your proposal for a solution? I hear you when you say /mute would affect the game - but toxicity affects it also. I keep saying it cannot possibly be one or the other; life is not inherently toxic <em>or</em> binary <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Have you ever voted to exe someone because of their conduct just to escape their words? I have, and would do so 10/10 times; but that doesn’t solve anything - it just creates more animosity until I can click that button at the end of game, and if that’s our ONLY immediate recourse to temporarily escape the toxicity, that affects the win/loss for everyone way more than a /mute would.* (better articulated)</p>
<p>Telling someone they have no choice but to wait until the end of a game and report or accept a ban is akin to saying<br>
“I am going to tie someone to a chair and force them to listen to me until I allow them to leave, or I will punish them.”</p>
<p>That’s… unethical; and I know it’s an oversight, but it’s a pretty big one for an MP game. It’s just a matter of time before someone somewhere gets legitimately psychologically triggered/injured because they can’t walk away from an abusive onslaught without accepting a ban.</p>
<p>So… /mute is no good, a /mute vote is no good, but I’m not sure I really agree that it would be the same as removing them from game. Perhaps if someone were silently and anonymously voted to be muted by 4 individual players, just allow their logs to be read while alive. That does not bar communication and I think is more than fair as far as prohibiting abuse. If it were abused, it would be because it would be an organized effort - and such things would be blatantly obvious to a mod/guide* looking over the game’s chat log if the targeted player /reported abuse of /mute vote… right?</p>

            <p>Then as opposed to a /mute command, what about an (anonymous, silent) /mute vote? It could keep the player in-game, preserve their ability to continue playing and writing logs, and still protect the other players? I don’t know how many required votes would be appropriate to ward against abuse, but it’s a thought?</p>

<p>The problem with a mute is that it is a SOCIAL deduction game. So many people will get reported for game throwing when someone claims prince and you still execute them because they were acting a little toxic earlier, not to mention the people who lie and say they had them muted for some minuscule offense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Rope has a strong point here. Muting people can also be a metagaming angleshoot used in games to explain why they didn’t claim to the Psychic or Prince or any other reason.</p>
<p>Newarks and Rope are getting off point at the end of this thread though.</p>
<p>Being able to mute players would single-handedly destroy this game. 100%. Social deduction games require communication. The Mute Metagame would be horrific and wouldn’t solve anything - it would only cause more salt and chaos. Willfully deleting the most important part of this game makes it pointless to play.</p>
<p>The only real solution is to report players after the game and remove them from the community. Everyone has the responsibility to do so even if they weren’t personally offended by the toxic player. It’s not a perfect solution but it’s better than the Mute alternative.</p>

            <p>Sorry <a class="mention" href="/u/newarkinvaders">@newarkinvaders</a>, that post was not directed solely at you, it was a general reply (and I’ve probably been clicking the wrong Reply button); there is a lot to reply to here.*</p>
<p>Your opinion that my suggestion would be overly disruptive has been noted &amp; acknowledged. Thank you for clarifying your position.</p>
<p>On my end, for clarification (and because I don’t know how to properly quote, sorry again):<br>

I’m just the current squeaky wheel <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I feel like releasing a multiplayer game with 0 options for chat control features is a safety oversight<br>
I’m not trying to be mean, but damn is everyone a snowflake these days? “Boohoo they are toxic!!” Life is toxic. Deal with it. But obviously the devs are doing hard work to keep this game clean and fun</p>
<p>I will edit to say, however, that projecting doesn’t make something true. I could say similarly that you seem to be overly offended that I am so “easily offended” (your, not my opinion), but what the heck does it matter to you anyway? I’m just trying to live and let live with common decency. If others can’t be trusted to practice common decency, that… doesn’t make ME the asshole?</p>

            <p>at some point did i say your request offended me ?<br>
I said I did not like your idea as it’s overly disruptive.</p>
<p>You don’t need a qualification in pop psychology<br>
that’s why it’s pop psychology over actual psychology.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.  how does a random guy you have never met on the internet know to insult your 4 year olds  autism?</p>
<p>It seems your offended because everyone else isn’t as easily offended as you and don’t need this level of protection .</p>
<p>Also worth pointing out that nobody mentioned snowflakes but you . It seems that maybe you are having a lot of this conversation on your head.</p>

            <p>Honestly idgaf if/how people choose to protect their sensibilities. Those sensibilities belong to them, not me…  not you; not even the devs, really. And I appreciate the complementary psychoanalysis, but … I’mma need to see yer credentials on that one.</p>
<p>Someone caring about different things than you doesn’t innately make them an idiot, or an asshole, or even wrong. And calling someone “delicate” or “a snowflake” is a pretty shallow tactic for reducing and dismissing by dehumanizing your opposition with personal attacks, and it’s actually rarely successful when your opposition feels confident about their stance.<br>
I am human, and so are all of you, and I think we can all safely say that there are certain things in this world we just cannot abide. And it’s not up to the guy standing next to you what you are allowed to feel that way about. Would you like to grant me the power to decide whether your feelings are appropriate or not?<br>
Then why would I automatically give that to you?</p>
<p>If I gave you a single example of my desire to /mute someone; say, for personally attacking my 4 year old daughter’s autism – would you deem that less ridiculous than muting someone for talking about meat? I’m pretty sure it doesn’t make me a melty little snowflake.<br>
But honestly… I super do not care about your opinion on my feels. Your judgment is irrelevant.</p>
<p>If I get so angry at someone’s online presence that I am shaking irl - it doesn’t matter if it’s about meat, my child’s neurodevelopment, or the color of my socks - I insist that I am given the option to remove myself from that context without penalty – at the very least.</p>
<p>If you ain’t got no triggers, I envy you dude. But that’s not generally the case for an average adult.</p>
<p>Being willing to admit that every once in a while, people can get under my skin (even when I’ve got my guard up) does not make me less-than. I think it makes me pretty honest.<br>
&amp; If I’m willing to throw my weaknesses up on a forum for you negative nancies to have a field day with, that does not paint me to be particularly delicate.</p>
<p>It is a fallacy that players must be morally bankrupt in order to earn the right to play a multiplayer game. By pure nature of being MULTIplayer; we players have to be prepared to make room for other members of the community in all their gloriously flawed humanity.<br>
We don’t have to hate each other for it tho. That’s a – how was it said to me? – “a personal choice.”</p>
<p>My request for a chat tool is not because I want punishment; it’s because I want to avoid altercations altogether.</p>
<p>Someone asking for the ability to defend themselves should not be threatening to you unless you are a regular perpetrator.<br>
&amp;… I’m not ignoring the comment about stoicism and sociopathy - we’re just talking about different things, and I’m not interested in lecturing or arguing with no productive gain in sight.</p>
<p>All in all, I have to trust that to the same devs who came up with the entire concept of ToL, it should be apparent that a request for some measure of personal safety tool stands to help way more people than it hurts.<br>
And that the only people it actually threatens to injure are people who habitually overstep others’ moral boundaries… which will just make the devs’ job even easier in the long run.<br>
Saying “I’m frightened it would be abused” is unfounded. Is /report abused? Unquestionably - and how is that handled?</p>
<p>These devs created an impressive brainchild of a game. I have faith that a protective chat function that doesn’t threaten the Everyman is not beyond their creativity or capabilities.</p>
<p>So if my personal request is stil offensive to you, I first encourage you to consider the level of offense you are taking from this and why. And then I would repeat:<br>
Please feel free to contribute with <em>productive</em> suggestions.</p>

            <p>First off , no , no you wouldn’t .<br>
Choosing how you act in a given situation does not make you a sociopath , controlling your own emotional well being does not make you a sociopath . Making a positive choice to ignore an internet troll does not make you a sociopath . Not being able to control your moral reactions could possibly make you a psychopath . But that’s just an uniformed pop princess psychoanalyst at play .</p>
<p>There is an alternative and here it is . Use your special filter and choose not to take any notice of what an internet stranger is telling you do to or calling you . Use this as practice for dealing with stressful situations in real life and then  at the end of the game , report the offender for being toxic .</p>
<p>You say you are not threatening the game , but allowing players to mute or kick ban mid game based on perceived injustice will lead to a loss of game quality .</p>
<p>For example , what if a group of people decide a fool is acting in a game throwing manner and kick ban him ,</p>
<p>What if you are BD and you have blocked 3 players because they where talking about eating meat and it was offending your vegan sensibilities and then you missed vital clues …</p>
<p>What if some guys where talking about banning guns and it offended your NRA sensibilities and you just couldn’t handle that these guys want to take your guns , so you muted them and missed vital clues to the game .</p>
<p>Everyone has issues that they are sensitive about , but nobody bleeds out of the eyeballs because someone wrote something on the internet .<br>
It would be nice if these people didn’t exist ,  but when they show up just get on with the game , act like the bigger person , don’t ruin the game further  and give in to what they want you to do . Then at the end of the game  , report them …</p>

<p>But see, you’re entitled to that opinion, even if it’s unfounded. It’s just that, if someone were to hypothetically take moral issue with me defending my own rights at no threat to theirs… that’s kind of… well, malicious.</p>
<p>I’m not out to threaten anyone’s gameplay. In fact, I think you’ll find that my entire point is just the opposite. So jeezy petes, stop trying to hang me as cult. I am 100% all ears to your suggestions for alternatives that leave no residual sand behind.</p>

            <p>Stop using the report measure sparingly , it wastes more of mods time if you allow people to be toxic without reporting them because there becomes an acceptability to toxicity if it isn’t reported .<br>
The best thing to do if someone says something that crosses the line is and this works 95% of time with toxic people . Don’t talk to them . just actually ignore them .<br>
Then report them later</p>
<p>There is a belief that being offended by something is somehow really really dreadfully awful and shouldn’t be bourne even for a moment .</p>
<p>You have the choice to be mortally offended by a comment to the point of catatonic break down , or you can choose to not rise to the bait and calmly report the offender at the end of the game .</p>
<p>I think the reason why it gets peoples hackles up is because some guy has a rant about something and you physically are unable to ignore the toxicity and then mis something important to the game , the  game is ruined . Leaving more people pissed off .</p>
<p>You say you are not asking for a game breaking resolution but all of your solutions would break the game</p>
<p>“I beseech you devs, PLEASE give us an ignore feature, a vote out of game, anything that we can do to protect ourselves against verbal assault / harassment / toxicity”</p>
<p>If you could vote to get a player out of the game for toxicity there would then be a subset of people winding people up to deliberately get people kicked to gain game advantage .</p>
<p>With a lot of multiplayer games its not important for you to be able to talk to everybody online , In a social deduction game it is game breaking not to be able to .</p>

<p>but if you’re gonna shut down a request for any degree of self-defense utility, please do help me understand why it’s getting peoples hackles up on principal. I’m not suggesting a game-breaking solve - or even that /mute is the way to go; I am, however, having a hard time understanding why this is an innately negative request. We <em>are</em> all yuman beans here, right?</p>
