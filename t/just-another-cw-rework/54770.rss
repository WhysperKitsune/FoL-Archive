    <title>Just another CW rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/just-another-cw-rework/54770</link>
    <description>My CW rework has the following principles/goals in mind:
1. Make CW impactful
2. Give claim space to evils/NK/fool/scorned
3. CW is support, but should feel powerful/magical

Passive
Magic Shell – The first time an attack would kill you, prevent all visits that night. [Notification: You were attacked but your powers prevented all visits]

Night Abilities

Empower (unlimited uses) – Give a target a boost tonight based on the target&#39;s class type
Killer – Target will be death immune
Offensive – Target’s abilities bypass occupation immunity
Support – Target will be occupation immune
Social – Target will be conversion immune
Special/Investigative – Target’s abilities will return correct results regardless of counter abilities (frame, etc)
[Notification: You empowered [target].]

Siphon (unlimited uses, one night cooldown, cannot target King) – Gain protection the next two nights based on the target’s class type
Killer/offensive – CW will be occupation immune 
Support/social – CW will be death immune 
Special/Inv – CW will be conversion immune
[Notification: You siphoned power from [target].]</description>

            <p>Right now fool has very little to explain a prevented visit.  Claiming you were jailed is easily counter-claimed and just invites a jail the next night.  Claiming you are a merc target doesn’t go very far if nobody is going to claim to be your merc (and TB can only go so far there).</p>
<p>This CW design gives MMs/NKs a BD claim to explain death immunity, gives Poss/Sorc an easier BD claim to explain occ immunity, and gives all evils a claim that is not readily disputable.  Thus, I expect this CW would be a popular scum claim.  As with knight, the meta response may be to hang CW claims indiscriminately.  To counteract that, I wanted to give CW something that would attract fools.  The passive does exactly that, giving the fool license to use his hide night ability without being instantly pegged as a fool.</p>
<p>Additionally, this CW has the empower tool that would make it a valuable support BD.  Empower can make prince death immune, which will be even more important if the meta continues toward prince outting early.  The CW can also protect a Hunter who is going to wolf, assist butlers/drunks with locking down Poss/MM, prevent cult from swapping healers off bleeding/valuable targets, prevent conversion of mystics/nobles, and improve investigative results.</p>
<p>This CW will be more interesting to play because there are many different strategies and playstyles.  Siphon can keep you alive at night, but at the expense of not really developing verifiable logs.  Alternatively, the passive allows you to instead focus on boosting key BD through Empower.  More, empower provides different boosts to different classes, thus making the CW versatile and flexible.   But siphon is not overpowered.  A CW could be death immune or conversion immune, but not both.  And a CW who is occ’d on a siphon night will be completely vulnerable the next night.</p>
<p>At the same time, empower creates more space by blurring results.  A butler who is empowered will not know whether his target was occ immune.  A Knight or hunter that is alch bombed may be accused of being the NK the next day.</p>

<p>I agree with nuclearburrito. In fact, it makes him a princess as well, since he gets role information. His passive also seems unneeded. Like it’s added just for the sake of making him stronger.</p>
<p>I like the empower idea, however.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The passive is meant to make CW an attractive claim for fools.  As for the role information, note that siphon does not tell you what power you obtained and does not give you the power that same night.  So finding another player’s role would require the CW to siphon that player one night and someone else to test the CW the next night.  Very different from a princess getting information instantly.</p>

<p>Well, being death immune requires having no night ability every other night, having supp/social players to siphon, and not being occupied.  I also think you will find that being death immune with virtually unverifiable logs is quite sus.</p>
