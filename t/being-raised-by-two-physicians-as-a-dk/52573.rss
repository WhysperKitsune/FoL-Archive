    <title>Being raised by two physicians as a DK</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/being-raised-by-two-physicians-as-a-dk/52573</link>
    <description>This happened to me on my stream this morning, and then the phys who claimed they raised me was CCed by the other phys and lynched.  It seems there&#39;s a check missing in the DK script to make sure a player isn&#39;t **already** a DK.

I&#39;ve uploaded the game to Youtube where it can be seen at Rusty .. &quot;Throne of Lies .. Double DK&quot;</description>

            <p>I don’t see a problem here, and I don’t think anything needs to change (outside of maybe making it more obvious how it works, so players won’t instalynch in a case like this and will say “wait, maybe you both tried to raise the same person.”)</p>
<p>What you’re asking is for Physicians to be more confirmable, harder to lynch, and (as a result) a bit harder to fake.  That’s a bad idea.</p>

<p>I do say lore is kind of irrelevant, but no their spirit is clearly not in their body for the majority of the night.  Otherwise they wouldn’t be mingling with the dead.</p>
<p>and yes it is SOMETIMES confirmable… either due to psychic, or the phys dying and leaving in his journal that he revived the guy. The point is that it should be rare as possible for BD to be certain that a living phys revived someone, and 2 revives is borderline OP, If it weren’t one of the extremely too limited already fake claimable classes I’d be in favor of phys being unique. So adding a way for multiple revives to go wrong, isn’t a bad thing for balance either.</p>

<p>Doesn’t matter. Balance &gt; Lore</p>
<p>And even if it is confirm-able by Psychic, we shouldn’t make it more confirm-able</p>

            <p>It already is confirmable - I’ve seen quite a few games where the last evils hold off attacking because a DK is in play - and I’m not sure about the interpretation of the lore.  My read is that the DK is permanently mobile, not switch on and off-able, until they rot away in 3 days.</p>

            <p>The reasoning is fine.</p>
<p>The balance is more important then the lore. It’s better to not have it confirmable</p>

            <p>Lore wise… not really the corpses come and go. Does the physician know whether or not his healed target was off stabbing the prince in the face? Nope they come and go in tiny windows of time, and spend most of the night at home (or in the coffin) waiting for people to show up.</p>
<p>balanace wise, I don’t follow the logic that “because something can happen in one scenerio” is not grounds for “it should happen in more scenerios”. The fact that a converted is auto identified as converting when a scout is on, doesn’t mean that we should make sure the princess can also see when someone is converting, just because there’s already a situation where it happens.</p>

            <p>The reasoning is illogical.  A physician trying to raise a corpse would most certainly know if it had walked off on its own already.</p>
<p>Also, a DK is already confirmable when there is a psychic, so your justification is incorrect.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it’s a bug as much as a concious decision between multiple problems. They don’t want reviving a DK to be a confirmable action, meaning no one should know for certain of a DK’s presence other than the reviving phys.</p>
<p>Of course this goal is entirely incompatible with an “ensure a second phys doesn’t waste his revive on someone who is already a DK”. As the notification or continued having use of revive… would confirm a second phys.</p>
