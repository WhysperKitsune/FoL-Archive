    <title>Sorceror games should have Neut Kings (or Good)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorceror-games-should-have-neut-kings-or-good/36782</link>
    <description>It feels a tad bit too stacked when a game has both Evil King and Sorceror. At the end of the game I internally say &quot;geez that was a waste of effort was there any point&quot; and then cry myself to sleep.

And if it is less than a 16 player game, and/or Unseen no less. That is brutal, and I&#39;m speaking from most often being on the evil faction in this scenario. It&#39;s a bloodbath 

It would be interesting if a Sorceror game always meant a Neut King game though.
