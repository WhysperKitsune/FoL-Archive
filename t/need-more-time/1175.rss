    <title>Need more time!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/need-more-time/1175</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve only played a few games, so perhaps when I&#39;ve had time to play more and gain experience, my initial opinion could change.

But I had a very strong reaction.... I NEED MORE TIME!

First, it&#39;s the learning curve... If I took time to open the in-game wiki, another day would go by.

But even if that weren&#39;t the case, it seemed to me that a game of plotting, deduction, social manipulation, stealth and debate needs to have time to play out. Instead it felt almost like I was playing an action/arcade game. This game would probably be fun even in *real time* where you have all day for players to make their one or two decisions, and I&#39;m certainly not suggesting you slow it down that much, but I felt some slow down is needed.

The advantage of the speed you have set right now is a lot more games in less time... but to me (and my wife who played a little too) the game would be more fun if it allowed more time for chatting with other players to figure out what was happening and hatch wild plots.... indeed The Game of Thrones success is just as much about the scheming conversations as the epic fantasy battles.

In the future, having maybe multiple speed options and letting players choose which speed game to enter might be a good solution, but in the meantime it seems like you are on the way too fast end of the spectrum.</description>

            <p>Well, this also depends on a few things. The experienced will require less time. The newer crowd will require more time. Perhaps we can have a newbie mode later that has 10 mode seconds and has limited classes (no complex roles).</p>

<p>The thing about this is that we’re in Alpha, so have no tutorial. However, we do (after you wrote this post) have a big blue Learn the Game button that should serve as a placeholder tutorial, for now. The average person should generally click learn the game before playing.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can force check if you’ve looked at the guide and class cards at least once, THEN let you play the game.</p>

            <p>I am completely against increasing day time from D2 onwards cuz it effectively works as a nerf to evil roles. While meta has not been established yet, I don’t feel like it should be tampered with (yet, if at all).</p>
<p>However i do agree that D1 needs more time, especially because it seems that the game starts as soon as first person has loaded in (or something of the sort). I had a game with prince where I loaded in and had 5 seconds. It’s just not user friendly.</p>

            <p>More time is defiantly needed on day 1 this has been mentioned quite a few times on discord.<br>
As for e.g… nearly everyone playing Prince day 1 doesn’t get a chance to jail anyone as they have about 5 seconds on average.<br>
So 5 to 15 seconds has been recommended by discord members to increase day 1 by.</p>

            <p>Let me expand on my suggestion a little:</p>
<p>First, let me make clear that I thoroughly read the Wikia more than once before I ever played. But (a) it isn’t all inclusive, and (b) when playing in game, it’s natural to want to review sections relevant to your particular situation.</p>
<p>Second, here’s an idea that will add to the game:<br>
Since daytime sort of represents a high council meeting of sorts, how about letting a player vote (or decree of the King) decide when the meeting is over. 51% or 2/3 or whatever could be the threshold. Obviously I’m not in favor of forcing everyone to sit around when everyone (or most) are ready to move on. Clearly night ends when night ends, and it wouldn’t make sense to do it that way. But if you handled days that way, that would also allow for one or two classes to have additional powers that interrupt or disrupt that vote in some way, with the King being the obvious one who it would make sense could override.</p>

            <p>Currently, we’re testing different times and such. The learning curve is higher, so naturally we’d eventually want to allow <em>more</em> time for newer players – while experienced players would want faster rounds</p>
<p>Remind me about this after Alpha ~</p>
<p>For now, I encourage you to check out our Wikia for a basic understanding @ <a href="https://tol.wikia.com">https://tol.wikia.com</a> – we’ll eventually throw the cards in the lobby for a further accessible reference.</p>

            <p>I’ve only played a few games, so perhaps when I’ve had time to play more and gain experience, my initial opinion could change.</p>
<p>But I had a very strong reaction… I NEED MORE TIME!</p>
<p>First, it’s the learning curve… If I took time to open the in-game wiki, another day would go by.</p>
<p>But even if that weren’t the case, it seemed to me that a game of plotting, deduction, social manipulation, stealth and debate needs to have time to play out. Instead it felt almost like I was playing an action/arcade game. This game would probably be fun even in <em>real time</em> where you have all day for players to make their one or two decisions, and I’m certainly not suggesting you slow it down that much, but I felt some slow down is needed.</p>
<p>The advantage of the speed you have set right now is a lot more games in less time… but to me (and my wife who played a little too) the game would be more fun if it allowed more time for chatting with other players to figure out what was happening and hatch wild plots… indeed The Game of Thrones success is just as much about the scheming conversations as the epic fantasy battles.</p>
<p>In the future, having maybe multiple speed options and letting players choose which speed game to enter might be a good solution, but in the meantime it seems like you are on the way too fast end of the spectrum.</p>
