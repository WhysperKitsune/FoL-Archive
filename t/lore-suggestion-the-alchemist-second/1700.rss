Lore Subject: How many potions does it take to get to a girls heart?

Lore:

The Alchemist serves as a tool of the Kings treasury. Tasked with turning unknown metals into gold her job entails a great deal of chemistry. However she cares not for his benefactor instead devoting himself entirely to her work not caring who provides materials. Stealing from both the assassin and the physician it does not matter if the means justify the ends. Her job is absolute and a few pieces of misplaced nightshade over the castle will help her to uncover the secrets of the universe. Of course it never hurts to have allies. Sometimes she will use her spare deposits of medicine to spare those who she may experiment on later.

Why does she do this? Some say that she wishes to please the King with the gold she will one day produce perhaps she wishes to court him with her ill gotten magic or perhaps she is simply in love with the idea of gold herself. Either way the court would do well to steer clear of her as she is far more paranoid than even the unseen.</description>
