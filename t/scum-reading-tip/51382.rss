    <description>I&#39;ve never seen anyone point this out before, so I figured I&#39;d do it.  I&#39;ve learned that when someone is on trial and a voter says something like &quot;King?&quot; (that is, &quot;King how should I vote?&quot;) it is almost ALWAYS either an evil or an alchemist.  I assume they do that to avoid responsibility for the way they vote and also to gain&#39;s King&#39;s trust.</description>

            <p>That is very true, it’s only real bad MMs who do that, but it happens too often.  I always shake my head when the Mastermind gets outted for being the last to claim</p>

            <p>For my Point</p>
<p>I look who claim at the king, and who do not claim</p>
<p>often, those who do not claim anything, at the king, and are very passive, they may comment on the discussion, but they will never suggest anything. they simply wait around and will only claim on stand. that often where you will find evil class. Passive guy who claim princess on stand ===== MM</p>

            <p>This is a clue but it’s never certain. I often follow King early as BD because I won’t have the information he does. Plus, like <a class="mention" href="/u/methomps">@methomps</a> said, it forces the King to take a position.</p>
<p>Still, though, if you’re an investigative role, it couldn’t hurt to check someone who asks the King what to do.</p>
<p>I’d say it’s better for evils to make small, pointless comments like that instead of staying silent - that’s a bigger tipoff for evils imo.</p>

            <p>I think it depends on context.  Early game if a person is put up and there is no obvious accusation, asking king may simply be seeking confirmation that there is a lead on this person.  King has superior knowledge from whispers.  Also, getting king’s input forces him to take a position, which can be useful depending on the result.</p>
<p>But I agree with you that it is a tipoff to be suspicious of a person, and as evil I specifically never act that way because people may read into it.</p>
