<h1>Rules</h1>
<h3><em>“The true enemy of humanity is disorder.”</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you haven’t posted in 36 hours, you will be prodded for inactivity via a ping. Not responding to a prod will cause you to be replaced.</li>
<li>Avoid discussing the game outside the thread while the game is still running.</li>
<li>Avoid using larger font sizes.</li>
<li>Avoid deleting/editing messages unless it’s a recent one or to correct grammar mistakes.</li>
<li>Avoid quoting the mod from your rolecard. This is a modkill-worthy offense.</li>
<li>Faking ultimates is allowed and a valid gambit.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<h3><em>“Alright. Gameface: On.”</em></h3>
<p>Each of the Day Phase I, Day Phase II, and the Night Phase will last 24 hours each.<br>
Actions are done by messaging me.<br>
The uninformed majority will be called Overwatch.<br>
The informed minority will be called Talon.<br>
Talon members will talk through a special Discord server<br>
There will be both logs and flips.<br>
There will be three game-specific mechanics in play - Eliminations, Ultimates, and Maps.</p>
<h1>Eliminations</h1>
<h3><em>“Your death makes me stronger!”</em></h3>
<p>Upon hammering a player of the opposite faction or killing them at night, the hammerer or killer will gain additional bonuses that will benefit their faction depending on their classes. All of the bonuses are listed as the first passive in your class card.</p>
<h1>Ultimates</h1>
<h3><em>“Ready to go Whole Hog.”</em></h3>
<p>Ultimates are extremely strong abilities that can be used once the player gains a certain amount of Ultimate Charges. They are activated by posting their activation text in the thread, while also quoting or replying to players depending on the Ultimate requirements.</p>
<p>Ultimate Charges can be gained during the end of the Day Phase I, through night action, or just by having casted a vote during either charge phase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charge to for each vote gained during Day Phase I - 2800/Players Living, rounded to the lowest multiple of 10.<br>
Charge per vote on lynched player - 40, 200 for hammerer.<br>
Charge per vote on charge phase - 40.<br>
Charge per night - 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used, the number of Ultimate Charges required to activate will be subtracted from the player’s total Ultimate Charges.</p>
<h1>Maps</h1>
<h3><em>“We fought a terrible battle here. Many Crusaders lost their lives.”</em></h3>
<p>In every Day Phase I, there will be a vote to decide the map for the next day/night cycle. Each map will give two additional effects to the mechanic and will also decide the Day Phase II’s lynch mechanic. Before the first day begins, the Talon-aligned players will have a vote to decide which map for the first day/night cycle.</p>
<h1>Day Phase I - Maps and Charges</h1>
<h3><em>“My will made real.”</em></h3>
<p>You may choose a map for the next day/night cycle and a player, except yourself, to give Ultimate Charges.<br>
The map that will have the most votes will be chosen for the next cycle and cannot be voted again, while each player will receive the total Ultimate Charges they received during the charge phase by the End of Phase. The Ultimate Charges per player scale inversely proportional with the number of living players in the match.</p>

<h3><em>“A moment to enjoy some peace and quiet… probably just a moment, though.”</em></h3>
<p>EFoL-style feedback will be used. Please submit your night actions in your role card to take effect.</p>
<h1>Role List</h1>
<h3><em>“Those who think they are all-knowing know nothing of what they do not.”</em></h3>
<p>This is a closed setup, ergo there are is not a class list, except everyone gains a role card and its matching flavor. in order for the game to not be flavor-broken, then any hero may be either part of Overwatch or Talon.</p>
<p>Classes in general will usually have a JOAT-like feel but leaning towards one specialization.</p>
<p>There is a fair caveat here that there will be heavy anti-slanking and anti-claiming, including partial claim, mechanics. Hard claim or slank at your own peril.</p>
<p>There are no third parties, no conversions, and no form of bastard mechanics included, but there are mechanics pertaining dead interactions and there may or may not be lost wolves.</p>
<h1>Joining</h1>
<h3><em>“I must rejoin my team.”</em></h3>
<p>To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like “I want to join” or “/join” or “/in” or “sign me up, coach” or whatever you want.</p>

<p>There is a fair caveat here that there will be heavy anti-slanking and anti-claiming, including partial claim, mechanics. Hard claim or slank at your own peril.</p>

</aside>

<p>Plus, I kind of need anti-slank mechanics for an 28p game. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/grin.png!v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
