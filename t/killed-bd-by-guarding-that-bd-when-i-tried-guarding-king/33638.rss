    <title>Killed BD by guarding that BD when i tried guarding King?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/killed-bd-by-guarding-that-bd-when-i-tried-guarding-king/33638</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I&#39;m Knight, I guarded king [16] and the system said &quot;you killed someone guarding [1]&quot; and then [1] was dead the next morning, ended up being a physician, and had my deathnote.  

so how did my guard switch from king to 1, and how did 1 die if i was guarding him, and and how was I the person who killed him when i was supposedly guarding him, and how can a knight kill a physician? 

also i believe it was a reaper game so possessor should have nothing to do with this.  

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to guard the king. 

#### Steps to reproduce: None

#### Comments- here is a screenshot, hopefully it uploads right.
