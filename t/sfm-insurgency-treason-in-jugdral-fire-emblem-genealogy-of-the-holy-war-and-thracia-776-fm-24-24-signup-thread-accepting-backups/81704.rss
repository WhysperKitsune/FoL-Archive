https://i.imgur.com/kqnZgCy.jpg

##### &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Hosted by @DatBird and @N.1. &lt;/div&gt;

## Starts When Filled or 5/15

# Rules and Punishments
[Standard FOL/FM Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926)




# General Mechanics
* Actions are done by messaging in your class card
* Loptrian Empire/Mafia members will talk through a special Discord server or forum page.
* There will be no logs but there will be flips.
* Starting from Day 2, ITAs will be enabled. They have a base 15% chance to hit, but are modified by abilities and the Weapon Triangle, the Trinity of Magic, ande the Triage of Anima. To use one type **/ITA Player** and ping me. There will be a hard cap of 5 ita kills per day, and they will go away for the day. They will go away permanently at 7 players alive.
* The host has a right to remain silent regarding any questions about the setup, passives, etc to stop angle shooting.
* If anything broken is ever found, I shall fix it regardless of your complaints.
* Bleeding, Poisoned, Injured are all interchangeable and will inform you how many days you have to live.



## General Scheduling 

* Rolecards will be sent out within a day of the game filling. Confirmations will be done in the rolecards only. 
* The game will start both once all players have &#39;checked in&#39; and confirmed their roles
* Phases will be 48/24.
* Lynches will be Majority &amp; Plurality
* Players should post at least 10 on topic and game related times per day phase. If this cannot be met for a particular reason, the mod should be informed in your role PM. Prods will be sent out in rolecards.

## Game Specific Mechanics

* This game is not bastard.
* There is no conversion.
* There may or may not be neutrals.
* There may or may not be lost wolves
* There are anti-claim mechanics.
* [**Reasonable Action Resolution**](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution) will be used to handle disputes on the same tier in [**Natural Action Resolution**](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution). 
* Only investigative roles and abilities will have feedback (such as being roleblocked / redirected) unless explicitly stated otherwise. They will not know who they were redirected to.
* Speed is a stat every role has. This is a stat to help determine if some abilities proc
* Money is a variable that every role has. It can be earned and spent at the store at night. Every time someone is killed their killer takes the cash, and in lynches the money is split between everyone on the wagon (except for the hammerer if the lynch death is via hammer with the hammerer getting all the leftovers). Also, all living players will be given a standard pay of 300 gold at the beginning of every day starting Day 2
* The shop will be able to be shopped at, at night without any use of an action. You can only buy one thing a night.
* Every Night there will be an Arena. There is a pay in every night to compete that might vary. You will unanimously fight in ITA sessions and the winner will receive a legendary weapon of their choosing as long as they can wield that type of Weapon/Magic.
* There are some Universal skills that can be acquired through the shop, or start with them.
* Legendary Weapons are only obtainable if you already own a normal version of the weapon (via staring with it or buying it) and win the arena. They usually augment your speed stat and give you specific skills
* Every player has two class cards, one they get at the beginning and one they get in the second generation. The second-generation cards are usually net buffs to your character in some way. At any point during the day, if the second generation would activate, the day will end with a no lynch as all current warriors either fall, get injured, or take over the continent. Under 3 circumstances will the game go into the second generation: There are 12 or fewer players, Day 4 ends, and Two Role Specific abilities
* This game&#39;s ITAs will be affected by your weapon equipped. Look at the chart below for Relevance
