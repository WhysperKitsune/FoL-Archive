            <p>I’m missing what you mean by “somewhat claimable”, if they make him testable (IE ability that others know if it is or isn’t’ used). Right now I have more of a problem with the game as a whole being too solvable, and the only balancing factor for this problem currently is bad players. I could care less if one or 2 classes aren’t the most fun thing on earth to play, if their existance makes all other classes have a game.</p>
<p>Here’s the further point… we take more classes out of fakable claims… the pressure on the ones in it go up 5x… if CW is moved into very testable, compared to the “almost untestable” category he is in… you bet your butt the “lul” knight, phys, sheriff/pali" factors will go up tenfold. massively raising the complaints of both being evil, and being one of those classes. Because the smaller that pool is, the more strategically advantageous it is to execute first ask questions later, with them.</p>

            <p>I see why they don’t want him to become claimable but if someone has a good idea that makes him somewhat claimable then I think it should be addded</p>
