&gt;[color=Brown]Quick Hunch  -[/color]  Select a player, Find out if they have attacked someone before or is attacking someone tonight. It will say they attacked someone even if the attack failed to kill. You will also prevent any invest classes from visiting this target_**[unlimited uses]**_

[color=Brown]Personal Business -[/color] Attack a player that you have found who attacked someone else _**[unlimited uses]**_

&gt;[color=yellow]Win Con - [/color] Kill 2 player that have successfully killed another player

This is a small take on Inqu and Pretender class put together, i think this makes a fun class because you have the option of working with BD but you can also go on your own. Your main target target may be the assassin or CL but you can also kill the Prince,Knight,Hunter, Chrono, Inqu, and Nk if youre lucky to find them. This class could be a really fun to work with and have in game.

_**PLEASE READ THIS**_
Questions that you could answer for this class:

3 - do you think this class is too overpowered or too underpowered?
4 - do you think this class will change the game in a positive or negative way?</description>

            <p>i agree with you on some things. If its poss game than you just have to deal with that. I also used one of your ideas and changed it to a day ability to make him easier.</p>

</aside>
<p>Too hard</p>
<ol>
<li>They have to have been alive for at least 2 days for you to check them when they’re attacking and then to kill them</li>
<li>They could be checked or killed the night that you’re checking them</li>
<li>Kinda swingy and makes him pretty much a kingmaker depending on who he sides with.</li>
<li>He can’t attack poss cause of his string</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggested changes: change first day ability to “Attack the player your target with <strong>Quick Hunch</strong> if they have attacked or are attacking someone tonight. [2 Uses]” And change the first night ability to “Discover whether your target can attack.”</p>
<p>Maybe change the second night ability to “If your target can attack someone, then prevent them tonight and kill them [2 uses]”</p>
