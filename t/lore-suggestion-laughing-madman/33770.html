          <p>I once stumbled upon the ruins of a castle on one of my adventures. From the looks of it the entire castle had been infiltrated. By who… or more disturbingly what, I cannot figure out. All I can see are the note and journals of people long gone. Some describe lives of deception. Some tell of princes and princesses killed by their own people, sometimes even their own king. Yet others tell of assassins and ritualists sowing doubt into the court. But there is one… a person or perhaps thing that most interests me. He is most commonly referred to as the fool. I cannot find much mention of him other than scrawlings in the margins of personal journals of books cursing his name. I believe I have found his personal log of his day to day activities but unlike all others I have found he doesn’t keep it very organized and from the very few things he does write I can only guess he was a raving lunatic.<br>
From what I can piece together from various burnt pieces of paper and scribblings of men waiting to die the fool was one hated by all. Some curse his name for deceiving them so while others praise his cleverness while despising him all the same but in all writings of him there are a few things in common. The mysterious fool was both skilled and insane. He had the power to make people say things without realizing it. He was most adept at hiding in the shadows. When he was seen on his many walks through the castle though, he made sure he was seen in just a glimpse, perhaps holding a knife or sneaking near the king’s doorway. No one ever caught a second glance of him but the first was enough for most to accuse him publicly. This was, of course, his goal. In his insanity he had come up with a plan. He wanted to be publicly executed so all could see what living in what the court had done to him. Upon analyzing what I could of his history I have concluded that he was a sad example of human life, Born with enough insanity to make him hatch such a plan but little enough to hide it until the moment where all could see. I firmly believe he still haunts the castle grounds, still insane, even in death. Now when I go to bed, even though I have long left that castle, I can hear what must have been his final maniacal laugh in my nightmares.</p>
