    <title>[class suggestion] Kings Advisor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-kings-advisor/18008</link>
    <description>Class- Advisor (could also be a noble rework)
Alignment-Neutral/investigative
Always spawn- No
Unique- Yes
Win requirements- The original king wins

Passive 1- dutiful- immune to occupation at night
Passive 2- Advisor- able to speak to the king at night (king and Advisor get an Advisor tab similar to prince/psychic)

Day ability 1- Whispers to and from you are unable to be seen for the day [1 charges]

Day ability 2- defile- make a player appear to be chosen class when they are executed [1 charge]

Night ability 1- peek -determine the faction of the target [3 charges]

Night ability 2- order- disable a targets ability to vote the following day. 


If a player spawns as Advisor, the king will see an icon next to their name showing they are the Advisor. Nobody else can see the icon just king. The point of the Advisor is to make being king a little less overwhelming and a little more fun as you know you have somebody on your side no matter what. The Advisor will not know what alignment the king has but it will obviously be easy for king to tell him N1. The advisors goal is for the king to win (not to survive, to win. Dead king can still win). The Advisor helps the king in several ways but in 2 main ways: 1- the Advisor gets 3 peeks. 3 chances to find allies of the king. The Advisor can potentially help an evil king out by locating an unseen or cult if he&#39;s lucky and telling king who it is and having 1 opportunity during the day to secretly notify the unseen/cult member that king is an ally. The other significant way the Advisor helps the king is the 1 defile he gets. If king is having trouble with leads, the Advisor can defile somebody who the Advisor can make appear evil so that trigger happy BD will slow their role. Also makes it so that the evil king can off one BD without being outed as evil. I think this will make being king a lot less stressful and a lot more fun and it&#39;s not OP because the abilities are limited.</description>

            <p>Yeah, king is already increase his team win rate by alot.<br>
I think the only option to make this class is if its appears somtimes, only when the king is natural.</p>
<p>Natural king can really takes advises about how to survive.</p>

            <p>I worry about any class that boosts the original king . being a particular king type already swings in the direction of his faction . Strengthening his starring position with another class interested in making the king win as it’s only goal will increase the swing</p>

            <p>Negative. The Advisor is neutral, and his win requirement is for the king to win. So if king is good, the Advisor will be working to get BD to win so that king wins. If king is neutral, the Advisor will just want the king to survive, if king is evil, the Advisor will be working to help the king help evil win. But he is neutral.</p>
<p>By your logic a merc would be aligned with whoever his contract is. Or the sorcerer has an evil alignment.</p>
<p>The Advisor is neutral because he has no alligience, just wants to see the king succeed.</p>
<p>And yeah if the king survives the king wins and so does the Advisor. But what I’m saying is that the king can die and still win if he has an alignment. So if the king dies the Advisor can still win. The the duke it says if the king dies the duke loses that’s the difference.</p>

            <p>Was it the duke? The only similarity I saw is that you can talk to the king at night. But the Advisors goal is to ensure the king wins not survives, and all the abilities are different. Also the Advisor is always neutral, not aligned with either side, just designed to help the king win through 1 use of defile,  3 uses of peek, and one use of invisible whispers.</p>
