    <title>Puppet Strings and Observer interactions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/puppet-strings-and-observer-interactions/48544</link>
    <description>I know that if The Observer watches the target that The Possessor sends a Puppet Strings target to attack, they&#39;ll see the person being manipulated by Puppet Strings as the visitor.  (That&#39;s part of the point of Puppet Strings, after all.)

But what happens if the Observer watches the person The Possessor used Puppet Strings to control?  Let&#39;s say that that person also performed a normal visit (eg. they&#39;re a Sheriff investigating someone.)  Does the Observer see them making two visits?</description>

            <p>Yeah, that was my assumption, but I’m curious if anyone knows for certain.</p>
<p>(And if he watches a CW who uses Tornado and is also Puppet Strings’ed, does he see three visits?)</p>
<p>This is an extremely important question, because remember, he’s also going to see the Possessor’s visit, so if a suspicious extra visit indicates Puppet Strings, he could use this to find the Possessor in a few cases.</p>

            <p>I would assume that he would see both visits. This is much like if the Cult Leader is seen erraticating.</p>
