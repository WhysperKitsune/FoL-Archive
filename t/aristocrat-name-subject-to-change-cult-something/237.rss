    <description>Day Ability 1: Undecided

Night Ability 1: Undecided

Passive: Royal Blood

Lore: 
Who the heck knows?

Comments: 
There should be a Cultist with Royal Blood, because in a Blue Dragon vs Cult game, Royals that step up have a 100% chance to be Blue Dragon
Converted Royals become this class and not the Cult Class corresponding to their Class Type
