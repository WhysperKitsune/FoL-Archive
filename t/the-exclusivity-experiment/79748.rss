    <title>The Exclusivity Experiment</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-exclusivity-experiment/79748</link>
    <description>Welcome to the Exclusivity Experiment

The rules are simple:

* You cannot post
  * mods can still post for mod stuff, but should otherwise refrain from posting unless they are also a member
* You can post, but only if you are a member.
* I start as a member
* It is encouraged for new members to post once to introduce themselves to the club, and to ping me so that i might add them to  the list
* Every new member may add an additional rule
  * If 24 hours go by without a new member, a random member will be chosen to add a new rule, and may be punished.
* You cannot submit a rule that targets other members subjectively. all rules must affect all members or all prospective new members
* It must always be possible to become a member If you would make a rule such that this would no longer be possible, an other random member may make a rule instead. In non-objective cases, the Experiment Admin will make the decision 
* I may modify this initial rule set later

As the first member, the first rule is: In order to become a member, like every post already in the thread before your introduction post, as of the start of the experiment


[details=&quot;List of Rules&quot;]
1. Like every post in the Experiment to become a member
2. Prospective members must compose a sonnet about FM in some form (FoL/SFoL/Miscs/VFM/etc) member Arete will be the judge on if the pass or not, or if they are not present the Experiment Admin will take the role as a secondary judge
[/details]

List of Members:
1. Simon
2. Arete


[details=&quot;Archived List of Members&quot;]
1. Simon
2. Orange
[/details]
&lt;Only Experiment Admins may proceed past this point.&gt;
&lt;If you are not an Experiment Admin please halt here and do not scroll further&gt;






&lt;Experiment Log&gt;

&lt;Experiment One&gt;
&lt;One person joined, and immediately prevented other people from Joining. And then proceeded to kick out the starting member. It seems like this may be a recurring problem. Minimal levels of valuable data were collected after they gave their rule. I&#39;ve updated the initial ruleset to hopefully prevent this in the future.&gt;
&lt;I&#39;ve hidden the update and creation of these logs into a brief change of the initial ruleset to promote multiple experiments. Thankfully I&#39;ve also been able to prevent the resetter from logging the creation of these for now, but I&#39;m Not sure i can do that in the future. I&#39;ll have to be more careful&gt;




&lt;Experiment Two&gt;
&lt;That same person joined, and made it impossible for new members to join via making the requirement a badge that only they have and is real difficult to get. the rule i made this time gives me subjective control over what rules are allowed as long as i can make a case for it. hopefully they dont see it coming and i can snip it in the bud and let them know what this is supposed to be about&gt;</description>

            <p>it has been 24 hrs since a member has joined.<br>
therefore a random member will be chosen to submit a new rule, and they are both encouraged to make a rule that will make accepting new members easier, and reminded that whatever rule they make they might be punished<br>
