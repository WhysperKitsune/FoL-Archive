            <p>Well, I made it one use and it’s not guaranteed you’ll find cult or unseen. Plus, you may have already used it or the maid isn’t in the round.</p>

            <p>One thing to remember. Merc no longer has contracts. Should be changed as Sellsword will be compatible with Unseen/Cult members while Merc is compatible with Blue Dragon members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examine room</strong> - Look at the target’s logbook. <em>(3 uses)</em></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is an investigative ability, so it matches this class. So no problem with this.</p>
<p>So to recap, the handmaiden is an investigative blue dragon, but has 2 offensive abilities, 3 investigative abilities (assuming hidden visits is investigative even though it is necessary), and a social ability. The problem is the class wants to maintain its type. It primarily wants to have its type’s abilities in this case being investigative. If a <strong>small</strong> 1 ability from another type is implemented it is ok, but for the class to be perfect a person primarily wants to implement investigative abilities. So to be accepted this class <strong>must</strong> be reworked.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong>The Maid (Unofficial Class)</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Blue Dragon Investigative</strong><br>
<strong>Service (Day)</strong>  - At the end of the day, you will learn if your target has royal blood. - 2 uses<br>
<strong>Poke Around (Night)</strong>  - Look in someone’s chambers to determine their class type. - 2 uses<br>
<strong>Matchmake (Night)</strong>  - Try to ‘hook up’ 2 players, you will be told whether they are compatible or not (see below). - Infinite Uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Members of opposing Factions are not compatible</li>
<li>Members of Neutral Factions are compatible with every Neutral Faction that they can win with</li>
<li>Royals are not compatible with each other that would be weird</li>
<li>The King and Fool are not compatible with anyone</li>
<li>The Mercenary is compatible with her target no matter the faction</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Converts into The Handmaiden (Unofficial Class) or The Seeker</strong><br>
<strong>Cult points: 2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the forum of lies, version of maid an investigative. As Captain, said your class is similar, but it still has its differences.</p>
<p>But as you see here, this class is an investigative with <strong>only</strong> Investigative abilities thus maintaining the class type investigative.</p>

            <p>This seems to me like an awkward combination of already-existing roles, thus lacking some originality. Other than that, I believe that the “Service” Day Ability is OP for a BD, because princess claims will always be serviced and MMs/Unconverted Seekers will die.</p>
