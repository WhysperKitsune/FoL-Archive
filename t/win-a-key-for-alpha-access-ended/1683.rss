    <description>## Greetings Nobles! Our Court is inviting you to Castle Adiart! But only four may procure an invite, who will it be?

**YOU** have the chance to become apart of the Royal Court here in Castle Adiart. To become a subject of the Court, you simply need to understand our scriptures upon the &#39;Wikia&#39; a place of great knowledge and understanding of how things work! Our scribes work heavily on it! 

However, :teemo: Teemo :teemo:, the little bugger, has been running all over it, and getting his paws on our work! Please, go around the Wiki and find this mischievous little devil!

Scouts have reported 4 instances of Teemo dotted about! Screen shot him on the page and send me a Private Message on the forums once you&#39;ve found him! We encourage heavy scouting, our scouts haven&#39;t pinpointed the exact locations.

Once you&#39;ve submitted your screen shots, you&#39;ll be entered into a raffle! There are 4 KEYS TO BE WON! 2 keys are being provided by @robflop because he&#39;s a beautiful person!

Oh, there are also rules!

You can&#39;t already own the game! Also, if you are caught editting out a Teemo, you&#39;ll be DQ&#39;d!
Make sure you are apart of the Discord too! : https://discord.gg/rFAXXQB

## The first person to find all *4* Teemo will win the first key! After that, everybody else that finds all *4* Teemo will be put into a Raffle and it will be drawn from RNG for the last three keys
