    <title>Hunter Needs a Rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/hunter-needs-a-rework/71719</link>
    <description>**Too Confirmable**

Hunter is too confirmable. There ability &quot;Wolf&quot;  is the only ability in the game that can make a player bleed at night, even the Hunter&#39;s converts lack this ability, basically confirming the hunter to be hunter.  In my opinion this is the only ability in the game that can 100% confirm a class, yes they can be converted but this is very unlikely as when hunter reveal their class they normally have all their bears, as hunters don&#39;t usually bear for the first 3 nights.

**Unnecessary** 
Hunter does not help bd as much as other classes he is basically the survivor from tos, but has 2 bleeds, bleeding does not really help bd and I know some of you would hate me for saying this, but wolf is only really used when bd know somebody is evil( can be used if somebody is sus but for the most part) , because hunter cannot get info on it&#39;s own it is only used as to confirm hunter that&#39;s it unless you get lucky from wolfing somebody or bearing somebody.

Remove Poll because I want to know reason&#39;s why because nobody is explaining in the comments why they think he doesn&#39;t need a rework.</description>

            <p>I never said that Hunter needs a buff, I just meant that if it received any changes then it should be a wolf buff because healers are common.  It’s fine right now though</p>

            <p>Hunter is fine.  Sure, wolf is confirmable, but you shouldn’t be using a killing ability for confirmation.  What if the healer gets occupied?  Or what if there is a sellsword?  Wolf needs a buff if anything, physicians are too common</p>

            <p>I think Hunter is fine. But whatever happens, please make all heal feedback generic.</p>
<p>No “You cured X of their nightshade poisoning,” “You healed X last night,” or “X was bleeding, so you healed them.”</p>
<p>Just, “You healed X” or “X did not need healing.”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>TLDR:</p>
<p>Hunter is only semi confirmable because at any given moment a Hunter most likely has not wolfed anyone.</p>
<p>Butler is instantly confirmable because nearly all Butler’s have occupied someone at any given moment</p>
<p>Mystic is auto confirmed because she has a confirmable day ability meaning that any request to confirm can be done without going to night phase.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is the only ability in the game that can 100% confirm a class</p>

</aside>
<p>Telepathy says hi</p>
<p>Wolfing can be easily faked to buy you time. No BD wants to mislynch a Hunter, so you generally get a night of safety. You just have to claim you wolfed somebody and then kill them the following night. If a Healer heals your target, they know your target was “bleeding” and will confirm it for you and your target will get lynched for “lying” about not getting bled. Ofc when your target claims they were attacked, just beat them down verbally.</p>
<p>Wolfing isn’t impossible to fake compared to something like Telepathy or Noble’s day abilities.</p>
<p>Creative lies go a long way in this game.</p>

            <p>You are massively underestimating the Hunter if you think he doesn’t serve a purpose. Bear acts as a psychological tool for every player involved.</p>
<p>For the Hunter because he can be more aggressive</p>
<p>For scum because it means dealing with aggressive players through murder or conversion</p>
<p>For other BD because it means aggressive players are risky targets</p>
<p>All of this encourages BD to be active and for Scum to try and compete for the role of Leader. And not in the mechanical King sense but in the psychological “this guy knows what he is talking about so I should do what he says” sense.</p>

            <p><strong>Too Confirmable</strong></p>
<p>Hunter is too confirmable. There ability “Wolf”  is the only ability in the game that can make a player bleed at night, even the Hunter’s converts lack this ability, basically confirming the hunter to be hunter.  In my opinion this is the only ability in the game that can 100% confirm a class, yes they can be converted but this is very unlikely as when hunter reveal their class they normally have all their bears, as hunters don’t usually bear for the first 3 nights.</p>
<p><strong>Unnecessary</strong><br>
Hunter does not help bd as much as other classes he is basically the survivor from tos, but has 2 bleeds, bleeding does not really help bd and I know some of you would hate me for saying this, but wolf is only really used when bd know somebody is evil( can be used if somebody is sus but for the most part) , because hunter cannot get info on it’s own it is only used as to confirm hunter that’s it unless you get lucky from wolfing somebody or bearing somebody.</p>
<p>Remove Poll because I want to know reason’s why because nobody is explaining in the comments why they think he doesn’t need a rework.</p>
