    <title>Report/Ban system</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/report-ban-system/1697</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I made this thread regarding reports and banning.  I want every one to suggest how reports and banning should be taken care of or if you think my way is good enough.
First of all let&#39;s start with how town of Salem takes care of reports, they perma-ban people who talk and rage at other players which I think is very stupid because what if that person is having a bad day ? You have possibly banned a loyal costumer because he had a bad day. That&#39;s what happened with me.

So what I&#39;m suggesting is a &quot;3 strike&quot; ban system and here it is 
Spam, sending links and false reports get a **7 day ban**

Profanity and harassment get a **14 day ban**

Game throwing and trolling get a **21 day ban**

If those reported continue doing it then their ban will increase and if they do it a third time, they are perma-banned. Let&#39;s not forget that people buy Throne of lies which means that if they get warned for a couple of days ban they will most likely stop, because if they get perma-banned then it&#39;s over for them.

Do you think this report/ban system is good ? If not suggest how reports should be taken care of.</description>

            <p>Well it doesn’t matter if you guys believe me - I’m an adult and the devs have access to my logs after the ban expired, so they can see I am sincere. I’m a role player and really nice person. My friend, well, not that great of a person but we have known each other a long time and I am trying. I wouldn’t say he bought into the whole alt-right hate stuff but he’s growing close. Anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply dev. I agree with you and the it’s appreciative you engage your customers candidly. I just wanted to share my two cents, as it seems laborious to try to police subjective things like “toxicity” but your heart is clearly in the right place. It’s nice coming into a game as chaotic as this one without having to deal with barrages of puerile chat to mine through, or someone calling me a slur because I wasn’t as wise to the game as them.</p>
<p>Either way I gave you a glowing review on Steam and hope for your continued success. You got me into a new genre and I’m grateful.</p>

            <p><strong>TL;DR: We’re not gonna become League of Legends, reports will actually punish people and we’ll do our best to not let this community turn toxic, sorry to disappoint you. We accept everyone as long as they accept everyone.</strong></p>
<p>First of all we’re not from US, at least not all of us, but we want a healthy community. <code>fuck</code> is allowed as well as most curse words when they’re not targeting someone. However, repeatedly disrespecting someone even without curse words can be toxic. I’ve seen reports of new players getting literally bullied for not playing like “experienced” players.</p>
<p>Gamethrowing is pretty clear for us to see to be honest. We don’t care that much if someone makes a bad decision or uses a bad strategy/tactic, they will get better at the game, they’ll learn, what we punish people for is the intention to ruin the fun for everyone. We don’t want people to kill trolls/gamethrowers or people who offend others, we want them to be out of our community. We accept everyone, as long as <strong>they</strong> accept everyone.</p>
<p>We don’t ban first offenders without a reason, so your friend most likely did something pretty bad. It’s not our job to secure your account.</p>

            <p>If racism and such slurs are banned, so should other serious profanity. You should be able to express yourself in more creative ways than using curse words, especially when those curse words did not exist at this time.</p>

            <p>whether or not profanity should be punished is dependent on the game’s rating and/or target audience.<br>
I looked and i couldnt find either<br>
as for the parts on game throwing and toxic behavior, i cant really speak on that front, as im not a mod</p>

            <p>I don’t think profanity should be punished. What passes for offensive to some might be casual lingo to others (certain terms and phrases common in the UK that wouldn’t even be allowed on basic cable in the US, comes to mind). We’re also not responsible for other people’s children or sensibilities. It’s a game about deception, murder, and execution - so why should someone be punished for profanity?</p>
<p>“Game throwing” can be something interpreted very arbitrarily. As can “toxic behavior”. A person may have made some mistakes while working towards an earnest goal, but it lost the game, and others would consider it game throwing. Some people are serious about winning, gregarious, and have no disruptive motives, but they want to have fun playing and like their games with a lot of levity - and some people consider that as being “toxic”. Some people may just not be great at the game, or be trying to sow discord in the short term while working toward an eventual win. I mean, this is really just a mess to try to police. If a person clearly states they don’t care and are just going to lose, fine, but even then, it’s just a game. Is this really something the devs and community want to waste time on? If someone is being a goof I can just leave, or deal with them using in-game mechanisms. I don’t need a nanny-like moderator to swoop in and ban the person.</p>
<p>Really, I think all that needs to be policed is racism (et al) and harassment. Racism can largely be addressed with filters, even auto bans that trigger when someone types an obvious slur or some common string that attempts to circumvent it (like spelling slurs in reverse, or phrases in some phonetic way). Harassment is obvious.</p>
<p>I caught a ban thanks to my moron friend who was using my computer after I fell asleep. I’m afraid to know what he even typed (the reason, he said, was “racism” - so yea, someone had to endure that thinking it was my good name on Steam doing it). That’s totally justifiable. But what if he was just being goofy in a game and people wanted him to be more serious? Maybe wrote stupid stuff in his journal? Etc? Do we really need mommy dev to protect fragile players from such grave offenses?</p>

<p>Game throwing and trolling is honestly an instaban imo. Since that breeds toxic behaviour out of the people affected. Which is something ToL actively tries to avoid.</p>
<p>Profanity and harassment it needs context to it. Because depending on the past situation Profanity can be acceptable (Such as you said, a person having a bad day.) But we’ll need to bump up the punishment. 21 days, if they don’t learn then ban.</p>
<p>Spam, sending links and false reports should net them a warning. 3 warnings then a ban should suffice.</p>
<p>(P.S. If you’re having a bad day, come vent to me in pm <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’ll gladly listen)</p>

            <p>Actually, it does work.<br>
Let’s see my situation.<br>
town of Salem perma banned me for talking shit when I had a bad day, let’s say if I was temp-banned, I would have had time to cool off learn from my mistake and come back. Guess what ? I can’t, I have been perma banned a costumer who was going to actually buy the Dlc pack they released.</p>

            <p>In my experience, Temp bans don’t work.</p>
<p>If somebody joins a game and starts spamming, sending links and false reports, why give them a chance to do it again? Get rid, that’s what I say.</p>
<p>If somebody is using excessive profanity and is harassing players, again, why give them a chance to do it all over again to somebody? Good bye! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=9" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>
<p>Gamethrowing and trolling… again ^ read above. Toodlepip! Cheerio!</p>
<p>Permanent bans are also a good way to set an example to others who may think that they might get away with it.</p>
<p>Of course, you’d differentiate between people. If it’s somebody who has been here for less than a week that’s doing any of these, yeh, perm-ban. If it’s somebody that’s been around for like a month or two, probably a less severe punishment.</p>
<p>Either way, temp-bans haven’t worked in my experience. People just come back and do it all over.</p>

            <p>What does “Face the consequences of whichever mod or dev caught you” mean ? You realize there’s going to be a report system right ? That means automatic report will be sent, they won’t manually catch some one doing something bannable. I feel like you need to rephrase that sentence. Also, of course some people will get punished more than others even if they fall under the same category, for example.<br>
Player A : Keeps saying “what the fuck dude ? Stop playing you are so shit” to a player over and over again then he will have to face a five day punishment.<br>
Player B : Keeps saying “FUCK YOU DUDE YOU ARE SO SHIT KILL YOURSELF” and other extreme stuff then he gets a longer punishment. The 7 day thing was to set a bar for each punishable act, some people will get more than others IF they are more extreme.</p>

            <p>That’s wrong and unfair, that’s like saying all criminals should get the same sentence. Does not make sense.<br>
I can agree on extending the ban for like a week to a month but perma is way too extreme. Only racists and those types of people should get perma’d, not some one who keeps saying “wtf you’re shit” over and over again.</p>

            <p>I don’t agree with this…</p>
<p>I think all the report that is valid should have the same ban day…</p>
<p>And it will progress on when you keep doing it…</p>
<p>People could get appeal if they think it is unfair or they are Perma’d but changed their attitude. Or have wait for a long time… Like 6 month or 1 years…</p>
<p>If the report are dealt slowly, they could add a judgement system to sort out report quickly, just like TOS…</p>

            <p>Hi guys, I made this thread regarding reports and banning.  I want every one to suggest how reports and banning should be taken care of or if you think my way is good enough.<br>
First of all let’s start with how town of Salem takes care of reports, they perma-ban people who talk and rage at other players which I think is very stupid because what if that person is having a bad day ? You have possibly banned a loyal costumer because he had a bad day. That’s what happened with me.</p>
<p>So what I’m suggesting is a “3 strike” ban system and here it is<br>
Spam, sending links and false reports get a <strong>7 day ban</strong></p>
<p>Profanity and harassment get a <strong>14 day ban</strong></p>
<p>Game throwing and trolling get a <strong>21 day ban</strong></p>
<p>If those reported continue doing it then their ban will increase and if they do it a third time, they are perma-banned. Let’s not forget that people buy Throne of lies which means that if they get warned for a couple of days ban they will most likely stop, because if they get perma-banned then it’s over for them.</p>
<p>Do you think this report/ban system is good ? If not suggest how reports should be taken care of.</p>
