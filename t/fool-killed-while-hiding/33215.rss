    <title>Fool killed while hiding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fool-killed-while-hiding/33215</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Playing as Fool night 2, after framing n1 and nothing else of note happening. I press hide at around 8 seconds left on the night. I receieve 3 messages that night: 
1. You will hide tonight
2. You hid from all visitors
3. You were attacked

afterwords, i was dead immediately. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
To my knowledge, Hide prevents all visits. This should prevent all people, including attackers, from visiting Fool, preventing night actions targeting them. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
Unknown. I have no idea what class caused the attack. Didn&#39;t stay to see what kind of game it ended up being, i was angry. 

#### Comments:
While i don&#39;t have a way to check this or prove it, i suspect it was an assassin or a cult leader. I think the NK that game was the Reaper, and i didn&#39;t receive a &quot;Reaped&quot; notice alongside the attack.

Edit: Jester to Fool. Whoops. Old Town of Salem lingo sticking around.</description>

            <p>Only other possibility is a converted Knight using the 1-use bypass on the night you were killed</p>

            <p>Only thing I can think of is being HH’s and attacked, which could happen, though it’s pretty unlikely to.</p>
