    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Thief (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-thief-neutral-offensive/2943</link>
    <description>The Thief is Immune to conversion.

You will have a counter visible with how many gold bars you currently possess.
Win Condition: Collect 3 gold bars, and survive.

Passive: On The Move
Immune to occupation.

Passive: Caught Red-Handed
The Thief will always show up as such when investigated by any class that can determine faction, if you have any gold bars.

Day Ability: Plant (2 uses)
Plant incriminating evidence on a player, causing them to show up as The Thief tonight.

Night Ability 1: Steal (1 use)
Sneak into a player&#39;s room, and steal a gold bar from them. Stealing from someone with Royal Blood gives you two gold bars, instead of one. You can only steal from a player once.

Night Ability 2: Mug (Infinite uses)
Occupy the target player. You will steal a use of a limited use night ability if they have any, granting you an extra use of Steal. 

You can have multiple uses of Steal at a time.
Basically, my idea for the Thief is that you&#39;ll be causing enough trouble for the Blue Dragon through the use of Mug to get more uses of Steal that they may want you dead, so you&#39;ll want to not get caught. On the other hand, if you have caused more trouble for the evil faction, the Blue Dragon may want you to use Mug on them, to mutually benefit, perhaps even giving you the name of a royal to complete your objective quicker so you can continue to assist them.</description>

<p>I think this should be, maybe name it “No time to hide the gold!” or something, and since you can only have 2 passives;</p>

<p>work this into <em>Steal</em></p>
<p>Just my suggestion, to make things clearer!</p>
