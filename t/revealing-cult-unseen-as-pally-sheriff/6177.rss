    <description>What is the correct play as pally/sheriff when you find evil player night 1 or 2? I tried whispering king and then when he did nothing, I claimed pally and told chat. They proceed to execute me as scorned. Do you guys stay silent when you find evil players or how do you do it?</description>

            <p>A Knight might guard you, or they might think you’re Scorned, or they might not be paying attention.  Calling the person out and getting them lynched will not only kill them but ensure you’re guarded.  Maybe when the player base matures a bit and stop believing every paladin/sheriff claim that’ll change but right now it’s generally not an issue to get someone lynched.</p>
<p>I don’t see why you wouldn’t just tell the King.  If he’s evil he’s either forced to use that info to keep his cover, or he betrays you but then it’s obvious he’s evil and you get rid of 2 threats.</p>

            <p>Also if you have a smart knight they will guard the person making claim. If they nailed an unseen and take action your knight will score a kill and further confirm your claim.</p>

            <p>When you say “check ##” you’re not outing yourself other than the fact you are BD. You could be a butler who hit an immune. You could be a princess and found potential killer. Priest might have gotten info from the dead. There are too many variables to pinpoint that person as a sheriff/pally that early in the game.</p>
<p>The point of the early game is to obtain leads and expose truth. There are classes other than investigative who can get to the bottom of what the potential target does (drunk or butler for example).</p>

            <p>I think this is a bad play on several levels. You have to consider how this will look to the other players.</p>
<p>2 sheriffs or paladins isn’t even guaranteed so what if you’re the only one? Even if there is one, they are going to have to consider the chance you are Scorned and asking for a check because you plan to frame the person tonight.  The odds are good enough that I wouldn’t bother checking as an invest because I’d consider any results I get to be completely unreliable. If I’m a protective role maybe I believe you and guard you, but maybe I don’t.</p>
<p>To the cult/unseen: You just randomly outed one of them. The BD don’t know you’re telling the truth but the cult/unseen sure do.  What conclusion do you think they’re going arrive at if someone randomly accurately accuses them during the day?  They’re going to know your an invest and you pegged one of them.  So, they’ll kill you.  And even in the best case scenario where your plan works, since you outed yourself to do it, and then you made the other Sheriff/Paladin confirm it, you just outed <em>both</em> sheriff/paladins.</p>
<p>I don’t see any advantage to this at all.</p>

<p>Anyways, Fool is a bad class and it really shouldn’t exist to begin with tbh, so all you can do is ask them to be Prince’d if you suspect a Fool</p>

            <p>I usually ask if someone can try and occupy the offender . Can a butler keep 8 busy tonight ?</p>
<p>You know it’s not mastermind so it’s likely just converted or most likely assassin .</p>
<p>If it’s an Assasin you are actually better off keeping him occupied for 3 turns rather than killing him straight off . there can only be one assassin after all.<br>
the<br>
if anyone ever says kill me next turn if i am wrong . I strongly urge everyone to kill them this turn and the other one if we are wrong next turn . especially on turn 1 1 in 14 long shot hits</p>

<p>Either stuff it in your journal to be revealed upon death, or out them. Usually people don’t lynch sheriff/pala as scorned.</p>

            <p>Push them for something different, get them to claim, and then claim if you need to I guess.</p>
<p>Also if the BD ever hangs Paladin/Sheriff as “Scorned” with no counter-claim, they’re irredeemably stupid and you just got put with bad people. You don’t risk it for a Neutral ffs</p>

            <p>Sit on that info for abit when a few people are dead, try whispering a claim out of them, or just going balls deep and pushing them for a claim in public to put them under pressure</p>

            <p>What is the correct play as pally/sheriff when you find evil player night 1 or 2? I tried whispering king and then when he did nothing, I claimed pally and told chat. They proceed to execute me as scorned. Do you guys stay silent when you find evil players or how do you do it?</p>
