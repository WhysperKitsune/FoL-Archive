    <title>Indirectly asking for conversion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/indirectly-asking-for-conversion/13615</link>
    <description>There is one trend i noticed in all of the game i play. Sometimes, 2-3 investigative roles are killed. The king is out of reports. There hasn&#39;t been any new info since 2-3 days. And people just keep doing absolutly nothing every days. They won&#39;t execute anyone because &quot;they need proof&quot;.

Then you finally say something &quot;ok guys, lets stop waiting forever, clearly we&#39;re not getting reports and were slowly getting converted. Let&#39;s just execute among the unclears&quot;. Then everyone goes crazy and execute YOU.

Can we say that&#39;s indirectly just asking to be converted? Its like everyone&#39;s strategy is doing nothing and hope they get converted.

Anyone else noticed this trend?</description>
