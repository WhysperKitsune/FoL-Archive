    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Golden Dragon</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/faction-suggestion-the-golden-dragon/58163</link>
    <description>I was thinking about having a second &quot;Good&quot; faction, with different classes than the Blue Dragon to help make games more diverse. This class would be an alternative to the Blue Dragon, and games would have either Golden Dragon or Yellow Dragon. Here is a suggestion for the faction called &quot;The Golden Dragon&quot;.
The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:
- The Queen is a more &quot;Social&quot; version of the King.
- The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is &quot;The Bailiff&quot; which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin.
- There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.
- All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.
- Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.
- There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.
- The &quot;Healer&quot; of this faction can only heal poison or bleeding a limited number of times, but he can cure poison and protect someone else from attacks on the same night.

I would appreciate comments or feedback. Some of you may have noticed I reused some of my old class suggestions here. I also took some ideas from stuff others have suggested in the past, such as the Queen&#39;s hidden whispers or The Royal Guard&#39;s Dayvig ability.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Okay, thank you for the feedback, here are some changes I made:</p>
<ul>
<li>I changed the mortician’s useless ability (oops).</li>
<li>I completely changed the executioner and hangman, there is no jailing in the Golden Dragon anymore. Made the hangman a “risky” convert on purpose, can be really powerful but if the unseen doesn’t play their cards right it will be obvious there is a hangman in the game.</li>
<li>I removed political pressure from the Elder and the Old Man and added another “social” ability that doesn’t involve vote manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff Im still thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Im not really sure how to change the Maid. A part of me really wants an ability that can hear night conversations, but I agree it could be really underpowered since evils will most likely just don’t talk at night if they know there is a risk of a Maid listening. Also, the ability to read whispers will still make her easy to confirm since there is no other class that can read whispers except maybe Possessor. One change I have in mind is to give her an ability that notifies the maid if a player speaks at night, but won’t reveal their messages.</li>
<li>I really want to make the Old Man able to choose the class he will reveal his accuser as, but there is no way to do that without removing one of his day abilities which I believe are more important.</li>
</ul>

<p>Revenge of Mithras - If you are sacrificed, the cult leader will get one charge of rupture in addition of the normal Eradicate charges.</p>
<p>Heart of Mithras (Night) - Use an eradicate charge to kill two players tonight. If the Cult leader uses eradicate as well, this ability will fail. 1 use, also uses 1 charge of the Cult Leader’s eradicate.</p>
<p>Ruptured throat (Night) - Select a player. If they talk or whisper tomorrow they will start bleeding. They will be notified if they are under this ability’s effects. 2 uses.</p>

<p>Btw I don’t mean to be a jerk but the fact that Acolyte has Invoker on it annoys me…</p>

</aside>
<p>Didn’t want to give him a free kill like the executioner. Blackmail is risky but could be powerful, the main use is to silence someone important so the assassin can kill them the next night. I could also change it so blackmailed players cannot edit their logs.</p>

            <p>Here is a thing. I would love to see alternative faction to Blue Dragon but also i would expect that classes have slighty less similarities. Bah, i would probably see a big step replacing The Prince with completely different class type with similar power.</p>
<p>Although it was solid attempt.</p>

            <p>Maid - You’ll likely get nothing useful out of Eavesdrop and it’s super confirmable if you manage to see the good Queen’s messages. Gossip is also too confirmable. Change it so your target can send an anonymous message the next day instead and change eavesdrop to allow the maid to see all whispers the next day instead.</p>
<p>Mortician - Dark Faith is useless since you can’t convert with him cause you’d have full slots. Make it the next convert instead or something</p>
<p>Executioner - Only 3 uses of Imprison? Boring(and useless). Give him more night abilities at the very least.</p>
<p>Cleaner - Was it previously named room keeper? Descriptions are kinda weird?</p>
<p>Old Man - Change up his abilities from pure voting I guess, cause his passive is useless af. People will be on the look out for Old Man, obviously so allow him to choose what the person’s “revealed” role looks like at least. I would replace political pressure tbh, probably removing it from both the Elder and Old Man</p>
<p>Hangman - Class card says executioner, also blackmail is too obvious, especially if he is outed as the executioner already. Maybe have it not notify them that they are blackmailed? Also same thing with Executioner, he needs more night abilities.</p>
