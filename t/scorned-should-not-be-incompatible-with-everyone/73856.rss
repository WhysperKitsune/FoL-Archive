    <title>Scorned should not be incompatible with everyone</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/scorned-should-not-be-incompatible-with-everyone/73856</link>
    <description>Fool&#39;s incompatibility helps him win.  But it does the opposite for Scorned and it&#39;s the only way BD can out them in a way Scorned has absolutely no way to defend against.  You can&#39;t plan ahead for a random n1 or n2 incompatible check, and it&#39;s not fair for a class that loses if it dies before achieving its win condition. 

You can&#39;t say, &quot;get the person you&#39;re incompatible with executed,&quot; because once they are it proves you&#39;re a fake and you lose all credibility and are therefore incapable of achieving your wincon after that.  

Except for special situations where for whatever reason they ignore you and let you continue framing.</description>

            <p>Uh shrimpy, that’s fair lol. Also being incompatible with everyone as fool is a byproduct of having maid as a class.</p>

            <p>Not sure if you are understanding what I’m trying to say.  I’m not talking about faking Maid as Scorned, I’m complaining that Scorned being incompatible with literally everyone is not fair to Scorned.  When you look at Fool, the incompatibility helps him win, with Scorned it’s the opposite</p>

            <p>Like the point of maid is to be a better sheriff however having slower checks and more potential for frames ect. Maid finding this is fine</p>
