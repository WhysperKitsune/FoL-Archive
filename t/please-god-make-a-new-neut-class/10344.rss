    <title>Please god make a new neut class</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/please-god-make-a-new-neut-class/10344</link>
    <description>Make a neut class or change alch where it&#39;s useful enough to bd and not that much of a risk to bd, that they don&#39;t neuts out every neut character it makes it extremely hard to play any neut. BD don&#39;t listen to any reason don&#39;t need any proof beside the fact your a neut because literally there is no reason to keep them unless it&#39;s late game and you need to try a come back against outnumbering and at that point why would they take your side made an account just to bring it up.</description>

            <p>God has nothing to do with the creation of Neutral Classes, the correct title should be “Please boslof make a new neut class”. Boslof is the ‘god’ of ToL classes, neut. esp.</p>

<li>You can claim very easily, pretend to be phys (a bit harder with death knight, but hopefully by the time people question you they don’t have the time to kill an alch)</li>
<li>Alchs will side whichever side will make the game faster, so as soon as cult have even numbers (even when prince can exe one and knight can CS one the following night), alch will vote with cult.</li>

            <p>The question is if they will claim Neutral after the seeker dies. Also the cult might kill them on thier own.</p>

            <p>I find if you claim after the king points you out , you will get killed . However if you claim before you are suspect then there are a lot more reasonable bd about .<br>
Remember as well a lot of the neuts out band wagon are in fact not bd but actually unseen or cult .</p>
<p>As unseen or cult really want  neuts out as well . It wastes the exe for the turn , which is great for evil and if unseen are under numbered at that stage alch is usually loyal to bd whilst bd is winning .<br>
Also the other options are much less for them . They know that the alch is not evil , bd will be risking it because killing neuts has consequences for bds - fools etc  , unseen love executing a fool .</p>
<p>A lot of neuts out guys tend to fall into 2 categories , idiots and unseen .</p>

            <p>Alc is insanely useful almost too much so for BD. He can heal, kill, can’t be converted and can protect himself. The only reason he’s a safe kill, is that he isn’t forced to side with blue dragon, which is kinda the definition of being a neutral. You can’t really change that in a class without just calling it a BD class.</p>
<p>If you ask me the real issue, is the kings investigations… people assume that if the king doesn’t find something in the first 4 days, he’s an evil king, which means when a king finds a neut, he has to go out at it.</p>
<p>If you ask me the real solution is a tweak to allies, make the BD kings checks work more like a sheriffs check. IE he can find unseen (except for MM in the first 3 days), and cult members, and that’s it.</p>
<p>Right now a BD kings check, confirms that you are either neutral (safe kill), or Cult/unseen (must kill), unless he happened to have hit a scorned target. It’s more or less irresponsible for him not to vote up the person.</p>
<p>If they tweak it so if BD king doesn’t see neuts as evil… than catching a neut proves himself as neut/evil king, which would greatly de-motivate neutral or evil kings from going neuts out also.</p>
