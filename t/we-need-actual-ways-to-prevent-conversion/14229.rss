    <title>We need actual ways to prevent conversion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/we-need-actual-ways-to-prevent-conversion/14229</link>
    <description>As you guessed from the title, this topic is about fixing conversion. I feel like it&#39;s pretty much broken in certain situations. Let&#39;s say a Sheriff or Paladin finds an Unseen/Cult member and all they see is they will get converted the next night.. Some people say &quot;Tell it to the king then.&quot; Well... no. Telling it to the king isn&#39;t always good, because they could be evil or they don&#39;t trust you yet. I believe the Court Wizard did a good job with its Magical Barrier ability, however it has been removed (sadly). The only way to prevent conversion is the Court Wizard&#39;s magical barrier, Jail, Mercenary or Smite, but these solutions are extremely inconvenient and it comes with sacrifices. This current system is pretty bad, because the high risk of conversion discourages players to out themselves and actually do their job, you&#39;re pretty much working against yourself. This isn&#39;t really a suggestion, but an opinion about the current conversion system -- It&#39;s bad. This is all I wanted to say.

Peace!</description>

            <p>You don’t have to out the converted person as Unseen.</p>
<p>When your Scout finds somebody being converted, consider keeping it a secret but write it in your journal.</p>
<p>Whisper to that player and try to wheedle information out of them. Claim you were Sheriff and investigated them that night. As a now scum player, that person will think they have a confirmed Sheriff on their side since they know your investigation did not pick up that they were converted that very same night.</p>
<p>I tend to whisper them “who do you think is suspicious most right now?” They’re more likely to choose BD or neutrals over their own teammates. If you notice them whispering to somebody, it is unlikely to be a teammate of theirs. Choose to investigate somebody they are not whispering since scum have little incentive to whisper each other when they have night chat.</p>
<p>If there is a drunk or butler claim that you trust, ask them to occupy your Scouted player.</p>
<p>This is a social deduction game, so use those socializing skills when you successfully Scout somebody. As you said, there is no point killing them when they will be replaced by yourself soon.</p>

<p>I would suggest more ways to SCOUT conversions, I think the game is fine now with preventing conversions but I think there should be 1 more class to scout a conversion, Noble??? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>IMO the scouting of conversions is much worse for too many parties.</p>
<p>I’m sheriff, found an unseen yay… got the unseen killed yay… Unseen replaced the guy I killed with me, oop… oh scout also auto caught me before I had a chance to do anything to try and reverse or mitigate the damage I did to the unseen.</p>
<p>I honestly do agree to an extent on a bit better prevention… I’m sure there’s some way we can balance it where converting the obvious just did damage to your faction was not a near certain success. Without simultaniously making "OK lets convert someone that they don’t have an eye on, not also an unlikely to succeed task.</p>
<p>The problem at that time was basically you had, prince, priest, 1-4 unconvertable neutrals, 0-4 CW targets. Just subtracting the 3 for the ones the cult/unseen knows the identity of and they can’t convert, (Themselves and a king), that was  over half off limits we would be talking 3-10/13 being nonconvertible.</p>
<p>I could easilly see conversion prevention being raised up to similar levels to what death prevention is currently. I mean even with knights, physicists and alchemists I don’t think I’ve seen a side fail to kill more than 3 nights in a row.</p>

<p>I know this thread isn’t about what you said, but in my opinion the conversion system needs a makeover in general. Also, I think it was nothing but bad RNG.</p>
