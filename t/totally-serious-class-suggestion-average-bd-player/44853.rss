    <description>**_Name - average BD_**
**_Faction - says BD but make sure to kill BD_**
**_Type - dumb_**

**Passive 1** - what game am I playing - instantly lose 1000 iq 

**Passive 2** - again - if you get a good class then you will instantly die n1 for no reason 

**Day Ability 1** - really - if someone is confirmed good make sure to execute then that day

**Day Ability 2** - why me - this ability can only be used when you&#39;re on trial. When you use this your character says  &quot;why me, EVIL KING!!&quot;

**Night ability 1** - I know I know but look at my name - instantly change your name to a meme and avoid all information about the actual game. 

**Night ability 2** - lost all hope - when you click this the TOL game will automatically close preventing you from losing more brain cells. 

**Win condition** - try to keep your sanity 

**Alternate passive** - instantly wonder why they added inquisitor and sorcerer instead of queen. I bet more then half of people playing TOL don&#39;t even know what a inquisitor was until they heard of it in game. Many people still dont know what it is still

This Is obviously a joke class picking on BD players that I play with. But other then that I truly love this game and can&#39;t wait for more content to be added</description>
