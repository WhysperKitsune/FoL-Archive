    <title>My Feedback to the game!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/my-feedback-to-the-game/24703</link>
    <description>1. The game should encourage players to refer each other by nicknames! not numbers! maybe remove the player number when they talk on chat.

2. the bad factions convert ability is not fun for the game, being converted is not fun!
Also it messes up the whole point of investigation roles, it&#39;s like the vampires in Town of Salem (which is also unfortunate that they added them), if it was something like the mafia of Town of Salem (which means - more bad guys on the start) it could be WAY better!

3. Deaths should give more info - what killed them!

4. pick better text colors, sometimes it can look a little messy.

5. Add a save/load Death Note option!</description>

<p>Nah, numbers are faster and easier, and trolls can’t mess them up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatable, but this game is balanced for conversions. A mode with none could theoretically be added in the future, but for now it’s best to just leave it in as to not segment the playerbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why? I see no reason for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open to suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would be pretty great. Sadly, I don’t think this one will happen anytime soon. It really is a shame.</p>

</aside>
<p>Absolutely 100% disagree… one of my greatest annoyances in a similar game to this… was everyone trying to use tricks to give names that are almost indistinguishable from eachother, No it’s not a strategy to convince them to accidentally hang SamueI Parris instead of the Samuel Parris that they caught.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ll be honest conversions were my greatest pet peve in town of salem… vamps never should have existed… but this game is IMO balanced for it, and it is a better game because of it. Part of it is what puts the emphasis on the  king, the permanant and consistant lack of trust, is what makes the game more fun… rather than a "ok we have a confirmed… so long as we don’t let him die, we can stick to it and win</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Deaths should give more info - what killed them!</p>

</aside>
<p>Fully disagree again, the lack of confirmation of things… the  mystery of what’s in the game is half of the fun</p>
<p>The lack of information is what makes things more interesting</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Can’t disagree with you fully on the latter points… most of the prior, it’s like trying to make this game into something it’s not.</p>

            <p>using names is a terrible idea, because people attempt to copy each others names and shit, also takes longer, plus journal and chat space is limited.</p>
<p>Im not interested in making the game town of salem, conversion is one of the mechanics we have that they generally dont.</p>
<p>physician used to have that power, no one cared, also players dont need spoon fed information, let them figure it out.</p>
<p>Some text colors might show up poorly for certain players, id not be against being able to customize them to colors the player prefers.</p>
<p>I support save/load deathnotes.</p>

            <p>Hmm…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It would take a lot of time to write peoples names, especially since ppl can choose their own. It would be confusing too when the chat is heated and you need to be fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert is what makes throne of lies so interesting. You never know who could be the evil guy. And the healer healing you last night could now be a Herbalist. It adds to the social deduction required. If the developers do as you want, it would just be a copy of the other game, and why then play throne of lies? No, TOL is good as it is with the converts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deaths are fine. You dont need more help to find who killed X player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not sure what you mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be cool.</p>
</li>
</ol>
