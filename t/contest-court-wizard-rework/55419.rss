    <title>[Contest] Court Wizard Rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/contest-court-wizard-rework/55419</link>
    <description>Wizards are supposed to be students of the mystical arts, with an answer for any given scenario. Therefore I propose that Court Wizards become a jack-of-all-trades type of support for BD.

Court Wizards are now _unique._

**Day Abilities**

Zone of Truth (1 Charge): Determine the player on trial&#39;s faction (reveals Blue Dragon, Neutral, or Unseen/Cult). Has no effect on the King.

**Night Abilities**

Magical Shield (Unlimited): Creates a weak magical barrier around a player, preventing occupation, conversion, and possession.

Fireball (1 Use - Not available until Night 3): Kill one player. Bypasses Night Immunity. If the player is a Blue Dragon, both the target and the Court Wizard are killed.

Binding Cure (1 Use): Removes poison or bleeding from both target player and the Court Wizard. Does not protect from attacks.

Hold Person (1 Use): Removes all immunities and occupies target for the night.

Scrying (1 Use): See who target player visits and is visited by.

Blade Barrier (1 Use): Grants death and conversion immunity to the Court Wizard. Kills any attackers. (Functions identical to Hunter&#39;s bear)

If the Court Wizard is converted, the newly minted **Rune Sage** channels its magical runes to empower its allies and weaken its foes.

**Day Ability**

Rune of Confusion (1 Use): Target may not use Day Abilities.

**Night Abilities**

Rune of Power (Unlimited uses): Target either the Assassin or the Mastermind. If the Assassin is targeted, the Assassin gains occupy immunity for the night. If the Mastermind is targeted, his &quot;Foresight&quot; ability that night will reveals his target&#39;s role.

Greater Rune of Power (1 use): Empower both the Assassin and the Mastermind.

Rune of Deception (1 use): Unseen appear as Blue Dragon for the night.

Blinding Rune (1 use): Causes any visitors to target player to be occupied for the night.

Rune of Sickness (1 use): Booby traps the target player - any players visiting that player will become poisoned at the beginning of the next day. If an already poisoned player visits the target, they are killed (bypasses healing).

---

I believe giving several single use abilities presents a good opportunity for strategic play. Players must pick their moments carefully, as they only get one shot at using most of their abilities. I am more confident about the Court Wizard&#39;s toolkit than the Sage - feel free to edit as you see fit.

One other Ability idea I had, which may fit into this CW template or another one you see fit:

**Trusted Advisor**: May nominate another player during the &quot;Royal Blood&quot; phase of selecting a new King. Enables that player the option to Step Forward during the Royal Blood phase. The court is notified when a player is nominated, but the Court Wizard is not revealed.</description>

            <p>Oof, someone woke up on the wrong side of the Round Table this morning. I’ll try to respond to your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>What I agree with</strong></p>
<p>I agree that the faction check day ability is meh. It’s intended to give a little social flavor to the class, and create interesting situations during a trial where the CW could viably lobby for (or against) the accused, but could also be easily lied about. Even under ideal circumstances, knowing with 100% certainty what a player’s class is doesn’t always save them / convict them.</p>
<p>I also agree that Magical Shield/conversion protection is a snooze ability. The intent was to give something for the CW to do between single use abilities, but likely it’s better just being out and having ONLY the single use skills.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this in part. I don’t think the night abilities are particularly complicated, but it creates actual choices for the player. It does somewhat lower the “specialness” of other classes abilities, but I believe that’s balanced by the single-use nature of the skills. As a bonus, it seems to fit the flavor of an actual “wizard.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Sage is somehow even better than current Sage, who’s already one of the best conversions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As I said in my post, I wasn’t wild about the Sage design. It definitely needs more work.</p>
<p><strong>What I disagree with</strong></p>
<p>First off, there is obviously some liberty being taken with the classification of “support.” Part of the problem CW faces right now is that a pure defensive class is already covered by physician, who protects against attack and poison. Magical Barrier protects against everything else, but is boring to play and generally has little impact (other than maybe frustrating a Mastermind for a turn).</p>
<p>Without additional mechanics to defend against, there’s not much room for a defensive support. So instead, I envisioned “support” as the CW filling the weaknesses left by increasingly dead BD roles. The CW “supports” the BD by filling in with single use abilities that mimic other role abilities. If the Dev’s want to disqualify me because I thought a little outside the box, that’s totally fine, I recognize that it’s not explicitly support. But this <em>is</em> another way the CW could go. And the whole point of the contest is to get new ideas, right?</p>
<p>So that’s my response to all of your “Try agains.” The abilities could have impact <em>if used and timed correctly</em>, which would make the new CW a high skill cap role.</p>

<p>Killer ability, and literally a worse Cold Steel.</p>

</aside>
<p>The whole idea is that it is a massive risk/reward, in order to restrict “yolo” attacks. As a kill ability, it shouldn’t be as good as the original.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you not target Mastermind. Because who needs Nightwatch, eh? I mean, it’s not like Nightwatch isn’t one of the weakest converts anyway cough cough</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Even for your general level of sarcasm, you kicked it up a notch here and I can’t tell what your <em>actual</em> point is. MM’s Foresight is use limited, and depending on when the CW is converted the MM may be missing charges already. Even if he’s at full, it’s unlikely all 4 will be used before either the Assassin or CW dies/is outed. You would not target the Mastermind if your Assassin is under suspicion, or if he’s getting rando-blocked by that pesky Butler. It would also provide an avenue to get at the Drunk.</p>

<p>This is likely my bad on the phrasing. When I say “Empower” I mean that the effects of the regular unlimited use Rune of Power apply (Occ Immune/Role check). Not “Empower” in the Frenzy sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is Circle of Death, but with poison. I’ve seen limited circumstances where CoD actually catches more than one person, but it’s usually a whiff. Being single use, and only poisoning, I think there’s value here. If you wanted to moderate it, just remove the kill for those already-poisoned.</p>

<p>Most class abilities confirm a role’s presence in the game: Hunter Wolf, Drunk Debauch, Knight Defense, etc.  It’s all about how its presented socially to the rest of the group and whether BD trust the claim, or think it’s a coordinated evil lie.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think given the limited mechanics remaining to defend against, and the clear direction that Magic Barrier is a boring ability, a Jack-of-All-Trades could be an interesting addition. I do appreciate the constructive criticism (even if I had to dig through some snark and sarcasm to get it).</p>

<p>While I agree with the sentiment, this change would increase the number of BD players who can directly kill from 2 to 3. Second, it is a single use, extremely high risk kill ability - if the Prince guesses wrong, he can no longer kill. If the Knight guesses wrong, the Knight dies. If the CW guesses wrong, BOTH players die, which is a huge detriment to the BD. It would make the CW a much higher skill-cap class to play.</p>

            <p>I mean, it makes sense from a game design and balance standpoint. If every role could have multiple night abilities it becomes either way too easy to confirm a class, or way too hard to confirm a fake.</p>
<p>However, I think giving multiple single-use abilities to just one role would give the CW the ability to feel impactful on the game, but also need to make strategic decisions about when to use which abilities.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how he is not fake claimable. People fake claim Hunter (another Unique class that can only confirm at night) all the time, with relative degrees of success. The new CW would provide some room for creative fake claimers to put the single use abilities into the right spots in their will. The day ability also provides some fun social interaction, giving some additional utility to the Scorned and the Fool, or allowing an Unseen/Cult fake claim to almost ensure a BD execution once they get put on trial…if they’re believed that is.</p>
