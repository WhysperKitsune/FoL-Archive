    <title>Noble Spy does not work if converted that night</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/noble-spy-does-not-work-if-converted-that-night/34853</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was noble D1.  On N1 I chose maid spy on 6, it successfully went off, then I was converted to unseen.  6 then whispered to a bunch of people on D2 and I could not see any of their whispers.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Aristocrat and Noble have identical abilities.  Since both have the exact same maid spy I would expect the maid spy to continue working after a convert.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Maid spy N1 and get converted same night.

#### Comments:

Brilliant game keep up the good work mates.</description>

            <p>Might just be a side effect of changing classes.  No other class has an ability that goes from Night to Day which is the transition where conversions happen.</p>
<p>Also not sure if it happened to the old Noble/Aristocrat when they had Maid Spy or whatever it was.</p>

            <p>Hmm… I don’t see a reason why it shouldn’t. Not sure if technically a bug, as this could have been intended</p>
