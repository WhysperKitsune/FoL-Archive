# Gameplay

- There is a Day 1 Lynch.

- Days are 72 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Lynches are majority and plurality. In case of a tie, the lynch will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.

- The **[Color=BF5FFF] Coven [/Color]** has an optional factional kill each night.

- The **[Color=BF5FFF] Coven [/Color]** will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

- Kills are announced. This means when somebody dies, the role(s) that killed them will be announced. Coven factional kilsl will be &quot;Massacred by the **[Color=BF5FFF]Coven[/Color]**&quot;, regardless of which member comitted it. 

- Feedback will be kept to a minimum this time.
