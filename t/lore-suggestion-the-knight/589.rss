    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Knight</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-the-knight/589</link>
    <description>Lore link: http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/The_Knight

Lore Subject: The Sword of the Royal Family

Lore:

Long have bards told tales of the noble knight in this world and the next. It does not matter whether you be young or old a knight is symbol of everything the common man strives for. The knights radiate an aura beyond that of a mortal man instilling fear in the evil and warmth in the hearts of the weak. Trained in both the arts of intimidation and compassion the king&#39;s knights ensure the peace in debates and freak acts of violence. Sword by their side and honour in their heart assures all that the knight will never let the kingdom down... Or so everyone thinks.


Comments: 

Mere extension of the introduction to the role. I&#39;m wanting to extend this later with a story of a famous knight. I just need to do some thinking when my flu is gone. Thanks for reading!</description>
