    <title>[Strategy] The Inquisitive (Responsible) Hunter</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/strategy-the-inquisitive-responsible-hunter/12729</link>
    <description>The Inquisitive Hunter strategy pushes Hunter from your typical accidental BD Killer role to one that leads BD, investigates --and if facts don&#39;t check out, killer of actual bad guys (Not Prince&#39;s, I swear!).

**Strategy:** D2~D4 mass whisper people and pressure them to give you their classes. Feign, but do not outright say you&#39;re an investigative class and you need their answer to determine whether or not they&#39;re sus. Compile a nice list of who is who and by Day 4 you will likely have more intel than both the Prince &amp; Psychic combined.

For most nights to those days that you play the &#39;inquisitor&#39; and spam people with whispers, use your Bear. Evil guys usually target those who whisper a lot (believing they&#39;re investigators) that aren&#39;t them, which is good for you as it can mean more kills.

After you&#39;ve got a nice list of claims, start putting people up on trial for logs and use your Wolf on those that are /extra/ sus. Just be careful not to use your Wolf on those that won&#39;t claim to you, because the chances are they may be the Prince.

And should you be put up for trial or jailed for all of your &#39;sus whispering&#39;, tell people outright that you are Hunter. Your only &#39;crime&#39; is mass whispering, which in reality is something most bad guys don&#39;t do. If you get asked to confirm yourself, Wolf someone! If you&#39;ve no suspicious to prove yourself with, Wolf an Alchemist or Physician; no harm done if they&#39;re innocent.</description>

            <p>Yet the Hunter’s trying all the while to confirm themself. It’s unfortunately not as easy as it used to be as when Hunter had traps.</p>

            <p>Then I would say prove it. I’m not giving any info about my class to someone who just whispers me claiming to be BD but has no proof. I’m actually more likely to want to hang someone who does that.</p>

            <p>This strategy encourages you to lie to your fellow BD allies which can backfire drastically. Especially with Hunter passive…</p>
<p>The real strategy to Hunter is</p>
<p>N1: do nothing<br>
N2: do nothing<br>
N3: Bear<br>
N4: Bear<br>
N5: Bear</p>
<p>And now it is late game and you probably have plenty of suspicious targets to wolf.</p>
