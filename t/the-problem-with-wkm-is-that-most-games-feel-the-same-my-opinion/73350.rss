    <title>The problem with WKM is that most games feel the same [My opinion]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-problem-with-wkm-is-that-most-games-feel-the-same-my-opinion/73350</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Anglasut and I have been playing Throne of Lies for 10~months, with 511 hours on my Steam account.
I have seen metas come and go, but there has always been one that never went away, the WKM, sometimes Princes would out and people would claim to them, reworked Sheriff could also out himself D1 and ask for claims, Mystic etc...  
  
(Some) People say that they hate WKM, but WKM has a **good** side, it gives the players something to follow, a path, you gather information N1, and then on D2 you give it to the King.
King, good or evil, has to play with that information, an Evil King may try to up the Prince and Decide Fate, a Good King may try to up the 4º Physician claim to check his logs.  
  
The **bad** side of the WKM is that some classes feel boring, especially those that need information to work, like Court Wizard, Knight or Physician.
Because you are gathering most of your information in 1 player, that player needs to assimilate and order around, telling people what to do, and that is the main problem of WKM, some Kings **can** read whispers and tell people what to do that night, some Kings **can&#39;t**.
  
There has been a trend on every meta since I have started playing, people WANT to give someone all the information, let it be King, Prince, Mystic or Sheriff.
And I think that&#39;s a problem you cannot fix.
I think that the best solution to the stagnation that some players feel is to rework Unseen and Cult, to differentiate them even more, make Unseen/Cult games feel completely different, rework King again and make him more about governing his court. Bring OE and Allies back have the court keep their King alive, make all kings neutrals!
  
I think that could be the solution, add a couple of new neutral killers, give a more defined identity to Cult and Unseen, make every game feel like a new experience.</description>
