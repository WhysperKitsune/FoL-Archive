    <description>&gt; # [color=steblue]The Barista[/color]
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Investigative[/color]**
**Nocturnal (Passive)** - Immune to occupation and redirection. You do not appear as occupy or redirection immune. This passive is kept upon class change.
**Spill Drink (Day)** - Spill a player&#39;s drink, allowing you to see if and when a day action is performed on them. Able to target self. - 2 uses
**Brew Coffee (Night)** - Brew coffee for yourself, allowing you to see which class types visited your target. Able to target self. - Infinite uses
**Offer Dessert (Night)** - Offer desert to a player, discovering if they are using their second night action. - 3 uses
*Defeat anyone who dares to oppose the Blue Dragon.*

&gt; # [color=purple]The Waitress[/color]
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Investigative[/color]**
**Nocturnal (Passive)** - Immune to occupation and redirection. You do not appear as occupy or redirection immune. This passive is kept upon class change.
**Scald (Day)** - Scald a player with hot coffee, allowing you to see who, what and when the latest day ability was used on them. (If there was no previous ability then the next one will inform the Waitress.) Able to target self. - 2 uses
**Distill Coffee (Night)** - Brew coffee yourself, allowing you to see which classes visited your target. Able to target self. - Infinite uses
**Offer Leftovers (Night)** - Offer leftovers to a player, allowing you to predict and see which position of the night ability they used. If you predict correctly you will learn what ability they used. - 3 uses
*Defeat anyone who dares to oppose the Unseen.*



[details=&quot;Explaining of Abilities&quot;]
Nocturnal is there due to her being able to drink her own coffee. If she was a bit more powerful I&#39;d remove the passive.

Spill Drink is if the barista spilled the drink on someone and was busy cleaning up but secretly leaning over watching them as she cleaned.

Brewing Coffee allows the Barista to be on &#39;high-alert&#39; and more wary of her surroundings, hence why she&#39;s able to see the class types that visit her target. The only thing I don&#39;t like about this is why she&#39;d be brewing coffee for herself and then going over to another player. Maybe she&#39;s just out for a wander.

Offering Desert is &#39;Would you like Desert&#39; to see if a player has time for it. If they are using an important action (which is usually action #2) then they&#39;ll decline as they have other places to be.

Scald, Distill Coffee and Offer Leftovers are just more cruel versions of Spill Drink, Brew Coffee and Offer Dessert. 


[/details]

Although the Barista &amp; Waitress may not be the most powerful investigatives they can easily be useful in situations. Nocturnal will help her quite a bit as well. Feedback would be appreciated as I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s a bit underwhelming at the minute.

She&#39;s also pretty damn good if you get converted into Assassin. You can change your claim if you already haven&#39;t claimed and you&#39;ll still be an occupy immune Assassin that can&#39;t be found by butler/drunk.</description>

<p>for offer desert, if you aren’t notified, then you know that they used position 1. If you are, you know they used position 2.</p>
<p>Offer leftovers tells you the same</p>
