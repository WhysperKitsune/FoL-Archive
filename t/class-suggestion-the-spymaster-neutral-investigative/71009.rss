    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Spymaster (Neutral Investigative)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-spymaster-neutral-investigative/71009</link>
    <description>EDIT: Well, it would seem my timing was quite poor today and OE got removed. I will have to come up with a fitting solution.

EDIT 2: Replaced Order Execution with Fatal Guards. Less powerful, but with an extra use.

Hello. With many, many suggestions of neutral classes, and with a recent (not really) request to suggest a non-killer neutral class, I decided to create my own. I intended to create a class with a playstyle similar to the Inquisitor, but with less likelyhood of being helped by BD and with a greater emphasis on needing to lie in order to survive. I also felt like giving Royal Blood an added layer of gameplay (e.g. make royals more hesitant to out themselves even if MM is gone).Without further ado, I present The Spymaster!

Class Card Name : The Spymaster (duh)
Class Card Faction : Neutral
Class Card Type : Investigative

**Win Condition:** Live to see every Royal Blood in the game killed, excluding the king. You will know when your goal has been achieved, but not how many Royal Bloods are in the game.

**Passives:**
**Underlings:** If you become King, your goal remains the same and you will gain 2 uses of **Fatal Guards** in addition to the rest of your abilities.

**Hired Thugs:** Immune to conversion. Death immune once.

**Day Abilities:**
**At Any Price:** Shoot and kill a player in front of the court. If any Royal Bloods remain afterwards, your mission is compromised and you will commit suicide. This does not prevent trials during the rest of the day. (1 use. Can&#39;t be used during a trial.)

**Night Abilities:**
**Genealogic Investigation:** Investigate a player&#39;s family. You will know if they have Royal Blood. (Infinite uses)

**Dynastic Surgery:** Send a lackey to attack a player. If you successfully kill a player with Royal Blood this way, you gain its passive. Does not count as a visit. If you kill a non-royal, this ability gains a 2-night cooldown. (Infinite uses,1-night cooldown)

Lore:
_The king had always been a paranoid man. He saw traitors everywhere, lurking, waiting for his demise. He could see the malice behind his family’s smiles, the over-eagerness to please made it all the more obvious. It could not go on like this. He had to weed out the treacherous roots from his family, but he could not solicit the help of his court. No, with their misplaced loyalty, such a foolish action would certainly doom him further. What he needed was a person fit to investigate his subjects thorough and discreetly, and take matters into their own hands if the need arose. A person with no ties to his bloodline or Adiart at all. Safety had never been cheap, especially in a monarch’s line of work, but the death of his heirs was a price he was willing to pay for it._

Comments:
So there you have it. The Spymaster is effectively able to kill 1 royal every 2 nights (and finish off whoever he thinks is the last one during the day). That coupled with Royals getting killed off or converted and executed should be enough to get the job done. As for the Prince, who is usually protected, I created both **At Any Price** and two uses of **Fatal Guards**, so there are at least 2 obvious ways to get rid of him later in the game.

BD will probably want you dead, since all Royals start off on their side. You will probably be able to find fake Royals rather easily, so claiming an Investigative class might be your best bet. Thoughts?</description>

            <p>Hmm, I actually think your cooldown suggestion is more punishing and able to prevent random attacks, while at the same time enabling the Spymaster to get rid of troublesome players that aren’t Royals, if the need arises.</p>
<p>It also balances out the infinite uses by creating a “limit” to them, while at the same time granting the Spymaster enough attacks to kill any number of royals.</p>

            <p>I changed it to 4 uses with CD if they get the wrong target (otherwise it would just be too similar to an NK). I might have to make the class work somewhat differently as a King now that OE is gone.</p>
