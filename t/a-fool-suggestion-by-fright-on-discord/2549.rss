    <title>A Fool Suggestion. (BY Fright on Discord)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-fool-suggestion-by-fright-on-discord/2549</link>
    <description>[NOTE: This isn&#39;t my suggestion. It is Fright&#39;s from the Discord]
I think the Unseen should be punished because Wildcard is for more self interested people. So I was  thinking keep the no trials for 2 days, but the Assassin couldn&#39;t take any actions for 1 night.
