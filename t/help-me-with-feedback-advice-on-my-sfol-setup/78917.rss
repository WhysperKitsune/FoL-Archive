    <description>SFoL (whatever) -- Return of the Righteous
Starting early or mid December

Lore: The order of the Unseen have taken over the entire world now. Unseen from different lands have joined forces towards their common mission. Their previous enemies, the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantum respectively, are almost entirely wiped out. However, it seems one of these two groups of heroes has returned for a last stand against the Unseen empire. Can the hopelessly outnumbered heroes reclaim their homeland? Or will the unseen secure their rule of the land of Adiart for good?


Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB

I replaced the name of the BD converter from return of the blue dragon, Negotiator, with Visionary, and replaced the name of the blue dragon killer, Insurgent, with Heroine, as I find those names more fitting and exciting.

**Any of the following 34 Unseen classes can roll in any fashion. The equal signs denote equivalency only for the purpose of determining Convert classes.**

[color = purple] **Alcoholic** [/color] = [color = purple] **Bureaucrat** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Drunk** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Overseer** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Aristocrat** [/color] = [color = purple] **Judge** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Noble** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Magistrate** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Duchess** [/color] = [color = purple] **Archivist** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Princess** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Librarian** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Enforcer** [/color] = [color = purple] **Fanatic** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Knight** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Crusader** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Handmaiden** [/color] = [color = purple] **Marchioness** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Maid** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Socialite** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Illusionist** [/color] = [color = purple] **Exiled** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Mystic** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Cabalist** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Marshal** [/color] = [color = purple] **Marshal** [/color] (Same class no matter which scum faction) -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Sheriff** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Agent** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Duke** [/color] = [color = purple] **Torturer** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Prince** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Warden** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Page (FoL)** [/color] = [color = purple] **Page (HoB)** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Squire** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Squire** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Nightwatch** [/color] = [color = purple] **Stalker** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Observer** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Watchman** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Poacher** [/color] = [color = purple] **Baronet** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Hunter** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Duelist** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Sage** [/color] = [color = purple] **Forest Witch** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Court Wizardress** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Druid** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Servant** [/color] = [color = purple] **Infiltrator** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Butler** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Sentinel** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Herbalist** [/color] = [color = purple] **Plague Doctor** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Physician** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Surgeon** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Soulcatcher** [/color] = [color = purple] **Blasphemer** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Priest** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Saint** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Arbalest** [/color] = [color = purple] **Marauder** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Archer** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Warrior** [/color] depending on game type
[color = purple] **Timesnatcher** [/color] = [color = purple] **Minstrel** [/color] -- Converts to either [color = steblue] **Chronomancer** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Bard** [/color]_depending on game type

[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color] = Scum Killer
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color] = Scum Converter

Game Setup: 16 players
King (60% [color = purple] **Corrupted**[/color], 40% [color = steblue] **Righteous** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Purified**[/color])
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color]
[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color]
[color = purple] **Duke** [/color] (Unique, only unique unseen class)
[color = purple] **Marshal** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color] / [color = grey] **Random Neutral Non-Killer** [/color]
[color = grey] **Random Neutral Non-Killer** [/color]
[color = grey] **Neutral Killer** [/color]

Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class

In this game, all the unseen can rand from any unseen provided in the list at the start of this post. It is completely random how many unseen will come from BD unseen and how many from HoB unseen. Nothing here is indicative of the scum faction; i.e. there could be both a Forest Witch and a Sage in game, both would convert into CW in a BD game or into Druid in a HoB game

Total 16 players
No unseen class is unconvertible

Scum faction starts with 2 members but may have up to 4 members alive. Conversion is a 1 night cooldown to convert a second or third member and a 2 night cooldown to convert a fourth. Pity convert mechanic is in play if the Visionary or Arbiter somehow hits neuts with convert attempts over and over. The attempts must be consecutive but would carry over to a different visionary or arbiter if there was one.

Same scum promotion mechanics for both BD and HoB as from Unseen in ToL

Non NK Neuts can rand from any neuts cannon to FoL 23 or HoB III.

The NK can rand as any NK present in the current FoL 23 or HoB III rolelist.

The Visionary or Arbiter will appear of a class of their own choice that they can choose and inform to me, the host, to any and all investigative abilities until the start of night 4, when which they will appear as Visionary or Arbiter.
