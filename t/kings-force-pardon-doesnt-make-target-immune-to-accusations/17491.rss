    <title>King&#39;s force pardon doesn&#39;t make target immune to accusations</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/kings-force-pardon-doesnt-make-target-immune-to-accusations/17491</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was Evil King and I used &quot;Decide Fate&quot; to force pardon mm. 
The rest just reaccused him immediately, made him stand trial and executed him.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
According to wiki, force pardon makes the target immune to any more accusations for that day. So he should survive that day.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Accuse someone so he stands trial.
As King force pardon him.
Reaccuse that someone and execute him.

#### Comments:
I can&#39;t be 100% sure that force pardon works that way. The in-game description of the ability doesn&#39;t say anything about accusation immunity. However, if it doesn&#39;t work that way, it seems pretty useless.

Oh, btw the version is 1.0.10c .</description>
