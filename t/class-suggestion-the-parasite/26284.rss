            <p>Well you’d have to find out who had the infection first. If the Prince got it , I don’t think BD would want to use an exe like that.</p>
<p>And yes , but it is risky, because the more you hold on to it , the more likely you are to lose.(Dying at night etc.)</p>
<p>(I hope i interpreted these questions right gosh this class has flaws)</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t it be a good idea to Execute whoever has the infection? Also why would you want to infect the starting parasite? Yes that second one needs a reason because otherwise you would just out yourself.</p>
<p>Also you would want to use your Ability as late as possible giving it less time to be sent back to you. Just saying.</p>

            <p>You are infected by default. however i am not sure if i should just keep it as is , or make another class for the parasite to go to when they change it.</p>

            <p>Okay, but if you’re the starting parasite, you can’t get a prev class, right? So if you are the starting one, why even use the night ability? You wouldn’t get infected so you wouldn’t lose</p>

            <p>Thank you for these questions</p>
<p>1.“Without having the infection on you” refers to using your first night ability (giving someone else the class) so you must survive without anybody giving the Parasite class back to you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using your first night ability , although i should’ve probably elaborated. "Then it is to get rid of the Parasite class, and acheive your previous class’s goal.</li>
</ol>
