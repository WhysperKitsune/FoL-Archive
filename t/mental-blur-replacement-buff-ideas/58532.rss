Here are my 2 replacement ideas of mental blur and a buff for mental blur

Night Ability 2: Mental Author ~ Edit a player&#39;s logs. You will see your target&#39;s pre existing logs. If the player dies the edited logs that you made will appear instead of normal logs. 2 or 3 uses depending on how OP it is.

Or

Night Ability 2: Conduit Illusion ~ Make 2 players think they are getting conduited. There will be only 1 of person talking in the conduit chat box and you will be able to see their chat. hopefully this makes sense :) .  2 use

Or the buff Idea ~ Which I&#39;m still trying to buff

Night Ability 2: Mental Blur ~ Erase a player&#39;s chat history. You will also get a copy of it. 2 use.</description>

            <p>You are suggesting something EVEN stronger than me, while you call my version “reaaaallly OP”. I don’t play ToS, so I cannot comment on that. I’m going to disregard this “if people cheat, it’s really weak” argument.</p>
<p>Snoops are way less rare, since Noble is starting BD and Illusionist needs to be the third convert and it needs to be an unseen game. Regardless, Snoop is also as you said metagameable, however it is still powerful, because it can access at least the singular claim the recipient has at that moment. Mental Blur will have the same base usefulness, because it can be combined with Assassin.</p>
<p>Confirmability is a risk, but that does not mean that all evil abilities need to be unconfirmable. Bewilder on Invoker, shouldn’t be removed, just because it reveals an Invoker is present to a single person. Knowing it is an outing ability, the user should be smart about using it. Herbalist’s drug is the same way for example.</p>
<p>By the way, Possessor can also facelift as BD with empty logs to try and get the court to think there would be an Illusionist. Even though, I really don’t think it is as blatant as you are making it seem.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see a problem with that though…ToS’s forger is almost has exactly the same ability and it is seen to be weak. Also yours is pretty swingy as it could be reaaaally OP or if metagamed reaaaally weak</p>

<p>Illusionists are rare and I think you are highly overstating the damage meta gaming could do to my skill variant. Especially, because it will always have a function if the target will die tonight, because they do not get the chance to retrieve their private notes. Also it is very tedious to copy paste your logs into private notes every single night, just on the very very slight chance you’ll be Mind Blurred. I really do not see myself or any significant majority of the playerbase resorting to that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Snoops are rare but people still write their second logs as evil in private logs instead of in their logs. After the metagaming I have seen in my time of playing… yeah I’m pretty a sure lot would.</p>
<p>Again mental blur (right now) is such an unhelpful ability imo that it can’t be fixed. You imo have fixed 1 problem with it which is buffing it but you still have confirmability and metagming as issues. It is a pretty decent ability but it has easy counters</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So yes it will almost be exactly the same as mental author since metagaming will make the log part essentially useless except mental author will be stronger and it won’t necessarily confirm Illusionist. Also duplicating is easy. Just copy and paste your existing logs in private notes.</p>

</aside>
<p>It doesn’t mean that if the one in game is metagameable that the reworked/buffed one should.  You prolly never saw it because mental blur is rare and there is absolutely no point doing that since you can just check your logs/journal.</p>

            <p>I mean it could be anything, so it is harder to know what your strategy could be for framing somebody in advance. Examples: If you get a Butler log you might want to imply occupy immunity on an outed Physician. If you get a Princess log, you can swap the type to killer/offensive.</p>
<p>It cannot be countered if they die that night from for example assassin/NK/evil king/alchemist/poisoning, so it can only be countered by very fringe metagaming that will usually not be helpful, because it’d require duplicating your logs into your private notes and writing down things twice. We should not base these decisions on “they can cheat somewhat easily” reasonings. We also have nothing that excludes people 100% from working together outside of the game, but we just have our good faith that they will do so. This is a similar thing. Besides all that, the current Mental Blur is also metagameable, by running a 3rd party program copying your chat log, or copy pasting it yourself manually. I have seen absolutely noone doing that ever, so I think the point is moot.</p>

            <p>Tbh I think assassin has no reason to have silence, he should get a different ability if you ask me. Maybe even something to counter the “Prince outting d1” meta. I remember someone suggesting to change silence to an ability that prevents someone from being healed for one night, which I think is a nice idea.</p>

<p>Okay so basically a better version of assassin’s silence… making silence an even more useless ability. Don’t get me wrong I like this ability but it just destroys silence</p>

            <p>A few more ideas to replace mental blur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make target player unable to read the chat the next day. They can still talk and accuse of treason, they just cant read messages or whispers.</li>
<li>Make a player able to read the chat, but the names of the people talking will be hidden so they won’t know who is talking.</li>
<li>Target player will be able to read the chat and talk, but no one would see their messages. They won’t be notified about this effect.</li>

<p>Would you have all the time to edit it and tell the unseen? I don’t think you could. Also your idea can easily be countered making it still unhelpful. Example: type everything you did before you get mental blurred in private notes, then if you get mental blurred just copy it back in your logs. It can also be countered by many other ways</p>

            <p>Some people have trouble writing down a single night action in time, but you suggest that the illusionist coordinates with their team, snoops the log of someone (which could be anything), and edits it in such a way to frame someone or protect the Unseen. That is a lot to do.</p>
<p>The illusionist gets a snoop++. It is overpowered. By destroying the logs, the unseen will also lose the information that might be stored in the log, so it does not have all of these benefits that it would have with your version.</p>
<p>Most of the time this will still boil down to working with Assassin. If you are already outing yourself to an alchemist/evil king/sorcerer, you are at a point in the game, where you don’t need to edit logs to save yourself.</p>

            <p>Really? I have seen plenty of people die with empty logs in my time. Regardless the information that was stored in there is still destroyed. Mental Author is way too much to do for a single night and it is an even stronger snoop that is seriously way more overpowered than what I am suggesting. It also is way less flexible, as it always needs to target whoever Assassin is targeting, which removes agency from the Illusionist and is less fun in that way.</p>
<p>Usually an Illusionist needs to stop claiming Mystic anyways, because when they turn into assassin, they are in trouble, so confirming their presence is really not such a handicap. Regardless, it is still just optional to use this ability, so they do not have to reveal their presence if they have claimed Mystic before, for instance. I would use this on for example an outed observer, because they have heaps of information.</p>

<p>That would be an unbelievable defense prolly kind of like how frame is since that is rare, since only 1 class has that and what are the chances of that class being converted and using mental blur</p>

            <p>That would be extremely obvious though</p>
<p>See a player get killed with no logs? Prolly Illusionist. I mean it’s not like mental blur isn’t obvious, so it isn’t a big problem.</p>
<p>I’d rather replace it with mental author since it very similar to this but it is not that obvious. I hate mental blur since it is weak and confirming an Illusionist in game</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I agree with this and I had also suggested it in another thread. Mental Blur is largely useless now, because it confirms the presence of an illusionist without really hindering the player, because the important information is stored in their logs. Removing their logs on top of their chat logs, will make it a lot more difficult to remember who claimed what again and will actually burden the recipient. This also opens up the possibility of the Illusionist and Assassin working together to kill someone and destroy their logs, limiting what information gets out. That is really powerful and will restore Mental Blur back to usefulness and possibly the primary ability of the Illusionist, if they do not know a BD investigative.</p>
<p>This will also open up the possible defense of “an illusionist mental blurred me”, for when you feel extra extra lazy as scum and don’t want to bother with logs. Not sure if that is a great thing.</p>

            <p>In all seriousness though, I think it should be buffed, but giving the illusionist a copy of the chat wouldn’t be that good since the only important stuff are their whispers. They should buff it so it deletes the player’s chat logs AND death logs. Maybe even private notes but that could be a bit too much.</p>
