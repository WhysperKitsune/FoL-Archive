            <p>It would be valid argument truth to be told.</p>
<p>Even if I was BD back then, I would do the same and wait for someone slip the wrong words.</p>
<p>The Fool sure did bring complete shutdown of motivation and that only prolong my survival but I can sure bend their wills to do something ‘productive’ with their actions.</p>
<p>I am glad the exploits are now fixed.</p>

            <p>SAME THOUGH</p>
<p>also in FM executions always give more info than in a real-time game, so it’s usually worth it</p>
<p>If the setup leaves you afraid to mislynch, the setup is the issue. No two ways around it.</p>
