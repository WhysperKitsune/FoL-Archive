    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Ranger [Neutral Investigative]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-ranger-neutral-investigative/72221</link>
    <description>_[This is a revamp of the Marshal Suggestion (When he was removed)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-marshal-neutral-offensive-updated-2-2-2018/40440)_

**The Ranger: Neutral Investigative**
**Goal: Exterminate All Non-Killer Neutrals before they win the game.**

**Passives:**

**Retired Blue Dragon:**
This class cant be converted and always will be not suspicious for Blue Dragon investigative classes, the ranger will never be able to vote someone for treason or pardon/execution.

**You Can Not Fool me:**
If during court the Scorned/Fool Uses Trollbox, you will know that message was not a real one, you will not know who made the Trollbox.

**Day Ability**

**Veteran Sights:** Check somebody, if he frames a player (or themself) you will know it, Infinite uses. The ability will keep investigating the same player until you chose another one

**Night abilities:**

**Expert persecution:**
Check a Player, if he is Neutral, you will know. Infinite uses

**Chaos Ending:**
Target a Player, if He is Neutral, you will end their missery. Bypasses All Immunities, Heal will save the target. If you hit the Neutral killer, it will not die. 3 Uses.

**Strategy:**

Fool and Scorned are your main enemies, find them fast and kill them before they accomplish their goals!

You cant kill the Neutral Killer, and he is not your target.

Blue Dragon will always want you on their team, so claiming Ranger will not be bad for you.

**Class Explanation:**

The Ranger is a retired member of the Blue Dragon. He only wants one thing: Peace on the court. And he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal.

Maybe he is not a young man anymore, but he is still an expert, and he still knows how to do his job.

Ranger will commit suicide if a Non-Killer Neutral wins in mid-game.</description>

            <p>What is the purpose of your class? This heavily nerfs all other neutrals except NK, without giving any compensation to them either. Don’t you think this is very unfun for the Alchemist that just happens to face this class? First of all this should be unique, because now a lone Alchemist, could face two of these bastards. Second, they should not count towards the neutral limit, since they are basically another BD class with this design.</p>

<p>Doesn’t need to be occupy immune when stabbing someone, doesn’t need to bypass immunity.</p>
