    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Werewolf (NK)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-werewolf-nk/70522</link>
    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;forestgreen&quot;] The Werewolf [/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer [/color]** 
**Lycanthropy (Passive)** - The Werewolf is also randomly assigned a Blue Dragon-aligned pseudo-class at the start of the game. The pseudo-class must be able to exist on its own, such as the Werewolf cannot have a Physician pseudo-class if two Physicians are already in-game nor can he have a Paladin pseudo-class in an Unseen game. This pseudo-class decides the Werewolf’s first day and first night ability along with giving them all of the pseudo-class’ passives and having bonus attributes depending on the current day or night.
&gt;~Attributes until the fourth day.
&gt; * The Werewolf will be seen as their pseudo-class to investigative abilities.
&gt; * If the Werewolf is executed or dies in any way, they will flip as their pseudo-class.
&gt;
&gt;~Attributes from the fourth day onwards.
&gt; * The Werewolf is immune to Poison and Bleeding.
&gt; * The Werewolf is immune to redirection and occupation.
&gt; * If the Werewolf has the Hunter as their pseudo-class, they lose Retribution.
&gt;
&gt;**Lunacy (Passive)** - The Werewolf is immune to death at night and also can use both night abilities starting the fourth night. If they sense a target is under protection from a Knight or a Bear Companion, he will not attack it.
**??? (Day)** - The same primary day ability as of the Werewolf’s pseudo-class. - ? uses 
**Eclipse (Day)** - Allows the Werewolf to switch back to the attribute set for the first three nights for this night and the following day, but they can still use Maul and Chow. - 1 use 
**??? (Night)** - The same primary night ability as of the Werewolf’s pseudo-class. - ? uses 
**Maul and Chow (Night)** - Kills the target player, but this ability is only usable after the third night. Can be used alongside the Werewolf’s pseudo-class primary ability. - Infinite uses 
*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.*

Theme: A neutral killer that is impossible to find via mechanical confirmation.
Survivability: The Werewolf essentially becomes immune to bleeding and poisoning after he fully transforms and has passive senses to prevent dying to a Knight or Hunter.
Late-game: Downright impossible to find via mechanical confirmation, and can even become King early if the pseudo-class has Royal Blood.

            <p>The point was they both disguise themselves in a loose sense.  Letting WW hide all game would make him better at disguise than Poss not to mention it doesn’t make sense lore-wise which is part of the fun.</p>
<p>Also I thought the 2 kills per night made up for no kills the first three.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was thinking about how great this class is but wanted to propose some modifications that preserve the core concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="gray"> The Werewolf </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray"> Neutral Killer </font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lycanthropy (Passive)</strong> - Until Day 4, you will appear to all abilities as the class you chose with Anthropomorphize. (You will still appear death immune to all attacks)</p>
<p><strong>Lunacy (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to death, occupation and target changing.  You are immune to poison and bleeding starting Day 4.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropomorphize (Day)</strong> - Choose the class you will disguise yourself as until Day 4. (1 use)</p>
<p><strong>Maul (Night)</strong> - Attack 2 players.  If they are death immune or defended by a Knight, you will bleed them instead and they will die in one night unless healed. (Infinite uses - not usable until Night 4)</p>
<p><strong>Dissimulate (Night)</strong> - Visit a player. (Infinite uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dissimulate seems like a useless ability but I put it there to help you write fake logs the first three nights you can’t attack.  It would suck, for example, to get busted D3 because you claimed to have visited someone who was jailed.</p>
<p>With the new limit of 3 non-unique classes, being able to freely choose your fake-claim is now feasible.</p>
<p>The OP has Werewolf copying Sorcerer’s <em>“you sensed something was off”</em> passive in order to save him from Bear Companion and Defend.  I removed this and let Maul simply bleed such players to avoid copying Sorcerer.</p>

            <p>This is the best Werewolf-themed class I’ve seen in this forum. Really well thought and seems sooo fun to play. That said, he should have SOME form of mechanical confirmation. As does every classes</p>

            <p>BTW It would be really cool for the Werewolf to have the OPTION to let all players hear a wolf howl the night he transforms <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  As a taunt!</p>

            <p>I like it!  I think he should flip as his true class upon daytime execution though and never have retribution. <span class="bbcode-s">Also I think he should have to choose his pseudo class D1 so he isn’t spoonfed information the evil faction doesn’t have.</span> on second thought scratch that I see the importance of the way you set it up now</p>

<h1>
<font color="forestgreen"> The Werewolf </font> <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/shield.png?v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h1>
<p><strong><font color="gray"> Neutral Killer </font></strong><br>
<strong>Lycanthropy (Passive)</strong> - The Werewolf is also randomly assigned a Blue Dragon-aligned pseudo-class at the start of the game. The pseudo-class must be able to exist on its own, such as the Werewolf cannot have a Physician pseudo-class if two Physicians are already in-game nor can he have a Paladin pseudo-class in an Unseen game. This pseudo-class decides the Werewolf’s first day and first night ability along with giving them all of the pseudo-class’ passives and having bonus attributes depending on the current day or night.<br>
~Attributes until the fourth day.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Werewolf will be seen as their pseudo-class to investigative abilities.</li>
<li>If the Werewolf is executed or dies in any way, they will flip as their pseudo-class.</li>
</ul>
<p>~Attributes from the fourth day onwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Werewolf is immune to Poison and Bleeding.</li>
<li>The Werewolf is immune to redirection and occupation.</li>
<li>If the Werewolf has the Hunter as their pseudo-class, they lose Retribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lunacy (Passive)</strong> - The Werewolf is immune to death at night and also can use both night abilities starting the fourth night. If they sense a target is under protection from a Knight or a Bear Companion, he will not attack it.<br>
<strong>??? (Day)</strong> - The same primary day ability as of the Werewolf’s pseudo-class. - ? uses<br>
<strong>Eclipse (Day)</strong> - Allows the Werewolf to switch back to the attribute set for the first three nights for this night and the following day, but they can still use Maul and Chow. - 1 use<br>
<strong>??? (Night)</strong> - The same primary night ability as of the Werewolf’s pseudo-class. - ? uses<br>
<strong>Maul and Chow (Night)</strong> - Kills the target player, but this ability is only usable after the third night. Can be used alongside the Werewolf’s pseudo-class primary ability. - Infinite uses<br>
<em>Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theme: A neutral killer that is impossible to find via mechanical confirmation.<br>
Survivability: The Werewolf essentially becomes immune to bleeding and poisoning after he fully transforms and has passive senses to prevent dying to a Knight or Hunter.<br>
Late-game: Downright impossible to find via mechanical confirmation, and can even become King early if the pseudo-class has Royal Blood.</p>
