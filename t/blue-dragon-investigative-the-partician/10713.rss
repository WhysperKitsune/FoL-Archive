            <p>yes but keep in mind:</p>
<p>-prince must be dead<br>
-all real princesses must be dead<br>
-drunks must be dead<br>
-all nobles must be dead</p>
<p>this is a lot, and even then someone could be an aristocrat lying about being partician</p>

            <p>This would be easy to tell if real or not depending on it there is still a Drunk or Prince. Otherwise, this class is almost unstoppable. Don’t like how it goes with the kingdom theme though.</p>

<p>Very hard to fake claim drunk except as alocholic. You would die to the claim from something else first.</p>
