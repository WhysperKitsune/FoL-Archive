    <title>Fixing RNG so game does not have RNG</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fixing-rng-so-game-does-not-have-rng/2496</link>
    <description>

-the herbalist&#39;s hallucinogens ability is completely random (and this is their main ability)

-the soul catcher&#39;s soul release ability could come up with no good information, could lead to game-winning information, not based on the soul catcher&#39;s skill, but luck.


-----------------------
How to fix:

-Replace herbalist&#39;s hallucinogens ability with the ability to heal the unseen members at night (I know pretty basic, but most unseen versions are just slightly altered), or they have limited uses and choose who they target, like the invoker but with more uses (3, maybe?)

-change soul release so that upon releasing the souls, the soul catcher chooses all the targets of the ability (soul release would probably have to be lessened to two uses)</description>

            <p>I was thinking. RNG is not neccessarily ALWAYS bad. The Princess’ Lightwasp ability is a very good and fun ability, even though it does involve RNG: This is because you can reliably assume that at least one BD member would be wasped, reducing the effective “randomness” of the ability.</p>
<p>I do think that in most cases it is to be avoided however.</p>

es, a few times just to convert yourself. Most times phys just exhumes to see what killer classes are in game, or so if a cult leader claiming knight says he killed the cultist (he did, as a sacrifice) with cold steel, physician can prove him wrong.

            <p>First off, the invoker’s ability to send somebody to someone else is very powerful and limited to 1 use is enough. I don’t think another Class should be able to do this with more uses. That’s just not right.</p>
<p>Second, Soul release is active whenever the Soulcatcher has souls available, uses don’t matter. I don’t see anything wrong with the Soulcatchers ability either, since any information is good information. It doesn’t target the King or Unseen so you’ve got nothing to worry about.</p>
