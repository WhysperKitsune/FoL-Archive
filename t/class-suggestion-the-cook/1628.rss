Page from the diary of The Cook-

_&quot;I spent years serving the King and the court. Pork leg here, chicken breast there. All of it was cooked to perfection but does the cook get any thanks? No. All they do is scoff it down like pigs. Even the Princess eats like a pig. Castle Adiart doesn&#39;t deserve such luxury._

_I&#39;m going to do it. I&#39;m going to kill them all. Over the weeks, I&#39;ve saved meat that I&#39;m going to mix in with a big feast. Maybe even serve it to them at night. Hell, they&#39;re too tired to even think about what goes in there mouth at night._

_I&#39;m sick and tired of the King and feeding his royal *scribble* backside. Castle Adiart will perish.&quot;_</description>

<p>It’s not really an incentive. I never specified it because I wasn’t ever finished with this.</p>
