    <title>Sheriff check returns no results</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sheriff-check-returns-no-results/10360</link>
    <description>#### Two of my sheriff checks in the last game I played returned no results. They didn&#39;t tell me non sus or unseen, and they didn&#39;t tell me whether I was occ&#39;d, redirected, prevented visiting, or anything like that. They simply said NOTHING...

#### All of my other 7 or so checks operated how I&#39;m used to.

#### Here are some screenshots of the nothing responses from my checks.
