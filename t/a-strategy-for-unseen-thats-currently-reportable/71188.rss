    <title>A strategy for Unseen that&#39;s currently reportable</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/a-strategy-for-unseen-thats-currently-reportable/71188</link>
    <description>MM can&#39;t &quot;scout&quot; their brand new convert and out them, since they have to &quot;discuss&quot; it with them beforehand and it&#39;s kind of suspicious to whisper the guy you claim is Unseen. 

So I hope one day this strategy can become viable by letting Mastermind know upon conversion if the player is okay with bussing without consent.</description>

            <p>while I agree with it (I think I may have even suggested it at the time). It doesn’t really solve one of the main parts of it. IE the existing unseen have had more time planning etc… than a fresh convert.</p>
<p>The rule as it is isn’t that you can’t bus someone that disagrees. If I understand the dev’s correctly.</p>
<p>MM - I’m going to bus you tommorow<br>
Ass: No I don’t want to be bussed</p>
<p>Next day -</p>
<p>MM: N3 - Ass unsen</p>
<p>The MM is still on the right side of gamethrowing in this example. The rule just requires you to let them know you are bussing them to raise the odds of winning, rather than because you want to troll your own team. For that though, it should be the existing members of the evil faction that make the call, rather than hoping the newer one opts in (or doesn’t opt out). In reality his refusal is more likely to be gamethrowing than helping.</p>

            <p>what if there were something like an “initiation message”. It appears similar to private notes. IE the MM or cult leader can type it up, possibly with notes of things for the converted to see the first day he’s converted. Would permit convert and bus strategies so long as they are explained, or possibly pre-plans of people to push on for an immidiate mislynch (good if you are converting say a confirmed investigator and want the initial accusation to have clout) etc…</p>

<p>Oh yeah, true, I usually use it to quickly warn everyone else what happened with my action that night. This also gives me an idea, why not make it intentional? <s>As it is likely a bug.</s><br>
Make Unseen able to talk while the court is getting the info of who died, maybe?</p>

            <p>Haha yeah but personally I prefer to ask the guy beforehand, that’s a solution but it’s unsatisfying to me</p>

            <p>Hey, I usually try something similar. <s>Should not share strategies here cause they become bad the more people know about it but ok</s>. Convert, n2 ask for bussing and them we up the “visited”. It will make them think Unseen had no converts n1 and confirm the MM as Sheriff for a while, who knows even make GK waste Fealty on them. Depending from my conversion and what MM is claiming I can ask MM to do it with me, honestly just a few classes are worthy keeping.</p>

            <p>MM can’t “scout” their brand new convert and out them, since they have to “discuss” it with them beforehand and it’s kind of suspicious to whisper the guy you claim is Unseen.</p>
<p>So I hope one day this strategy can become viable by letting Mastermind know upon conversion if the player is okay with bussing without consent.</p>
