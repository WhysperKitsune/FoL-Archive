    <title>Reworks concerning the 1.0.18 Meta</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reworks-concerning-the-1-0-18-meta/51767</link>
    <description>As people are saying, King is strong in this meta, which is a whisper King D2 Meta, Which I don&#39;t find as a problem. But it needs a counter. 

Also concerning another hot thread going around concerning the lack of framing and retribution, we need more of that. So my idea is this.


[quote]

[color=blue]**The Noble**[/color]/[color=purple]**The Aristocrat**[/color]

_Passives_

**Royal Blood:** (As is)

**Diplomacy:** You may use both Day Abilities in the same day.

_Abilities_

**Political Pressure:** (D) (3)
(As is) (Uses increased)

**Noble Twin:** (D) (3)
(As is) (Uses increased)

**Eavesdrop:** (N) (oo)
Choose two players. Tomorrow, you will see all whispers to and from them. Cannot target the King.

**Royal Advisor:** (N) (2)
You will see all whispers to and from the King tomorrow.

[/quote]

Analysis: 
1. Noble is mostly played as a weak whisper class.
2. The King Whisper Meta is very strong.
3. Noble and Aristocrat gets to see the King&#39;s whispers on a limited amount.
4. In replacing Snoop with Royal Advisor, they have lost out on a powerful but not a fitting ability.
5. Their voting aspect must, therefore, be strengthened.
6. Result: They must be buffed.

[quote]

[color=red]**The Apostle**[/color]
(Becomes a possible starting Cult Underling)

_Passives_


_Abilities_

**Cult Force:** (D) (2)
Force a player to accuse someone and you will gain an additional vote for the next trial that day.

**Crimson Call:** (D) (2)
(Identical to Telepathy)

**Dark Voices:** (N) (3)
(Identical to Eavesdrop)

**Twisted Advisor:** (N) (1)
(Identical to Royal Advisor)

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Apostle is also buffed like Noble but gets fewer uses for each ability, fitting the theme of the Cult.
2. It also gets a form of Telepathy to be like the Psychic.
3. Because Noble gets buffed, Apostle gets buffed too.

[quote]

[color=purple]**The Illusionist**[/color]

_Passives_

_Abilities_

**Telepathy:** (D) (2)
(As is)

**Mind Warp:** (N) (oo)
(As is)

**Mental Blur:** (N) (2)
Choose a player. They will be unable to talk tomorrow until the start of the first trial that day. (It works regardless of if they are the accused, accuser, or bystander.)

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. The Illusionist carries a very useful framing ability, Mind Warp, that should probably be more prominent among Evil classes. 
2. Mental Blur however, confirms an Illusionist, and does not really help at all.
3. Mental Blur has been changed to be buffed up, but still allows people to talk after the first trial, so they can defend themselves if accused.

[quote]

[color=purple]**The Marshal**[/color]

_Passives_

_Abilities_

**Expose:** (D) (2)
(As is) (Uses lowered)

**Forge:** (D) (2)
Choose a player. Tonight, you will be able to look at and edit their logs. If that player dies tonight, your version will show up as their logs in the graveyard.

**Probe:** (N) (oo)
(As is)

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Expose is usually completely unnecessary, but because some class needs to have that niche ability, Marshal will be fine with it.
2. The Snoop that was taken from The Noble/Aristocrat/Apostle shows here in the form of Forge, which is a Day Ability so that Marshal can use the nighttime to edit the player&#39;s logs and then plan on the Unseen killing said player.
3. Unseen classes usually don&#39;t last very long anyways due to the fast nature of the faction.
4. Result: Snoop had to go somewhere.

[quote]

[color=purple]**The Duchess**[/color]

_Passives_

**Royal Blood:** 
(As is)

_Abilities_

**Luring Gaze:** (D) (2)
Make all members of the Unseen appear as Not Suspicious tonight.

**Bat Eyelashes:** (N) (oo)
(As is)

**Dark Wisp:** (N) (3)
Choose a player and make them appear Unseen to all Investigative abilities tonight.

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Unseen needs more framers to make framing a somewhat more prevalent thing in ToL.
2. Duchess&#39; Dark Wisp becomes a framing tool.
3. The NS ability is moved to a Day Ability to allow it to be used in non-conjunction to Bat Eyelashes.

[quote]

[color=purple]**The Assassin**[/color]

_Passives_

_Abilities_

**Bewilder:** (D) (2)
Choose a player. They will not be able to use Day Abilities today.

**Nightshade:** (D) (4)
(As is)

**Assassinate:** (N) (oo)
(As is)

**Double Kill:** (N) (1)
(Identical to 2-for-1)

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Assassin&#39;s Distract is so weak
2. Preventing Day Abilities will become much more useful and flexible in lots of ways.

[quote]

[color=red]**The Seeker**[/color]

_Passives_

_Abilities_

**Identify:** (D) (2)
Tonight, you will discover the faction of your target.

**Gaze:** (N) (3)
(As is)

**Fraud:** (N) (2)
Choose a player. They will appear as Cult to all investigative abilities tonight.

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Expose is a niche ability, it would be fine to leave it on just the Marshal.
2. And to match Unseen Investigative classes, the Seeker can also frame.

[quote]

[color=red]**The Invoker**[/color]
(Only Offensive converts)

_Passives_

_Abilities_

**Bewilder:** (D) (2)
Choose a player. They will not be able to use Day Abilities today.

**Chains of Corax:** (N) (3)
(As is)

**Strings of Mithras:** (N) (2)
(As is)

[/quote]

To also have a Day Offensive Ability, Invoker gets a buffed up Bewilder that is much more flexible and usable.

[quote]

[color=red]**The Acolyte**[/color]
(Killer converts)

_Passives_

**Blood Offering:**
If you die because of bleed, the Cult Leader will gain one use of Eradicate. You cannot be sacrificed if you are bleeding.

_Abilities_

**Transfusion:** (N) (3)
Choose a player and protect them. Their attackers will die and you will begin to bleed at night. The attack bypasses night immunity.

**Crimson Curse:** (N) (1)
Choose a player. If no one is currently bleeding, you will make them bleed. They will die in one night.

[/quote]

Analysis:
1. Acolyte used to be a thing.
2. Invoker got buffed up.
3. So to make Invokers equally common as other converts and not twice as common,
4. Acolytes are now Killer converts.</description>

            <p>well I’d say it helps a bit in day 1 meta… but roughly the moment it turns out to be an unseen game, people know there’s a 90%ish chance their whispers are safe. Unseens weakness is that they have at most 1 converted class in their team at a time, and as noble isn’t a certainty to begin with. It isn’t really worth it to adjust behavior to deal with a single potential class in the game.</p>

            <p>In general I think these are very good. The Aristocrat and Apostle changes are a terrific counter to the d2 whisper meta. Perhaps Royal Advisor could be one use only though - it’s strong.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do like the idea of forging. The Marshal seems an apt choice. But having that + Blackmail is too strong. While you edit someone’s logs, you just point-and-click someone else to give a false result. Seems like double-dipping, ability-wise. Also, if Blackmail is included with a Fool and Scorned in game, that means we could have <em>three false results in one night</em>.</p>

<p>Agreed, but both Duchess and Marshal shouldn’t have a framing ability. I like that your proposed Duchess’ kit is actually centered around that strong ability - on the Marshal it feels like an addition rather than an identity.</p>

            <p>As people are saying, King is strong in this meta, which is a whisper King D2 Meta, Which I don’t find as a problem. But it needs a counter.</p>
<p>Also concerning another hot thread going around concerning the lack of framing and retribution, we need more of that. So my idea is this.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="blue"><strong>The Noble</strong></font>/<font color="purple"><strong>The Aristocrat</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><strong>Royal Blood:</strong> (As is)</p>
<p><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> You may use both Day Abilities in the same day.</p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Political Pressure:</strong> (D) (3)<br>
(As is) (Uses increased)</p>
<p><strong>Noble Twin:</strong> (D) (3)<br>
(As is) (Uses increased)</p>
<p><strong>Eavesdrop:</strong> (N) (oo)<br>
Choose two players. Tomorrow, you will see all whispers to and from them. Cannot target the King.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Advisor:</strong> (N) (2)<br>
You will see all whispers to and from the King tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Noble is mostly played as a weak whisper class.</li>
<li>The King Whisper Meta is very strong.</li>
<li>Noble and Aristocrat gets to see the King’s whispers on a limited amount.</li>
<li>In replacing Snoop with Royal Advisor, they have lost out on a powerful but not a fitting ability.</li>
<li>Their voting aspect must, therefore, be strengthened.</li>
<li>Result: They must be buffed.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>The Apostle</strong></font><br>
(Becomes a possible starting Cult Underling)</p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Cult Force:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Force a player to accuse someone and you will gain an additional vote for the next trial that day.</p>
<p><strong>Crimson Call:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
(Identical to Telepathy)</p>
<p><strong>Dark Voices:</strong> (N) (3)<br>
(Identical to Eavesdrop)</p>
<p><strong>Twisted Advisor:</strong> (N) (1)<br>
(Identical to Royal Advisor)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apostle is also buffed like Noble but gets fewer uses for each ability, fitting the theme of the Cult.</li>
<li>It also gets a form of Telepathy to be like the Psychic.</li>
<li>Because Noble gets buffed, Apostle gets buffed too.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>The Illusionist</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Telepathy:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Mind Warp:</strong> (N) (oo)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Mental Blur:</strong> (N) (2)<br>
Choose a player. They will be unable to talk tomorrow until the start of the first trial that day. (It works regardless of if they are the accused, accuser, or bystander.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Illusionist carries a very useful framing ability, Mind Warp, that should probably be more prominent among Evil classes.</li>
<li>Mental Blur however, confirms an Illusionist, and does not really help at all.</li>
<li>Mental Blur has been changed to be buffed up, but still allows people to talk after the first trial, so they can defend themselves if accused.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>The Marshal</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Expose:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
(As is) (Uses lowered)</p>
<p><strong>Forge:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Choose a player. Tonight, you will be able to look at and edit their logs. If that player dies tonight, your version will show up as their logs in the graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>Probe:</strong> (N) (oo)<br>
(As is)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expose is usually completely unnecessary, but because some class needs to have that niche ability, Marshal will be fine with it.</li>
<li>The Snoop that was taken from The Noble/Aristocrat/Apostle shows here in the form of Forge, which is a Day Ability so that Marshal can use the nighttime to edit the player’s logs and then plan on the Unseen killing said player.</li>
<li>Unseen classes usually don’t last very long anyways due to the fast nature of the faction.</li>
<li>Result: Snoop had to go somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>The Duchess</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><strong>Royal Blood:</strong><br>
(As is)</p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Luring Gaze:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Make all members of the Unseen appear as Not Suspicious tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Bat Eyelashes:</strong> (N) (oo)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Dark Wisp:</strong> (N) (3)<br>
Choose a player and make them appear Unseen to all Investigative abilities tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unseen needs more framers to make framing a somewhat more prevalent thing in ToL.</li>
<li>Duchess’ Dark Wisp becomes a framing tool.</li>
<li>The NS ability is moved to a Day Ability to allow it to be used in non-conjunction to Bat Eyelashes.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>The Assassin</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Bewilder:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Choose a player. They will not be able to use Day Abilities today.</p>
<p><strong>Nightshade:</strong> (D) (4)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Assassinate:</strong> (N) (oo)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Double Kill:</strong> (N) (1)<br>
(Identical to 2-for-1)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assassin’s Distract is so weak</li>
<li>Preventing Day Abilities will become much more useful and flexible in lots of ways.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>The Seeker</strong></font></p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Tonight, you will discover the faction of your target.</p>
<p><strong>Gaze:</strong> (N) (3)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Fraud:</strong> (N) (2)<br>
Choose a player. They will appear as Cult to all investigative abilities tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expose is a niche ability, it would be fine to leave it on just the Marshal.</li>
<li>And to match Unseen Investigative classes, the Seeker can also frame.</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>The Invoker</strong></font><br>
(Only Offensive converts)</p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Bewilder:</strong> (D) (2)<br>
Choose a player. They will not be able to use Day Abilities today.</p>
<p><strong>Chains of Corax:</strong> (N) (3)<br>
(As is)</p>
<p><strong>Strings of Mithras:</strong> (N) (2)<br>
(As is)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To also have a Day Offensive Ability, Invoker gets a buffed up Bewilder that is much more flexible and usable.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>The Acolyte</strong></font><br>
(Killer converts)</p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><strong>Blood Offering:</strong><br>
If you die because of bleed, the Cult Leader will gain one use of Eradicate. You cannot be sacrificed if you are bleeding.</p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Transfusion:</strong> (N) (3)<br>
Choose a player and protect them. Their attackers will die and you will begin to bleed at night. The attack bypasses night immunity.</p>
<p><strong>Crimson Curse:</strong> (N) (1)<br>
Choose a player. If no one is currently bleeding, you will make them bleed. They will die in one night.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acolyte used to be a thing.</li>
<li>Invoker got buffed up.</li>
<li>So to make Invokers equally common as other converts and not twice as common,</li>
<li>Acolytes are now Killer converts.</li>
</ol>
