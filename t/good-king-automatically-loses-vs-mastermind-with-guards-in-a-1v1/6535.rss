    <title>Good king automatically loses vs mastermind with guards in a 1v1</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/good-king-automatically-loses-vs-mastermind-with-guards-in-a-1v1/6535</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
3 people alive- the good king, the mastermind, the reaper
good king and mastermind voted up and executed the reaper
when the reaper died, the game automatically ended and the unseen won, even though the king had guards left.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
the game is supposed to continue because the king can guard himself and vote the mastermind up with point the finger the next day.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Get the good king and mastermind as the only ones left alive. 

#### Comments:
Please fix this. It hurts when you automatically lose a game that you&#39;re guaranteed to win as good king with guards.</description>

            <p>Apparently there are issues with Kings actually winning the 1v1s. I’ll forward this to <a class="mention" href="/u/ellie">@Ellie</a> <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Moderators have said king wins all ties if they can win, so king should have won.</p>
<p>it probably was a glitch.</p>
<p>However, are you sure it wasn’t an evil or neutral king?</p>

            <p>It seems like the King doesn’t count as an unseen or BD for purposes of determining who wins the game.  So it wasn’t 1 BD versus the MM, the game sees 0 BD left, 1 unseen left, unseen wins. I’m fairly sure the reverse is true too, if the King is the last cult/unseen the game just ends.  The only time this isn’t true is when a possessor has jumped into the King.</p>
<p>So basically, The King wins with the good or evil team but he isn’t actually on that team.</p>

            <p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Is the logic here that, even though somebody is King and has double the votes, democracy time is over and whoever can kill the other over X amount of nights is considered the winner? I guess that actually makes sense. But I always loved being the Mayor and forcing scum to hang themselves. Ain’t nothing better than that.</p>

            <p>Guards don’t matter in this scenario as they only prevent death, not conversion.</p>
<p>The Mastermind can’t convert or kill the King anyway, so this should be an auto-win for BD.</p>
<p>There are a ton of these auto-win/loss issues that don’t fully make sense. i42 need to get on that. It feels really terrible to new players.</p>
