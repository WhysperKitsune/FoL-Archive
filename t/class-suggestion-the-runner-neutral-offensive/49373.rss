    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Runner (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-runner-neutral-offensive/49373</link>
    <description>**The Runner (Neutral Offensive):**
**Passive 1:**
Former Criminal: Sheriffs and Paladins will see you as evil the first time they visit you. (_Note: Does not affect Observer’s peek, etc._) (_Note: After doing it a second time they will think you are neutral (ns) instead._)

**Passive 2:**
Close to Victory: Immune to occupation and target-changing. After reaching your goal you gain death immunity and will appear as a Blue Dragon to any investigative abilities. 

**Day Ability 1:**
Criminals Needle Gun: Shoot a player with an intoxicating needle. Will immobilize them after 2 days. Cannot target king. (1 Use, unavailable if reached goal) (_Note: Will not work on occupy immune people._)

**Day Ability 2:**
Brace: Gain Death Immunity for this particular night (2 uses, unavailable if reached goal)

**Night Ability 1:**
Paralyzing Trap: Set up a trap at a room, if someone visits the room, they will be immobilized. The trap will be removed afterwards (Unlimited, unavailable if reached goal)

**Night Ability 2:**
Paralyzing Field: Set up an electric field around your room. Anyone who visits you tonight will get immobilized. (1 Use, unavailable if reached goal)

**Victory Condition:** Get at least one person immobilized 2 times. And survive.

[details=&quot;Lore&quot;]
`When you find yourself before the king, you usually bow or kneel in front of them, in my case, both of those were impossible. I was already on the floor, kicked by a knight serving them. “I have never thought that it would be my foolish prince of a son who would get you. Your traps were treacherous indeed.” Anyone who listened looked at me with eyes of scorn. I started preparing the Paralysis Bomb in my hand. “Therefore, we have a request for you.”, I silently stared at the king. “Though your loyalty will waver a little, I suspect you of being the perfect man for a very special job.” The first prince standing next to his father looked at his father in shock, his eyes were saying ‘You can’t mean you trust this guy?’, and his father didn’t even react to his son. However, he did react to my gaze. “We want you to infiltrate the court of our neighboring country and disrupt the court.”, I looked at him with a denying look, the court? Isn’t that the place where everyone talks lavishly much? “Of course, payment is in due for you if you succeed.”, things began to get interesting. A payment is of course much better if you want a someone like me to work for you. “You will get an entirely new identity, as well as having all of your crimes forgiven and all the damage paid for by the royal family. Your new identity will serve as a Count in this country.” That offer was too tempting. Count? To even offer that high of a position to a criminal is considered taboo, even if I was a commoner it would still be way too much for a royal family to be able to do. It seems like he’s desperate. “I’ll accept on one more condition: Let me survive.”`

**Comments:**
Immobilized: Unable to do anything, includes talking in the court-room + Evil HQ, however they are still able to listen. Will last for 1 day and 1 night. Their bodies will be as if they were reaped. (Meet up at courtroom, not meeting up at Evil HQ.)

The Paralyzing Trap: Will stay until someone activates it. Will not activate on occupy immune people. Will activate on anyone else. Will be removed at activation. If multiple people visits said person it will be random who the trap occupies. The trap will stay if no one visited said person. Cannot be placed on the runner. Will not activate on other runners. The Trap will be removed if a new one is built.

            <p>This is a cool change in gameplay. I really like when people come up with different ways to win as Neutral classes other then just trying to survive. Good idea!</p>
