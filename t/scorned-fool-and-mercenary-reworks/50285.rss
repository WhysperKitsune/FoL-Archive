<p>Night Ability: Rip Contract: get rid of you’re target’s contract (note: this is for people who get targets who are being rude af, also this will count as if someone killed you’re target)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The one huge problem I see with this, is the inevitable outcome. Mercs will be asked to rip their contract ASAP and asked to be reassigned to the first confirmed BD. possibly worth outing prince to get him that.</p>

            <p>Going to note that the punishment from executing fool comes from the “Poor Fellow” passive, which this rework lacks. Also I like the Scorned changes but yeah too much like Noble.</p>

<p>what about a 2 use ability… call it something like hide. Prevent people from visiting you. Gives you the agency you need to defend yourself, and with 2 uses, if you are active, by day 3 you’ve either had enough time to start appearing suspicious enough that the bad guys don’t want you dead.</p>
<p>The key problem with fool as he is, is he already punishes BD for correctly assesing someone is working against BD, and doing what they are supposed to do, but your suggestion is adding in extra consiquences for not only realizing he’s against the BD, and not only did bd correctly realize he was against BD, but probably a fool… you are adding in a possible penalty for using the only remaining options for killing him.</p>
<p>Defensive abilities, sure whatever. Risks for… using the backup methods to kill the fool, that’s just insane.</p>

            <p>Well if scorned is found by princess then it’s gonna be in trouble because the only to social classes that are BD are psychic and noble, psychic is unique soo noble is gonna be the way it has to go, or it could claim a support class but that’s not gonna help it win at all unless it finds a unique strategy or something like that, also peek will help the scorned how to accuse the player</p>
<p>Yeah but do you know how it feels to die N1 as fool? It’s an awful feeling, not even getting a chance to do to anything, that’s how most of my fool games are like that</p>

<p>Maybe give the ability I can’t name just 1 use?</p>
<p>I mean it just feels like something a mercenary would do, maybe just 1 use?</p>

<p>I personally already feel like Fool is too easy, as people are so determined to execute suspicious claims, so it doesn’t need a buff.</p>

<p>Once you run out of Guards, you don’t need extra protection for them.</p>

            <p>Well it’s the fool’s choice whether to kill them or not it’s not a passive. Yup and it does has the same goal. Also if that player is jailed/guarded/healed it wont work. If you don’t like it maybe it can occupy the player for 1 night or something like that</p>

            <p>right I’m getting what you are saying, but it’s basically lose lose lose for BD with no way to mitigate it other than prince, and possibly hunter.</p>
<p>Ignore the fool… left with a permanant uncontrollable vote that has no interest in helping bd<br>
so 4 BD vs 3 unseen and 1 fool… = deadlock can’t execute. A voter that has no interest in voting with BD is a huge detriment.</p>
<p>Execute the fool - I’d assume you are saying normal consiquences here… 1-2 days of no voting to execute.</p>
<p>Attempt to kill the fool with knight, hunter, alc etc… Oh ok he’s now immune to the first shot. and he’s able to land a kill to punish you for… doing literally teh only thing you can do to try and get him off the board.</p>
<p>In short, this form of fool is, damned if he exists,</p>

            <p>Well I have a steam account called htmwoo, so you may know me at steam or you just saw one of my other posts, the reason I named myself htm is because my friends call me that (for some reason)</p>
<p>I like the current system, what I mean by the night ability is that anyone who attacked him can be optionally chosen to be killed, I don’t mean that if he gets lynched he will kill one of the people who voted execute on him</p>
<p>Well currently merc’s target can get lynched without merc being able to save his target, so that’s why I gave him that ability which I can not figure out a name for and I mean rebound is pretty useless so I gave merc the ability to save his target after he used all of his stand guards but this would require him to sacrifice himself, meaning all bad abilities will go on him except conversion</p>
<p>Sorry If I don’t sound that clear, English is not my first language</p>

<p>Assuming fool has the same win condition… this is just maximizing how much of a problem he is to go against… even when you figure out what it is? Basically making prince litterally the only thing that can kill a fool without a sharp penalty?</p>
<p>IE knights, alcs, etc… can no longer remove the fool</p>

            <p>“htm” sounds familiar, do I know you?</p>
<p>The Scorned change just looks like a straight buff, which I’m not sure it needs. However, I don’t think either ability is bad for it if it were to be buffed.</p>
<p>Not a fan of the ToS Jester-like Fool change, probably worse than the current in dissuading you from lynching it, punishing the court (if you believe that’s necessary), and being on the recieving end of the punishment.</p>
<p>I also don’t see the point of your Merc rework, could you please explain your thought process?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
