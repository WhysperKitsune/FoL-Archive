    <title>For Those Who Host Turbo Game (Especially GI Turbo)</title>

    <description># I think that you should only host turbo game when you can guarantee that the game will fill up and you can host the game, and also, restrain yourself for hosting too many turbo game.

# Not only that there is too many GI turbo out there, it also clog up the forum, making it harder for people who wants to play an actual game.

# Feel free to dismiss my suggestion though, it is your choice whether or not to host it :P</description>
