    <title>What exactly is the King supposed to be?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-exactly-is-the-king-supposed-to-be/75938</link>
    <description>Ok so there is a lot of talk over what the King&#39;s job is. And so far based on the community it has been pretty clear that there are 2 things that we DON&#39;T want him to be:

* An Investigator
* A Whisper Mule 

So. With those 2 out of the picture, what should the King&#39;s purpose be?

Don&#39;t worry about the specific ability&#39;s and don&#39;t worry about late game.</description>
