    <title>New ability for the King to avoid frequent early lynches</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-ability-for-the-king-to-avoid-frequent-early-lynches/1972</link>
    <description>Regret(Passive)If the King is killed by a member of its own faction that faction is being instantly occupied by grief until the day after the King was found dead, this bypasses Occupy Immunity but does not affect Royal Blood. A lynching is a collective kill by all Blue Dragon members alive.
There have been frequent complaints of kings being killed with no evidence and no suspicious behaviour just because they could be evil. This makes winning for neutral kings almost impossible, and subverts the idea of an unknown king. Accusing the King itself should not me made that hasty, and this should prevent it. Being neutral king will still be hazardous now, but not nearly impossible.</description>

            <p>As nk, I try to help bd without being too helpful and guard myself until out of guards, then judge how close the game is before ending, and decide if I need to claim to evils to not kill me</p>

            <p>As Neutral King just claim BD and then do fuck all/super passive until there are about 7 ppl left and then claim neutral. I don’t think I’ve ever lost as Neutral King doing this. Evils gonna want to find sheriff and Prince before taking out king, so just make sure you claim neutral before you think their eye will turn on you.</p>
<p>Neutral King claims d1 should always just be hung from BD pov, and theres no need anyway. Only problem is if unseen convert Nobles, but in that case they’re gonna kill you either way <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>You still aren’t helping Neutral Kings…</p>
<p>Claiming Good King will still get you killed by Evils.</p>
<p>Claiming Neutral is the only sure-fire way to stop Evils killing you. But with this, it’s like… “Neutral King? No leads, we execute.”</p>

            <p>… you don’t know how this helps Neutral King?<br>
Well… you know, if you don’t know if it is neutral king or good king… then you might not be so lynch happy on day 2! If the Neutral King does get lynched, it does not help the Neutral King. However, this change is not supposed to punish anyone who tries to get a Neutral King killed, because that would be dumb. If you claim Neutral King, prepare to get lynched. Thats ok.<br>
If you claim Good King however, then the people will be less happy to lynch you. It gives you well needed cover.</p>

            <p>I don’t see how this helps Neutral King though, it’s not apart of a Faction. Neutral is not a Faction.</p>
