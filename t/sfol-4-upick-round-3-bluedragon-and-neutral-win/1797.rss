    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-4-upick-round-3-bluedragon-and-neutral-win/1797</link>
    <description>**Welcome to another game of Upick, where you, the players, get to make your own class by sending me a name, unique to you!**

**Rules:**
1.	Follow the Global Forum Rules
2.	Don&#39;t be a dick
3.	Don&#39;t be inactive
4.	Do not quote/screenshot private host messages

**Gameplay:**
Days will be 3 IRL days long, or shorter if someone dies
Nights will be 1 IRL day long
Actions are done by messaging me
Cult will talk through a Discord Chat
This is a Upick game, and so has special mechanics, each player, upon the game beginning, will PM me and deadfrien a name for their desired class, RNG will dictate which classes will be Blue Dragon and which will be Blackrose and neutral, and then I shall create them, this will take about 48 hours probably
The classes will be more like in Mafia than ToL, meaning they will have 1 or 2 abilities maximum, also types will not be in play, just factions
No Standard Classes shall exist
When you receive your class card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it
Balance isn&#39;t guaranteed
Only the host can use big words, colored words unless you have approval, and only bold your words when peforming actions such as voting

**Executions:**
To accuse someone say &quot;/accuse [player]&quot; or &quot;/vote [player]&quot;
There will be no trial, if you reach a majority vote, the voted player will die
Executions end the Day
After The Night
You will be told what happened to you
Night:
Who knows what could happen?
Day:
Who knows what could happen?

**Journals:**
There shall not be Journals

**To Join:**
To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want. After expressing you wish to join, provide me and deadfrien the name of your class via pms.

            <p><strong>Sigh</strong> Well, it’s truely bastard game and Upick2 hasn’t even ended yet.</p>
<p>It’s also orangeandblack5’s fault  to occupy PKR I guess, if he wasn’t drunk or something like that - we could have stopped Icibalus from happening, I didn’t buy his claim when his objective is to sell candy or some shit (no offense, gg) so, I notices that Upick3 is not like Upick2 where you got several BD’s have different objectives that there’s no two neutrals but you got good ‘neutrals’ amoung the mix that has like, get 8 coins by the end of game alive, it doesn’t show I need to win with BD or like that, or eliminate BD and any neutrals that stands against you and like that.</p>
<p>So here on Upick3, it’s either win with BD and eliminate Unseen and neutrals that stands against you.</p>
<p>As for Queen_Alfa, yeah that’s my fault for that to happen - I literally brainfarted when I ask moderator to open the unseen chat here, but then I realized I am talking to moderator that also plays the game, not as co-host.</p>
<p>Total accident.</p>
<p>Since I am going to skip any SFoL games hosted by Fadeblade or otherwise, I have warning for that and not allowed to play one game.</p>
<p>I kinda wish I have new role to play with in further FoL, Fool was fun although I’d like to try new class sometime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Physical Representation Of Fade’s Annoyance At People Signing Up To Closed Signups<br>
The Darkgod being so annoyed at people who joined the game before it was open has forced you to begin a ritual that will summon him into the world where he will purge everyone who joined before he opened the game<br>
DarkGods Mark (Night) - You mark your target with a letter from FadeBlade that you choose they know they were marked and you can’t use letters that have already been used. When all targets have been marked and someone speaks his name, he is summoned and kills all the people who joined the game before he opened it. nothing can prevent him<br>
Darkgods interference (Passive) - You are immune to death and occupy at night and already contain 2 letters from FadeBlade that you choose. when one of your targets dies and lacks a mark of FadeBlade they are marked with a random letter you know what letter it was. The letters from DarkGods Mark will always be revealed when their death is announced<br>
*Your objective is to see The Darkgod summoned while you are alive</p>
<p>This make me chuckle.</p>
