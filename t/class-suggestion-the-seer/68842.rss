<p>You are right.  I probably won’t update the class though, I’m out of ideas.  I just want a class that predicts stuff because prophecy in dead chat is fun but I want it to have an impact on the game.</p>

<p>If the Oracle coordinated well with the Assassin then this could pretty much give an additional KPN to the Unseen while he’s alive, so a hard no from me.</p>

            <p>Both are more support than social and I feel like both they are very weak. How about you change Twist Fate to “If your first target dies for any reason, then your second will commit suicide.”</p>
<p>Doom is pretty niche as well, being kind of useless if the Seer was the N1 convert. I suggest making it target two people instead as a slight buff.</p>
<p>Edit: It would be cool of Seer had another minor ability or a passive. For example, the passive to survive an extra night of poison/bleeding is pretty useful.</p>

            <p>And can we please stop pretending this class is social?</p>
<p>Predicting deaths isn’t the mark of a social class. That’s just playing the game. Every class benefits from predicting deaths and this one benefits about as much as a physician.</p>
<p>It has 0 social ability’s and has 1 support ability attacked to a trigger. I don’t see how you can justify calling this class social</p>

            <p>Give the Oracle another day ability to not be completely useless without correctly dooming. Current incarnation is completely overshadowed by something like Sage. Sage can also redirect away kills and can ensure the death of one target like prince as well. Sage has other benefits like swapping away healers or investigatives. It needs to be more powerful.</p>
<p>Seer is better now and reminds me of a version of the time mage that was created as a suggestion for the court wizard rework, however I think this would also benefit from some positive day time ability in case Prophecy were to fail. It is not fun to sit on your hands and I still think I would prefer a Physician over a Seer in every case.</p>

            <p>Healing someone you predict will be attacked, as Physician does, does have the social element as you correctly point out.  But it is also supportive, and in fact it is primarily supportive because without the heal your prediction is worthless.</p>
<p>The <strong>Prophecy</strong> ability on the other hand is purely social, and not supportive, because it does not help the person whose death has been predicted.  Which is why I can call the class social <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:"></p>
<p>On second thought, you could say the <strong>Prophecy</strong> I propose is also supportive because it exists only to charge uses of <strong>Destine</strong> which is supportive …  So maybe you’re completely right.  But still, <strong>Prophecy</strong> is the ability that will be used more often than <strong>Destine</strong>.</p>
<p>I don’t know really <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/hugs.png?v=9" title=":hugs:" class="emoji" alt=":hugs:">  Call it support if you like!</p>

            <p>Okay this is how this class is going to work.</p>
<p>The person shall try to work with alchs when not converted. But when they are converted they are going to be agressive  which Is easy to notice the difference.</p>
<p>I think that the converted version should have 1 charge at the start.</p>

            <p>Do you like the updated <strong>Destine</strong> ability?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Destine (Day)</strong> - Select a player to consume all charges of Destine. If ever they were to die, their death will be postponed by the number of <strong>Destine</strong> charges. - 1 charge</p>
</blockquote>
