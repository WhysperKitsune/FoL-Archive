    <title>Let Sellsword disable DAY abilities</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/let-sellsword-disable-day-abilities/75552</link>
    <description>Really self-explanatory, there needs to be a STRONG counter to day confirms.

We asked for this long ago and were only given a 20-second silence.  

This isn&#39;t good enough.

Plus, it&#39;s bugged at the moment on Invoker at least.</description>

            <p>I see your point, but tbh Prince should just have normal immunity.  It’s not good balance for a class to be immune to basically everything.</p>

<p>Don’t think it should work on the Prince. That’s too powerful in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t see how it would be.  Prince is too powerful at the moment as there’s no way to completely counter it other than Reaper, but Reaper games aren’t a guarantee(Plus reaper can’t win with the opposing faction.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s why I added this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They will not be notified until they attempt to use an ability.  Still consumes the cost(souls/brilders)/use of the ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can still confirm someone, but it’s harder and requires them to waste a use of an ability, which I don’t see people doing just to confirm someone else.</p>

<p>We only want evils to disable day abilities so that BD can’t say “Hunter, wolf someone” or “Mystic, telepathy” because as soon as they say that, they will (hopefully) get disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do see your point, but you should never use wolf(or any killing ability) to confirm yourself.  There are way too many negative variables(think of how many occupiers/redirectors there are).  I’m not against reducing it to one use to lower confirmability for Butler, but part of the reason why I want it is that Butler is honestly a bit boring.</p>

            <p>If you want it to work on prince then it needs to not be an occupy. Prince is immune to occupy remember?</p>

            <p>Why?  Isn’t occupation just a disabling of an ability?  So why should it be limited to night abilities?</p>

            <p>/support</p>
<p>Here’s what the ability itself should look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bewilder(Uses: 3 for servant, 2 for sellsword and Butler, and 1 for Invoker and Pretender) -</strong> Occupy your target for the rest of the day.  Bypasses immunity.  They will not be notified until they attempt to use an ability.  Still consumes the cost(souls/brilders)/use of the ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This will be given to Butler, Servant, Invoker, and Pretender(would replace Distract for the last 2) as well.  Uses vary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would work on all day abilities, including ones that are selected during the day but actually occur at nightt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would work on the prince</p>
</li>
</ul>
