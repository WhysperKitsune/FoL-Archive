    <title>Mercenary Shield Bug?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mercenary-shield-bug/71076</link>
    <description>In this game, there were 2 Mercs. #9 and #10
On n2, Merc #9 and Merc #10 both shield the prince (#5).
The next day, #10 claims &quot;I shielded the prince, and he was attacked 2x! My shield saved him&quot;
I respond with &quot;Thats a lie, I shielded him too, but my shield didnt trigger.&quot;
We hang #10 and he really WAS a merc. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
My shield should have triggered too, or at least first. I was #9, so with all things being equal should be 1 step earlier in the trigger rotation.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Have 2 mercs shield someone who is attacked on the same night.
