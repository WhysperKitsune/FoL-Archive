    <title>[Class Suggestion] Interrogator (Rework)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-interrogator-rework/70809</link>
    <description>My last Interrogator class was supposed to be non-confirmable, but people said it was confirmable anyway.  So I&#39;m giving it another shot. 

&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;] The Interrogator [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Social [/color]** 
&gt;
&gt;**Interrogate (Day)** - Send the message, [color = &quot;purple&quot;]**&quot;What is your class?&quot;**[/color] as a whisper to someone.  Not usable again until that player claims to you in whisper, or they die _(this is to prevent spamming, and motivate BD to claim)_.  You cannot target the same person twice. The Interrogator cannot whisper &quot;What is your class?&quot; outside of this ability _(to prevent spamming, so people can&#39;t just spam this question to every person in-game and claim they are an Interrogator who&#39;s bluffing on 14 of the 15 whispers)_.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Claiming to you in whisper&quot; refers to the first (correctly-spelled) class mentioned in anything they whisper you after you&#39;ve Interrogated them.
&gt;
&gt;**Truth Serum (Night)** - Learn the exact class of someone you&#39;ve interrogated who refused to claim to you. (1 use - recharged if you find scum with this ability)


&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;] The Torturer [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Social [/color]** 
&gt;
&gt;**Firekitten (Passive)** - Read all whispers.
&gt;
&gt;**Coerced Confession (Day)** - Trollbox a whisper from one player to another. (Infinite uses but only 3 times per day max)</description>

            <p>That doesn’t confirm you.  Literally all Interrogating a confirmed Prince is is whispering him, “What is your class?” and letting you waste Truth Serum on him if he doesn’t claim to you in whisper.</p>

            <p>Why would you Interrogate a confirmed Prince?  I don’t understand what that is supposed to accomplish.</p>
<p>Sure, you can use any mispelling of “What is your class?” but nobody will have any reason to claim to that.</p>
<p>People will be motivated to claim to the correct spelling after you’ve claimed Interrogator because if they are BD, they want you to be able to Interrogate the next person, and if they are evil, they don’t want to be truth-serumed.</p>

            <p>If you misspell it like that it’s obvious it’s not a real Interrogate.  How does that make it weak?</p>

            <p>My last Interrogator class was supposed to be non-confirmable, but people said it was confirmable anyway.  So I’m giving it another shot.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue"> The Interrogator </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="steblue"> Blue Dragon Social </font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Interrogate (Day)</strong> - Send the message, <font color="purple"><strong>"What is your class?"</strong></font> as a whisper to someone.  Not usable again until that player claims to you in whisper, or they die <em>(this is to prevent spamming, and motivate BD to claim)</em>.  You cannot target the same person twice. The Interrogator cannot whisper “What is your class?” outside of this ability <em>(to prevent spamming, so people can’t just spam this question to every person in-game and claim they are an Interrogator who’s bluffing on 14 of the 15 whispers)</em>.</p>
<p>“Claiming to you in whisper” refers to the first (correctly-spelled) class mentioned in anything they whisper you after you’ve Interrogated them.</p>
<p><strong>Truth Serum (Night)</strong> - Learn the exact class of someone you’ve interrogated who refused to claim to you. (1 use - recharged if you find scum with this ability)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="purple"> The Torturer </font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="purple"> Unseen Social </font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Firekitten (Passive)</strong> - Read all whispers.</p>
<p><strong>Coerced Confession (Day)</strong> - Trollbox a whisper from one player to another. (Infinite uses but only 3 times per day max)</p>
