    <title>Assassin&#39;s 2nd day ability</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/assassins-2nd-day-ability/9485</link>
    <description>Right now assassin honestly has one of the weakest abilities in distract like why would anyone use that?
Here is my idea-Day ability-Forage-Forage for some nightshade giving you an extra use of nightshade
This lets you poison more people and makes you choose between poisoning someone or getting another use of nightshade.
or Day ability-Without a trace-You will be gone from your room that night preventing you from talking to the the other unseen members and from being visited.This prevents the prince from jailing you as he can&#39;t find you when he tries to jail you.</description>

            <p>Well the distract ability is pretty useless, but not sure about that as a replacement.</p>

            <p>I think too many times assassin was forging instead of killing. Defeated the point of observers and knight and king guards</p>
