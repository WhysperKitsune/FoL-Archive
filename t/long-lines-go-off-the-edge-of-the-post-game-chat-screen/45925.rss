    <title>Long lines go off the edge of the post-game chat screen</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/long-lines-go-off-the-edge-of-the-post-game-chat-screen/45925</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

If you type a line that&#39;s too long in the post-game chat screen, it accepts it, but your text will vanish off the right side of the box instead of wrapping around, causing it to be cut off.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The line should either wrap, or it should prevent you from typing / sending a line that&#39;s too long in the first place.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Just end a game, and in the postgame chat, write a very long line.

#### Comments:

It&#39;s possible that this is dependent on resolution.  I am playing fullscreen at 1920 x 1200.</description>
