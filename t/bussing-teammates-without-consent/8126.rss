    <title>Bussing teammates without consent</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bussing-teammates-without-consent/8126</link>
    <description>I just read a post by the moderator robflob that bussing your teammates without their consent is gamethrowing. This is ludicrous!

If I am MM and have a teammate that has no abilities left, and I ask to bus them but they say no, I should be able to do it without consent because the only reason they are saying no is because they want to live, like a priest that doesn&#39;t revive prince because they don&#39;t want to die.

Not only that, but I might also want them gone because the prince keeps jailing them, and if I whisper to ask it then it will seem suspicious.

Even further, if the prince is jailing ME as mastermind, and he might execute me soon, I will need to do an uncoordinated bus on my teammate to get the prince off of my back.

------

In addition to the out of abilities circumstance, it also applies when a really good conversion shows itself. You would need your teammate to die that day to be able to convert that person that night.

Another circumstance is needed further evidence of your being good, so you claim someone you just converted was revealed to be converted to you through scouts.</description>

            <p>I will try to communicate with ym team before a bus, but with faking sheriff scout it is much better to do it before your first night chat with them because people know when an unseen dies.</p>

            <p>What if there was a message in the scum team night chat on Night 1 that simply reads:</p>
<p>“Intentionally casting suspicion on an ally to earn credibility (i.e. bussing) is not against the rules, but please try to communicate strategies like this beforehand as to not irritate your fellow players. Sometimes bussing is a good idea, but teammates may not understand why you are getting them killed. Please communicate intention! Thank you.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve had so many reports where people have been bussed and then outted the entire faction because they were uninformed and not communicated with.</p>
<p>It has started to lead to game-throwing reports by both sides of the team.</p>
<p>The Mastermind reporting the Assassin for revealing all the Unseen.<br>
The Assassin reporting the Mastermind for throwing him under the bus.</p>
<p>I’m not kidding, we get at least 5 of these reports a day. It’s like Methnor said before, there are new players to the game and to the genre and throwing them in the deep-end doesn’t seem fair. It’s best we nip it in the bud. Perhaps when we get a competitive system and the more experienced players start joining up, then yeah, perhaps bussing will be a more active strategy. But until that happens, it’s like I said, nipping it in the bud.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In that specific case, the assassin is the one who clearly should get a warning/ban. The mastermind played by his condition: He judged it was the best strategy for the team to buss that assassin. The assassin did not play by his win condition: he outed his whole team because he was salty.</p>
<p>This is just common sense.</p>
<p>I have not seen that specific game, but i am sure there is PLENTY of times where bussing is a great strategy. Punishing players for it does not seem right.</p>
<p>Its easy to say “well communicate”, but usually its during the day that you see a good bussing opportunity. For example, the assassin is starting to be suspicious, and you think he going to be jailed by the prince, you use him to appear more innocent, AND to be able to convert during the night.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One example was this.</p>
<p>I was linked with a psychic and claimed princess as a lone MM. The other person also claimed princess. I converted her into assassin. Because I was worried about a second princess screwing me over I immediately outed the new princess as Killer/Offensive. They got lynched and I carried on with my gameplay now without any counterclaim. There was no time to coordinate and waiting would get the Psychic to probably call me out. What was I supposed to do?</p>

            <p>That sounds like a learning curve problem. Not what the rules are supposed to address. It would be better to simply mention bandwagoning as spacificaly NOT an example of gamethrowing to make the assassin in this case have no excuse.</p>

</aside>
<p>We understand the rule. But i think we’re allowed to disagree with it. This game is still very new, and i think rules will most likely change in time.</p>
<p>I have been playing mafia/werewolf games for many years, and its the first time i see a rule about bussing being illegal. Its a very legitimate and basic strategy used in those game types. And of course, its most often not done with the person’s consent.</p>
<p>Same goes for the mercenary rule. It makes absolutly no sense to force mercenaries to not play by their own win condition.</p>
<p>I think its healhy to discuss rules and possibly have them changed. Seems like the huge majority of the community thinks bussing should be allowed in the game. Bussing is usually done on the spot, its not a planned thing. I think it just takes mods some common sense to see the difference between a buss that went wrong, and someone who purposely tryed to lose the game.</p>

            <p>And when you don’t have time to coordinate it? One of the times I bussed someone in a way that would get me killed if I did it any later and it was on a fresh convert. No time to plan with them and no time to ask. Same happened one of the time I was bussed Except it was the new convert doing the bussing on me. Same deal as before.</p>

            <p>I’ve accidently bussed the last cult before. I was kinda screwed as I couldn’t lynch out all the BD before I lost.</p>

<p>What’s with the Evil King? They cannot safely ask their teammates if a bus is OK.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a very good point. I have often bussed my cult partners knowing full well they were cult just to give myself some credibility as evil king. I did that whitout their consent. Should i be banned?</p>

            <p>Honestly, if there is any game where bussing is a good idea it is this one because of the conversation mechanic</p>

            <p>As i explained in my merc post, i think those VERY special rules need to be displayed VERY clearly whitin the game. In every single other mafia games i have played, bussing is an extremely common strategy.</p>
<p>I come from a site called epic mafia where they have some of the best players, and bussing is extremely common.</p>
<p>If you are going to warn/ban people for doing a classic mafia/werewolf strategy, it should be displayed very clearly.</p>
<p>And quite honneslty, i think all those rules which are trying to stop advanced level of play is bad for the health of the game. There is a difference between stupidly outting all of your team because you are salty, and throwing a partner under the buss to give yourself more credibility. But if we’re constantly fearing a ban, then we will avoid this kind of next level play.</p>

            <p>I’ve both spontaneously bussed and been bussed and I always had the bussed person realize what was happening and play along. It’s surprising satisfying when it happens on the spot. Remember that a gamethrowing Evil will also out THEMSELVES as evil and not just the bussed person.</p>

            <p>yeah I am talking about the turn 4-7 sheriffs with ever decreasing circles producing no results . Combining with Sherriff gets converted a lot  id be leaning towards turning on a sheriff that kept missing .</p>

            <p>Sheriff whiffing on multiple nights can easily happen, especially if they investigated the Mastermind the first 3 nights, were jailed, occupied, redirected, or plenty of other things. A competent Mastermind can easily fake a Sheriff will that has 4-5 N/Ses, with weaving in fake occupations, people who died, and other things. You can get suspicious of people who don’t have results, but that suspicion can easily be incorrect.</p>

            <p>I certainly watch sheriff claims and will start to get very suspicious of any that have either completely failed to find anybody for 4-5 turns and will call them out on it .<br>
If someone claims investigative class I expect results !!</p>
