    <title>[Suggestion] Re: Boslof’s Strawpoll</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-re-boslof-s-strawpoll/72657</link>
    <description>Hi there, the 2 main things I want to consider with this post are **1. Why having the access for BD to share logs publicly is bad for the game**

And **2. Why I’d suggest Unseen/Cult are able to view each other’s log’s in real time AND able to leave a note for converts**

So onto my first point, having the ability to publicly share logs during the day first and foremost nullifies the Marshals snoop to a degree, and it also forces players to prioritise having good logs as opposed to **social** deduction. This change would cause the game to deviate from this genre and become a battle of “who has better logs” and I believe is quite **Anti-social**

2. So if it so antisocial Marcus, why do you want to allow cult/unseen to view each other’s logs?

Well I’m glad you asked! The Unseen and the Cult are first and foremost a team, and as such, being able to co-ordinate claims/logs etc will **increase** their win rate.
A byproduct of this suggestion, is also to allow a small “conversion” note for the unseen/cult with say a 100-200 character limit. The primary purpose of said note is just to inform the convert of who is claiming what and informing them that they may be bussed. As someone who has tried to bus the convert myself once and I did try to let them know before the graveyard started, some people are simply unaware of it, and having a note pop up with a small summary of what the heck is going on can go a long way. Again, I think this change will **buff** the unseen/cults winrate. 

I think the neutral classes would suffer the most because of these penalties, and increase the skill ceiling of neutral classes overall. 

Please leave feedback as to your thoughts on these suggestions

            <p>I’ll think more about 2 but the idea of pasting your journal is just ew, largely for the reasons you described.</p>
<p>Having only one pre-made will is the opposite of social deduction. It limits your abilities extensively.</p>
