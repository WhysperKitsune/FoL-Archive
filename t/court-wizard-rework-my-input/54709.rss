    <title>Court Wizard Rework - My Input</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-rework-my-input/54709</link>
    <description>Here are some of my ideas on how to make the Court Wizard a more powerful ally for the Blue Dragon. I didn&#39;t change anything for the Sage as I believe him to be in a better spot since Tornado is much stronger with the additional information from Mastermind and Assassin along with the added chaos.

The Court Wizard abilities below are similar to that of the Psychic&#39;s and the Knight&#39;s without killing or talking to anyone. This why it isn&#39;t Social or Offensive, but instead purely Support for the Blue Dragon!

___________________________________________________________________________________

**Court Wizard** – Blue Dragon Support
Day:

**Astute Observation** - 2 charges
Outputs an anonymous message to everyone stating the number of evil faction members currently in the game. Outputted number does not include Neutral Killer.

//Ability is similar to the Mystic’s Telepathy ability. This allows the Court Wizard to prove himself if questioned as well as to provide the BD team useful information as to how many they are up against. Ideally used in end game situations with 7 or less players remaining. Can also be used in the early game to discover if the evil faction was eliminated early. 

Night:

**Ice Cloak** – 1 charge
Applies a protective barrier around another player giving them an immunity to death once for up to 2 nights. Alerts the player given the barrier if they were attacked.

//Playing on the Court Wizard’s lore of having “Ancient knowledge of fire and ice” and “the last of my magic to summon forth a runed spell of protection”, the CW can protect high valued targets that may need additional protection. Cannot be used on themselves or the King. The alert message is, “Your Ice Cloak has broken, you are no longer protected!”.

**Magical Barrier** – Infinite Charges
Protect a player from all negative effects and conversion. Does not prevent kills.

//Nothing changes.

___________________________________________________________________________________

**The Sage** – Unseen Support
Night:

**Wall of Fire** - 2 charges
Summon a wall of fire at a player&#39;s door, preventing everyone but the Assassin from visiting them.

//Nothing changes.

**Tornado** – Infinite charges
Swap two players’ positions, causing all players targeting one of them to target the other.

//Nothing changes. I believe only the Sage should have the Tornado ability as it sows chaos and only aids the Unseen. Heals can be prevented and investigations can be ruined. It also helps that the Sage knows who the Mastermind and Assassin will be targeting for maximum effect.</description>

            <p>I understand your point and it is absolutely a problem this game has. As of now CW is a very underwhelming class with little ways to confirm yourself making it a perfect class for evil fake claims and frustrating for real CWs.</p>
<p>I look forward to how the devs plan on making CW fun to play yet also an easy claim for evils. The easy solution would be to nerf some of the current classes so that it’s harder to prove, but that risks making the game less fun for many players.</p>

            <p>Put it this way.</p>
<p>Let’s say this exact change goes through. CW now can’t be claimed by evil. This moves the problem to knight and physician. It doesn’t fix anything. So do we give physician and knobby day abilities as well? Then they can only claim sheriff/ paladin. Then those two get global day abilities. Well now miss lynch is impossible, and evils have no viable claims. This makes it impossible to win as evils, since you can’t fake anything anymore.</p>

            <p>I understand that, but there are many other things that makes mystic unclaimable for evils, while court wizard currently has none of that, other than the chance with tornado.</p>
<p>If we want to “LUL cw claim” we need more classes that can’t be confirmed, not less.</p>

            <p>It confirms him much like how Telepathy would confirm a Psychic. If players really want CW to be a safe claim for evils to make then it would be better for Astute Observation to only tell the CW. Then again why would anyone believe the number?</p>

            <p>I get what you’re going for, but this auto confirms him. Physician needs to actually heal someone, which could never happen. CW currently can still prove through tornado usage.</p>
<p>Essentially, by giving him a day ability that confirms him, you negate any possibility of cw being a claim for evils.</p>

            <p>Right now I feel like CW is in a weird spot as a Support class to not have a way to prove themselves. Both the Merc, Alch and Phys have a way to confirm that they are Support class. This was my way to have CW claims be a little more trustworthy.</p>
