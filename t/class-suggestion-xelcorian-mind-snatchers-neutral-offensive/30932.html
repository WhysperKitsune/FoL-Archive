<p>Lore<br>
Those blessed with magical capabilities devote their lives to the art of the arcane. For they must if they dream of conjuring more than a simple shower of harmless magical dust. As even the creation and formation of simple ice can fail spectacularly without the proper skill or concentration. But, there are none incantations so vastly complicated and open to failure as rituals to commune with creatures from other spheres. Blood spilled at the wrong moment, sacrifices offered up too late, or chants of power interrupted by a lapse in concentration. All can at best bring a ritual to a close. At worstâ¦ terrible horrors are brought from other planes, stranded in their new permanent home, but not bound properly, or inhibited in any shape or form. The extra terrestrial beings of Xelâcor are but one of many examples. Cunning asexually reproducing parasites that merge with the brains of host victims, subtly assimilating their knowledge, and eventually their host into a hive mind structure after a length process in which the parasite permanently fuses itself with the hostâs brain. While those deemed unworthy or of no purpose are cast aside, brains budging as blood cells erupt and rupture until the host beingâs life ebbs away. An ever growing colony spans the world, from simple villages to the castle Adiart.</p>
<p>Comments<br>
Personally I believe the addition of a neutral killer that has a win condition that isnât specifically tied to killing everyone would be good for the game as people often arenât a fan of NKs having a extremely low winrate. Though they still understand why that has to be the case. Which is why Iâd like to suggest the idea of a slower paced NK that has the potential to kill people in droves if allowed too, without being over powered due to a slower pace associated with its play style. Being more so focused on a staging and executing a grander plan over the course of the game to fulfill objectives instead of chipping away at the player count every turn like the current NKs. The way I see it the current NKs can be described as very aggressive (sorc) middle of the pack (poss) slow (reaper) Which is why Iâd like to see an NK thatâs very slow, but ultimately rewarding and fun to play. Which I hope something like this would be to the player base as it rewards skill and proper planning with a fair amount of strategy involved throughout the course of game. Thank you for reading, please post what you think about it, Iâm eager to hear about what the community thinks.</p>
