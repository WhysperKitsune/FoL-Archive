            <h1>Danganronpa: Star Academy</h1>
<h3>Prologue</h3>
<p>It was the start of a new academic year at Star Academy, where anyone can become a star! (Or so the cheesy motto said)</p>
<p>From the freshmen who had only joined that year, <em>16 students</em> were told to come one hour earlier than the others to the school building, Building R13. These <em>16 students</em> were those deemed to possess incredible talent that would soar high in the future. In other words, those whose talent on the level of <strong>Ultimate</strong>.They were given an early access to school, along with the key for a private dorm for themselves.</p>
<p>Like any other schools, orientation day was also an introduction to the school’s rule. The 16 students received the rules in form of a list.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Rules</summary>
<ol>
<li>22.00-07.00 is considered as Night Time. Several areas are off-limit during the night.</li>
<li>Sleping in your own respective dorm is mandatory. Punishment follows those that breaks this rule.</li>
<li>Violence against the Heads is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Additional regulations may be added if deemed necessary.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<h3>Chapter 1: A New Star Has Ended</h3>
<h4>The Start of a Game</h4>
<p>One month after the school year had begun, the 16 <font color="red"><strong>Ultimate Students</strong></font> were gathered in the Gym by <font color="purple"><strong>Headmaster Monokuma</strong></font> and <font color="purple"><strong>Headmistress Kirasha</strong></font>. They gave the students an unexpected news.</p>
<p>In order to stimulate the growth of their talent, the <strong>Ultimate Students</strong> were to participate in a <strong>killing game</strong>.</p>
<p>The students questioned this ridiculous announcement, but it was soon clear that it was no elaborate joke. The school was shut in. There was no way out. They investigated Building R13 thoroughly, yet there was no hope to get out.</p>
<p>…until several new rules were added.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Rules</summary>
<ol>
<li>22.00-07.00 is considered as Night Time. Several areas are off-limit during the night.</li>
<li>Sleping in your own respective dorm is mandatory. Punishment follows those that breaks this rule.</li>
<li>Violence against the Heads is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Additional regulations may be added if deemed necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone who kills a fellow student and becomes ‘blackened’ will graduate, unless they are discovered.</strong></li>
<li>Destruction of Star Academy is prohibited.</li>
<li>Taking items without purpose is prohibited.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<p>The seed of distrust was sowed between the students. They performed their own activities during the day, and when Night Time came by, they went to sleep.</p>
<h4>The First Case: Double Murder</h4>
<p>When the students woke up in the morning, they faced the start of the game. The door to Dorm 2 was ajar. Inside, they found the strangled corpse of <strong>the Ultimate Medic, Raya</strong>.</p>
<p><font color="cyan"><strong><em>Raya Tara the Ultimate Medic</em></strong></font> <em>was strangled to her death in her own dorm.</em></p>
<p>That was not the end. When Regent, the Ultimate Optimist, Prakoso, the Ultimate Deliquent, and Olin, the Ultimate Furry, checked the Incinerator, they found the burnt corpse of Hiakic, the Ultimate Video Gamer.</p>
<p><em><font color="burlywood"><strong>Hiakic Mianna the Ultimate Video Gamer</strong></font> died in the Incinerator Room.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Heads</strong> informed the students of the existence of the <strong>Trial</strong>.</p>
<p>A chance for them to found the <strong>Blackened</strong> and prevent him from graduating. The students started to investigate.</p>
<h4>Trial of the First Case: Double Murder</h4>
<p>After the investigations, the students gathered at the <strong>Trial Ground</strong> and began their trial.</p>
<p>Several evidence were revealed to light in the trial.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Evidence</summary>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A video of Raya being strangled by an unknown man</li>
<li>A mouthguard found in Dorm 2</li>
<li>Raya and Hiakic’s estimated time of death</li>
<li>Zakai’s confession of tying Hiakic inside the Incinerator Room</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>The evidences and testimony from the students shortened the list of suspects to three students: <strong>Misty, the Ultimate ???</strong>, <strong>Zakai, the Ultimate Debater</strong>, and <strong>Luzia, the Ultimate Soldier.</strong></p>
<p>Each suspects were pointed out by one students, who had their own hypothesis of what had happened.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Hypothesis</summary>
<blockquote>
<h5>Accusation of Zakai, the Ultimate Debater</h5>
<p><strong>Accuser</strong>: Prakoso, the Ultimate Deliquent</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Zakai was the one who had seen Hiakic last alive. He had confessed to tying Hiakic in the Incinerator Room. When he was in the middle of his act, Raya saw him somewhere he shouldn’t be. He proceeded to kill Raya to eliminate the witness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h5>Accusation of Luzia, the Ultimate Soldier</h5>
<p><strong>Accuser:</strong> Zakai, the Ultimate Debater</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Several people had known of my plan to tie someone in the Incinerator Room. Luzia was one of them. She hurted Hiakic. Then she knocked Raya’s door, saying that Hiakic was injured. When Raya opened the door, she strangled Raya. When Luzia came back to the Incinerator Room, Hiakic was dead. Hiakic death was accidental.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h5>Accusation of Misty, the Ultimate ???</h5>
<p><strong>Accuser:</strong> Luzia, the Ultimate Soldier</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Misty had knowledge of Zakai’s plan as well. Anything I can do, she would be able to do as well. I am not the culprit.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>After a debate, the students voted for who they thought was the culprit. The majority of the vote was placed on Zakai, the Ultimate Debater.</p>
<p><strong>The Heads</strong> revealed the murderer, which was truly Zakai. Their guess had been right. The murder was not completely Zakai’s fault, but he was still responsible for it.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Murder</summary>
<p>After exiting the Computer Room, Zakai had waited until someone was left alone. Hiakic was the last person inside. He forcefully kidnapped Hiakic, dragging her to the Incinerator Room. Zakai tied her over the Incinerator. Then Headmaster Monokuma opened up the Incinerator floor to reveal a fire pit.</p>
<p>Hiakic was murdered, and Zakai was the Blackened.</p>
<p>He left the room in a hurry. Raya was standing there in the corridor. She had seen him enterring and leaving the crime scene.</p>
<p>She must be killed. He took a mouthguard from the gym’s supply.</p>
<p>In the dark of the night, Zakai approached Raya’s dorm. He knockced on her door, saying that something  was wrong with Hiakic. Raya grabbed her first aid kit and rushed to open the door.</p>
<p>He strangled her there. Throwing the mouthguard to the floor, Zakai left the room and went to his own dorm.</p>
</details>
<p><em><strong><font color="cadetblue">Zakai Letigo the Ultimate Debater</font> had been executed.</strong></em></p>
<details>
<summary>
Execution</summary>
<p>Zakai sat in a court room-like setting. A giant monokuma sat on the judge’s seat with a giant gravel. Another monokuma, standing across of Zakai threw accusations at him. Upon the last garbled word of the accusing monokuma, the giant monokuma nodded and bashed Zakai with his giant gravel.</p>
</details>
<p>He was the <strong>Blackened</strong> that killed <strong>Raya, the Ultimate Medic</strong> and <strong>Hiakic, the Ultimate Video Gamer</strong>.</p>
<p>The trial ended. The students, with a bitter taste at their tongue after witnessing Zakai’s execution, returned from the <strong>Trial Ground.</strong></p>

<p>(Also, this is me having a biased view because I was the one killed off first, please take my views with a pinch of salt)</p>

            <p>For those of you who are here yet may not want to join the discord for some reason. <strong>Here is a summary of the prologue.</strong></p>
<p>Yadoko, the Ultimate Psychologist helped a bunch of people. Everyone was allowed to move around freely, even leaving the academy. Eventually of course this was all taken away as the students were locked in and forced to play a killing game. Yada yada</p>
<p><strong>Here is a mini summary of chapter 1.</strong></p>
<p>The Ultimate Video Gamer was killed due to Monokuma himself. Yet Zakai was chosen as the blackened (Despite not being involved)<br>
As a result, he went to kill the Ultimate Medic<br>
During the trial The Ultimate Debater himself was eventually found guilty and was executed<br>
Before all this, 2 things of interest happened<br>
Firstly a rebellion by Yadoko the Ultimate Psychologist. Including threatening the headmasters, lunging and throwing weapons at them, offering a self sacrifice and then just passing out after everything<br>
Then a kill on the Ultimate Scholar due to being too lazy in school (Inactivity)</p>
<p>We are 4 people down.<br>
Despite Zakai being the murderer it won’t sit well for everyone due to the true culprits of the first murder. The one which normally should count before anything else.<br>
It is heading into chapter 2 slowly</p>
