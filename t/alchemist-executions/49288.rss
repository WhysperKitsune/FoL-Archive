    <title>Alchemist executions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/alchemist-executions/49288</link>
    <description>Throne of Lies is all about lying and trying to find the liars. In order to find the liars you have to **use your abilities** and **share information** in order to **deduce**.

With that im mind, I feel like Alchemists often (90% of the time) get executed just because no one has any other leads and since he is a NEUT, who cares if he gets executed.
 
I think it would be a nice idea to add some sort of punishment for the &quot;NEUTS OUT&quot; movement we seem to have in this game. It would make players more wary and actually make them use proper deduction/investigations before going for &quot;alch claims&quot;.

Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, &quot;yolo&quot; Alchemists are definitely fair game when it comes to the executing decision but most Alchemists keep to their corner and just heal and still get executed for no actual reason. 

As for the punishments, I think something like the following would cause enough impact without making the Alchemist an &quot;untouchable&quot; class.
**_First of all, the game must register if the alchemist used a &quot;Bomb&quot;. If the Alchemist used it, then none of the following applies:_**

- If King used &quot;Order Execution&quot; on an Alchemist, the King loses the other &quot;Order Execution&quot; charge. If the King had already used one and it was his second &quot;OE&quot;, then King loses the daily abilities for ONE day (no Pointing Finger and no Force Pardon/Exe).

- If Prince executes an Alchemist, Prince cannot jail anyone the next day,

- If the Alchemist gets voted up for treason and executed, the court cannot vote anyone up the following day.


These &quot;minor&quot; changes would make it so that players actually have to put some effort into investigating the claims instead of just executing an Alchemist because there&#39;s no actual punishment for that at the moment.</description>

            <p>Still has a huge impact on who can and can’t be voted. And if they’re clever, they can even lynch someone scoring an extra kill, assuming their close to victory anyways.</p>
<p>If all but 1 Unseen votes to execute, that 1 Unseen gets a free kill if they are willing to die.</p>

<p>Most Alchs don’t just bomb, and although he killed the Prince, he saved the game so he had a neutralish impact.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While I’m all for the “neuts out” movement, I have found it easy to trust alchs who are honest with you.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself. How can you tell if an alchemist is trustworthy or not?</p>
<p>In a game of deception, it’s not easy to tell if someone’s just yanking your chain, but during the last game I played, I…ahem…RP’d as a certain player’s slayer, pretending to act out on my rage against a player that had a disagreement with me during the last match. (Yeah I know my logs didn’t show the deb n1, whoops, but that would of never been the problem if you would of investigated the THREE sheriff claims instead of a knight claim…)</p>
<p>I forgot his name, but I was “Bewb Haunter” the Good King. During the game I said that “while I am the good king, if you’re boob I will ex you” to spread some doubt around my subjects, and then even more so d2 when I asked everyone to claim if they were boob or not. forgot my exact words there, but I didn’t get as many claims as I did before, but it worked. I had 2 people claim “not boob” who turned out to be OG unseen, and I had three key claims. observer, knight, and alch.</p>
<p>This was at least a night ago, so I can’t give a play by play, but I can at least tell you a key moment which lead me to victory AS THE ONLY BD LEFT ALIVE. Remember that first alch that claimed to me? During the game he yolo’d bd twice, BUT HE WAS HONEST. He told me right then and there “Sorry I killed the prince.” the day the prince came up dead, and again when he killed…I think it was a sheriff? Normally yolo’ing alchs get ex’d as soon as they’re found out, but this alch put his trust in me (probably because he thought I was nk tbh lol), but because I didn’t take him out for his mistakes, I had him on my side until the end, as well as a second alch. The alchs teamed up to keep me healed as well as the second used his alch bombs to take out the surviving unseen, even though the situation was 2 unseen vs 1 good king vs 2 neuts. It was probably a rare moment in this game, but our neutral trust lead us into a double alch bd victory. I even gave them the opportunity to bomb me to end the game by exe one of the unseen myself that night, but they stuck with me.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Support an Alch, and they will support you in return.</p>
<p>Also, That second alch that saved my bacon? He was boob.</p>

<p>I think Alchemist should only have 2-3 charges of Stone Skin. Once you make it to n3 or so, there’s very little risk for the Alchemist from that point forward assuming you’ve saved your SS.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I rarely play games where alchemists are wrongly executed.  I think the problem is actually the opposite:  Alchemists are too often Kingmakers.  It’s too easy to win as Alchemist.  Maybe reduce their stoneskin to 3 so if they don’t want to get killed by evils, they have to put more effort into cooperating with them.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I think the fact that people are arguing over whether the Alchemist should always be lynched or never be lynched shows that it’s mostly fine.</p>
<p>(Personally I think it’s stupid for BD to lynch / execute alchemist claims unless they have some reason to think they’re evil, but the fact is that they do sometimes do it.)</p>

            <p>It’s kind of the whole point of the Fool though.</p>
<p>I think we should rethink the punishment for it, because it sucks to do nothing for 1, or even a whole 2 days.</p>

<p>I think it would be a nice idea to add some sort of punishment for the “NEUTS OUT”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>BD shouldn’t be directly punished by killing any Neut (except Fool ofc) imo since they can side with any faction.</p>
<p>Alchemist is pretty strong where it is right now because it is capable of healing poison and bleeds, killing with yolobomb <em><strong>and</strong></em> can give themselves night immunity.</p>

            <p>There is no reason not to kill an alchemist claim. Any knights should 100% attack an alch claim as</p>
<p>A) They may be lying and be scum<br>
B) Confirms you as killer if you leave note<br>
C) Eliminates a non-BD player. You want as many BD as possible.</p>
<p>Even if I’m not a knight, if we have no leads I would 100% push to hang the alchemist claim if it is very early game (D2 or D3). Only reason I wouldn’t was if someone claimed poisoned.</p>
