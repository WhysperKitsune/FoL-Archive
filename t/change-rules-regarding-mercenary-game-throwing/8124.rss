    <title>Change Rules regarding Mercenary Game Throwing</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-rules-regarding-mercenary-game-throwing/8124</link>
    <description>Id like to see what player bases opinion are on this .

Currently it is considered game throwing as Mercenary to throw your contract under a bus . ( out him as bd for example ) so that you can get a different contract . 

For me this goes against the spirit of the game . I should be able to employ any tactic I like to ensure my victory .

I appreciate this is the current rule and I will abide with it in game but I don&#39;t like that this is the rule . 

What do you lot think ?</description>

            <p>If this is going to be the official policy of the game then he should 100% be removed from being Neutral and made a Blue Dragon class.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s completely within the spirit and lore of the class and within the game for him to do whatever he needs to do to win.</p>
<p>It’s just like the Alchemist; I tell the king: “I don’t care what kind of king you are, I’m not here to judge you. I just want to win.”</p>
<p>I’m a goddamn Mercenary. I offer my protection to the highest bidder. I only care about myself. I will do whatever it takes to win. I will eliminate anybody that is foolish enough that gets in my way. Even those who I swore to protect.</p>

            <p>I think you don’t understand what meta game means, because bussing your first contract has absolutly nothing to do with meta game. It’s arguably “assholish” to betray your first contract once all hope is lost, but its arguably the same as betraying your old BD members once converted.</p>
<p>That being said, i do think you are 100% right. Having a rule that essentially patch a flawed design in the mercenary is bad. Maybe he needs a rework. I would suggest something like this:</p>
<p>1: Have only 1 target. If the first target dies, its over, merc lost.<br>
2: Give the merc a passive where as long as he is alive, his target is immune to death at night.<br>
3: Give the merc a bulletproof vest that saves him once at night, just like the priest.</p>
<p>I feel like its more interesting this way, because there is no way for the merc to prove his master he truly is a merc. But the merc is much more powerfull.</p>

            <p>if you don’t agree that it’s game throwing, you still have to admit that it’s unethical in respects to the game. Because it defeats the purpose of the mercenary role. If what you did was allowed, you would not be able to trust anybody claiming to be your merc. A mercenary ideally should side with his contract no matter what. That’s the whole point of the contract. A mercs contract should be able to trust his merc to help him through the game. Bussing him for your own benefit is… I guess meta gaming for lack of a better term. its just a kinda crappy move for what the merc is supposed to be.</p>
<p>But yeah technically you did what you thought was the best way to ensure you met your win conditions. Which is what you’re supposed to do especially as a neutral player. So while I still think what you did was crappy and technically wrong. I am glad you did it, because it shows a flaw in the mercs design. The merc needs tweaked to remove any incentive to throw your current contact under the bus, so it’s good that you exposed that I think.</p>

            <p>Exactly man. I 100% agree with your post. But i was reported for doing it and the mods did confirm i would have gotten a violation because it is against the rules (they were nice enough to pardon me). Even tho what i did essentially made me 100% win as merc instead of having a sure loss.</p>
<p>Something i hate too, is, this rule becomes an extremely grey area. When your contract’s side is going to lose the game 100%, what constitute game throwing?</p>
<p>Am i forced to pardon him in a vote after hes been confirmed unseen?</p>
<p>Am i forced not to vote him?</p>
<p>Am i forced to lie about his side when asked?</p>
<p>Am i allowed to stay silent if asked what side he is on?</p>
<p>Am i allowed to help BD find other unseen/cult?</p>
<p>I mean this seems like an extremely grey area. I think nobody should get a ban for “game throwing” when they clearly had winning in mind. I feel like punishing players who try to think outside the box to get higher win rates isn’t a good thing for the game.</p>

            <p>It is a Neutral class. I am going to side with I damn want to side with when I am neutral.</p>
<p>I am confident the vast majority of the player base will agree with me that it is not Gamethrowing to out your contract if it makes you win. The non-debatable definition of Gamethrowing is intentionally making yourself or your faction lose the game. In what way does outting your contract do that??</p>
<p>If you really want that to be a thing then make Mercenary become the same faction as his target. If you think a NEUTRAL class throwing someone under the bus who is in a complete different faction is Gamethrowing you high af tbh.</p>

            <p>While I agree that the Merc should be doing everything to keep their charge safe, it really puts you at a disadvantage if you have to vote with a losing side.</p>
<p>In addition, the Merc has no way to verify whether the claim of BD or evil is correct. They could have been lied too by the contract!</p>
<p>Also, with the no bussing your contract rule, whats now to stop me claiming merc, the “contract” outting me, then me accusing them? That’s completely within the rules right? But if I am legit merc I cannot accusing them!</p>

            <p>Id like to see what player bases opinion are on this .</p>
<p>Currently it is considered game throwing as Mercenary to throw your contract under a bus . ( out him as bd for example ) so that you can get a different contract .</p>
<p>For me this goes against the spirit of the game . I should be able to employ any tactic I like to ensure my victory .</p>
<p>I appreciate this is the current rule and I will abide with it in game but I don’t like that this is the rule .</p>
<p>What do you lot think ?</p>
