    <title>Forum-Based ToL</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/forum-based-tol/188</link>
    <description>There are multiple websites that play Mafia on a forum and I thought it could be done here
Obviously some abilities wouldn&#39;t work( RIP Troll Box) but I think it could be fun and also a good way to test suggested roles without the devs having to code them just to find out they don&#39;t work very well

            <p>I’m not sure how popular Forum ToL would be in comparison to just going to FM or MS. A good idea, but it would need to get something really right to attract the playerbase.</p>

            <p>Hmm… If we get more requests and can find some volunteer moderators (for that specific forum topic),  I’d be interested.</p>
<p>However, at this time it would be purely community-run so the devs can finish the game itself <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> perhaps something more official or intelligently automated (such as a Discord bot: something I’m good at coding) can auto mod on the future!</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>

            <p>I second this. There are separate mods in the forums. Admins, Global Mods, and Forum Mafia mods</p>

<p>I get that, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a developer running it, on the ToS Forums it is run by a different set of people entirely</p>

            <p>I don’t mean RP I mean actually playing the game<br>
As in, someone moderates, there are day and night phases<br>
Stuff like that</p>
