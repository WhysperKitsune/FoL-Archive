    <title>Why do people mistake redirect immune for occ immune?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-do-people-mistake-redirect-immune-for-occ-immune/71308</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen countless games now where a noble/phys is hung cause a drunk said he was occ immune.

We need to spread awareness that there&#39;s a difference. We can&#39;t let BD hang someone wrongly for this reason.

            <p>List:</p>
<p>Anyone with occupy immunity: Occupy and redirect immune always<br>
Mystic: Never occupy immune, always redirect immune<br>
Noble: Maid spy is redirect immune. Gossip is not. Never occupy immune<br>
Physician: Self care is redirect immune. Heal is not. Never occupy immune<br>
Mastermind: Never occupy immune, never redirect immune<br>
Anyone successfully occupied: is redirect immune<br>
Anyone who does nothing: is redirect immune</p>
<p>Therefore: if you have a Butler occupy someone the night a Drunk redirects that person you can cross reference the results to see with 100% certainty (baring mind warp) if any given player is Mastermind including N1-3</p>
