    <description>This guide should help you play Possessor more effectively. These tips partially apply to other NK but this is tailored to the Possessor in particular.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind when playing Possessor. There is no magic strategy that will win you every game but you can be a larger threat if you optimize your play.

# Tip 1 - Have a planned endgame from day 1

Obviously you need to be flexible. However you need to know what you are working towards as soon as possible. Have a backup plan of course but don&#39;t lose sight of the goal just to make a quick play that gets you spotted.

A few different examples of win states:

1: Being a trusted psycho king

2: Dead king. Dead Prince. Possessed confirmed sheriff. 

3: Possessed King. 1v1

Ect. You don&#39;t need to get creative for this. Just take a state where you are likely or guarenteed to win and get there.

Generally if you can control the day phase you win. 

# Tip 2 - Don&#39;t be afraid to speak up

Talking draws night kills. However it also makes you seem more trustworthy. This is always worth it. You are night immune so you don&#39;t need to worry about the Unseen or Cult.

The bigger thing to keep in mind is that the more you talk the easier it is to take control of the day phase and also let&#39;s you gather claims

# Tip 3 - Plan your jumps in advance

You should already know when and why you are jumping a few nights in advance. If you are jumping due to suspicion then you should accuse someone the day before. If you are trying to frame someone then whisper a trusted BD that they might kill you.

If you are trying to possess a confirmed BD then you should know what the protectives are doing.

## Know who you jump to!

Nothing kills a Hunter frame attempt more than possessing the Hunter you are trying to frame. Possessing the Prince is usually good but requires good timing to make the most out of it. And if you possess a scum then you are in danger of being immediately discovered

If there is anything you should take away from this post it&#39;s that:

# Planning is key!

If you know what you are doing. Why you are doing it and what everyone else is going to do in response beforehand then you win. You CANNOT wing it as Possessor. There is no randomly winning because you have majority.</description>

            <p>Obvious tip on a possessor guide should indeed be to emulate whoever you jump to. It is so obvious that suddenly the super active person that kept yelling and using all caps becomes passive as hell. They will suspect conversion or possessor on you, if you don’t pay attention to that.</p>

            <p>Can I add paying attention to little details your possessee does in their daychat ie not capitalising the first letter of a sentence, if you all of a sudden don’t capitalise your sentences you may be easier to read as possessor.</p>

            <p>On the thread here are a few of my own Possessor stratagem.</p>
<p><strong><em>Defile any class that doesn’t indicate it’s a Possessor game and possess the King N1</em></strong></p>
<p>It seems risky and stupid to do this, but it typically pays off as long as you don’t stay too long in the King. The reasoning here is to rely on the King meta and get players to start claiming to you so you can begin drafting long-term plans for the late game. Also you’ll be typically safe for the first few days as nobody will ask you to point the finger as nobody expects the King to be possessed so early, or that it’s even a Possessor game at all. To reduce suspicions on you, you can also announce to the court that you have an Inquisitor claim to dampen any suspicion that it’s a Possessor game.</p>
<p><strong><em>Feign reaped and jump twice early game</em></strong></p>
<p>Essentially, on the second or third day Facelift into another class, say nothing, vote nobody, and abstain during trials. At night make sure your log only contains information up to the previous night and then jump after deleting your death note. Do the same thing with the next body and then you can either save your last jump or use it to feign reap again. For added effect, claim that you’ve been chilled. This strategy is far more reliable than claiming Inquisitor as if suspicion starts to pile on that it’s not a Reaper game then people won’t instantly execute you in response, additionally people find it easier to believe a fake Reaper than a fake Sorcerer game. This tactic essentially allows you to jump into people who have been mechanically confirmed in the past without any suspicion at all and is less risky than faking Inquisitor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stay in the same body, have a solid fakeclaim, gain trust and become a Psycho King</em></strong></p>
<p>This works only if you are skilled in creating fake logs, know how to scumread, and avoid being scumread in response. To put it simply, meld into the Blue Dragon, don’t antagonize people, create a convincing fake log, gain everyone else’s trust, and once all Royalty barring the Prince dies you kill the King. This will secure your place in the next day’s election and nobody will even believe that you’re a Psycho King. The fact that it’s a Possessor game will make people believe that the Possessor must have jumped at least once, but since you can provide evidence that you did not get possessed, as in having your whisper logs and being able to point once King, you’ll basically be set for the rest of the game. To summarize, it’s using WIFOM as in a Possessor game people will expect you to forgo a solid claim and rely on your jumps not to get caught, and not do the complete opposite.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I would like to add that a very strong strategy is to try and delay the discovery that it’s a Possessor game for as long as possible. The more you keep people guessing or think it’s Sorc/Reaper, the better it will be for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strategy only really works against dumb courts, to be fair. By d3 the court can easily tell if it’s a Reaper game and there are subtle differences that happen between Sorcerers and Possessor games aside from an Inq spawning. Knights and Hunters will notice if they kill anyone who doesn’t have any capabilities to kill and if you end up killing a member of the Cult or Unseen you’re pretty much outed as no BD Killers nor Alchemist will claim it, and since the Sorcerer can’t kill Cult or Unseen members with Magic Missile then they’ll essentially assume it’s a Possessor game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One strategy I’m fond of as possessor is to pretend to be the Inquisitor and claim a few early kills with Puppet Strings as Ruthless Efficiency (apologising for any mistakes during the Day phase, of course), then claim you were attacked at night around Day 3/4, and jumping out of your facelifted body the next night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See above. Way too many things can go wrong with this strategy from a Knight/Hunter killing your puppet to somebody finding out you’re Killer/Off and occ immune, and people are far less likely to be hesitant to kill a Neutral claim than a BD claim. It can work, but for most of the times you’re better of claiming a BD class acting town, keeping a good log, and then blending in rather than try the Inquisitor strategy.</p>
<p>I like risky tactics with the Possessor, but the Inq claim tactic makes you extremely vulnerable and doesn’t have a good risk-reward payout as the only thing you’ll convince the court is that it’s a Sorcerer game and the Sorcerer is still at large and will only convince the Unseen/Cult not to kill you instead of the BD when you’re found. Plus, faking Inq/Sorc games is an overdone tactic and people will soon catch on fake Inq claims or execute anyone that outs themselves as Inquisitor after the Sorcerer dies</p>

            <p>Yes this is the kind of plays I would recommend trying. The thing I am trying to drill in is that you need to have that in mind from D1 and not just wing it. These things require set up.</p>
<p>It WILL fail sometimes. But trying to play by ear will fail more.</p>

<p>REMEMBER TO WIPE YOUR DEATHNOTE BEFORE JUMPING. THAT CAN GIVE AWAY THE WHOLE PLOT.</p>
