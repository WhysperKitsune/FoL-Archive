    <description>So i&#39;ve believe it would be a good idea to implement an ability to choose what faction we&#39;re going against. Now the only reason im recommending this is because every game so far i&#39;ve gotten unseen since the game released. Now the catch to this would be that newbies would have to play a specific amount of games before they could choose cult. Anyone else that has been playing for an extended period of time would be able to play it right away. Such as anyone who has been in since the beta. This would effectively made the game more fun for others with the downside that people would know what they&#39;re up against. Also this could help come up with more cult roles since not many exist.</description>

            <p>Except if they choose to sacrifice their cult member for killing power and there’s Paladin claim or two, they know it will be cult game unless they have to convince the Herbalist did this.</p>

            <p>Fully agree with Cbman here, there is a reason you sacrifice Cult for kills. I feel cult is supposed to hide as long as possible while converting, but kill enough so people think it’s Unseen</p>
