    <title>[BUG] Repeated use of the fill option on small segments of a deathnote causes a crash</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-repeated-use-of-the-fill-option-on-small-segments-of-a-deathnote-causes-a-crash/63409</link>
    <description>I was filling each individual letter on the death note I had written to create mad rainbow text, after several uses of fill the game stopped responding and I was forced to close it. Each time this has happened it has been when I was using the yellow color. Seems to be an issue specifically with using fill where the there is very little surface that is &#39;filled&#39;.</description>
