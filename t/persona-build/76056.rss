            <p><strong>Name -</strong> Samuel Blackthorn.<br>
<strong>Species -</strong> Human.<br>
<strong>Strengths -</strong> He is an agile person, as agile as an elf, with the intelligence of a Dwarf. He knows how to wield weapons, studying them for years.<br>
<strong>Weaknesses -</strong> He isn’t very strong, and tires easily. He is sick, relying on a poison to survive, and that’s saps his strength.<br>
<strong>Personality -</strong> He is pretty moderate, hiding his emotions like a shell. However, he feels like no one would like him if they knew the truth, and that scares him.<br>
<strong>Description -</strong> He wears a black jacket and jeans, always looking brand new. He has dark hair that falls into his eyes, silver eyes. He has pale skin.</p>
