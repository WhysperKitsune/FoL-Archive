    <description># THIS IS THE GAME THREAD HI HI HI HIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

# Game Mechanics

- The game is largely based around friendship and puzzle solving.
- To win, players have to graduate. The first person to graduate will be declared the Valedictorian, A.K.A. the best of the best. All players win as long as they do not fail out of school or other factors prevent them from graduating. To graduate, you have to complete your final puzzle.
- Alternate wincons are possible
- Each day there will be 1 class. You will be automatically sent to your class, unless you specifically note not to, or are prevented. You will be given homework at the end of each class meant to be turned in at the beginning of the next one. It is possible for class to be canceled for any reason.
- Grades are power in Happy Puzzle University. Many different benefits and setbacks are given to students based on their grades. Grades are based on attendance, homework completion and accuracy, and test / quiz scores. No, you don’t get an exact system, I grade how I feel like it.

- Outside of classes, there will be campus life. You are free to explore all of campus, except for that one building! You know the one! Don’t try it!!!!! You can improve your social standing, form
study groups, or find various things that can help you improve your acceleration towards graduation, hinder others, or various other things. There’s plenty of mystery surrounding the campus, so feel free to try to figure out the various puzzles of life.

- Stealing will have a base 50% chance of working, with a 50% chance of a successful steal going unnoticed. This can be altered by stats. Any attempt to steal homework will always be noticed.

- To whisper, create a PM with you, your recipient, and me.

- Activity is expected. This is still very much a freeform misc / puzzle game, so expect an amount of activity similar to VLDR. I will replace you out if I feel like it. You have been warned. If you complain after, I will call you cringe.


# Energy
- Each player will have a maximum amount of energy as determined by their stats. 30 is the minimum energy level

- To go to your classes, dorms, and the cafeteria, you do not need energy. 
- To go to a building costs 1 energy, and to move within a building costs another 1 energy. All other actions will have an energy cost determined by the host.
- Maximum energy will be replenished for a full night’s sleep in your dorm, + an extra 10 energy if you stay in there for the duration of the night phase. You may leave your dorm during the night phase, but all energy points used at night will be deducted from your energy points the next day, including a -5 penalty for being tired.
- There will be a -5 energy penalty if you do not eat at the cafeteria at least once per day.
- Homework can be completed at night at no penalty

# Rolecards

- Your rolecard will have your major, and your stats. Abilities could possibly be gained later. All actions will be done in your rolecard. In the format 
&gt; **/Action** [Energy Level After Action / Max Energy Level]
- Additionally, each player will have a backpack, with 5 public slots and 1 private slot.

            <p>btw I openwolfed bc I thought that claiming Mastermind would be more credible than claiming Innocent which didn’t really work out because at the same time I thought MM execution would count as a mistrial which it didn’t and that was unfortunate<br>
