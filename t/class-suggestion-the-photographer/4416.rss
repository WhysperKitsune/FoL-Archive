            <p>It might break the role entirely but I feel there is a difference way you could use this mechanic. For example:</p>
<p>Blackmail:</p>
<p>“Show someone a photo of them. You can anonymously whisper to them as long as you have the picture. You may disclose the picture on the same day you blackmail someone with it.”</p>
<p>It would need to have a different goal than the one I gave earlier.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean it o_o Like it would be too OP I think… <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> I just thought about that what I writed up. That you have a photo in which possesor went to someone and possesed him and you can decide, wheter disclosure it or make a deal with him <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit 1: Or you know what? You are actually right. I messed it up. In my way he won’t can longer frame BD but in your way he can.</p>

            <p>I guess it works either way. I just like the idea of being able to get people accused for something that someone else did.</p>
<p>Example: You take a photo of the sheriff. The person the sheriff visits is possessed. You post the photo that makes him look like the Possessor and get him executed.</p>

<p>Night Ability: Captured moment<br>
Choose a player to which you’ll go and took a photo <strong>in which are informations about what happened at this room.</strong><br>
That means you would see for example:<br>
Person A went to Person B and guarded/killed/healed/poisoned/investigated etc. You would actaully know everything what happened “at this room” - Means that if Person B went to Person C, but Person A reaped Person B<br>
soul in photo you will see/it will write that&gt; Person A reaped Person B<br>
soul. Is it enought clear? xD</p>

<p>That’s a nice idea! I think I’m gonna do it like you say… But then taking photos would be kinda usefull since you would reveal them only when your victim choose 3rd option…</p>
