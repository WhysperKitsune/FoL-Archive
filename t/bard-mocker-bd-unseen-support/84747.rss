<p>can we get an f for scorned</p>
<p>if its an unseen game without a scorned(which are both requirements met often) this will often not see a use<br>
I dont think its too theoretical that this would spawn in a game with only fool as framer or somethin and consistently be nigh impossible to use<br>
and also it makes scorned a real pain since even if you get your frames right it might just hippity hippoity say no</p>
<p>also im not sure how much it matters but this’ toolkit is all over the place(healing, vote manip and anti-frame)</p>
<p>also what kat said about confirmability</p>
<p>this class feels like a mix of ideas made it into a class but I dont think this would be fun to play as<br>
change as you want(your the designer) but id probably try and circumvent the confirmability and make a more effective night ability</p>

            <p>well tbh I’m expecting open claims to end when people realize that whisper meta can be a thing again</p>
<p>But I do see the point about inspire and that will likely be added with another night ability and/or changed completely.</p>

<p>makes this class basically unviable to fakeclaim as as its super confirmable</p>
<p>for the convert this would also be really strong prob which isnt inherently bad</p>
<p>i think the ability is interesting but will prob turn into noble forcevote where, despite it being strong lategame, it will be used primarily as a mechconfirm – even moreso likely here as this class doesnt have much confirmability to it outside of this ability</p>

<p>honestly? kinda useless</p>
<p>i think an ability to let people bypass frames isn’t a bad one but it being</p>

<li>the primary night ability</li>
<li>the <strong>only</strong> night ability</li>

<p>makes this class just boring to play (it worked on old CW because old CW empower had like 8 effects)</p>

<p>i don’t dislike this</p>
<p>would invests still get results, since its a fake occ?</p>
<hr>
<p>overall this class feels like it’d be really boring</p>
<p>the night ability is absurdly boring to use and useless in a large portion of games (frames are <em>not</em> that common, especially in unseen games)</p>
<p>the day ability to heal bleeds has no counterplay to it and the other day ability is likely to turn out to be a mechconfirm magnet (might end up being like mystic where it just tries to get kinged, especially in unseen games where the “cannot be silenced” passive is actually <em>good</em>)</p>
<p>needs some work imo</p>
