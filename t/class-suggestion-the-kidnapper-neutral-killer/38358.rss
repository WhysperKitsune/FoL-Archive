**Refer to this post until I can incorporate the adjusted information here (they&#39;re mostly the same):**
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-kidnapper-neutral-offensive/38276

Idea: Add a &quot;Cannot speak or vote for 1 day and night&quot; rule to Show Mercy to really double down on the &quot;why did you survive a kidnapping&quot; angle.

Idea: Add an effect similar to Mastermind&#39;s In The Shadows passive to Slippery. Allows Kidnapper to play in a more stealthy fashion which is in-line with his concept.

Idea: Remove Hogtie and have Kidnap upgrade on Night 3 or 4 to bypass all night immunity.</description>

            <p>Hi Maximus,<br>
I’ve been thinking a bit about this class but I just haven’t had the chance to update this page properly.<br>
One idea I’ve been messing with is a completely different approach to the occupation game that takes ideas from Sorc and sets the Kidnapper further apart from Reaper.<br>
Rather than having a day ability to bypass occupy immunity, beginning on night 3 or 4 Kidnap is upgraded to be able to bypass night immunity, including on the King. This combined with the possibility of an In The Shadows-like passive makes the Kidnapper a much more stealth-oriented NK that becomes more powerful the longer he’s left alive (going so far as to kill death immunes), while still retaining the weakness of the delayed/interruptable kill.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a sound idea, but its implementing it. I don’t think Neutral needs another killing role, I know the post will be worked on in the future which is why there’s so many questions about it. The role would need a counter measure to it so it isn’t overpowered, like with Sorc and Inq. But overall it seems like a good class idea, just needs further development.</p>

            <p>Occupy immunity is bypassed by Hogtie. As the class is reliant on being able to first occupy before killing, it’s important to have multiple charges. Once the player is kidnapped, they’re essentially taken out of the game (similar to reap) before being killed the next night unless it’s prevented.</p>

            <p>Nuclear, why would they normally what?<br>
Noble, I also think the Offensive variant is more interesting, but I started getting ideas about Killer application and figured I may as well do another mock-up. The more perspectives the classes as a whole and their individual abilities are seen from, the better.</p>
