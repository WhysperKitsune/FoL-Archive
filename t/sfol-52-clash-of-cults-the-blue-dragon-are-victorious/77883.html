          <p><em>Peace is always fleeting</em>.</p>
<p>Adiart had known a good many moons of relative stability, since the Black Rose Face-off that brought all the Unseen into Exile. After the Mastermind was beheaded, the Cult became more docile picking up more normal lives, living between the regular townsfolk becoming more akin to them. They win major points that way under the regime of the Blue Dragon. They were not so different after all. Only minor disagreements about the intricacies of lynching or ritualistic blood sacrifice. Potato, Potato.</p>
<p>Even the Neutrals no longer had much beef left. The Fool became sane under the new scarcity of lynches feeling solace into the sweet embrace of death suiciding. The Sellsword became enchanted with the devotion of the Mercenary, after which they made a contract of their own avowing themselves into matrimony and consequently going on honeymoon. This didn’t sit well with the Scorned, who made it their mission to see their happiness ruined. The Inquisitor can’t handle the sheer Heatheny up in here and just yeetted themselves away for this match after killing the Warlock, because they are hella petty and they openly claimed it. The Neutral Killers had a massive showdown that resulted in their mutual demise. The Alchemist committed suicide after all evils had gone soft and they could no longer be near the agony of patients in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>All was well in Adiart until this one fateful night.</p>
<p><em>The Mystic was twisting and turning. Hot flashes burned through their skull. Screams, conflict, an argument. They could faintly make out a table… no an altar because of twin torches lit atop of it. Two hooded personas were circling it. A distinct metallic odor, the smell of blood, crept up. “How cou”, "Traitor, “You brought”. A hard thud deafened the Mystic’s hearing and their vision faded to black.</em></p>
<p><em>After coming to, they noticed more hooded figures entering the small decrepit area, among which a strong maternal energy. The Devout took off their hood revealing many scars, reached over for a small note lying near the carnage and with their face hardening read the jotting. With trembling hands they crumbled the note holding aback tears. The hooded figures started emotionally roaring. This meant war.</em></p>

The Note</summary>

</details>
<p><em>The Mystic awoke in a cold sweat. They must warn the King and Kingdom of what they had seen. In the middle of the night they climbed step after step of the longwinding stairs seeing thunderous rainstorms through the circular windows. They reached the Royal Quarters and stormed past the guards straight into the throne room. It was vacant. While panting they surveyed the area and in the distance heard a wailing woman and crying. Was this the destined night?</em></p>
<p><em>The Mystic made their way over to the noises that suddenly had gone quiet and they barge into the Queen’s private Chambers. There was blood everywhere. The Queen palely laid out in the bed completely out of sorts and not moving. Their eyes were hemorrhaging. The King held a small still baby in their arms. They hadn’t opened their eyes and did not seem like they were going to. What calamity had happened here? The King slowly rose and said in a low otherworldly tone: “Gather the Court!”</em></p>
