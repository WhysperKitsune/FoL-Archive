</aside>
<p>Yeah, the fact that more 2/3rds of the classes in the game have night confirmability, is the reason that the 1/3rd are auto execute. Try being an assasain or MM, CL or NK and claim… well anything within the realm of classes you can claim that a not asleep at the wheel BD won’t either auto exec, or call out a contradiction the moment you give your logs publicly.</p>
<p>The issue is so few classes aren’t confirmable… leading to the very tiny handful that are, getting auto executed (because 50/50 shots are in BD’s favor generally, and when you rule out the butler, drunk, mystic, king, noble, observer, prince, hunter, merc, and focus on what’s left… you’ve generally got 60-70% chances of catching evils in what is left. The reason for that is too few classes that aren’t confirm-able, not too many.</p>

            <p>That is your opinion, my opinion is different. Try to play with CW claim at least once.</p>

            <p>We want to limit them and make it as hard as possible. Right now CW is a fairly good fake claim and it needs to stay that way.</p>
