    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Entwined (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-entwined-neutral-killer/51029</link>
    <description>This is a &quot;different&quot; Neutral Killer that Vulgard, Memesky, cbman, Gregreat, and I created on the ToL discord.

This has a unique feature where two people play as the NK; one being the Support version and one being the Killer version. Let&#39;s get into it.

(Yes these are dependencies, but for a good reason)

The Entwined [color=gray]Neutral Killer[/color] 
Unique :shield:
Convert Immune 
Cooperation Class (Two people are Entwined; One is Entwined [Support] and the other is Entwined [Killer].)

**[color=purple]Nightmare[/color]** (Aka Entwined Killer)

**Passive: [color=darkred]Fear Factor[/color]** - Your power is determined by your Fear Factor. As long as your Fear Factor is 1 or higher, you are night immune. As long as it is 4 or higher, your attacks bypass immunity. As long as it is 7 or higher, your attacks cannot be prevented by any means and your immunity cannot be bypassed. Your starting Fear Factor is 1.

**Passive 2: [color=purple]Spellbound[/color]** - The two players function together. If the sub dies, the main is independent. If the main dies, the sub suicides. They also share a night chat. You will appear to be &quot;Entwined&quot; when killed.

**Day Ability: [color=purple]Hush[/color]** - Prevent a player from speaking today. If they are executed, add 1 to your Fear Factor. (2 uses)

**Night Ability 1: [color=darkred]Reave[/color]** - Attack a player. If the attack successfully kills that player, add 1 to your Fear Factor. (Infinite Uses)

**Night Ability 2: [color=darkred]Ether Switch[/color]** - You and the other Entwined switch bodies. Only works if the other Entwined uses it on the same night. (Can be used until it has been performed successfully.) 

**[color=darkred]Entity[/color]** (Aka Entwined Support)

**Passive: [color=purple]Reimbue[/color]** - Every time the Killer passes a Fear Factor threshold, all your abilities recharge. This upgrades Phantasmal Lethality, and will continue to upgrade PL.

**Passive 2: [color=purple]Spellbound[/color]** - The two players function together. If the sub dies, the main is independent. If the main dies, the sub suicides. They also share a night chat. You will appear to be &quot;Entwined&quot; when killed.

**Day Ability 1: [color=purple]Mind Twist[/color]** - Choose a player’s mind to ravage. Tonight, if they visit either Entwined, they will die and the Killer will add 1 to their Fear Factor. (2 uses)

**Day Ability 2: [color=purple]Phantasmal Lethality[/color]** - The Killer Entwined will be Occupation and Redirection immune for the night. (3 uses) | After 7 Fear, Phantasmal Lethality makes the Killer&#39;s Target kill who they were Targetting with a non-piercing attack. (So Killer targets to kill Butler, who targets Princess. Support uses PL, and Butler now attacks the Princess.)

**Night Ability 1: [color=darkred]Ether Switch[/color]** - You and the other Entwined switch bodies. Only works if the other Entwined uses it on the same night. (Can be used until it has been performed successfully.) 

**Night Ability 2: [color=darkred]Unleash[/color]** - The other Entwined may target two players with Reave tonight, and they will add 1 to their Fear Factor for each successful kill. (1 use)

Goal: Must kill all of the members of the main factions to win. (Entwined Support still wins if Entwined Killer wins)

**Changelog**

- Changed names from Entwined [Killer] and Entwined [Support] to Nightmare and Entity.
- Changed Entity to Entangled, and updated Spellbound Passive(s).
- Added Maximum level of PL and changed Entangled back to Entity.
- Changed thresholds so Nightmare starts with night immunity, and removed the Empower part of PL.

            <p>Mind if I just say to everyone who doesn’t know that this class has been designed live on the ToL Discord in general chat, someone threw the idea “what if there was an NK played by two people” and we just went along with it</p>

</aside>
<p>I liked Entity better, and I think Vulgard did as well. Entangled doesn’t sound good. They should be two beings tied together rather than one class named after a word that’s a synonym to the bond they share. Entity is a lot better, and it’s reminiscent of a closer bond that a more obscure gamer would understand (reference to another game).</p>
<p>Anyways, Empower would have been made irrelevant if Nightmare is given rightful immunity. Now I’m going to suggest something (but not something outrageous that I already talked to Vulgard about that would turn this class into a Fool hybrid with bug eyes)</p>

            <p>I would think that the support would take the hit for the killer to keep the killer alive, that would probably be the strategy and they could also confirm each other which besides sorc if you have excellent communication no other NK has. Team neutral killers never seen before.</p>

            <p>I made them purple and red because I could, also to give the format a “unique” look.</p>
<p>I was worried about getting killed N1, which is why we have Empower. Entwined[K] gets death immunity once before they reach 3 fear.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we can change the name to be easier. What would we call the two though? Right now we just have Entwined [Killer] and Entwined [Support].</p>

            <p>They’re both supposed to flip Entwined for flavor reasons.</p>
<p>However, Malteser (Chocolate here) already suggested me that the Killer could be named the Nightmare and the Support could be named the Entity. They would both flip Entwined though. It’s something I’m considering</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is a “different” Neutral Killer that Vulgard, Memesky, cbman, Gregreat, and I created on the ToL discord.</p>
<p>This has a unique feature where two people play as the NK; one being the Support version and one being the Killer version. Let’s get into it.</p>
<p>(Yes these are dependencies, but for a good reason)</p>
<p>The Entwined <font color="gray">Neutral Killer</font><br>
Unique <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/shield.png?v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:"><br>
Convert Immune<br>
Cooperation Class (Two people are Entwined; One is Entwined [Support] and the other is Entwined [Killer].)</p>
<p><strong><font color="purple">Nightmare</font></strong> (Aka Entwined Killer)</p>
<p><strong>Passive: <font color="darkred">Fear Factor</font></strong> - Your power is determined by your Fear Factor. As long as your Fear Factor is 1 or higher, you are night immune. As long as it is 4 or higher, your attacks bypass immunity. As long as it is 7 or higher, your attacks cannot be prevented by any means and your immunity cannot be bypassed. Your starting Fear Factor is 1.</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2: <font color="purple">Spellbound</font></strong> - The two players function together. If the sub dies, the main is independent. If the main dies, the sub suicides. They also share a night chat. You will appear to be “Entwined” when killed.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability: <font color="purple">Hush</font></strong> - Prevent a player from speaking today. If they are executed, add 1 to your Fear Factor. (2 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: <font color="darkred">Reave</font></strong> - Attack a player. If the attack successfully kills that player, add 1 to your Fear Factor. (Infinite Uses)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2: <font color="darkred">Ether Switch</font></strong> - You and the other Entwined switch bodies. Only works if the other Entwined uses it on the same night. (Can be used until it has been performed successfully.)</p>
<p><strong><font color="darkred">Entity</font></strong> (Aka Entwined Support)</p>
<p><strong>Passive: <font color="purple">Reimbue</font></strong> - Every time the Killer passes a Fear Factor threshold, all your abilities recharge. This upgrades Phantasmal Lethality, and will continue to upgrade PL.</p>
<p><strong>Passive 2: <font color="purple">Spellbound</font></strong> - The two players function together. If the sub dies, the main is independent. If the main dies, the sub suicides. They also share a night chat. You will appear to be “Entwined” when killed.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: <font color="purple">Mind Twist</font></strong> - Choose a player’s mind to ravage. Tonight, if they visit either Entwined, they will die and the Killer will add 1 to their Fear Factor. (2 uses)</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 2: <font color="purple">Phantasmal Lethality</font></strong> - The Killer Entwined will be Occupation and Redirection immune for the night. (3 uses) | After 7 Fear, Phantasmal Lethality makes the Killer’s Target kill who they were Targetting with a non-piercing attack. (So Killer targets to kill Butler, who targets Princess. Support uses PL, and Butler now attacks the Princess.)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: <font color="darkred">Ether Switch</font></strong> - You and the other Entwined switch bodies. Only works if the other Entwined uses it on the same night. (Can be used until it has been performed successfully.)</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 2: <font color="darkred">Unleash</font></strong> - The other Entwined may target two players with Reave tonight, and they will add 1 to their Fear Factor for each successful kill. (1 use)</p>
<p>Goal: Must kill all of the members of the main factions to win. (Entwined Support still wins if Entwined Killer wins)</p>
<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed names from Entwined [Killer] and Entwined [Support] to Nightmare and Entity.</li>
<li>Changed Entity to Entangled, and updated Spellbound Passive(s).</li>
<li>Added Maximum level of PL and changed Entangled back to Entity.</li>
<li>Changed thresholds so Nightmare starts with night immunity, and removed the Empower part of PL.</li>
</ul>
<p>–Ideas/Questions–</p>
<p>None Right Now.</p>
