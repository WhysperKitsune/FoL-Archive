    <title>Reaper &quot;night immune&quot; problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/reaper-night-immune-problem/30264</link>
    <description>For me, the biggest problem with reaper is what happens when he get attacked.
The attacker doesn&#39;t get any message and the reaper just don&#39;t die.
I think the attacker should get a message &quot;your target was immune&quot;, so the reaper will be able to claim night immune classes like merc / alch / inq /guarded by king.

Right now, every attacker knows that the reaper is 100% reaper.</description>

<p>In my experience, if you revealed to them D1, people will generally believe it (evils are unlikely to want to fake being a merc with a specific target D1, since it puts them in danger of getting called out when their “target” dies and they’re unable to offer a contract to anyone.)</p>

            <p>All the night immune classes have claim problems:</p>
<p>-merc: no one can say they are your target<br>
-alchemist: you can’t heal to prove, and might get executed anyways<br>
-guarded by king: king can just say he didn’t</p>

            <p>No. The message you get for hitting reaper is the same as if you hit a phys target which is far more likely than being guarded by king. And claiming Alch in response to that will get you killed anyway.</p>
