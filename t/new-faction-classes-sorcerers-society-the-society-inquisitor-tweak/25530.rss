    <title>[New Faction &amp; Classes] Sorcerer&#39;s Society! (The Society) + Inquisitor tweak</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-faction-classes-sorcerers-society-the-society-inquisitor-tweak/25530</link>
    <description>Problem:
People have a lot of complaints about the Sorcer/Inquisitor thing. Personally, I don&#39;t mind them - but I&#39;m all for working out some solutions.

Announcing...

**THE SOCIETY**

_&quot;Okay guys, this is a Soc round!&quot;_

Like Cult and Unseen, the Society is a group of baddies with conversion capabilities. There can only be one group per match. This means either Unseen OR Cult OR Society.

I would like the Society to have a limit of 4 members, however if this is seen as OP, a limit of 3 is of course reasonable.

_This faction is designed to be confusing._ Unseen and Cult have their own special flavors. Society rounds will be more geared toward &quot;advanced deduction&quot;.

The Society spawns with a **Sorcerer** and a **Herald**. From that point forward, any Blue Dragon who is converted becomes a **Pupil**, and any Neutral who is converted becomes a **Doomsayer**.

**Lore:**

The Society is a group of magic-users who believe the world belongs to those powerful enough to take it - through magical power. The Sorcerer is the &quot;teacher&quot;, and those who are indoctrinated are the &quot;students&quot;, in a manner of speaking.

-----

**Society-Related Classes:**

**Inquisitor** - Remains mostly the same, but is now folded into the Blue Dragon faction as the Sheriff/Paladin for Society rounds. _All Society members show as magic users and can be killed by the Inquisitor._ Similarly, there is no need for Cult to show as magic users, as Inquisitor will only be appearing in Society rounds, not Cult rounds.

Alternately, if the devs definitely do not want Inquisitor as a Blue Dragon, his goal can simply be to see the Society lose, even if he&#39;s killed.

We are also taking away &quot;Holy Blessing&quot;, the passive ability that makes Inquisitor immune from one attack. Why? **Read to the end to find out...**

-----

**Sorcerer** - Has one change to its Day Ability, and is now part of the Society faction.

Passive:
**Mage Armor** - Immune to Death and Occupy at Night.

Day Ability: **(NEW)**
**Corrupted Mind** - Indoctrinate a player into the Society. Usual conversion immune classes cannot be converted. (Infinite use, but limit on number of Society members applies. 1 night cool down after use.)

Night Ability 1:
**Magic Missile** - Fire a magic missile at a player, killing them. (Infinite use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Circle of Death** - Everyone visiting target player will die. (Unavailable before night 5, 3 uses.)

-----

**New Classes:**



Class 1: **Herald**

Lore: The Sorcerer&#39;s favorite student, you are tasked with secretly spreading the Society&#39;s message, and bringing in new followers.

Note: The Sorcerer and Herald will spawn together in all Society games.

Passive:
**Student Becomes Teacher** - If the Sorcerer dies, you will take their place.

Day Ability:
**Magic Dust** - All players appear to be a magic user to The Inquisitor tonight. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Sing Praises** - The Sorcerer&#39;s attempt at conversion cannot be blocked tonight (2 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Mark of the Mage** - Cause the Sorcerer&#39;s murder victim to be revealed as Sorcerer the next day. (singe use.)

-----

Class 2: **Pupil**

Passive:
**Studied Texts** - If the Herald is killed or becomes Sorcerer, you will become the new Herald. (Whether you or another Society member are promoted depends on when you were converted, etc.)

Day Ability:
**Faulty Spell** - Cast a spell on a target player, causing a random daytime effect. (4 uses.)
Low chance of: Poison, Bleeding
Medium chance of: Icy Touch, Trollbox
High chance of: Distract

Night Ability 1:
**Circle of Confusion** - Cause a player to target themselves if they use an action that night. (3 uses. Of course this DOES NOT include obviously broken things like Prince&#39;s execution.)

Night Ability 2:
**Malodorous Potion** - Concoct an amateurish potion for a player, giving them immunity from murder while simultaneously removing occupation immunity for the night and occupying them. (2 uses.)

_^ Use this to protect your fellow Society members, an Evil King, or any player you think may be beneficial to you at the cost of blocking them -- OR -- use it to occupy an enemy with the cost of making them immune from death that night. Double-edged sword in both cases._

-----

Class 3: **Doomsayer**

Passive 1:
**Forbidden Tome** - If the Sorcerer and Herald are killed, you will become the Sorcerer. (Whether you or another Society member are promoted depends on when you were converted, etc.)

Passive 2:
**Gnarled Finger** - If you are executed by vote, a random guilty voter will appear as a magic user (to the Inquisitor) and a member of the Society (to the King) for the remainder of the round. (Name explanation: The icon would be a finger pointing accusingly, as if the Doomsayer is pointing to someone and going: &quot;You, my brother, how could you execute me?&quot; to frame them. XD)

Day Ability:
**Puzzle Box** - The player you select will see others&#39; messages as gibberish for the next 8 seconds. (3 uses.)

_^ Everyone else is speaking normally, but the target sees them saying stuff like: &quot;Bargle dongle diddle pliff!!&quot; - Could use code from word censor to simply shuffle around some letters... Extra points if the icon for this ability is Lemarchand&#39;s box from Hellraiser._

Night Ability:
**Misfortune Teller** - Correctly predict who will be executed the next day, and all members of the Society will be murder and occupy immune the following night. (3 uses.)

-----

**But wait... here&#39;s the twist!**

I held this for last, and I think it&#39;s a pretty great buff to Inquisitor, so I hope you don&#39;t blame me for keeping the secret...

_The Inquisitor&#39;s new PASSIVE ability!_

**Head of the Snake** - If you kill the Sorcerer at night, no Society member may be promoted to Sorcerer or Herald on the following night!</description>

            <p>In patch 0.8.5 occupy immunity was changed to count ability’s that change your target as an occupy</p>
<p>That means occupy immune people are also immune to: Debauch, Strings of Mithras, Tornado and Teleport.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the change is not something I know off the top of my head.</p>

            <p>Agreed with <a class="mention" href="/u/lily">@Lily</a><br>
But I still like the idea of preventing a promotion for a while. How about the following one night instead of two?<br>
And also, shouldn’t there be a one day cooldown in between the conversion for the Sorcerer?<br>
Also, I feel like Icy Touch should be part of a Low Chance Faulty Spell as that is pretty powerful on its own in the right situations too.</p>
<p>But overall, this idea is fascinating.</p>

            <p>Problem:<br>
People have a lot of complaints about the Sorcer/Inquisitor thing. Personally, I don’t mind them - but I’m all for working out some solutions.</p>
<p>Announcing…</p>
<p><strong>THE SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p><em>“Okay guys, this is a Soc round!”</em></p>
<p>Like Cult and Unseen, the Society is a group of baddies with conversion capabilities. There can only be one group per match. This means either Unseen OR Cult OR Society.</p>
<p>I would like the Society to have a limit of 4 members, however if this is seen as OP, a limit of 3 is of course reasonable.</p>
<p><em>This faction is designed to be confusing.</em> Unseen and Cult have their own special flavors. Society rounds will be more geared toward “advanced deduction”.</p>
<p>The Society spawns with a <strong>Sorcerer</strong> and a <strong>Herald</strong>. From that point forward, any Blue Dragon who is converted becomes a <strong>Pupil</strong>, and any Neutral who is converted becomes a <strong>Doomsayer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lore:</strong></p>
<p>The Society is a group of magic-users who believe the world belongs to those powerful enough to take it - through magical power. The Sorcerer is the “teacher”, and those who are indoctrinated are the “students”, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Society-Related Classes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong> - Remains mostly the same, but is now folded into the Blue Dragon faction as the Sheriff/Paladin for Society rounds. <em>All Society members show as magic users and can be killed by the Inquisitor.</em> Similarly, there is no need for Cult to show as magic users, as Inquisitor will only be appearing in Society rounds, not Cult rounds.</p>
<p>Alternately, if the devs definitely do not want Inquisitor as a Blue Dragon, his goal can simply be to see the Society lose, even if he’s killed.</p>
<p>We are also taking away “Holy Blessing”, the passive ability that makes Inquisitor immune from one attack. Why? <strong>Read to the end to find out…</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong> - Has one change to its Day Ability, and is now part of the Society faction.</p>
<p>Passive:<br>
<strong>Mage Armor</strong> - Immune to Death and Occupy at Night.</p>
<p>Day Ability: <strong>(NEW)</strong><br>
<strong>Corrupted Mind</strong> - Indoctrinate a player into the Society. Usual conversion immune classes cannot be converted. (Infinite use, but limit on number of Society members applies. 1 night cool down after use.)</p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
<strong>Magic Missile</strong> - Fire a magic missile at a player, killing them. (Infinite use.)</p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
<strong>Circle of Death</strong> - Everyone visiting target player will die. (Unavailable before night 5, 3 uses.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>New Classes:</strong></p>
<p>Class 1: <strong>Herald</strong></p>
<p>Lore: The Sorcerer’s favorite student, you are tasked with secretly spreading the Society’s message, and bringing in new followers.</p>
<p>Note: The Sorcerer and Herald will spawn together in all Society games.</p>
<p>Passive:<br>
<strong>Student Becomes Teacher</strong> - If the Sorcerer dies, you will take their place.</p>
<p>Day Ability:<br>
<strong>Magic Dust</strong> - All players appear to be a magic user to The Inquisitor tonight. (3 uses.)</p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
<strong>Sing Praises</strong> - The Sorcerer’s attempt at conversion cannot be blocked tonight (2 uses.)</p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
<strong>Mark of the Mage</strong> - Cause the Sorcerer’s murder victim to be revealed as Sorcerer the next day. (singe use.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Class 2: <strong>Pupil</strong></p>
<p>Passive:<br>
<strong>Studied Texts</strong> - If the Herald is killed or becomes Sorcerer, you will become the new Herald. (Whether you or another Society member are promoted depends on when you were converted, etc.)</p>
<p>Day Ability:<br>
<strong>Faulty Spell</strong> - Cast a spell on a target player, causing a random daytime effect. (4 uses.)<br>
Low chance of: Poison, Bleeding<br>
Medium chance of: Icy Touch, Trollbox<br>
High chance of: Distract</p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
<strong>Circle of Confusion</strong> - Cause a player to target themselves if they use an action that night. (3 uses. Of course this DOES NOT include obviously broken things like Prince’s execution.)</p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
<strong>Malodorous Potion</strong> - Concoct an amateurish potion for a player, giving them immunity from murder while simultaneously removing occupation immunity for the night and occupying them. (2 uses.)</p>
<p><em>^ Use this to protect your fellow Society members, an Evil King, or any player you think may be beneficial to you at the cost of blocking them – OR – use it to occupy an enemy with the cost of making them immune from death that night. Double-edged sword in both cases.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Class 3: <strong>Doomsayer</strong></p>
<p>Passive 1:<br>
<strong>Forbidden Tome</strong> - If the Sorcerer and Herald are killed, you will become the Sorcerer. (Whether you or another Society member are promoted depends on when you were converted, etc.)</p>
<p>Passive 2:<br>
<strong>Gnarled Finger</strong> - If you are executed by vote, a random guilty voter will appear as a magic user (to the Inquisitor) and a member of the Society (to the King) for the remainder of the round. (Name explanation: The icon would be a finger pointing accusingly, as if the Doomsayer is pointing to someone and going: “You, my brother, how could you execute me?” to frame them. XD)</p>
<p>Day Ability:<br>
<strong>Puzzle Box</strong> - The player you select will see others’ messages as gibberish for the next 8 seconds. (3 uses.)</p>
<p><em>^ Everyone else is speaking normally, but the target sees them saying stuff like: “Bargle dongle diddle pliff!!” - Could use code from word censor to simply shuffle around some letters… Extra points if the icon for this ability is Lemarchand’s box from Hellraiser.</em></p>
<p>Night Ability:<br>
<strong>Misfortune Teller</strong> - Correctly predict who will be executed the next day, and all members of the Society will be murder and occupy immune the following night. (3 uses.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>But wait… here’s the twist!</strong></p>
<p>I held this for last, and I think it’s a pretty great buff to Inquisitor, so I hope you don’t blame me for keeping the secret…</p>
<p><em>The Inquisitor’s new PASSIVE ability!</em></p>
<p><strong>Head of the Snake</strong> - If you kill the Sorcerer at night, no Society member may be promoted to Sorcerer or Herald on the following night!</p>
