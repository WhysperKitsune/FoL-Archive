    <title>Why BD Should Kill All D1 Alch Claims</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/why-bd-should-kill-all-d1-alch-claims/62060</link>
    <description>I see people often making the criticism that D1 Alch claims have no downside and want some kind of nerf to stop them doing it. They are, after all, provable relatively quickly and long term might assist BD investigative efforts.

There is a factor behind the D1 Alch claim that is a double edged sword, and that is how the Unseen/Cult/NK treat you. It is beneficial for the Alch to claim D1 to lessen the likelihood that evil killing classes target them. **However;** when you do this, you _increase_ the likelihood of these classes targeting BD when they attempt to convert/kill. A day that could have been wasted on you via stoneskin or by virtue of you being unconvertible has almost no chance of happening after you claim.

&quot;Alch claim&quot; on D1 always reads to me as &quot;unseen/cult please leave me alone until my vote is needed&quot;. It&#39;s an open and subtle pledge of allegiance thinly veiled as a way of helping BD. Alchs can be of benefit via healing without claiming D1, and so the justification of &quot;I can heal&quot; is a moot defense.

The only way this kind of behavior that Alchs are demonstrating will change is if BD&#39;s attitude to alchs change. They are _not_ your allies. You should not treat them as such. They must prove their worth if they are to keep their lives. Open claiming D1 tells me they aren&#39;t interested in being of any use.</description>

            <p>also looking at it myself and I also have to say.</p>
<p>Yes 100% obvious that an alc that does not claim and soaks up an attack or conversion attack is better for BD than an alc that announces without request.</p>
<p>That being said what isn’t demonstrated is the risk value of losses between no alchemist, vs claimed alchemist.</p>
<p>The good of an outed alchemist</p>
<p>He’s very unlikely to yolo bomb, and very likely to bomb if instructed by a majority of BD, or a probably BD authority figure.</p>
<p>He’s also very likely to cure any poisons/bleeds, and save bds with healings.</p>
<p>The bad -<br>
he’s a wild card when the numbers are even.</p>

            <p>(This topic was on May 10th but I still want to nudge my opinion in)</p>
<p>I mean, I can see where you are going with this. Alchemists don’t have to side with you, and most Alchemists tend to side NK of a low win rate or Unseen/Cult because they don’t want to be killed at night.</p>
<p>But then again, you can’t always kill off Alchemist claims from D1. Don’t get me wrong, most of the court will just call you an idiot or salty if you try to push on an Alchemist, it’s like democratic immunity.</p>
<p>And of course killing off one of the healers will have drawbacks, like if both Physicians are dead then CL/Assassin can poison or bleed with no worries. Alchemists don’t need to heal you, but they actually have to. Simply because they don’t want to be seen as lying and voted up for execution, or axed by the Prince. (Or attacked by evils believed to be a BD in hiding).</p>
<p>So there are times you can force the Alchemist on your side, even if they don’t wish to. Just don’t give them the option of betrayal, like a super majority with the BD or simply the Prince existing is good enough.</p>
<p>And yeah, D1 claims of an Alchemist makes them say “I’m not going to help either side”. So they wont help the BD either, which makes them a threat to you. I support this either way, but don’t actively hunt them all down unless you can afford it.</p>

            <p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t alch have a huge win rate anyway? It also doesn’t make him an auto execute since he’s still a healer.</p>

            <p>Not to burst your bubble.</p>
<p>That will make alch wins rate DROP HUGELY.</p>
<p>Since alch is convertible and isn’t a Bd there is no reason to keep them alive.</p>

            <p>I think the easiest fix is to make the alch convertible. Part of what makes alch so strong is if they do stick with bd, they are immune to conversion and have the ability to be immune to death. If an alch seems particularly bd, you can convert them. We can even tie some strong abilities to converted alch to make executing an alch even more enticing by denying that option from unseen.</p>

            <p>Alch claims work relatively well long term as a scum claim for the above reasoning. If claiming X class is fakeable and less likely to be exed, there is every reason for scum to also use it.</p>
<p>Even more fun when you play kings bitch as assassin claiming alch, gives you an opportunity to read whether he is actually evil and on your side or not.</p>

<p>In spite of this I have had times where I would kill an Alch as evil to remove a healer in order to get access to poison.</p>

</aside>
<p>Resources they no longer have the chance to waste on accident as the alch has so helpfully open claimed.</p>
<p>I kill alchs as unseen/cult when they demonstrate a dedication to forwarding BD’s interests. If they’re inactive voters, not healing unless ordered to under punishment of death, I keep em to speed up majority.</p>

<p>Most alchs don’t do this. They claim and they sit there. Alchs can prove their worth and help BD <em>without</em> claiming D1.</p>

</aside>
<p>You don’t need the Alch to do anything besides claim to network. You can just whisper the Alch yourself to get heals or bombs.</p>
