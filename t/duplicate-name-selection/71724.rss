Duplicate names should be prevented.

#### Steps to reproduce:

            <p>It could have been, but I don’t think it was. There was no point in using tricks to get around the rule since both of us entered it at the same time.</p>
<p>There is a slight difference between “I” and “L” in that capital “i” is slightly shorter, but I admit it’s a pretty small difference.</p>
<p>I agree that it’s a small problem, but when I see a whole bunch of chat logs where the name is the same, it’s a bit hard to tell at first glance whether they all came from the same person.</p>

            <p>Second possibility comes to mind… could be an upper case i lower case L issue.</p>
<p>which could be solved by either making the letters more distinct or by making the word filter detect them.</p>
<p>admitted it’s nowhere near the problem that it is in social deduction games that don’t include numbers in chat and post death.</p>
