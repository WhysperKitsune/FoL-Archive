    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Leper</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-leper/42853</link>
    <description>So, we&#39;ve been without a Neutral Offensive class for, forever now. 

I have a proposal, which is somewhat of a merge of Pestilence and Arsonist in ToS, but has different abilities, different playstyles, and a different win effect.

So here is the outcast peasant, the Leper! He has leprosy.

            <p>Add something that he can see who is currently infected? If that is too strong, make it a day ability possibly? At the moment he has nothing that helps his fakeclaiming and he obviously assists scum. I’d prefer an incarnation where Diseased and Infect change to this:</p>
<p><strong>Diseased:</strong><br>
Anyone who visits you will become infected. (The first part of the original passive is also redundant)</p>
<p><strong>Infect:</strong><br>
Occupy target player and infect target player and all players that visit target player this night.</p>
<p>Basically lower the infection spread, but give him more room to fake-claim.</p>
<p>Epidemic should also specify all players <em>alive</em>.</p>
