    <title>[Rework] Court Wizard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rework-court-wizard/54604</link>
    <description>**Court Wizard**, Blue Dragon, Support, Unique

Day Ability: Master&#39;s Apprentice [1 Use] - Declare a player your apprentice, making them immune to conversion. Effect persists until the Court Wizard dies or gets converted. _(Returns a message if a conversion has successfully been blocked)_

Night Ability 1: Brute Force [Unlimited Uses] - Empower your target&#39;s abilities, allowing them to bypass death immunity, occupy immunity and _In the Shadows_. _(Returns a message if an ability has successfully bypassed an immunity)_

Night Ability 2: Tornado [3 Uses] - Cause all players targeting one of your targets to target the other. Does not change occupy immune players&#39; targets. _(unchanged)_

**Sidenote**
The potential strength of the two new abilities call for the Court Wizard to be Unique. This, however, most likely is the price to make him exciting to play. The Sage should probably also receive a day ability to make one Unseen Member permanently immune to being detected (effect also ends once the Sage dies). Ritualist is a different story, since - additionally - Physicians turn into one as well.

I would like to point out that returning an unspecific or no message for a successful use of either ability is detrimental and most likely a part of why Court Wizard currently feels terrible - at least unrewarding - to play.

**Contra**
This is an indirect power reduction of both, the Unseen as well as the Cult, which, considering their winrate, most likely is not just not necessary but counterproductive. The problem with the Unique-Tab is that it reduces the amount of potential clams an Evil Player has (thus this rework can also be considered a nerf to the Neutral Killer), however, the Court Wizards Abilities remain as (un-)provable as they used to be until now. I can see CW become/remain the Evil Faction&#39;s claim-equivalent to the Neutral Killer&#39;s Hunter.

**Pro**
Especially Brute Force emphasizes coordination and game knowledge for Blue Dragon Players. I consider Brute Force the most useful when paired with a Butler in order to occupy a Neutral Killer/Mastermind or when paired with a Knight to kill a Neutral Killer/Mastermind. I would like to highlight that these scenarios, even though they are clearly extremely strong when put at use, are rather rare considering that a CW should make an appearance about as often as a Hunter does and that coordination as well as those exact classes are needed in order to perform them. Randomly using Brute Force - for example on an Assassin or Neutral Killer - will clearly backfire, thus it empathizes cautious and skillful use of the ability.</description>

            <p>Perhaps make it so that the Master’s Apprentice will be converted if you are converted too? Convert limit ignored if unseen, nothing happens if cult reaches 4 members converting the CW</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we need more things that prevent converts lol</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I absolutely agree. In fact, this scenario would probably reduce the amount of conversion immunites, since Court Wizard becomes significantly more rare. (As I suggested, about the same frequency as Hunters)</p>

<p>I want to support this, I just hope it’s not too strong</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see the concerns of you guys, and I share them. I went through a lot of scenarios and imagined where Brute Force could be too strong and - frankly - there are not too many. It is most likely on the same Power Level as the Hunter’s Wolf, just way more situational - since you need a second player you trust to work with you - but also quicker.<br>
As I said, the Evil Faction can also make use of the Court Wizard, by tricking him into empowering them instead. Would you really trust a Knight Claim and empower him since he is claiming he wants to kill the Mastermind, or is he just an Assassin in disguise who is going to go for the Prince that is being guarded by the King?</p>
