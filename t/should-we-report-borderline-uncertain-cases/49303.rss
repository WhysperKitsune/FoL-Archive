    <title>Should we report borderline / uncertain cases?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/should-we-report-borderline-uncertain-cases/49303</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve all seen it.  Someone does something so mind-bogglingly stupid that they [i]must[/i] have been gamethrowing; or they seem to mysteriously know stuff they really really shouldn&#39;t, far too easily and with no obvious way for them to get it.  But they don&#39;t do or say anything that makes it 100% certain; it&#39;s [i]possible[/i], though unlikely, that they were just really that stupid, really inattentive, or really lucky.

Should we report cases like that?  My assumption is that those reports might not be individually useful but that they can help establish a pattern, since all the reports against someone are tracked and catalogued somewhere - so if they have a history of acting trollish in previous games, they might get in trouble even if they avoided tipping their hand too obviously this time.

Or do reports like that just clog up the moderation queue unnecessarily, meaning we should only report unambiguous, clear-cut cases?</description>

            <p>I report anything that is blatant throwing, no exceptions. I don’t always report suspicious wins - I need to have some basis for it, like, d2 MM execute or self-outing your team, something like that.</p>

            <p>I played a game where a Princess claimed Sheriff, outed Assassin day 2 then outed MM day 3.  On day 4 she called somebody else “Unseen” who turned out to be Inquisitor, and used that as proof she got lucky.  I will always wonder if she was cheating or just gamethrowing.</p>

<p>I’d say if and doubt report. Include as many details (IE the day/night that made you suspicious) etc… The mods/dev’s have access to details you don’t, IE say someone happens to find all the unseen back to back… from your perspective you can’t tell if they were lucky or cheating, from a viewpoint of a single game no one can tell if it’s luck or cheating, the dev’s will probably ignore it if it’s just a single game. However the dev’s can see if he’s grouped up with the same person, and gets rediculously lucky every time his friend is on the unseen/cult.</p>
<p>Newbie mistakes also fall into that. Everyone makes mistakes and bad calls. On the other hand if someone blatently keeps doing the same thing, after being clearly informed that it’s destroying his team, the dev’s will at the very least send him a warning saying it won’t be tollerated.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of behaviors that just can’t become clear cut from the perspective of a single game.</p>

            <p>I see no reason not to take action. If somebody appears to be several standard deviations smarter/dumber than what you’ve come to expect, there’s no reason not to let the mods investigate and handle it.</p>
