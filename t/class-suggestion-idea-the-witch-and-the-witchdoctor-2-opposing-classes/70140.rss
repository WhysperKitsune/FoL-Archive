    <title>&gt;Class Suggestion/Idea&lt; The Witch and The Witchdoctor, 2 opposing classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-idea-the-witch-and-the-witchdoctor-2-opposing-classes/70140</link>
    <description>Now, I&#39;ve seen witch and witchdoctor everywhere on these forums, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone make them oppose each other. I&#39;m going to change what opposing classes usually means. Usually, it means a neutral that should side with bd and an nk. Im changing mine to a bd class, and a neutral killer that can win with other evils, (in a way a sorc can).

&gt; # **[color=grey]The Witch[/color]**
&gt; *[color=grey]Neutral Killer[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive &gt;Potion Mastery&lt;** - You have a potion for every condition - including the ones that make you **death, occupation, and redirection** immune.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive &gt;Sense Evil&lt;** - The first time you attempt to kill a evil player, the kill will fail and you will get the message: *&quot;You saw the evil intention in **Player** and did not kill them.&quot;* All whispers from you to that player and from that player to you will be hidden the rest of the game.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability &gt;Brew&lt;** - Brew a potion today. You may choose which potion to brew out of *Heal Potion* and *Occupation Potion*. Usable on d1. _Infinite uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability &gt;Witch&lt;** - Force a player to use their ability on another player of choice. You will attack the Controlled player. If the controlled player is death immune, you will attack the player that you chose to be targeted. _4 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability &gt;Use Potion&lt;** - Use a potion gained from **Brew** out of *Heal Potion* and *Occupation Potion* on a player. _0 of either potion on start. Uses are gained from *Brew*._
&gt;
&gt; Goal: Defeat the [color=blue]Blue Dragon[/color] and all else who may oppose you. You win with [color=purple]Unseen[/color]/[color=darkred]Cult[/color].


&gt;# **[color=blue]The Witchdoctor[/color]**
&gt;[color=blue]*Blue Dragon Support/Investigative/Killer*[/color] (Unconvertable and Unique)
&gt;
&gt;**Passive &gt;Trials and Practices&lt;** - Immune to all abilities from [color=grey]The Witch[/color] besides *heal potion*. This passive will be retained even if your class changes. You will only be present if [color=grey]The Witch[/color] is present in a match.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability &gt;Faith Heal&lt;** - Choose a player. If the player is attempted to be the target of [color=grey]The Witch&#39;s[/color] **control** ability tonight, it will fail. This is true if the player is either the controlled player of the target of the controlled player. _3 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability &gt;Focus for Evil&lt;** - You will see whispers to and from the [color=grey]The Witch[/color] that would otherwise be hidden today. You will not know which players are doing the whispering. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability &gt;Remove Evil&lt;** - Choose a player. If they are visited by [color=grey]The Witch Doctor[/color] you will kill [color=grey]The Witch Doctor[/color]. Bypasses [color=grey]The Witch Doctor&#39;s[/color] death immunity. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability &gt;Heal&lt;** - Heal a player from attacks or nightshade/bleed. _1 day cooldown, Infinite uses_.
&gt;
&gt;Goal: Same as the rest of bd, I forgot exactly what that was.

Suggestions are very, very welcome as I started seeing less and less purpose for the witch doctor and ideas for them. If you have any ideas that could help this, go ahead and tell me.</description>

            <p>Can we stop with this hard-counter crap? The Sorcerer is typically agreed to be the worst designed NK here and there’s no need to create any Sorcerer clones here, and to make it worse this NK lacks way too many capabilities that an NK needs.</p>

<p>As in the only NK that is fucked if they get poisoned, bled, hit a bearing Hunter or a Knight’s guarded target, and has a limited number of kills, including a night ability with a consistent 0 KPN? Are you delusional?</p>

<p>Add poison and bleed here. NKs need some form of protection against it as they need some sort of survivability against the Cult and/or Unseen and cannot depend on Physicians or Alchemists.</p>

<p>A NK needs unlimited kills to work. After n4 and you’re fully reliant on the Unseen/Cult, which may have already lost by then. And this is a blatant carbon-copy of ToS’ Coven Leader.</p>

</aside>
<p>This shouldn’t even be a night ability. Having utility on a NK is fine, it’s just that they need to have a consistent KPN to work. See how every NK has all of their night abilities with some killing potential. On an optimal level of play there should be little to no reason to use this ability as it wastes a night you could be using to kill your target.</p>

            <p>I don’t really like the concepts of sorc/inq.</p>
<p>Also having another NK like that wouldn’t really be fun. Plus at least Inq can side with scum but WD can’t since of the BD goal and it’s unconvertible too. The only unconvertible classes should be:</p>
<p>King</p>
<p>Prince</p>
<p>and Neutrals imo</p>

<p>if sorc didn’t have a counter id have a much higher winrate because it wins with evils.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>honestly I doubt sorc’s winrate is effected much by inq, I’ve only seen an inq kill sorc once, most the time I see the inq kill 2-3 random people, and the BD kills the sorc, (which may slightly help the sorcs odds of winning). Far as I see it removing the inq, would be a rough break even with regards to the sorc’s winrate.</p>

            <p>Now, I’ve seen witch and witchdoctor everywhere on these forums, but I’ve never seen anyone make them oppose each other. I’m going to change what opposing classes usually means. Usually, it means a neutral that should side with bd and an nk. Im changing mine to a bd class, and a neutral killer that can win with other evils, (in a way a sorc can).</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong><font color="grey">The Witch</font></strong></h1>
<p><em><font color="grey">Neutral Killer</font></em></p>
<p><strong>Passive &gt;Potion Mastery&lt;</strong> - You have a potion for every condition - including the ones that make you <strong>death, occupation, and redirection</strong> immune.</p>
<p><strong>Passive &gt;Sense Evil&lt;</strong> - The first time you attempt to kill a evil player, the kill will fail and you will get the message: <em>“You saw the evil intention in <strong>Player</strong> and did not kill them.”</em> All whispers from you to that player and from that player to you will be hidden the rest of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability &gt;Brew&lt;</strong> - Brew a potion today. You may choose which potion to brew out of <em>Heal Potion</em> and <em>Occupation Potion</em>. Usable on d1. <em>Infinite uses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability &gt;Witch&lt;</strong> - Force a player to use their ability on another player of choice. You will attack the Controlled player. If the controlled player is death immune, you will attack the player that you chose to be targeted. <em>4 uses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability &gt;Use Potion&lt;</strong> - Use a potion gained from <strong>Brew</strong> out of <em>Heal Potion</em> and <em>Occupation Potion</em> on a player. <em>0 of either potion on start. Uses are gained from <em>Brew</em>.</em></p>
<p>Goal: Defeat the <font color="blue">Blue Dragon</font> and all else who may oppose you. You win with <font color="purple">Unseen</font>/<font color="darkred">Cult</font>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong><font color="blue">The Witchdoctor</font></strong></h1>
<p><font color="blue"><em>Blue Dragon Support/Investigative/Killer</em></font> (Unconvertable and Unique)</p>
<p><strong>Passive &gt;Trials and Practices&lt;</strong> - Immune to all abilities from <font color="grey">The Witch</font> besides <em>heal potion</em>. This passive will be retained even if your class changes. You will only be present if <font color="grey">The Witch</font> is present in a match.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability &gt;Faith Heal&lt;</strong> - Choose a player. If the player is attempted to be the target of <font color="grey">The Witch’s</font> <strong>control</strong> ability tonight, it will fail. This is true if the player is either the controlled player of the target of the controlled player. <em>3 uses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability &gt;Focus for Evil&lt;</strong> - You will see whispers to and from the <font color="grey">The Witch</font> that would otherwise be hidden today. You will not know which players are doing the whispering. <em>2 uses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability &gt;Remove Evil&lt;</strong> - Choose a player. If they are visited by <font color="grey">The Witch Doctor</font> you will kill <font color="grey">The Witch Doctor</font>. Bypasses <font color="grey">The Witch Doctor’s</font> death immunity. <em>2 uses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability &gt;Heal&lt;</strong> - Heal a player from attacks or nightshade/bleed. <em>1 day cooldown, Infinite uses</em>.</p>
<p>Goal: Same as the rest of bd, I forgot exactly what that was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suggestions are very, very welcome as I started seeing less and less purpose for the witch doctor and ideas for them. If you have any ideas that could help this, go ahead and tell me.</p>
