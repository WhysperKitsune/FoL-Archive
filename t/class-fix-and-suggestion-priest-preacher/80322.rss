    <title>[Class Fix and Suggestion] Priest/Preacher</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-fix-and-suggestion-priest-preacher/80322</link>
    <description>&gt; These classes were a collaborative effort between [color=Purple]**Magnus**[/color] and [color=steblue]**DirectorHail**[/color].

&gt;# [color=steblue]Priest[/color] :shield:
&gt; **BD Support**
&gt; **Holy Resurgence (Day Ability)** - *Once the Soul passes through this world to the next, they’re never coming back.* Select a recently killed member of the [color=steblue]**Blue Dragon**[/color] to revive. They will receive a notification that they’re being revived and cannot talk to or hear other dead players. Their chat history of dead players will be removed for the duration that they’re alive. The revived target will die in two days. - **1** use
&gt; **Familiar Blood (Day Ability)** - *Hold hands, and wait for a sign.* Within the first 30 seconds of the day, you may select a dead member of the  **Blue Dragon**. The dead player will be notified and can send an, up to 30 letter, message. At the end of the following night the Priest will receive the message as well as the player’s updated logs. - **Infinite** uses
&gt; **Blue Fire (Night Ability)** - *The flames of the gods burns through your veins.* If attacked by an anti-[color=steblue]**Blue Dragon**[/color] class, you will be immune to death. - **1** use
&gt; *Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

&gt; The [color=steblue]**Priest**[/color] will convert to either the [color=purple]**Preacher**[/color] or the [color=darkred]**Ritualist**[/color].

&gt;# [color=purple]Preacher[/color] :shield:
&gt; **Unseen Support**
&gt; **Purple Flames (Passive)** - *That which was once benign, is now a cruel and twisted fate.* When attacked, you will be immune to death. This passive can only take effect once.
&gt; **Demonic Chant (Day Ability)** - *The end is nigh! Prepare yourselves!* Select an alive player. They will be silenced and unable to use their limited use day abilities, and you can talk in their place. - **2** uses
&gt; **Fearing Retribution (Night Ability) -** *Why show mercy when you can twist the blade in deeper?* Select a player. If they are attacked, the attack will bypass death. - **2** uses
&gt; *Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*


[details=&quot;Clarification&quot;]
[color=darkred]**Both classes are intended for Throne Of Lies; heavy edits would be needed for it to work in a Forum Of Lies environment**[/color]
[color=steblue]**Holy Resurgence**[/color] - *Select a recently killed member of the Blue Dragon to revive.* By Revive, it means killed the night previously.
___
[color=steblue]**Familiar Blood**[/color] - *Within the first 30 seconds of the day you may select a dead member of the  **Blue Dragon** . The dead player will be notified and can send a 30 letter message. At the end of the following night the Priest will receive the message and the players updated logs.* This fixes the problem of *forced to stay*. It means you need to use it quickly, yes. And you will receive the update logs of the player *as it was when the BD received the notifications.* This is to counter multiple messages via logs.
___
[color=steblue]**Blue Fire**[/color] - *If attacked by an anti- Blue Dragon class, you will be immune to death.* This means, if you use this ability, you will be immune to death, but only against those who are not BD (of course, death bypassing abilities will still work). You will be immune if you attacked from multiple non BD. 
___
[color=purple]**Purple Flames**[/color] - *When attacked, you will be immune to death. This passive can only take effect once.* Unlike [color=steblue]*Blue Fire*[/color], you do not have to actively use it, and it will protect you from anyone. However, if you are attacked by two people on the *same* night, you will die. 
___
[color=purple]**Demonic Chant**[/color] - *Select an alive player. They will be silenced and unable to use their limited use day abilities, and you can talk in their place.* Originally, this wasn’t going to affect day abilities, but Hail convinced me. (Thank him for making the classes good *and* balanced, actually.) Once this ability is used, you cannot cancel it for the day. This means you cannot talk as yourself again for the day (bad news if you’re VFRed), but you can vote from yourself. Admittedly, the target can spam vote, but you can talk it off. Even if no one is convinced, there’s no link back to you.
___
[color=purple]**Fearing Retribution**[/color] - *Select a player. If they are attacked, the attack will bypass death.* No, no, NO! This is not like the [color=purple]*Frenzy*[/color] ability of the Enforcer. This doesn’t bypass jail, but it does bypass protection. In addition, if *anyone* kills the target, they will always die. (Although you’ll still rely on the Assassin, probably.)

<em>Let’s say <strong>1</strong> is Priest, <strong>2</strong> is Random BD, <strong>3</strong> is Possessor.</em></p>
<p><em>3 possesses 2. This makes it seem as though 3 is BD. Priest attempts to talk to 3, but can’t, because 3 isn’t BD.</em><br>
How does this out Possessor?<br>
(If I’ve made a mistake in logic, please point it out)</p>

            <p>This class would have no problems outting a possessor as well. They just revive a BD, and then this BD tells everyone that x is possessor.</p>

            <p>Dead interaction was a really bad idea, it got removed for good and won’t come back.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Why remove dead people interactions from living abilities?"</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dead chat/interactions has always been random and unreliable. There’s no fun factor in <em>forcing</em> people to stay after dead to claim your gp. Died night 1? Still get some gp out of it without waiting til the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We now offer a % gp after the match ends if you left <em>while dead</em> , which discourages players to stay even-more if they don’t want to (most players left or afk’d immediately after death, anyway)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We want dead chat to be more of a spectate/optional thing than being a core part of the game. It’s one of those things that’s “cool at first”, but you realize very fast is both useless and frustrating~ for example, we couldn’t reward a % leaving while dead while these features existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We don’t <em>want</em> to hold your gp hostage by making you stay (if dead). Dead interactions were unreliable and too random (mostly bad-random). Died n1? np - quit, queue back up, get gp later when the old game ends.</p>

            <p>Then what were the actual problems? Being able to share information from the dead to the living forever? Even if that was true, there’s no way to reveal it to the rest of the court without outing yourself.<br>
If need be, a passive could be added to make a conversion attempt always succeed on the Priest?</p>

            <p>I get it, but you realise that there’s limited time and limited knowledge that comes with one person. And due to the nature of <strong>Holy Resurgence,</strong> you can’t have time to talk to them, confirm yourself to them, and then revive them.</p>

            <p>Conversion is a thing, although I understand why some may think holy resurgence would be to strong and in the right situations it would be. Perhaps a negative passive could be put in play to cut back it’s potential.</p>

            <p>The problems previously consisted of the following;<br>
**Being able to instantly confirm both themself and another player (which it can still admittedly do, but it’s not permanent).<br>
However, the Priest does not have the ability to revive a converted as the original (which was a real problem, evidence can be found on <strong>Retired Classes</strong> page of ToL wiki)<br>
You’re probably going to be converted as soon as you’re outted, which makes others sus of you. You can’t have instant communication with dead all the time, either.<br>
I say it fixes a lot of problems.</p>

Clarification</summary>
<p><font color="darkred"><strong>Both classes are intended for Throne Of Lies; heavy edits would be needed for it to work in a Forum Of Lies environment</strong></font><br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Holy Resurgence</strong></font> - <em>Select a recently killed member of the Blue Dragon to revive.</em> By Revive, it means killed the night previously.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Familiar Blood</strong></font> - <em>Within the first 30 seconds of the day you may select a dead member of the  <strong>Blue Dragon</strong> . The dead player will be notified and can send a 30 letter message. At the end of the following night the Priest will receive the message and the players updated logs.</em> This fixes the problem of <em>forced to stay</em>. It means you need to use it quickly, yes. And you will receive the update logs of the player <em>as it was when the BD received the notifications.</em> This is to counter multiple messages via logs.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Fire</strong></font> - <em>If attacked by an anti- Blue Dragon class, you will be immune to death.</em> This means, if you use this ability, you will be immune to death, but only against those who are not BD (of course, death bypassing abilities will still work). You will be immune if you attacked from multiple non BD.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>Purple Flames</strong></font> - <em>When attacked, you will be immune to death. This passive can only take effect once.</em> Unlike <font color="steblue"><em>Blue Fire</em></font>, you do not have to actively use it, and it will protect you from anyone. However, if you are attacked by two people on the <em>same</em> night, you will die.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>Demonic Chant</strong></font> - <em>Select an alive player. They will be silenced and unable to use their limited use day abilities, and you can talk in their place.</em> Originally, this wasn’t going to affect day abilities, but Hail convinced me. (Thank him for making the classes good <em>and</em> balanced, actually.) Once this ability is used, you cannot cancel it for the day. This means you cannot talk as yourself again for the day (bad news if you’re VFRed), but you can vote from yourself. Admittedly, the target can spam vote, but you can talk it off. Even if no one is convinced, there’s no link back to you.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="purple"><strong>Fearing Retribution</strong></font> - <em>Select a player. If they are attacked, the attack will bypass death.</em> No, no, NO! This is not like the <font color="purple"><em>Frenzy</em></font> ability of the Enforcer. This doesn’t bypass jail, but it does bypass protection. In addition, if <em>anyone</em> kills the target, they will always die. (Although you’ll still rely on the Assassin, probably.)</p>
