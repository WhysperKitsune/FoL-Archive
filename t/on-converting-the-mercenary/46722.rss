    <title>On Converting the Mercenary</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/on-converting-the-mercenary/46722</link>
    <description>In general, I have no problem with mercenary being a convertible class but I would like to see this one little change to him. Passive: On The Job - You cannot be converted while Guarding your target.

I go to guard my target on Night 1, get converted, only to find out they didn&#39;t get the notification that I had stood outside their door. I did not have fun that game.

It&#39;s also really awkward mid-game for this to happen as you have no way to prove you still the merc without using the Guard ability.</description>

            <p>That is weird behaviour, I was always under the impression a message would still go through even if you are converted that night. If you are converted N1, you can simply change your claim and fakeclaim like many evils have to do anyways. I donâ€™t think the mercenary needs conversion immunity when he guards to be honest.</p>

            <p>I agree with you 100% on this. All though I think the devs are looking at the merc next patch and are going to change some things so we will see what happens. Also the should be under feedback/suggestions not class/loreðŸ˜Š</p>
