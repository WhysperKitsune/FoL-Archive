    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Parasite (Neutral Killer, Unique)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-parasite-neutral-killer-unique/29793</link>
    <description>The Parasite (The name isn&#39;t very thematic, but I couldn&#39;t think of anything better/more fitting. Open to suggestions, though!) is a Neutral Killer capable of conversion, but only by sacrificing themselves in the process. Because of this, there is only ever one living Parasite, but all Parasites win if the living one does. With the ability to convert someone either when you die or when you infect them at night, this class is hard to get rid of.

&gt;## [color=lightyellow]The Parasite[/color]
&gt;[color=Grey]**Neutral Killer**[/color]
**Resilient (Passive)** - Immune to occupation.
**Backup Host (Day)** - Choose a target. If you die in any way, they will become the Parasite. - 1 use, it can&#39;t be prevented, it can be used on day 1, if they can&#39;t be converted they will not become the Parasite, if you are not the original Parasite this can only be used after 1 night
**Plague (Night)** - Kill a player. - Infinite uses
**Infect (Night)** - Choose a target. At the end of the night, you will take your own life, and they will become the Parasite. - 1 use, you keep the use and remain alive if the target could not be converted or visited, if you are not the original Parasite this can only be used after 1 night
*Kill everyone that does not need to survive as an objective.*

### Interactions:

* The ability to make another player become The Parasite adheres to the normal conversion immunities, and can&#39;t convert Unseen/Cult (I&#39;m unsure if the latter is included in the former since there is no way to check)
* For the abilities with limited uses, new Parasites will have the full amount of uses 
* If the Parasite uses Infect on the same night that they are attacked, they will successfully Infect their target assuming they were able to
* If they are attacked on the same night as they Infect but already have a Backup Host, Infect will take prevalence if it succeeds, but Backup Host will take effect if Infect fails
* If the Parasite&#39;s Backup Host dies, they will not get the use back
* New Parasites do not retain existing Backup Hosts of old ones 
* Backup Hosts will not receive a notification that they are the backup host until the Parasite dies and become the Parasite.</description>
