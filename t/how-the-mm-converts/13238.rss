    <title>How the MM Converts</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-the-mm-converts/13238</link>
    <description>Scientifically speaking, the Mastermind can have many possible ways of converting good guys, but through my research and all of my calculations I have come to a conclusion. Read this Carefully:

Ever wonder why the BD converts to an opposing faction and increase their chances of death? Well, me too. There has to be a complex system behind it, and I may have cracked the code. Choosing to join an evil faction should take a long timeto decide, not just one night. Maybe the MM just has good persuasion skills? Wrong. There is something juicy behind it, and I may be the first to know.

The Mastermind has to give the person he is going to covert something they desire. He may give them access to watch Rick and Morty, or take them to the tavern to watch the princess dance, but I have my final conclusion.
