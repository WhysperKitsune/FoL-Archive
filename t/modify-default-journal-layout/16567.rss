    <title>Modify Default Journal Layout</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/modify-default-journal-layout/16567</link>
    <description>Hey. I love the fact that we have a default layout button, but I think the functionality could be expanded upon.

Personally, I prefer a layout more akin to the following:

&gt; | **Character Name**, the **Class Name** |
&gt; 1.
&gt; 2. 
&gt; 3.
&gt; 4.

&gt; | Miscellaneous Information |
&gt; [3] claimed that he was a noble, despite having been immune to attack.
&gt; The King didn&#39;t give us a lead on day two, so therefore he is evil.

Since this deviates from the default log, I can&#39;t really make use of this great new feature. Which is why I recommend adding the ability to customize the default log through an in-menu option, [as shown in this mock-up image](https://i.imgur.com/oZyO1gU.png). The player would be able to pull up a menu that is, essentially, [a journal with a button below it](https://i.imgur.com/FZoBjgL.png) allowing the player to set a new default format.

I think this would be a great additional layer of functionality to the default journal layout, which would give players a little more control over adding their own personal styles to their logs.

Let me know what you think!
Thanks.</description>

            <p>I agree with this. As it is, I think being able to c/p chat log opens that tactic up for abuse, with the kinda-bad UI around that being the mitigating factor. Can you imagine trying to dupe the color tags that get copied?</p>

            <p>The one fear I have of an automated “name the classname”. While it may be easy to do, it’s also a newbie trap metagame… IE the prince can demand the log include the top row, and study it closely for typo’s spelling errors, capitalizations etc…</p>

            <p>That pipe idea is pretty good, I’ll keep it in mind.</p>
<p>That being said, I’d also like to request a default private notes feature as well.</p>

            <p>I went looking for game files to modify and didn’t find one. Anyone have any hints?</p>
<p>FWIW, I find log readability goes -way- up on paste with a pipe character before the N1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geo the Reaper</p>
<p>| N1 - reap 1&gt;5; linked<br>
| N2 - reap 2: immune<br>
| D3 - chill 3<br>
| N3 - reap 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geo the Reaper | N1 - reap 1&gt;5; linked | N2 - reap 2: immune | D3 - chill 3 | N3 - reap 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geo the Reaper N1 - reap 1&gt;5; linked N2 - reap 2: immune D3 - chill 3 N3 - reap 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference is more notable in the game font since pipe is a thinner and longer character than most of the letters, and the impact is even higher if you tend towards verbose logs. I find I get exe’d a lot less for “bad logs” and people seem to read them more closely when I do this.</p>
<p>My new game ritual now is to c/p a "| " down the left side, and clip the last few nights since the current layout doesn’t let you write day logs for scouting, poisons, etc, without going over 1 page. The current scrolling behavior is cancer when trying to c/p.</p>
<p>If the devs don’t make things configurable, at least tossing in a default line delimiter like this for c/p wouldn’t suck.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This 100%. I thought this is what they meant by default initially. Also i would like to save deathnotes for future use and the ability to read logs at the score board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% more on deathnotes, especially if I could draw offline, and scoreboard logs–I quit using deathnotes because they’re too hard to draw quickly, tbh.</p>
<p>I’d like to be able to review chat from scoreboard too, honestly, since a lot of times I’m at the wtf just happened point when the game ends. If you wanted to really thrill me let me save all that for later review.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/silcore">@Silcore</a> I really dont like this idea, for a similar reason they removed the ability to copy system messages.<br>
It just makes it easier catching people in a lie because you would then be expected to show logs immediately.<br>
If you happen to catch a mistake while copy-pasting you can still correct it.<br>
Also if you keep multiple classes logged at the start of the game to stay flexible you would have to keep them on different pages and switch around etc…</p>
<p>I´m all for the customizable layout though.</p>

            <p>Some additional functionality worth considering: being able to display a single journal page to the public.</p>
<p>Every trial ends up demanding that the accused copy their logs into chat. This ruins the formatting and makes reading through their log arduous. Instead, there should be a second button at the base of the journal (just beside the “default layout” option) which allows the player to “present a page.” This would make the process a little easier and will further discourage the plague of blank journals.</p>

            <p>Agreed.  I still see people putting in their name and class name at top having to make players “double enter” from the top, this should be a small hotfix without requiring an update.</p>
