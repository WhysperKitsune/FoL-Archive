    <title>Making butler great again</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/making-butler-great-again/15963</link>
    <description>Butler is a bit, ah, bland. You know how you can make it unbland? Poisoning the king D4 when he has done nothing suspicious.

To fix this, I think it would be nice if nightshade wine could target ANYONE. It would make it a precious resource only to be used on special occasions, such as testing a phys claim.

If this would be to advantageous, remove a use of &quot;party&quot; which is very similar to the court wizard&#39;s ice ward in the next patch anyway</description>

<p>Additionally, Butler poison is a vital check on evil kings - it’s extremely important to encourage evil kings to hide, and with the way courts work, voting isn’t always enough.  Evils have CS as a threat to help keep them in check, but that won’t work on the king, so they need something else.  Butler poison is that thing.  If you let Butlers use it on someone else, they almost always will, which isn’t good for the game.</p>

<p>Agreed 100%. I don’t know the way to Make Butler Great Again, but I don’t think it has to do with the Nightshade - Evil King needs a check on his power.</p>

<p>No no no no no.  That would make it <span class="bbcode-i">more</span> likely that they’d yolobomb N4, not less, since now they can just murder the most suspicious person in town to avoid feeling bored.  Encouraging that is not really good for the game.</p>

<p>While I’m all for making roles more fun, giving them the ability to kill anyone they want isn’t really the way to go about it.  Something more subtle, please.</p>

            <p>Throw a Party can be pretty useful, though. It is Butler’s self-defense ability. If you know there’s a good chance you are going to be attacked on any given night, use it.</p>

            <p>I support removing party for something more butlerish but the whole point of butler is his relationship with the King so don’t like the nightshade change.</p>
