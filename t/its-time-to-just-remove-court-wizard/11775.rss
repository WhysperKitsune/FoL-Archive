    <description>**This class _does not_ belong in the Blue Dragon roster. It is just a shit version of the Physician.**

I will outline in full why this class does not belong in the game.

1. Ice ward is a worse version of the Physicians heal in almost every aspect. Notable exceptions are:

- Blocking an empowered eradicate
- Blocking a reap
- Blocking a scorned frame on someone who coincidentally is also being investigated by a sheriff/paladin/king.

2. Charge is a worse version of Reanimate in almost every aspect. Notable exceptions are:

- A prince uses all of their executes correctly and somehow you, the CW, and the prince, survive until the late stages of the game, and after you charge the prince they survive for the next 3 days to execute more Cult/Unseen.

Ice ward is more useful to the fucking Cult/Unseen because it&#39;s more likely to block an investigation than an attack. There is actually no purpose to CW at the current time, and every game it appears it serves as a handicap to the BD. God forbid you get double CW, I can almost guarantee games with double CW result in overwhelming amounts of losses.

CW as it is would be a better fit in the Unseen. Swap sage and CW or just remove CW.</description>

            <p>I actually don’t use Ice Ward at all for the first 2 nights because you’re more likely to hinder investigation results or healing.</p>
<p>I only begin Ice Warding once I hear a solid BD claim.</p>

            <p>Cw is powerful.  Blocking visits is incredibly strong.</p>
<p>The problem is there is no feedback to the CW.  You don’t know when you did something good. If you predict who the assassin will kill as a Phys, you get feedback that they were attacked and you healed them.  You gained information, and in the process helped confirm yourself to BD.</p>
<p>As a CW, you can ward someone and you’ll never know if no one would have visited them anyway, or if you saved them from a conversion/kill.  You could be the BD MVP as CW and not only would no one ever know it, you potentially wouldn’t even ever know it yourself.</p>
<p>This is what needs to change to make the class fun.</p>

            <p>Balance wise the CW might be fine, but I see a lot of players complaining ingame how boring the class is to play.</p>
<p>With which I have to agree: It is one of the few classes that are boring to play. I posted some suggestions for changing the recharge to a more fun ability in another thread. (post 1.08 changes)</p>

            <p>Why not both?</p>
<p>New decent power level and able to be fake-claimed sees ideal imo, and if that comes with some slight buff then I guess it’s worth it or whatever</p>

            <p>I don’t get all the hatred CW garners for itself.</p>
<p>Pre-1.08 it was too strong, able to block conversion &amp; negative effects for two players a night. Post patch, it can Ice Ward each player twice and now recharge abilities.</p>
<p>Ice Ward’s a lot stronger than people think it is, but limited. Would people rather it go back to having a single target Barrier nightly? <em>(I still don’t think it needs to be able to Barrier two people a night again)</em></p>

            <p>I think a pretty big problem is that the Unseen version of CW is a lot stronger than the normal version too. Although, I guess that’s inevitable when you only have three Unseen.</p>

            <p>I wrote useless <strong>or</strong> extremly powerful. Useless if you already used your both blocks, which happens quite often if important classes get revealed in midgame. If you happen to still be able to barrier your teammates in lategame, it is one of the most powerful abilities to turn the game around.</p>
<p>For the moment the most succesfull tactic for me as CW is to completely be honest with king D2 and tell him who I use my MB on. This way the limited inspects at least don’t clash.  This can also be exploited as a bussing tactic if you are evil class and want to prevent the king to check your guys (though it can backfire of course)</p>

            <p>one problem is people seem to think you need to press a button every night.</p>
<p>You don’t.</p>
<p>You should not randomly occupy as butler, or random wolf as hunter, or random barrier as CW. It is generally detrimental to this until some leads show up.</p>
<p>It’s the same reason you do not make a random player immune to being voted up as noble N1: it could hurt your team.</p>

<p>The caps are my form of shouting as this an’t IRL. Also the Video was saying “It’s time to stop” as my post said to stop complaining about things that don’t need complaining. Also anybody that has been here on ToL Forums for a while knows I’m naturally aggressive. It’s my nature.</p>

            <p>There really is no point in trying to change your opinion since your opinion is that CW’s role is to completely occupy a players room and not let anyone through. that is fine though since this is what the devs designed the CW to be in this patch.</p>
<p>this still does not change that I have another opinion and many other people do to. I think he is not i a good spot right now and neither is the noble (though noble is boring to play, he is really important in lategame right now).</p>
<p>there is no point to be agressive about it with all caps and silly youtube videos, since that is not how a discussion works.</p>
<p>What most complaints about CW seem to boil down to is:</p>
<ol>
<li>He is kinda boring to play and you feel most of the time more like you are obstructing players than helping</li>
<li>Other players get annoyed by random CW blocks obstructing their limited and unlimited abilities, especially invest classes, causing the team to lose time on the detection.</li>
<li>In late game you end up being mostly useless or extremly powerful, depending if you used your abilities right. But most of the time the 2 charges get used on confirmed BD in midgame so you end up only able to barrier the enemies</li>
</ol>

            <p>Honestly I just think it needs to not have the 2 per person restriction. A poison or Bleed can bypass the defense so it isn’t unbeatable if there is 2 on each other.</p>
<p>Even if there is phys. Confirmed CW 1, Confirmed CW 2.</p>
<p>CW 1 is on CW 2 is on CW 1</p>
<p>Assassin poisons CW 1</p>
<p>CW 2 is no longer on CW 1 so that Phys can heal him</p>
<p>MM converts CW 1</p>

            <p>Stop using Caps. If there was a system that I could ban a class that I wont’t want to play it would be Court Wizard in every single game. If you are happy playing this class, then I guess you are in minority. This class needs a rework for sure.</p>
