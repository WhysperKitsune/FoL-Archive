    <title>We need to talk about trials</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/we-need-to-talk-about-trials/9298</link>
    <description>As far as I was made aware, trials in FoL, unless otherwise specified in that game&#39;s rules, worked as they do in-game: when majority vote is reached on somebody, a trial begins in which they may be executed or voted innocent. In FoL, these trials are supposed to last 24 hours, and upon the expiration of these 24 hours the trial ends. The King may decide fate, but whether or not that occurs either the person on trial is executed and the next night begins, or they are voted innocent and the day timer begins. If any of this is invorrect, please do let me know.

The reason we need to talk is that, in SFoL10, as far as I can tell, majority was reached on a player before the end of the day (the thread was set to auto-lock upon the end of the day), and yet the moderators completely discounted this and started night anyways. If this is not in error, somebody please explain to me why; and if it is, this should be remidied to ensure the health of future games. Either way, I feel that the standard FoL rules section of the OP needs to be updated to clarify these issues.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>Bastard in the sense that the moderator can lie to your face.</p>
<p>Also <a class="mention" href="/u/eevee">@eevee</a> trials have always been 24hr, the point of contention is the mods not starting a trial at all.</p>

            <p>Trial is a trial. It should happen always when there is enough votes</p>
<p>Only point here is if a late trial should last 24h or decreased amount of time.</p>

            <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The game should function as the rules state, unless a rule change is made for that game (such as SFoL2) or if it is a bastard game (which should ideally be disclosed beforehand as well).</p>

            <p>But choosing to use the auto-close is just that - a choice.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t change the game just because it’s more convenient to do so, especially if the rules as written are violated in doing so.</p>

            <p>Nah, that creates issues with auto thread closing.</p>
<p>I’m personaly against using it, but I see why some mods like using auto-close.</p>

            <p>I’m inclined to agree. I thought a trial would last a minimum of 24hours (unless majority/Decide is used). If that 24 hours went beyond the remaining time, the day ends immediately upon the trial ending.</p>

            <p>Pmed mod few times about it. Seems that was <a class="mention" href="/u/queen_alfa">@Queen_Alfa</a> decision. And I agree that this decision was made in total oposite to rules specified in thread.</p>
<p>Also, I would want to once again suggest something wich was implemented in all my games. Trials start at moment of mayority, not at the moment of announcing them.</p>
<p>Cause hey, it isn’t players fault for mod not being online to start trial. So why do players lose theirs time due to mod not being able to start a trial?</p>
<p>If that was the case, this 6 hours of time would be enough to gather at least few votes.</p>
