    <description>Passive 1-Blackmailer-Hear everyone&#39;s whispers
Passive 2-Time Efficient-You are able to use both day abilities and night abilities in the same night or day multiple times.
Day ability 1-Trollbox-Same thing(unlimited uses)
Day ability 2-Kidnap-Take someone away and talk to them at night-Unlimited uses(Basically jail)
Night ability 1-Reveal-Talk to the Unseen/Cult for the rest of the night-Unlimited uses
Night ability 2-Release-Release the person you kidnapped allowing them to use their abilities-Unlimited uses
Win con-Help the Unseen/Cult win or Survive
This class essentially tries to kill the whisper the king meta.
We all hate it and this class doesn&#39;t directly solve the issue.However if this is implemented it would cause some debates if people wanted to whisper king or not as this class might overhear and help the unseen strategize who they are killing.It would also cause some funny games where people get fed wrong information from whispers.</description>
