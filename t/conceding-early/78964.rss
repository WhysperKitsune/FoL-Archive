    <title>Conceding early</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/conceding-early/78964</link>
    <description>Hi,
we had now quite a few games which were very unsatisfying for everyone because evils conceded very very early.
I&#39;m mostly playing ToL, and there is Conceding considered as Gamethrowing and a punishable offense.
When I&#39;m hosting FoL, I&#39;m always like... &quot;yes you can tell me that you want to concede, and I probably will use it in my decision when to force end the game, but there&#39;s a good possibility I will just ignore it as host, or use it a bit later.&quot;
What does lead to conceding, why is it allowed, and what can we do to make it misused less frequent?
Also... is there kinda a pressure to concede? Aka &quot;hey you didn&#39;t concede and made this game go on forever&quot;? Or is it a very drastic way of replacing out?

...

Conceding early (aka D1-D3 or so) doesn&#39;t say you&#39;re a bad person or whatever, it just means, there is *something wrong*. Please let&#39;s not witchhunt, but accept that people are misusing it, and how we can help them to do it less.</description>

<p>I voted to concede in SFoL 60 because the setup was very town sided and we were just dragging out the inevitable</p>

            <p>LyLo/MyLo? Sure. I agree that conceding there would be unreasonable. If the person cannot participate a /out is better suited.<br>
However the concede in Arson, say, was perfectly reasonable. Town had 12 v 1. Not gonna happen.<br>
Doesn’t matter if it’s early or not. It matters on how much chance you have at winning and how long it will take.<br>
If the setup ends too early for the host’s liking then measures should be put in place to prevent it.</p>

If you have only one member left, that’s at least not “early” anymore</p>

            <p>Yes, it’s possible for one remaining scum member to pull through even if things are looking impossible to win, but it also leans on skill and how much time.</p>
<p>There are certain situations where it probably isn’t okay to concede, like if the conceding member isn’t busy the next couple days and can actually play scum.</p>
<p>However, if the remaining member doesnt have confidence in their scum play and they really don’t have time to wiggle themselves out, it’s perfectly fine for them to concede then use time they should be using to do something else to stress themselves out trying to pull through.</p>

            <p>i mean.<br>
if you want to get technical about it there are scenarios which dont exactly meet the wincon but which are mathematically confirmed to end in a particular result, but these are normally auto-resolved so im not sure they count</p>

            <p>Scum should always have the <em>right</em> to concede</p>
<p>does that mean they should in most cases?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>If the scum believes its unwinnable then it is.</p>
<p>Fk is gonna yell at me but its a lot about mindset</p>
<p>If you believe you are going to lose in a concede worthy situation you will lose</p>
<p>if you believe you are going to win theres less chance of you losing</p>

<p>Actually, now I look on it is it actually considered gamethrowing if you would be able to concede in a turbo match?<br>
That’s actually a hard placement to place a rule. It’s probably the closest thing to it but it’s definitely not accurate.</p>

<p>In turbos, conceding has little point due to short phases</p>

<p>If conceding is every removed I will always dodge setups that state that or just blatantly /out or completely avoid the thread all together in the event I do want to concede.<br>
Removing the ability to concede is tremendously bad.</p>

<p>Just to explain the tol version, its not because its turbo. It is because everything is considered Gamethrowing which is “going intentionally against your (current) win condition”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not gamethrowing at all. It’s called knowing when to give up. Some things just can’t be won and aren’t worth the time.<br>
I fully believe the reason that conceding is not an option in ToL is due to it being a turbo.<br>
If it is banned under gamethrowing then it is either</p>
<ol>
<li>The wrong reason of why it should be banned</li>
<li>The right reason in the wrong category</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be banned as it is perfectly reasonable to expect someone to dedicate 5~ minutes while the game solves.</p>
<p><strong>It is absolutely not reasonable to expect someone to dedicate DAYS towards something while the game has already been solved.</strong></p>
<p>Working towards reducing the concede rate is completely fine: I’m actually all for it.</p>
<p><strong>The reason for this is that the only way you reduce concede rates is by having people improve their game which is always positive.</strong></p>
<p>Working towards the removal of the function to concede is absolutely ridiculous and should never even be considered in forum matches that have one phase longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>The reason for this is that you are not only putting emotional stress onto them (which lasts much less and has a much less chance to build to a severe rate) you are also causing them to feel the need to waste their time, impacting their life and potentially stopping social situations like ect. at a dinner table or even influencing them to decline social invites. You also make the player feel extremely bored and potentially not wanting to participate in future games.</strong></p>
