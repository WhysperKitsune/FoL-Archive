    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Priest and The Heretic (v2)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-priest-and-the-heretic-v2/73904</link>
    <description>Updating this old idea because we could really use another Blue Dragon Social class, and we already have artwork for the Priest so we&#39;d only need some for the Heretic.

---
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**[color=steblue]The Priest[/color]**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Devout (Passive)** - Your voice may not be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, Troll Box, Mental Blur, etc. will not work on you.)
&gt;**Enclave (Passive)** - All members of your enclave may chat at night.
&gt;
&gt;**Shepard (Day)** - Add a player to your enclave. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;**Excommunicate (Day)** - Remove a player from your enclave. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Blessing (Night)** - You may bless a player, protecting them from all negative social effects (Icy Touch, Distract, Troll Box, Mental Blur, etc. will not work). The blessing will stay on the player until you bless someone else. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;**Anoint (Night)** - Prevent all day abilities from affecting your target tomorrow (includes Decide Fate). Does not prevent day actions that take effect the following night. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm._

&gt;**Converts into [color=purple]The Heretic[/color].**
---
&gt;&lt;big&gt;**[color=purple]The Heretic[/color]**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=purple]Unseen Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Hearsay (Passive)** - As long as you are alive, the Unseen will have a separate chat tab with which to talk during the day. At night, members of your enclave may talk.
&gt;**Dogma (Passive)** - Your voice may not be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, Troll Box, Mental Blur, etc. will not work on you.)
&gt;
&gt;**Impersonate (Day)** - Your next whisper will appear to be from your target. They will be unable to send or receive whispers until this occurs, and during this time you will receive all whispers meant for them. They will not be informed that this is occurring. *(2 uses)*
&gt;**Scheme (Day)** - If your target is not in your enclave, add them. If they are, remove them. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Mislead (Night)** - Any day abilities your target attempts to use tomorrow will have no effect. *(Infinite uses)*
**Scheme (Night)** - Prevent all day abilities from affecting your target tomorrow (includes Decide Fate). Does not prevent day actions that take effect the following night. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Your objective is to Eliminate the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who stand against you._
---
This now acts as a true neighborizer, able to add multiple people to its chat and maintain communications at night. This is very powerful if you&#39;re good at deciding who to trust, but can come back to bite you if you aren&#39;t.</description>

<p>Great concept, but why should it be limited to negative social effects?  It should just work on all negative effects(I’ll provide a list if you need them)</p>

<p>I love the concepts, but I think they would do better as a Mystic overhaul.  Mystic is meant to(or at least should) be the neighborizer.  I’ll upload an updated version of my old rework later, which is similar to this.  Priest should focus around preventing negative effects.</p>

<p>And while that’s fair I personally would prefer to suggest a multipurpose suggestion that can be rolled back to focus on one aspect than suggesting something focused entirely on that aspect</p>
<p>Plus I like the idea of being able to cancel it without just un-pushing a button</p>
<p>Hell you could also use it to impersonate a whisper to yourself, a buddy, or some Neutral that’s willing to play along</p>
<p>Having them whisper to a Sellsword telling them to say the whisper was incriminating could be pure gold</p>

            <p>guess it depends mainly on how often whispers are used these days, With both of us kind of on hiatus I’d guess we both really lack the knowledge.</p>
<p>If there are few to no whispers most days, my methods are better, if 2+ whispers are done yours are better. my fear is a bit less on practicality (Personally in my view in both of our concepts whispers are going to effectively have the same result, as a whisper jammer, however IMO the impersonate part will just result in complaints that that is worthless as some players will focus on it and miss the jam).</p>
<p>Biggest difference in our styles, I’m more paranoid of negative feedback rolling things back because of complaints. I see a whole lot of potential as a whisper jammer, and effectively no potential as a whisper spoofer unless whispering becomes far more flooded. I’m more afraid of people seeing the spoofer and not seeing the jammer part of it.</p>

            <p>One of the important benefits to my Impersonate is that you can <em>cancel</em> the ability at will. Additionally, being able to not see that other people are whispering will make it even more obvious that somebody is under the effects of Tinnitus.</p>
<p>I definitely like intercepting their whispers though, gonna add that</p>

            <p>could add in that their whispers can’t be heard as well, the way I see it on a practical level, it is about the same… I don’t see the “impersonate” portion of it accomplishing anything beyond potentially giving away the use of the ability. (it’s too easy to ask and verify, and there’s unlikely to be a high enough volume of whispers that one shouldn’t just verify every whisper).</p>
<p>If you want to actually make the impersonate work… now if we do want to make a whisper impersonation that actually doesn’t fall appart like that, it would take a pretty hefty buff.</p>
<p>Impersonate: All whispers to you will appear as the target, All whispers to your target will instead be visible to you.</p>
<p>admitted, that too runs a side risk of verifiability by simply asking out loud “did you whisper me X”</p>
<p>The way yours is… at least to me, is best served by not actually sending the whisper. lock up and block out their whispers… sending the message itself is more of a liability, as it’s easy to double check. IMO if it can be double checked, then the impersonate portion of it is a distraction from what’s actually powerful about it (it blocks whispers prior to sending a message)</p>
<p>I only see the message itself useful in scenerios where there’s too many whispers to verify each one, say in the middle of WKM… but if there is a WKM it would probably take place before it is reasonable to have converted a priest.</p>

            <p>you can be more tactical, but due to whispers being much rarer than normal speach, it would probably be easier to always give a test every time someone whispers you.</p>
<p>With trollbox you are always seeing 20+ chat messages a day, so people will only test the most blatent 5% or so. Whispers you’ll be getting 1-2 whisper conversations a day normally, there’s no sane reason not to test each one.</p>
<p>Maybe to take the seeming emphasis away from the message, and put more emphasis on the whisper block, it were say</p>
<p>Tinnitus (or curse of deafness): Target is unaware of when people are whispering, and cannot read whispers to himself.</p>
<p>Takes out the part that IMO is going to find itself useless very quickly, draws attention to the real stregnth of it (grants plausible deniability if scum ignores a whisper, causes people to be unaware of whispers meaning someone may miss important clues from who is whispering whom, as well as of course random extra issues from people not being able to hear what’s being said to them".</p>

            <p>yeah, mainly it would be the equivelant of “can you repeat that” is to the trollbox. assuming whispers are less common (honestly I haven’t gotten back into playing since the MM buff, mainly because it was simultanious with allies return), but if whispers are uncommon, it would seem pretty standard to just always respond to every whisper you recieve with “say hi”.</p>

            <p>Whispers are just not recieved. You can use this to block whispers if you so wish. I don’t see whatever issue you are seeing.</p>
<p>Is it that there would be no reply? Because that can be as much of a tool for scum as it is for determining that somebody is being impersonated.</p>

            <p>with impersonate… how does the “they will not be able to recieve” work though.</p>
<p>is there a solution to</p>
<p>her: “/w 1 13 is unseen”<br>

<p>If he doesn’t receive it then obviously there’d be no reply… if he does then there isn’t much point in blocking whispers.</p>
<p>The enclave part is interesting would be currious how that plays in practice.</p>
