    <description>The Fraudster (Neutral Offensive)

Day Ability 1: Sell for Profit (0 uses)
You grant a player one more use of one of his night abilities. In exchange, you receive a gold coin.

Night Ability 1: Five-fingered Discount (unlimited uses)
Your target loses one use of one of his night abilities. You gain one use of Sell for Profit.

Night Ability 2: Pay to Win (3 gold coins to use)
You can only activate this ability when you have 3 gold coins. You spend those coins and win.

Win Condition: Pay to Win.

The Patron (Neutral Investigative)

Passive: Screw the Rules, I Have Money
Every time you succeed in a night action, you receive a gold coin from the king.

Day Ability 1: Return Policy (1 gold coin per use)
If a player was robbed of a use of his abilities, you can give it back to him.

Night Ability 1: Money Talks (unlimited use)
Choose two targets:
- If neither of them is the Fraudster or his target, you will get no feedback.
- If one of them is the target, a message will tell you that they were attacked.
- If one of them is the Fraudster, a message will tell you that they are suspicious.
- If you target both the Fraudster and his target, the Fraudster&#39;s attempt will be prevented and you will receive a message saying that you just interrupted an attack.

Night Ability 2: King&#39;s Taxes (0 uses)
You get 1 use of this skill whenever you receive a feedback from Money Talks. You force every player on the court that has a gold coin to give it to the king. This includes you.

Win Condition: Make sure that the Fraudster loses.

In order for one of these classes to appear, the other must be in the game as well.</description>

            <p>I feel that it’s still overpowered with the Patron though, only 3 coins needed to win.</p>

            <p>Would you take a look at it again, please <a class="mention" href="/u/okx">@Okx</a>? I made a counter to it, seems like a cool gameplay in my opinion.</p>

            <p>This seems quite overpowered. It looks like, in most situations, the merchant can win in 3 nights, maybe 5 at most.</p>
