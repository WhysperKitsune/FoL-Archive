&gt;*[color=gray]Neutral Killer[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (The Trial)** - Death immune. If you are hit by your own virus from **Plant Virus**, you will gain an extra charge of **Degenerate**. 
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Foresee)** - If occupation or redirection is attempted when using **Degenerate**, the occupier/redirector will be killed, the ability will be canceled, and you will lose a charge of the ability.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Plant Virus)** - Plant a virus in a player. They will die in 3 nights, if they visit a player, that player will get the virus and the original holder will lose it. (If the player can visit two players one of the two at random will get the virus). This cannot be healed but the virus&#39; killing is postponed one more night if the target is jailed on the third night. The virus bypasses death immunity. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Trollbox)** - Force a player to say something to the court. The target will not see the message. _Infinite uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Corrupt)** - Attack a player. _Infinite uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Degenerate)** - Attack one player tonight and give another the virus. _0 starting uses, uses may be gained from **Plant Virus** using the passive **The Trial**_.
&gt;
&gt;Win Condition: Same as all NK&#39;s.</description>

            <p>Yah exactly, I made this because a scorned found me as neutral and an observer found me kill on the same night and got salty so made a class that indirectly nerfs both</p>

            <p>I think if this were to be implemented they would need to buff fool to kill people on a mislynch. I do like the indirect nerf to scorned with this though.</p>
