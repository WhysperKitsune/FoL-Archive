    <title>Psycho King doesn&#39;t show as winner when he wins</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/psycho-king-doesnt-show-as-winner-when-he-wins/30895</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Reaper became King, won with Alchemist, showed Alchemist win only on splash screen.
Both actually won and got the gold

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Should at least show &quot;King and Alchemist win&quot;

#### Steps to reproduce:
Presumably get a psycho king to win with an alchemist.

            <p>Oh hey! I was that Reaper/Psycho King! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Can confirm I had the same bug, it just said “The Alchemist Wins.”<br>
Edit: Here’s a screenshot for proof<br>

I did receive gold and the postgame screen treated it like a win.</p>
