    <title>The Developer of Lore, ISWThunder</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-developer-of-lore-iswthunder/12542</link>
    <description>@ISWThunder    is a very good writer when it comes to lore, I know for a fact, at least. And I don&#39;t fully know what his position on the dev-team is, but holy crap we need more lore in-game, the characters are fascinating with awesome powers/abilities, and the artwork is AMAZING, now what do we need? Hmm... LORE OF COURSE!!! Yes, there is some already, but not enough! 

Who&#39;s amazing at writing Lore and already in the position of Dev, meaning has the power to make things official? ISWThunder of course!

And look at his amazing lore(s):

If you read even just one sentance in any of the lores he&#39;s written, you&#39;ll see what I mean. But yes, my suggestion is simple, incorporate lore into the game and ISWThunder write it because he&#39;s amazing &lt;3</description>

            <p>Thank you for the compliments, Dooku. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>There have been some other talk this week about creating more lore for the game. As you can see, I tend to be a bit wordy, so it can take some time for me to write, but I’m gonna work on crafting some more stuff that I’ll put out through the ToL social media accounts and the forum.</p>
<p>Of course, I should probably pick a few more classes that won’t be quickly eliminated from the game. I’ll have to move a bit higher up the command, I think.</p>
