            <p>I genuinely love this and I’ll admit this now.<br>
I was waiting for a Bard suggestion.<br>
We all need a bit of music and upbeat here.<br>
A Bard would keep the people entertained.<br>
Some nice wine and a bit of music, no wonder why Castle Aidart is loved so much!</p>

            <p>Perhaps for the tale of love ability, they should effect each other with something based on their class type; killers would kill, regardless of normal conditions, offensives would occupy (The players would not be occupied otherwise, what they do si in addition to their other night ability), support roles heal, etc.</p>

            <p>Would it be too strong for a 1 time usage? You could also just ask what their class is in chat with the same results!</p>

            <p>I was thinking that the night ability should be solid considering the variables of the day ability but perhaps the knowing how many abilities they have might be too much of a giveaway im not sure on that one though</p>

            <p>Maybe not see what day abilties they have, as it basically translate as straight up knowing their role, but see the number of day and night abilties they have? it’s still pretty good as it narrows it down, without being a dead giveaway</p>

            <p>Oh my …</p>
<p>Target a player with Fate or Fiction, use “Good” as your word, ask them if they’re “Good” or “Evil” and when they say “Good” they reveal their own role! That’s gonna be fun as it can be variated quite a lot.</p>
<p>I like the role because it’s actually a really tactical one. The Bard should get another night ability with 1 use that should turn every action a certain player takes at night, at themselves instead! Meaning an Assassin killing a player would instead make them kill themselves. A Prince executing a player will make them execute themselves etc. Call it “Tale of Rebound”</p>
<p>Just an additional idea of mine.</p>
<p>I also think tho that for an investigative class, the amount of investigation is quite limited. Maybe a second day ability that allows you, 1 time, to see what day abilities another player has?</p>
