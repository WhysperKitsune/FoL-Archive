    <title>Definitely loving the improvements after playing today!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/definitely-loving-the-improvements-after-playing-today/73110</link>
    <description>**Every class has their own theme music!** I didn&#39;t notice until today... *(duh it’s the patch)
Also I was wondering if the new _titles_ and _avatars_ are unlocked for all? ...where you only need gold to buy them or is there some kind of requisite to unlocking them? 

Anyways, back to killin&#39; you fools with the curse :fool:</description>
