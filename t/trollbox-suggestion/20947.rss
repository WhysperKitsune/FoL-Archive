    <description>Toolbox should have unlimited uses or something like 3 times per day. We need to defeat this repeat or double line entry meta. Trollbox is rarely effective and usually only on newbies. It becomes increasingly harder to use as the players experience goes up. 

Unlimited box forces people to investigate and actually deduce whether that person is who they say or &quot;not say.&quot;</description>

            <p>That’s why I said OR. Unlimited or 3 uses per day. Unless they up to 6 seconds per message the  leave it as is because it fixes the problem completely.</p>

<p>It should silence them. You are literally speaking for that person and if they are about to be accused it’s a win win because you can box just before accusation if the player is pro enough.</p>

</aside>
<p>My point is, unlimited uses and block their chat… is a tad excessive… someone could send trollboxes in 6 second incriments, keep someone blocked from start till finish of the entire day…</p>

            <p>Well then you create one of 2 problems.</p>
<p>Either Trollbox does not count against the 6 second rule, and now even innoculous trollboxes are discovered when someone tries to speak just after being trollboxed.</p>
<p>Or trollbox does count against the messages, and trollbox is now a silencing weapon.</p>

            <p>This is why I suggested, as a whole, they prevent multiple chat entries with like a 6 second delay. Chat spans too fast anyways at times and alot gets missed with people typing multiple lines at a time. This would also, now that I think about it, make toolbox effective as it is now.</p>

<p>IMO it just forces people to spam<br>
3 is unseen<br>
3 is unseen<br>
3 is unseen<br>
3 is unseen</p>
<p>When people know the hard limit, you can intentionally move past it. Plus even if you don’t say “repeat”, you say “did you say X”, and if there’s a “no I didn’t say that”, it doesn’t matter how many times he says it, you know there’s a trollbox interfering one way or the other.</p>

            <p>It’s still defeatable relatively easy though.</p>
<p>“3 did you actually say bob is unseen”<br>
3. Yes<br>
3. No I did not must be a trollbox<br>
3. Yes I did that was a trollbox</p>
<p>Even with the minor amount of subjectivity that is the possibility of a reverse trollbox (IE trollboxing legitimate claims to make them look like trollboxes), you still pretty much have it. The real trick to trollboxing effectively is to do it in statements that don’t trigger any alarms at the time, but are likely to be remembered later on.</p>
<p>I like doing simple things like “I was occupied”, then 2 days later he posts his logs, and I trollbox someone else<br>
“didn’t you say you were occupied day 2?”</p>
