<li>The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is “The Bailiff” which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin. The Bailiff gains a different ability depending on the scum faction.</li>
<li>There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.</li>
<li>All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.</li>
<li>Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.</li>
<li>There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> Psychoneirik<br>

<li>The Queen and all royals will have a private night chat. There will be a different chat for every day, and you are only allowed to talk on the most recent one.</li>
<li>When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it. Failure to do so might make you lose your spot.</li>
<li>Players are able to ask the host for flavor text or notifications to help with fake claiming.</li>
<li>Frame doesn’t work on Royal Guard’s Duel.</li>
<li>Frame will make the target appear to have visited whoever died that night to the Bailiff’s Interrogate ability.</li>
<li>Frame will make a player give the opposite records to a librarian.</li>
<li>If a framed player visits the gravekeeper’s Stalk target the Gravekeeper will be alerted.</li>
