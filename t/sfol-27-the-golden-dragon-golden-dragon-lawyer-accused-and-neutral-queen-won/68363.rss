    <description># Welcome to SFoL 27: The Golden Dragon


## This SFoL works like a normal SFoL with one twist: The Blue Dragon is replaced with:
&lt;big&gt;[color=orange]The Golden Dragon[/color]&lt;/big&gt;


The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:
- The Queen is a more &quot;Social&quot; version of the King.
- The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is &quot;The Bailiff&quot; which works as a nonconvertible Sheriff/Paladin. The Bailiff gains a different ability depending on the scum faction.
- There are no classes with royal blood, instead the Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.
- All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.
- Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.
- There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.
