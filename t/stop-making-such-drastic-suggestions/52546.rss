    <title>Stop making such drastic suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/stop-making-such-drastic-suggestions/52546</link>
    <description>A lot of recent suggestions are [i]waaaay[/i] too drastic given the scale of what they&#39;re trying to solve.  The game is, mostly, fun and interesting as it is; it doesn&#39;t have any serious, glaring, game-ruining flaws that would require severely altering or removing core systems.

We don&#39;t need to remove or drastically revise whispers.  Prior to the change that made kings usually-good, whispering the king wasn&#39;t even a major thing.  It can be fixed with more minor tweaks.

We don&#39;t need to drastically revise the Prince.  The Prince is [i]fine[/i].  Yes, it sucks when he dies early, but ToL still isn&#39;t really that swingy of a game overall.

And yes, I know I&#39;m guilty of occasionally overly-broad suggestions myself, but really, we should try and think of the most subtle / least-drastic way to achieve an intended goal.  Many of the things people are trying to address now are, after all, the result of previous sweeping changes that weren&#39;t fully thought-through; if we constantly make sweeping changes to the game, it&#39;s going to be hard to balance and hard for people to keep track of how the rules work at the moment.  We&#39;re better off trying more minor tweaks at first - new abilities or roles, or slight tweaks to existing ones, in ways that discourage or encourage things to go the way we want, rather than the blunt instrument of drastically altering something at the source.

Seriously, the top of the suggestions forum now is full of big sweeping changes intended to fix things that, while they&#39;re worth focusing on, are not [i]that[/i] big of a deal.</description>

            <p>Because it also stops king from being part of trusted groups or from giving evils info.</p>

            <p>Yeah honestly all these sweeping suggestions are getting old and a lot of them are… not good or well thought out. It feels like a random thing is picked every week where we decide it’s the worst thing ever and the make suggestions about how we should completely redesign the game from the ground up to solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Why not just make it so you can’t whisper to King? I like whispering and it’s one of my main ways to play the game. BUT the whisper to king meta is getting out of control. I think at least.</p>

            <p>For me personally, removing whispers is something I always wanted, but never really had the opportunity to talk about because they were never a problem before.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’m not the only one.</p>
