            <p>I just sped up time and you died through the bleed. It wasn’t intentional I swear. I legit read you as if you were my ally. I thought it would take 2 nights.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Both you and Geyde were super skeptical going into my alliance chat. That’s why it didn’t work out. I was sincere at the start, but your posts gave me red flags like crazy.</p>
<p>I don’t know what gave you the impression that I was not sincere. Reputation? Or how I went into the chat?</p>
