    <title>The pretender discussion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-pretender-discussion/71927</link>
    <description>What do you guys think of the new class added to throne of lies? After the long wait for a new neutral class we get The Pretender and I can say I was almost 100% disappointed. I thought there was so many good ideas we suggested for a new neutral class. 

The new class just seems very plain with finding royal blood and trying to become king. Even afterwords when you are king good luck surviving woth no guards

 My personal opinion is that this class was created to add more claim space to the game.  My wishes for the future is that they add new abilities to this and introduced a new mechanic to the game 

Tel me what you think</description>

</aside>
<p>of random curriosity has anyone managed to get voted up as pretender via methods other than pre-psycho king NK meta (IE outright announcing pretender at the election and hopping the BD favors a neutral king to a possible evil king)</p>

            <p>Personally I don’t mind Pretender. Night immunity is nice. I just sit back and try to come up with a good claim and some good logs. Today I claimed Sheriff, gained the courts trust until a Paladin was killed. Then the King was killed. There were only a handful of us left and I staight up told everybody I was Pretender, got voted in. We exed the remaining BD and won.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe she could have more effective day abilities (maybe I need more practice)</p>

            <p>hasnt it already been established this is a class you actually have to play the game to win as. its not just another old alch where you win most of the time because your a second better phys. there is no point in claiming pretender because it doesnt side with bd and never will as its a nuetral class. after you become king you have to decide whether to side with bd and risk getting killed by evils or side with evils and risk getting hung. its a decently high skill class after all.</p>

            <p>That is understandable. I know what classes they new but I have played as the class twice now.  In one game I openly claimed and in another game i stayed silent.  In games where I openly claimed or other people openly claimed they were ignored or killed. In games where people tried to secretly become king by claiming a BD class or when I tried to do that, they were usually killed before coming king.</p>
