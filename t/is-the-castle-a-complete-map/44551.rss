    <title>Is the castle a complete map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/is-the-castle-a-complete-map/44551</link>
    <description>I noticed there&#39;s a lot of detail in the rooms you can see from the throne room.  Out of curiosity, is Throne of Lies&#39; castle a complete map, with the rooms the players go to each night all physically present in it and arranged in a logical way?  If so, is the complete map visible anywhere?</description>

            <p>I think he means that whether during the playthrough, the location can be visualized into a complete map of adriat castle?</p>

            <p>I don’t understand what you’re asking.  The players don’t “go to” the rooms, they’re just background scenery.  They’re not arranged in any way because they don’t interact with the game other than to provide a visually appealing background while you type and press buttons.</p>
