Lore Subject: An Interview with a Butler

Lore: 

It&#39;s very interesting living the life of a Butler in the king&#39;s court. The faithful Butler takes care of all the minor issues that the king is far above in his daily routine. Ever Faithful to his liege the Butler&#39;s loyalty is a cornerstone of our great worth ethic here in Adiart. Even one with low class blood can provide a direct service to his majesty and his children. We asked the Kings current Butler what it means to work at the castle:

&quot;It&#39;s a privilege of the highest calibur to serve my Liege in such a troubling time. It is my duty to ensure his attention be on the matters that truly besiege our fair kingdom. I entertain his guests and provide the attentiveness worthy of his majesty&#39;s grace. Of course this includes keeping a steady supply of wine, ensuring meals are properly arranged, keeping sir and madams clothes immaculate at all times, sending and receiving messages and ensuring at all times that the reputation of the kingdom is up-kept to his majesty&#39;s exemplary standards. Any Butler worth his salt will ensure that the good kings wishes are upheld even at the expense of his own life. Of course this doesn&#39;t mean my life is entirely devoted to his majesty&#39;s pleasure. I often find that resting improves my efficiency and with his majesty&#39;s leave I get half a day off every Sunday to partake in my own pleasures amongst the townsfolk. I do find beauty in the world outside the castle and am privileged to have such an understanding liege. &quot;

Comment: Here to show a butler&#39;s attitude towards his role and a Butlers life of devotion. I tried to take inspiration from the Butlers of the 1920&#39;s attitudes to make it authentic.</description>

            <p>I did. Did you not see him casually mention about sending and receiving messages? I doubt a Butler would converse much about his secret network on how to send messages to people without others knowing XD</p>
