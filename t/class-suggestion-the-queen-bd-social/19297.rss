    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Queen (BD Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-queen-bd-social/19297</link>
    <description>The Queen is a non-guaranteed unique BD social role. She has great voting power whenever the King is involved and she can also help BD give leads to the King without fear of being outed to an evil king.

**Passive ability 1**
You cannot step up for king. 

**Passive ability 2**
When voting for a new king, or when voting to pardon or execute the current King your vote counts as three. 
&gt;_Comments: I know it&#39;s powerful, but it is also really situational since it only affects the King._

**Day ability 1**
Force a player to step up for King as if they had Royal Blood. 1 use.
&gt;_Comments: Situational ability but along with her second passive this can help secure a BD King._

**Night ability 1**
Select a player. They will be able to send anonymous messages to the King for the rest of the night. Can target yourself. Unlimited uses.

&gt;_Comments: Allows people to give leads to King without fear of being outed by an Evil King._

**Night ability 2**
You will know who the king sends their guards to tonight. 2 uses
&gt;_Comments: If well timed, this can help you find out if the King is evil. This will also make Evil Kings play more carefully when there is a Queen alive._

**Consort (Unseen social)**
**Passive ability 1**
You cannot step up for king. 

**Passive ability 2**
When voting for a new king, or when voting to pardon or execute the current King your vote counts as three. 
&gt;_Comments: The main advantage of the Consort over other converted classes is the ability to secure an Evil King along with her day ability._

**Day ability 1**
Force a player to step up for King as if they had Royal Blood. 1 use.
&gt;_Comments: This can help secure an Evil King. This could also be used to force an important BD role like the sheriff or prince to become King, thus making them lose their normal abilities._

**Night ability 1**
Select a player. They will be able to send anonymous messages to the King for the rest of the night. Can target yourself. Unlimited uses.

&gt;_Comments: Allows the unseen to give false leads to King._</description>

            <p>I’ve been considering a Queen class. Although it’s nothing like your suggestion. Mine is a unique, unconvertable Blue Dragon that takes the spot of the Prince. So in any given game, you will have either a Prince or a Queen, but not both.</p>
<p>I was thinking her abilities would involve making her target unconvertable. I like the idea of choosing the king’s target with Allies. I guess as far as he knows it could have been a CW that caused him to change targets? Going with your idea though, I don’t think the Queen should be convertable. Seems a bit too powerful. But I like the concept for while she is BD aligned.</p>
