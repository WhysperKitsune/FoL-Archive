            <p>I would expect a class with the problem of being recognized as having an excellent other ability, such as infinite making player’s stop talking and knowing who recognized them, so as to silence them.</p>

            <p>This one is blatantly underpowered.<br>
The Reaper can make others clam up, can use souls to pierce Night Immunity.<br>
The Possessor can make others to attack someone else, which shields them from Knight Protection(actually the Knight will kill the Possessed) and is immune to occupation.</p>
<p>And those two are <em>underpowered</em>, they rarely win unless converted into the King(which should not be an easy way out but is currently)<br>
Your suggestion is a killer who basically kills someone they were not visited by only, that always pierces Night Immunity, <strong>that does not even have Night Immunity at all</strong> and…<br>
that does not even have anything else than one killing ability and one ability to ease up its weakness!<br>
Also, there is a good reason why MM has Night Immunity(its death is horrible for Unseen) and that one should not be able to be pierced with ease</p>

            <p>okay<br>
maybe for lore, they dont recognize the person during the day because they only saw the person while they were wearing the mask?</p>
