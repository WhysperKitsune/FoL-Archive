    <description>Sometimes it can be hard to follow someones train of thought if the chat is active. What if there was two chat windows, the normal one like we have now, and another one where you could isolate one or more players and you could only see what they have said during the game.

So if I press on 4 in that window I only see what 4 has said all game long, if i press on 4 and 8 i get both their chats for the reminder of the game. It could also be useful if I could select all whispers in that window to only read whisper two and from me, or just see all whisper logs from all players.

In general I think we could extract a lot more info with a system sorta like this, and make the games a bit more high level. I</description>
