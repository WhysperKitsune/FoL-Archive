    <description>Hey folks,

The combined forum and Discord community is **the** best &quot;**guild**&quot; of people I&#39;ve ever encountered. If you are reading this, you are one of these community members we&#39;re referring to that is extra-awesome. Everyone helps each other, is friendly, knowledgeable, resourceful, and we almost never need to ban _anyone_ here. It&#39;s a haven.

## The Backstory/Issue

However, every now and then there will be players in-game that bring about toxicity in some form. I was reviewing our [Steam reviews](http://store.steampowered.com/app/595280) and most issues seem to involve &quot;toxicity&quot; (in some form) for those that are not part of our _guild_.

Due to this, we want you guys to have an awesome experience and have crafted what may arguably be one of the most fluent and transparent human moderation systems that indie games can offer **(more info below)**:

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/heres-what-happens-after-you-report-a-player-your-reports-matter/49294

___________________________

While we&#39;re super proud of our system and you can see that your reports do something in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/tol) **#justice** channel, there&#39;s one major double-edged sword:

## Revenge Reviews

Let&#39;s discuss some possibilities to potentially [and reasonably] alter our system where we can moderate without developer backlash. Some players will even revenge review for just a warning or a 1-day suspension. Sometimes with up to 800 hours logged.

Up until now, we have been providing additional awareness factors for proof of such a review, but this requires investigation, research, and time. We want to try thinking deeper to think how we can avoid this.

**As a community-based game, we are reaching out to our players for ideas.**

## Here is what we have tried:

* Provide a screenshot with proof of logs (to prevent &quot;Banned for nothing&quot; reviews)

* Added additional information within suspension messages (date/time unbanned)

* Unless extra-bad, scale from warning &gt;&gt; 1d suspension &gt;&gt; 3d &gt;&gt; 7d &gt;&gt; etc.

## Here is what we CANNOT do:
Some of these may be obvious, as we need to respect Valve&#39;s rules; but just in case, we cannot:

* Ask for a review in-game (like annoying mobile apps)

* Exchange something for a review

* Issue disciplinary action for a revenge review

## Here are the ideas we&#39;ve had, but passed on:
* **Bad guys queue instead of a suspension.** We can&#39;t do this because it takes 16 players for a game and we don&#39;t have _that_ many players suspended at once. Generally, after the first suspension or warning, **most players STOP being toxic** (which is a good thing). This would only work for ~2 player games.

* **Only issue warnings**. If there&#39;s no real suspension, people will just keep going.

## Current ideas that may work:
* **3-Strike rule.** 
Instead of suspensions, we ONLY issue warnings. After 3 strikes within x amount of time, players are suspended for 1 year.

* **Continue with current system, but :insert some really smart change:** 
Our system works well, but we need a way to prevent revenge reviews that also complies with Valve (Steam)&#39;s terms of service. Revenge reviews are really making the devs stressed out and requires additional resources that we could be using to make the game better.

## Conclusion
The better we moderate, the more potential for revenge reviews. This makes moderation a bit tough -- we need some changes, somehow. We could use your help surveying:

* Do you like or dislike [the way we moderate](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/heres-what-happens-after-you-report-a-player-your-reports-matter/49294)?

* What are your thoughts about how we handle moderation?

* How would you improve our moderation system?

* **Psychologically speaking, let&#39;s dive into their mind:** 
If you were suspended for 1-day for racism, what would discourage you from revenge reviewing?

* Any other ideas to allow us to moderate without potentially receiving backlash?

            <p>As we sometimes see on <span class="hashtag">#justice</span>, there have been some users who have been suspended, but other people that use imgur screenshots of end game or what have you if applicable in order to use as evidence, you can see some people actually seem to be baiting. It will as you said Blade, be impossible to suspend everyone and does not go against the rules as such. As Cheesy said, it’s better for no punishment unless they have done something that breaks another rule.</p>
<p>Another thing, wait if it is genuine and it isn’t baiting? IT’s hard to determine if this is the case or not, so they would most likely be found innocent since everyone could say that they had no intention to bait and say it was an honest mistake.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>If you were suspended for 1-day for racism, what would discourage you from revenge reviewing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was suspended 3 days for naming myself “Heil Hitler” (my first and only offense).  If I were a revenge reviewer, that would have triggered me.  The punishment was excessive considering the options of a 1-day suspension or even just a warning (which would’ve sufficed).</p>
<p>I have not reviewed the game yet, but if I did, I would say the pros are its the best in its genre by far and there are always new updares.   The cons would be too low of a skill ceiling (this game easily has potential to have a much higher skill ceiling when a vet lobby is implemented) and moderation is too harsh regarding offensive jokes.</p>

<p>for those who are afraid of words on a computer screen</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmm, I think you underestimate the type of reports we receive. It’s not just about words – you only have a very limited time to debate/interrogate/process information and if 1/2 the chat is spammed with all-caps racial slurs, often contributing 0 useful words an entire game. This disrupts the game and leaves a slimy feeling. It’s not like people are using words as an empowering adjective like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s f–ing guilty”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those reports don’t go through. Heck, in that phrase he at least progressed the game and that’s perfectly fine. It’s when you go spammy/off-topic with toxicity is when it causes trouble.</p>

            <p><em>BREATH IN</em><br>
I feel as if moderation is too centered around feelings, just because my words could hurt someone’s precious little feelings when they made a bad play doesn’t mean I should be punished for speaking the truth. Hell I am writing this as politely as possible so I don’t get a warning. Sticks and stone may break bones but words never hurt. as <a class="mention" href="/u/poopmaster">@poopmaster</a> said a friendly welcoming community won’t just spring out of the ground after harsh bans and flagrant censorship.</p>
<p>I believe that AFKers/Leavers/Gamethrowers are the problem, not people’s words. Now I’m not saying the report system is bad, it’s fucking amazing but I would like a bit more transparency, like show us a brief summary of the mods review in the justice log and just not the reason they were suspended. If we shift away from words and “toxic” people and focus on people who are actually ruining games. I realize once mud is slung and it is slung back and it keeps going on the game is ruined, but we can avoid that be just ignoring them</p>

            <p>I understand where you are coming from and I do agree to an extent, but there is no reason why both throwing and toxicity cannot be moderated together. I do think it is up to the developers to see which one carries a higher weight. Fundamental disagreement it is.</p>
<p>I am not sure on this, as a moderator themself could better address your concerns, but a player actually has to report another person to put that person on a moderator’s radar. In that sense it is the community’s voice on what is deemed acceptable and what is not, and not the moderator’s themselves, so it is not simply them imposing their worldviews on all players. Someone actively was bothered by someone to the point that they deemed it necessary to report them.</p>
<p>In the same sense as you tried to trivialize that words on a computer screen can hurt someone. I can say that you are trying to make the argument that some other game-result words on a computer screen are hurting them more. It’s just words, it’s just a game.</p>
<p>I also don’t see how racial/homophobic slurs, or naming your character after some serial killer/deadly disease/recent school shooting/whatever can really be seen as helpful to the community organically growing, because they are allowed such expression.</p>

<p>The words you use can hurt people. Please choose them with appropriate care. Take this as an opportunity to adjust and improve the way you interact with others. The game will be more fun for everybody if you do.</p>

            <p>imo there’s a difference between being a jerk and being toxic, and we shouldn’t punish people chosing to be jerks</p>
<p>Being mean, insulting people’s actions, etc. should be allowed</p>
<p>Using slurs to do so? No.<br>
Making threats outside of the context of the game? No.<br>
Repeated and targeted harassment of a player’s character? No.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how strict the moderation is on this front at the moment, but I would be concerned if slinging insults at players you feel are dumb could get you a warning.</p>
<p>Also a chat filter is a great idea, just make attempting to bypass it a reportable offense and bam.</p>

            <p>Appreciate you getting back to me on this.  I feel like we have a fundamental disagreement if you honestly think that someone using “toxic” language ruins a game more than a person who actually decisively alters the gameplay of the match intentionally to create what is essentially a waste of everyone’s time.  It isn’t ‘refreshing’ at all actually, it’s a plague in gaming that moderators think it’s up to them to decide what is kosher language and what is not.  “Toxicity” and “harsh language” are very abstract industry terms that devs like to vaguely throw around in order to enforce moderation as they see fit - it blurs the line and almost always leads to administrative abuse.</p>
<p>The fact that mods think they can “oust toxic behavior” through censorship is an unattainable farce, and really speaks to the undeserved savior complex they have - which usually includes their own personal opinions as well.  I honestly think the best way to handle the issue is to create a chat filter, make it as PC as possible censoring as many words as the admin team can possibly find offensive; then give players the ability to turn the chat filter ON or OFF.  Many games, including Overwatch, use this function and it works very well.  It allows a safe space for those who are afraid of words on a computer screen, and a space for those who don’t mind such things.  I think you’ll be surprised how many people will choose to have their game experience NOT censored.</p>
<p>A friendly welcoming community won’t just spring out of the ground after harsh bans and flagrant censorship, it will come when the community is allowed to grow organically through their own expression, and respect from moderators who pay attention to gameplay and not terminology they find offensive.</p>
