    <title>[Class idea] Sorcerer/warlock (large edit)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-idea-sorcerer-warlock-large-edit/2116</link>
    <description>I&#39;m aware other players have suggested other classes named warlock, but this one is different.

**Sorcerer**
Blue dragon offensive

**Hellish rebuke** (Day, 2 uses) Any player who attacks you the following night will be occupied the next two nights (This bypasses occupy immunity)
**Self-destruct** (night, 1 use):  Kill yourself. Reveals the class of every player who visited you the night you use this the following day (x, the y, visited the sorcerer last night)
**Forcecage** (night, infinite uses) (You do not visit target) target player is occupied 


**Converted class (warlock)**
Unseen Offensive
**One with shadows** (passive) If you do not use any ability at night, you will be seen as the sorcerer to investigators.
**bestow curse** (night, infinite uses) target is occupied until you use this ability again, die, or are occupied yourself.
**Temporary Damnation** (Day, 1 use) Target leaves an empty body (as though they were reaped,) and returns to it at the end of three days, supposing they were not murdered in that time.</description>

<p>This would pretty much alert people to a Warlock, and if somebody claimed Sorcerer they are getting hanged in two days.</p>

            <p>Basically you’ve got some really cool ideas here but it seems like you rushed the last few abilities to finish the class. If you build on the clearly weaker abilities/scrap them and start again I can see it being a really interesting role.</p>

            <p>The BD passive seems anti-BD and slightly random? Not sure about that. Likewise Erase Memory seems cool at first glance but it is convuluted and has little to no applicability or real practicality to it.</p>
<p>Shock, the main ability of the Unseen role needs to be reworked entirely as it’s literally just evil court wizards.</p>

            <p>Magic surge: Possibility to edit it so that this only happens once</p>
<p>self-destruct: One person said this is extremely powerful, another said it is detrimental to yourself. This ability is supposed to be used sparingly, as it <strong>can</strong> be detrimental to self, but also <strong>can</strong> be good to your faction.The reason it has infinite uses is because I assumed that the sorcerer would die the first time they used it.</p>
<p>Erase memory: [quote=“ThePlex, post:6, topic:2116”]<br>
Again… hurting your own faction… let’s say you used it on Sheriff. And Infinite uses? That’s very unbalanced. If you found Mastermind, you could essentially keep them alive and just use it over and over until you’ve gotten rid of Assassin + Other potential converts<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Suppose the butler role blocked a fellow blue dragon member. He would have hurt his own faction. In regard to your mastermind criticism, I can see how this would be a problem; perhaps a rule could be implemented that once you use it on a player, you cannot use it on that player again.</p>
<p>Drain life[quote=“ThePlex, post:6, topic:2116”]<br>
What… how would this go un-noticed?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The point is that players need to figure it out for themselves. If no player gets enough votes the next day, then it will go unnoticed. Also, many evil roles out themselves after doing an ability, such as the illusionist’s ability to erase from the chat log.<br>
I agree that the name of the ability needs reworking, suggestions are accepted.</p>
<p>Conjure nightshade:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what Forage is for, this is a bad idea</p>

<p>The idea is the assassin could kill this night AND gain nightshade,</p>

 JammySplodge:</div>

<p>No absolutely not</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would be willing to rework this to lower the uses of this ability to 1 or 2. Other than that, it is not overpowered.</p>
<p>Teleport: [quote=“JammySplodge, post:5, topic:2116”]<br>
This could work but I feel it being infinite would be a little too powerful<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Many classes have multiple night abilities.I can understand the concern, though; lowering to three would be appropriate, I feel.</p>

What… how would this go un-noticed? People are a lot smarter and know exactly how many votes are needed with the number of alive players. By that point, you’d have been outted and they’d know you exist. And how has that got to do with anything related to draining a life?</font></p>

            <p>I’m aware other players have suggested other classes named warlock, but this one is different.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer</strong><br>
Blue dragon offensive</p>
<p><strong>Hellish rebuke</strong> (Day, 2 uses) Any player who attacks you the following night will be occupied the next two nights (This bypasses occupy immunity)<br>
<strong>Self-destruct</strong> (night, 1 use):  Kill yourself. Reveals the class of every player who visited you the night you use this the following day (x, the y, visited the sorcerer last night)<br>
<strong>Forcecage</strong> (night, infinite uses) (You do not visit target) target player is occupied</p>
<p><strong>Converted class (warlock)</strong><br>
Unseen Offensive<br>
<strong>One with shadows</strong> (passive) If you do not use any ability at night, you will be seen as the sorcerer to investigators.<br>
<strong>bestow curse</strong> (night, infinite uses) target is occupied until you use this ability again, die, or are occupied yourself.<br>
<strong>Temporary Damnation</strong> (Day, 1 use) Target leaves an empty body (as though they were reaped,) and returns to it at the end of three days, supposing they were not murdered in that time.</p>
