<p>This is a very good question… I believe we prefer this way to encourage people to stay throughout with a chance to rejoin. If we code this, we’d likely aim for beta and have it ready for release. I’m not sure if we can make it to alpha… But we’ll see <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ask me again in 2 months haha. I’d say 80 percent change we’d do this.</p>

That way we can find it later when we’re ready to code in more classes, if we take the suggestion in! It’ll also give others a nice template of where to post class suggestions ~</p>

            <p>so would it be read out like this</p>
<p>orphan (Neutral Wild Class</p>
<p>Night ability 1) on day 1 or 2 you can pick someone to become your father figure. should your father figure die you will become his role If you pick a Blue dragon member and targeted by the mastermind when your target dies you become the black rose version otherwise immune to convert</p>
<p>(back story version<br>
on one rainy day, you were begging for food eating the scraps you got barely able to survive. until 1 fortune day you met a stranger who took pity on you, he took you back the castle, where you gained a better place to live. however not long after you began trying as a knight hand’s</p>
<p>years later he died killed by the black rose later that day you took your father’s sword and vowed to end the reign of the black rose once and for ever</p>
<p>Back story Blackrose version</p>
<p>You always lived a terrible life you were always a slave nothing more than a tool it was like that even since you were a kid nothing but work and the worse of bread. it’s a miracle your even alive. however, you grew tired and kept getting your master did not approve. as he yelled at a knife came from the back slaying your master, a figure in a cloaked robe offered you a new life, a life you could not refuse. this day you joined the black rose.</p>
<p>since then you have had but 1 purpose rule the throne</p>
<p>How do you think?</p>

<p>for 1 is it neutral because I don’t see a black rose member helping the cult out? who’s side is it on</p>
<p>The 2nd Point I have is it’s kinda weird because the max number of black rose members seems to only be 2 so you could only change what 1 member is seen as</p>
<p>The final point with is what is the blue dragon version because the point of black rose is to convert the blue dragon to their cause saying that this is only for the black rose defies all that</p>

<p>Hi there – I can clarify a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Cult is their own faction – Correct: They will not defend the Black Rose</li>
<li>The Black Rose will <strong>start</strong> with two people. There can be a max of 4 (2 converted). This may change over the course of alpha/beta <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> let’s see what people think and can always tweak balance later.</li>

            <p>if it a good king he will become good noble man. if its a bad king he will become bad noble man. if cult leader he will become a cult if cult leader dies ( same if he chooses a cult member) however if he is cult when the mastermind dies he will become cult leader. if cult when mastermind dies he will  become a cult leader however if there is one he will kill the cult leader to take his place. if in black rose then he will become the mastermind. if blue dragon he will become a new role that converts black rose/ cult back to blue dragon. except for the leaders</p>
<p>the role should be called orphan because he needs a father figure</p>

            <p>From my current understanding specials roles such as king, cult leader, mastermind will only have 1 player in the game as those roles, unless a noble becomes king or a cult member is made cult leader, (no idea what happens with master mind)</p>
<p>i was hoping you could give a more indepth explaiontion on how these roles affected by the child/kid/Heir/ what ever sounds cool</p>

            <p>btw if the kid is converted he will still become that role just that he will become the black rose version and your ideas will go perfect with this role also picking n1 or 2 will have its advantages because if your converted you can have black rose kill. if converted to cult the only chance you have to change is cult leader die you will have to have choose them. however if you dont choose and are converted n2 or 1 you will become the leader of black rose or cult</p>

            <p>nothing to be sorry about ideas is meant to be expressed changed and improved</p>
<p>and with that kid idea, it’s really good. I think that would fit in with the Wild Class the most.</p>
<p>so do you have to choose who your father is day 1 or 2? and if they don’t choose it will be random?</p>
<p>simple yet effective</p>

            <p>i assumed cult was with black rose. must have misread.</p>
<p>he could disguise himself.</p>
<p>maybe you can help me with the third im kind of thinking that he can use someones role the next night after he disguises as them. if he disquises as cult/ black rose he will not see names while in their chat and will not be able to use their role. if  it is a killing role. however he now knows anyone role so yea kind of an invest 2</p>

            <p>im sorry for putting so many but im so hyped for this game and want to help any way i can.</p>
<p>maybe there can be kid role where the kid chooses someone to be their father figure n1 or 2 (so they dont choose someone because they know their role). when that person dies the kid will become that role. if king dies the kid will become a nobleman good if king was good but bad if king was bad.</p>

            <p>its a good start but I see many problems with it,</p>
<p>for 1 is it neutral because I don’t see a black rose member helping the cult out? who’s side is it on</p>
<p>The 2nd Point I have is it’s kinda weird because the max number of black rose members seems to only be 2 so you could only change what 1 member is seen as</p>
<p>The final point with is what is the blue dragon version because the point of black rose is to convert the blue dragon to their cause saying that this is only for the black rose defies all that</p>
<p>Apart from that all it has potential and a good basis to use for something cool</p>

            <p>maybe a role like deceiver. the role disguise anyone in the black rose or cult as someone else. meaning if john (deceiver) disguises Harold (cult/blackrose) as vik (any role) harold will come up as viks role if a sheriff views him. however if vik is viewed he will still be his role.</p>
<p>also if a observer watches someone and  Harold attacks that person it will come up as vik. same will go if john disguises any other black rose or cult. however if observer watches harold he will see him being disguised.</p>
<p>fell free to say this is bad or to change anything. im not really good with this stuff this role can really backfire if you disguise someone as prince or assassin so on</p>
