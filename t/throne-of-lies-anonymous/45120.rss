    <description>Hi, my name is Charlie... and i&#39;m a Throne of Lies addict.  I sometimes binge play for 8-10 hours a day.  Every time i say it&#39;ll be my last game for the day.  But the excitement of starting a new game and getting a (hopefully) new class is too much.  Sometimes even if i dont wanna play, i&#39;ll play anyway because i like doodling on deathnotes.  does anybody else... care to share their story?</description>
