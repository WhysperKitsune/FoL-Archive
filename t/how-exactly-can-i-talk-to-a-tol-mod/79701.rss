    <title>How exactly can I talk to a ToL mod?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-exactly-can-i-talk-to-a-tol-mod/79701</link>
    <description>As you all may know, I am currently banned from the ToL server.

I have found people in the pre-game lobby that broke rules
I can&#39;t report them.

I have found bugs in this game.
I cannot post logs here.
I haven&#39;t gotten any response by anyone on the posts.
I currently cannot play ToL because I physically cannot get in.

I was banned for supposedly advertising my Twitch...
...While I was streaming ToL, putting it in the right place.

Either let me help your game, or don&#39;t. But you have to realize that you can&#39;t be this hard on your players. Your game is dying, XBlade. I know you have to enforce rules, but imaginary crimes and breaking invisible rules are what&#39;s keeping me from helping you fix the Windows 7 game. I can&#39;t nominate you for an award because I don&#39;t know if It&#39;s any good anymore.

<ul>
<li>In a game of 16 players, if the guy was truly reportable, rest assured that there will be 14 other players to report them.</li>
<li>You can take a screenshot and send us the imgur link at the end-of-game report</li>
<li>You can DM a Judge+ here where you have community privs. Priestess above already offered.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are multiple ways to do this. However, I’m going to lock this since it’s public ban/appeal discussion.</p>

If you can’t upload a file you could probably find a workaround, eg. a text sharing site. Or just pasting it in a spoiler.</p>

<p>If you’re on Windows 7, that should be fixed as of Nov. 14.<br>
If you’re on Mac/Linux, I can try and get you a picture of the workarounds in discord if you’d like.</p>
<p>But as <s>Mom</s> Priestess said, there’s ToL Mods on this forums. If you don’t see them around, though, there’s a fair number of active guides and judges who could get you into contact with a Mod.</p>

            <p>… I mean, you’re talking to a ToL Judge right now, and you definitely can dm the mods too here…<br>
if you want to appeal, public isn’t the right place for it<br>
Btw the Win7 problem is fixed, we Win7 people can play again.</p>
