    <title>King pointed finger after he was chilled by Reaper</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/king-pointed-finger-after-he-was-chilled-by-reaper/46897</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
4 players left in game: Good King, Alch, Obs (who was already reaped at night) and Reaper (me). I chilled King after he accused me but before he pointed finger (see attached screenshot). Nevertheless he still was able to point finger. This put me on the trial and Alch was able to exe me. This bug (I suppose?) made me lose cause otherwise I would be accused 2 times (Alch&#39;s vote + King&#39;s vote without finger) and that would not put me on the trial. Then at night I would reap King and win.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
King would not be able to point finger after he was chilled.

#### Steps to reproduce:

#### Comments:
This is actually a stupid mechanics. The one who can press button faster: King (point finger) or Reaper (icy touch) wins.![bug|690x388](upload://pvKilMgO3De95Vr7djiIECL1RYN.jpg)</description>

            <p>Well I guess Icy Touch prevents from using daily abilities. So it should not cancel vote but should prevent King from getting double vote.</p>

            <p>The royal finger is not a vote, it empowers the vote. What you should be asking for is chill to cancel a player’s vote too.</p>
