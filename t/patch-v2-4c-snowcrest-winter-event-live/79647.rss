____________________

## v2.4.0c

* **[Snowcrest](https://tol.fandom.com/wiki/Snowcrest)** event is live
* Merc &quot;Shield&quot; charges now go away after successful use
* Poacher can now speak with Unseen
* Objective-based classes (eg, Inquisitor, Scorned) will now trigger the popup/win properly
* Objective-based classes should now see proper feedback in chat when partially-completing objectives
* Objective popup was unsatisfying and is now styled a bit
* Fixed some visual vote messages for &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;today&quot; mixing up
* Neutral Killers should now be able to win the way they&#39;re supposed to
* Pretender no longer stands on her chair in her night room
* Fixed starting faction colors @ end screen
* Exhume is no longer cancelable from the parent icon to prevent multi-use exploits (use the &quot;x&quot; at the popup)
* Noble + Aristocrat are now *Royals*, once again
* Timesnatcher&#39;s &quot;Rewind&quot; should now be working properly
* Fixed multiple Trollbox exploits during Trial that had to do with a lingering popup box
* Poisoned Wine is now usable at d4+ instead of d2+
* Both Sorc abilities should be available now during trial
* Several winning/game over fixes (needs more testing, but should be better than it was).
* Prevent dupe classes in Winners header text, such as &quot;Alchemist, Alchemist&quot;
* Send Selection fixes
* Clarification: King takes arrow if you slam Hunter. *This is intended.*
* Probably more fixes that I forgot to write down.

It&#39;s not every fix, yet, but figured smaller patches are better since these fixes are just lingering here!</description>
