    <title>Unban the ability to use certain names</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/unban-the-ability-to-use-certain-names/62073</link>
    <description>To me, it makes no sense that we aren&#39;t able to name ourselves &#39;Evil King&#39;, for example. But yet we can change 1 letter and make the name &#39;Evil Kang&#39; and it passes the filter? I mean, unless you&#39;re going to ban every single iteration possible of a name, it seems pointless to ban it at all. There will always be a way to get around this, and all it does is limit people needlessly.

On top of that, no one refers to players by their name in the first place. If you want to state that &quot;Evil King [4] is Unseen&quot; you would just say &quot;4 is Unseen&quot;. That is how all the players do it. Why limit them from calling themselves &#39;Evil King&#39;?

I guess all this &#39;name unavailable&#39; stuff started with all the &quot;Vow of ____&quot; roleplayers. This _should_ be a case of banning the roleplayer, not the name. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being able to name ourselves things as long as we actually play normally, and not like a roleplayer. If we want to name ourselves &#39;Mastermind&#39; and we&#39;re actually Butler, as long as we play like a Butler, what&#39;s the problem?

And the last reason why name banning makes no sense..
I had a game the other night where someone literally named themself &quot;CP&quot;.**[1]** I think most of us know what those letters represent -- he used the actual words, not the letters. We all voted to execute him regardless of his role on d2. I just want to know why fun and harmless names are banned by the filter... yet this guy was able to name himself CP. That&#39;s messed up. Maybe add **THAT** to the filter?! Plus, as I said, we all voted to execute him based on his name alone, and he turned out to be BD. People with names like that do way more damage to the gameplay than someone naming themselves after a role.

Unban the ability to name ourselves things like &#39;Evil King&#39;, &#39;Mastermind&#39;, etc. Especially if you aren&#39;t gonna add actual disgusting names to the filter. Ban the roleplayers, not the names.

**[1]** CP is the thing a pedo would have in their history/on their PC that they would get arrested for. And this player used the actual words, not the initials.</description>

<p>I disagree with people saying it’s confusing or malicious. Outside of maybe 3 names, I don’t see the point of having name bans. I don’t think another wall of text will make me see the point, either.</p>

</aside>
<p>My logic is not “bad names are allowed so these should also be allowed,” but rather “these names should be allowed.” The fact that bad names are allowed was meant to provide support to that statement.</p>
<p>I also don’t see why people want ALL class names banned, when it seems like it’s only 2-3 of them that cause issues in the first place. Just ban ‘prince,’ ‘mystic,’ and ‘telepathy’ then? Problem solved, we can unban everything else.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a reason not to, and people have been saying it through the whole thread. Malicious intent, like trying to metagame by calling yourself mystic and pretending to telepathy, especially if you’re evil and the confusion benefits you. And, the whole thread people have been saying that bad names <em>are not</em> in fact okay, but the filter isn’t perfect and doesn’t cover every horrible thing that has ever existed. A more elegant solution than having the create a megafilter would be to do the obvious thing and report the person who is setting the name that is found offensive, and eliminate the problem at its roots. Then, seeing as someone used the name, it will most likely get added to the filter anyway, so it covers that too. I don’t understand why you think this point hasn’t been driven home yet, but I felt a wall of text might solve that.</p>

            <p>Your logic is still completely warped.<br>
“This one bad phrase got through the filter so you should let me name myself King”<br>
I think the biggest question here is why you want to name yourself King so badly? I’ll reiterate here that there are only two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>you’re extremely uncreative</li>
<li>you have malicious intent</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no good reason to name yourself the specific class names. It’s funny to you but annoying or confusing for everyone else. You can say all you want that there are ways around the filter, but it’s there to help combat players from just naming themselves Prince or Mystic or King. At least with names like Kang you can glance at it and notice the difference.</p>

            <p>Hmm. Didn’t think of that.</p>
<p>But, this just goes back to my point about it being impossible (and also a bad idea to try) to ban every iteration of a banned name. IMO, only the really bad stuff should be banned at all, yet ironically it seems those words aren’t banned.</p>

            <p>Well just to clear things up. “CP” is a normal way of phrasing it, and is so much used by the news, I thought everyone knew that. they use “CP” instead of the whole word, and that I think most news site today phrase it as.</p>
<p>Well continuing on the topic that was first raised, I think it can become a bit annoying that there are some words that are banned, that we players need to rephrase it all the time to get a name, I don’t mind if if someone names them self king, as it would not be a big confusion, cause your allowed to name yourself phys, or alch. and those are the same thing as king IMO, as mostly people use phys and alch to discribbe this classes instead of the full word. I don’t see what it would hurt to unban those banned names.</p>

            <p>Maybe you should realize that, for some things, it’s bad enough I don’t want to just type it? I don’t want to get put on a watch list or something. It’s not a phrase that should be said, imo, and it’s not a big deal for me to tell a moderator to go look it up. Moderators are no better than anyone else, and common courtesy would demand they don’t act that way, either.</p>

            <p>I’ve worked it out now as people have said it<br>
when someone, especially a moderator, asks you a question, common courtesy is to answer it, not go “look it up yourself exdee”</p>

            <p>Did you actually want to be told the definition of CP or not?</p>
<p>I mean first you pretend you don’t know what it means and I tell you to look it up, then you ask me “which definition” out of 50 or something, and I tell you the urban dictionary one, and <em>then</em> you respond saying you’d never trust urban dictionary?</p>
<p>If you don’t actually want the definition and jsut want to troll, I’m done chatting with you.</p>

<p>If you want to state that “Evil King [4] is Unseen” you would just say “4 is Unseen”. That is how all the players do it.</p>

<p>Even here you would still need to ban the names “4” and “Unseen”</p>
