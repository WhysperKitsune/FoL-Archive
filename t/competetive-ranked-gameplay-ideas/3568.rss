    <description>## Rules
1. I would like this topic to gather all ideas, thoughts, feedback and comments about competetive/ranked gameplay ideas.
2. Do not talk about &quot;if competetive is needed&quot;. Do not cry or shout that current game mode is fun and enough and that ranked idea is bad.
3. Avoid writing opinions like &quot;i love the idea&quot;, &quot;i hate the idea&quot;, without backup of thought-through arguments.
4. If you&#39;d like me to extend/correct something in this post - send me a message instead of commenting.

## Reasoning
Casual players are fine with no ranked system. It&#39;s ok. They don&#39;t like pressure to win. They want to be happy after either win/lose. That is why a lot of players will tell you - there is no need in creating ranked system.

They are wrong. Other group of players, usually called by game devs &quot;hardcore&quot;, don&#39;t actually want just &quot;fun&quot; from game. They want to develop and be best in it. They care about win/lose and they also don&#39;t want to play in group with players, who are casuals, make many mistakes and just want to chill and have fun during the game. What drives them is - challange and competition.

Hardcore players won&#39;t play the game because of graphics, gold, levels - although many of them will still buy stuff. They just care about developing best strategies and growing in ranking. If game doesn&#39;t have this - they will quit playing it in few weeks or months. Otherwise - they can play the game without any patches many hours everyday for years - without actually getting bored.

I&#39;m quite sure devs are aware of that, but my conclusion is - there may be more casual players, than hardcores - but hardcores are those, who will play the game 8h/day for next few years and they will keep it alive, by being constant players.

Rankeds may not be #1 priority, but it definitely should be set high.

## Goals
To make a good competetive mind-conversion-psychology game, I think few assumptions should be set.

**Clear, immutable goal**
Every role should have quite clear goal from start and random factor (like being converted) should not dramatically change situation of the player. Otherwise their efforts in early-game are in opposition to their late-game goals. That means - player with &quot;convertable roles&quot; will just afk/dont care about early-game at all - what many people actualy do.

Town of Salem developers decided to remove vampire and role-changing for a reason and even it&#39;s currently core mechanics of evils in Throne of Lies - I suggest you do same in rankeds. The Golden Mean could be allowing Mastermind/Cult Leader only to change 1 person per game and only during first 3 nights. This way people would not go over-aggresive with &quot;vfr&quot; or similar strategies early, as they could still be turned.

**Minimalizing randomness and making game Team vs Team instead Chaos**
1. BD should have:
- 1x Prince
- 1x Paladin/Sheriff
- 1x Killer
- 2x Investigative (excluding Paladin/Sheriff)
- 1x Social
- 2x Support
- 2x Offensive

2. Evils should have:
- 1x Mastermind/Cult Leader
- 1x Assassin/Cult Killing Role
- 2x Support/Investigative/Offensive
- 1x Turned by Mastermind/Cult Leader as stated above
**The good option is to introduce new faction specially designed for ranked gameplay.**

3. Neutrals:
- 1x Random

4. King should be considered &quot;support&quot; - so if king would be evil/bd - evils/bd would have 1 less Support.

In such setup, in general it would be 5 vs 10 + 1 game. With good balance of skills it should be ~50% win chance for each faction.
Neutral would have least chance to win, so he should gain a lot elo for win and lose few for lose.

Second factor of elo-impact should be day-of-death. If somebody died early - he shouldn&#39;t lose nor gain much elo.</description>

            <p>Non investigative classes can get info. As an alchemist I figured out who the Possessor and MM were by day 2 as well as some other scum. This was because the Possessor possessed the king and when we realized this and executed him the whole unseen abstained. I knew that they would do this and Emerald positioned the abstainers getting me some scum kills.</p>

            <p>I somewhat agree, as a role list in Ranked is not very good as people will rely on that, but having a role list in general (like in casual) could tremendously help new players improve their scum reading and master roles.</p>

            <p>You don’t need to be an investigative class or have a restricting class list just to know if someone is lying or not. If that’s all you are relying on to play the game, then you aren’t playing it well in my opinion. Knowing if someone is lying or not is a key part of a <em>social</em> deduction game.</p>

            <p>I’m just telling you facts. In 90% of games, 90% of classes know almost nothing about what’s happening. The information amount and it’s spread is negligible. This is why early-game is actually very-unimportant and random. People only sometimes focus in the end - but then its usually too late.</p>

<p>Some randomness is always required in games. But it cannot be 99% of game.</p>
<p>Indeed. I agree it is game of psychology. But I am only interested in psychology of people who try to win/care. You cannot “predict” that your ally will be a dumb and in 2v1 with 100% knowledge situation he will go afk or vote confirmed ally. Some logical thinking is required from players in order keep the game fun.</p>

<p>We need to find a golden middle. Currently it’s usualy game of 0 information. You’re a knight. After 8 days u have literally no info like that below:<br>
1 = ? -<br>

5 = ? -<br>
6 = ? -<br>
7 = ? -<br>
8 = ? -<br>
9 = ? -<br>

11 = priest -<br>
12 = ? -<br>
16 = ? -</p>
<p>We cannot expect people to discover a magical ability of being able to distinguish if truth is sentence “i am drunk” or “i am knight”. Some amount of information must be in game!</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Quote<br>
Since the devs are left with the choice of completely changing the game for a Ranked mode that’s inherently different, or just implementing a ranking system, the second option is likely much more appealing and almost certainly the route that will be taken. Therefore, I cannot advise a competivie mode be attempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my proposal it actually just requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>role list</li>
<li>changing setup of game start (another numbers and classes of evils and bd)</li>
<li>changing cult leader and mastermind abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>I do no think it sounds like redesigning whole game. If game is flexible - they may be able to implement such mode in weeks, maybe in few months if they want to polish it well before releasing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quote<br>
Even if a balanced competitive mode is added and is different from the base game, that causes its own problems. The game will suffer an identity crisis (that its aboucurrent playerbase certainly cannot support), and at that point you might as well just play a different and better balanced game (assuming one exists - but it’s only a matter of time until one does). It just doesn’t seem worth the time of the developers when I can find a balanced game elsewhere more easily if I don’t care about 3D graphics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game must be consistent. If ranked gameplay would implement changes I suggested - they should inflict normal game mode as well. Classes should definitely not have different abilities in casual than in ranked (another amount of charges is acceptable). Game must follow the convention simple to start with - hard to master.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree completely, but I personally don’t expect that the devs will go this route, as changing how conversions work affects game balance. Since whatever competitive mode should be the mode that balance changes are made for, the “normal” mode will see changes built for a game with completely different core mechanics. Player actions aside, this is a huge problem.</p>
<p>Since the devs are left with the choice of completely changing the game for a Ranked mode that’s inherently different, or just implementing a ranking system, the second option is likely much more appealing and almost certainly the route that will be taken. Therefore, I cannot advise a competivie mode be attempted.</p>
<p>Even if a balanced competitive mode is added and is different from the base game, that causes its own problems. The game will suffer an identity crisis (that its current playerbase certainly cannot support), and at that point you might as well just play a different and better balanced game (assuming one exists - but it’s only a matter of time until one does). It just doesn’t seem worth the time of the developers when I can find a balanced game elsewhere more easily if I don’t care about 3D graphics.</p>

<p>In ToS even their elo system is really badly designed - it somehow works (even though you can hack elo by quitting games xD). But in general being higher elo in ToS makes you not face situations like “2x 100% confirmed allies vs 1x 100% evil” and allies voting each other and losing a game for all dead people from their faction.</p>
<p>Just by the fact of having elo number value - <strong>people change attitude to the game</strong>. For casuals - to aggresive &amp; unpleasent one - for us - they just care about win/lose, and that’s what we need. Even if elo doesn’t mean much and is quite random number, the numerical value motivates people to care just by it’s existance and psychological influence.</p>
<p>So I do believe it is possible and probably not perfect, but quite solid. I agree that it requires changes - as I stated - I don’t see an option to do competetive wisely without removing/reducing class-conversion mechanics.</p>

Honestly the closest we could get to a “Ranked” mode would probably be to just sort players by winrate or something. It would still be a salty cesspool, but at least the LLN would take effect over trying to fit a modified Elo calculation to a conversion-based game.</p>

<p>That is why in my proposal I removed (actually super-hardly minimized) conversion mechanics. Problem solved.</p>

            <p>Ranked with conversions doesn’t need salty players in the community to go wrong, it makes salty players while it’s going wrong.</p>

<p>That is true, you got a point here. But the problem is - if elo is a number, like 1000, and let’s say you have for example 50% chance to get role with 10% win ratio… No matter how good you are - after playing a lot you will be always going down. The system can work only if in general - considering statistics of all classes win ratio would be 50%.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, the game is still in its infancy. Give people time to learn to play and improve the win rate of said class.</p>
<p>Side Note: Some people just care for ELO, which is not a very good competitive environment as some people will do anything to win, rather then win by skill. Also, playing with Toxic people ruins your mood and therefore you’ll lose more, just saying out of experience <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
