    <description>As people are getting smarter with the game they&#39;re coming to the realization it&#39;s best to just kill anyone who claims Alch even if confirmed. I can&#39;t really think of a suggestion but it always seems best to just kill an alch when part of BD. Statistically speaking the risk of keeping them  alive is always greater than the reward. At this point the only way they stay alive is if they do not get spotted and I think with a little tweaking to incentivize a BD keeping them alive might make them a little more fun to play.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I actually win quite a few games as alch, I think the mistake most people make as alch is trying to hide all game. When you do that, when you get discovered as a neutral or something, people just insta-hang you because taking the risk of you being something else is too great.</p>
<p>I usually just whisper the king early, tell him flatly that I am a neutral alch and that I will heal him every turn until he tells me to poison someone. If you’re lucky, someone will attack him and you’ll heal him and earn his trust.</p>
<p>After that, stoneskin if you feel some heat or if you were the only one to whisper him, and ride it out.</p>
<p>Eventually you’ll feel a breaking point in the game. BD start with an advantage but if they play poorly or get unlucky, the evil team will close the gap. If I feel like the unseen are going to win with just a little help, I’ll use a poison to break the BD back and claim like, “oh crap, I thought X was evil” even though I knew he wasn’t. Since they know you’re neutral alch and you apologized, they’ll be less likely to want to hang you when they know there’s still a CL/MM/etc. The Unseen won’t want to kill you as much for the same reason, they know there are BD left.</p>
<p>Anyway, alch to me is all about deciding when to try and tip the scales one way or the other.</p>

            <p>What if they swapped the stoneakin option for a truth serum potion. One time use kind of like the old noble ability (crier) where it should out to the room his role and or class. Being conversion immune and 3 night immunity potions rarely ever get mentions because they get hung because BD does not like “NEUTS”</p>

            <p>Yeah I would agree the ability to cure nightshade is too BD sides. In all honesty I think the ability to heal is too BD sided as well. It’s a powerful ability but when all the BD are just killing you off it makes your ability kind of obsolete and even goes against your ultimate goal.</p>

            <p>Also as the learning curve is defiantly getting better. But take into consideration the game blowing up as much as it has has been the larger streamers. And we all know the rule “neuts, out” that has become the newest meme. As people get more and more into the games fixings neutrals will have more of an impact. But general perception is they don’t add anything to the game.</p>
<p>That being said if they could cure nightshade and and 1 reduced stone skin potions would balance them out a bit. But that may make them too BD sided?</p>

            <p>Claiming Alchemist as Alchemist if you have another option is usually a bad idea tbh</p>
<p>Don’t draw attention to yourself, but don’t coast.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t my most thought out Idea. I do 100% think that alch needs to be better at hiding. I’m just not sure if the alch does or if alch PLAYERS do.</p>

            <p>Not sure I’m on board with this particular idea by <a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a> , but if Alch needs a buff (debatable to begin with) it should allow it to stay more hidden.</p>

            <p>It might be better to make the alch better at hiding instead. I would suggest making stoneskin a heal instead of night immunity.</p>
