    <title>A new game mode + UI improvements</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/a-new-game-mode-ui-improvements/45433</link>
    <description>Hello, I will make this short and clear:

One thing that bothers me is when the UI (the textbox, the user list, the character photo, everything that&#39;s not the scenery in the back) disappears when it switches between night and day. It would be awesome if those wouldn&#39;t disappear and only the scene in the back goes black. It&#39;s annoying because when I have the list of roles open, and the day/night phase begins, it disappears for a brief moment of time. So the suggestion is to keep the UI elements rendered while keeping the scenery transition.

Another nice addition to this game would be (on top of the weekly suggested ranked mode), Chaos mode, which the game would have a little bit of everything.</description>

            <p>I’d suggest never removing the list of people on the bottom-right.  It fades out at several points, and it’s just irritating when you’re trying to use it to update your log and such.</p>
