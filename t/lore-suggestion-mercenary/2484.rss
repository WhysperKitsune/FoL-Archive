    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Mercenary</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-mercenary/2484</link>
    <description>A young girl once grew up in a neighbor hood of thieves, she has learned that you can trust no one, only do tasks for others when they will give payment first. She had grown up knowing these rules, and protecting her clients from harm, effectively making a name for herself and the Mercenary of the town. After she was in the thieves neighborhood for a while she decided that she had to leave. So, she left the neighborhood and traveled to a castle. Were she though that she would get better clients who would have a higher buying price. She arrived there she began contracting another, but she realized, if her target died it would get her bad reputation and eventually not be able to sell her services. She figured that if 2 of her contracts died, she would loose sales and never recover. So in result of this, she would kill herself. So she decided to contract a person in the kingdom, for this was the start of her journey. A journey that we will never know the outcome of.

Comments/Explanations:
I feel like this lore fits the neutral category and the premise of mercenary in general. Like how she suicides after 2 of her contracts die. In general It fits well as the lore for mercenary seeing as though It provides a backstory while leaving framework for what is yet to come.</description>
