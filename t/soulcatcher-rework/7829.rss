    <title>Soulcatcher rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/soulcatcher-rework/7829</link>
    <description>I know that the priest is convert immune now. Thing is that might be temporary. If the reason for the change had to do with the Soulcatcher than that is what needs changing.

Soulcatcher - Unseen Social
Passives:
Consume soul - like it was before. Consume 2 souls to heal
Call the darkness - The dead can talk to the living unseen. The dead will hear you as Priest

Night Ability&#39;s:
Capture soul - If your target dies you will gain thier soul (unlimited)
Absorb souls - You lose all of your souls. All whispers to and from the players who&#39;s souls you captured are revealed to you.

Any suggestions? Please don&#39;t bring up how likely Soulcatcher is to be brought back, there are other threads for that.</description>

            <p>Don’t forget that you read whispers RETROACTIVELY. Meaning that if someone was being whispered to a lot earlier in the game and you collect thier soul then you would know what that whisper was even though you weren’t even soul catcher at the time.</p>

            <p>Seems incredibly weak apart from the talking one which is still weak because it’s an Apostle but you only get one</p>
