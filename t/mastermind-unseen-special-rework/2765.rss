    <description>The Mastermind

Unseen Special 
In the Shadows(Passive) - Investigative classes will see you as Blue Dragon the first three nights.
Can&#39;t Touch This(Passive) - Immune to death at night
Ambush(Day) - Kill any Maid Spy or Scout that is active on your target at the end of the day. You can not convert the target this night. You can target everyone with this.- 2 uses, 2 days cooldown(always)
_Note_: You could extend this effect to the Prince, but that might be too powerful.
Convert(Night) - Convert someone into the Unseen - Unlimited Uses, but 1-day cooldown on success
Determine Danger(Night) - Determine any hindrances or threats for evils visiting the target, including the Scout. You will ignore them this night. You can use this on any Unseen as well. - 3 Uses
_Note_: You cannot convert and determine danger  at the same time... Determine Danger also allows the Mastermind to fake some classes more reliably. I am not sure how many uses of Determine Danger would be balanced tho, Unlimited, 4,3 or 2 uses(definitely not 1 or less). Some feedback on this would be great.

I think that currently the Unseen are not powerful enough for 16 players games, unlike the Cult, and this change would allow 
1.The Mastermind(or some other Unseen) to claim something more reliably(via Determine Danger)
2.The Mastermind not to out all visits as converted people
3.The Unseen to get rid of the pesky Scout
which is great for the Unseen because if the Mastermind dies then they have a very very big problem, usually.
It would also force the Sheriff to relocate the Scout sometimes. On the other hand, a dead Maid Spy or Scout indicate that the person was not converted at that night...</description>

            <p>Master mind should be a menace. He isn’t.</p>
<p>The cult leader gets to convert more often, kill, and even sacrifice his members. The cult leader gets to convert, and less often then the cult leader.</p>
<p>Master mind has nothing to do but wait when he has 2 other members.</p>
<p>I don’t think he should kill a scout, I think he should have a 1 use ability that converts but bypasses scout and a day ability with 2 uses being faux poison.</p>

</aside>
<p>We could even make it a counter to the scout only, but that ability would only be a counter to the Sheriff’s scout, which happens to be very powerful right now. Besides, it isn’t reliable and it does not allow you to convert the target if it has no scout- but this ability stops the Sheriff from scouting one person only.</p>

</aside>
<p>It is no Wall of Fire at all. I think you misread what it says. <em>You can use this on any Unseen as well</em> means that you can target Unseen members with this ability, nothing more.<br>
<em><strong>You</strong> will ignore them this night</em> does not extend to fellow Unseen members, or else it would say “The Unseen will ignore them this night”. An assassin visiting the same target will be subject to any dangers and problems avaliable.<br>
<em>Ignore</em> means that you - and only you - are silently not affected by something.</p>

            <p>I do happen to love it though.</p>
<p>The Unseen is the main evil faction.</p>
<p>As such, their leader should be something to fear and this gives the Mastermind more power and makes sense with the Lore.</p>

            <p>One thing I do not understand.<br>
What exactly do you mean by “ignore them?”</p>
<p>Also, considering how buffed this new Mastermind is, it will be a horror if the Unseen were to lose him.</p>

            <p>No.<br>
The Unseen are intended to be the main evil faction…(cult is intended to spawn too, but not as frequently)<br>
and 16 players games are intended to be normal(at release).<br>
A buff like this is far, far better than your suggestion.</p>

            <p>I agree unseen is weak 16 player. Perhaps if 12 or more players, unseen cannot spawn.</p>
