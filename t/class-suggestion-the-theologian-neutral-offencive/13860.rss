    <description>The Theologian - Neutral Offensive
Passive: Faithful - Appear BD to invest abillitys. You are occupy immune.

Day ability: Reserve - All day ability&#39;s on your target will fail today(3 uses)

Night ability 1: Preach - Occupy your target and all of his visitors (Unlimited)
Night ability 2: Blessing - Give a player Occupy and Night immunity this night. Does not inform them of this unless they were Occupied or Attacked(2 Uses)

Goal: Ensure the Blue Dragon falls and either you survive or that another Neutral wins.

Ex1: You survive but the other neutrals die with the BD - You win
Ex2: You die but the Scorned executed thier target and the BD fell - You win
Ex3: You die but the Fool is executed with the Unseen - You lose
ect...

Blessing goes before the drunk&#39;s happy hour meaning that he will remove the Immunity&#39;s you add.</description>

            <p>Why do you lose the third example?<br>
The BD lost and a Neutral won you should win</p>
