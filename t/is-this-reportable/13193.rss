    <description>I&#39;m in a game right now and the prince asked everybody to execute me because I had a confirmed merc contracted to me and he wanted the merc to contract him. Is that reportable?</description>

<p>All the Rules listed imply that what the Prince did wasn’t against the rules, and so, not reportable.</p>
<p>It’s an incredibly bad mannered move, but it’s not gamethrowing. His goal wasn’t being lost.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Basically this. Strategies like that are frowned upon, however not against the rules.<br>
So, not reportable.</p>

            <p>the reason you need permission is because they might game throw and say who their team mates are. Everyone knew they were prince, so you couldn’t have revealed him or anything.</p>

            <p>First, you guys are wrongly using the word “bussing”. Bussing can only be done as unseen/cult. Bussing is when you purposely out a partner to gain credibility. What this prince did has NOTHING to do with bussing.</p>
<p>Since you were unclear, his play was arguably good if he had no better choice of execution.</p>
<p>Instead of executing nobody, he executed an unclear, which also resulted in getting protection from the merc AND clearing the merc. Amazing play by that prince if you ask me.</p>

<p>Nobody needs your permission to execute you in this game. It looks like your team decided this was what they wanted to do and they did it. Threatening to report somebody for executing you is a metagaming angleshoot.</p>

<p>But the key difference is, he effectively put it to a vote with his own team… I agree it was a horrible play. Outing someone as BD isn’t really bussing. Asking BD to vote for someone doesn’t force them to do so, especially if they were knowing they were bussing on behalf of that really dumb jailors plan. Either every non evil that voted to execute the probable physician is guilty, or none of them are.</p>

            <p>Merc ran out of guards prince got killed BD lost and everybody laid into the prince.</p>
<p>Also to the reply from a different person from earlier, the bussing rule was regarding the unseen I know that. But the point was even though unseen bussing unseen might be a good strat for the good of the team, you still need that persons permission to bus them. Ergo I would assume devs would say if prince wanted my merc, he’d have to get my perimission to execute me to take my merc. Same concept.</p>

            <p>I’d say point blank, “bussing a team” doesn’t really come into play at all here. Bussing is pretty much as evil, you out another evil that you 100% know the identity of. This was a prince outing a probable good (most likely not “confirmed, as pretty much only prince is unconvertable”), to make a play, and it involved more or less the majority of the BD agreeing with the play…</p>
<p>That being said, it’s just bad play IMO… the rest of the BD should have objected or refused, a merc is nice and all, and he’s already used at least one of his protections, and he could be converted to a sellsword or killed to completely negate whatever good that concept had to begin with.</p>

            <p>I just don’t like the idea that people could get punished for “rules” that aren’t necessarily fully explained in the game itself. If the Devs didn’t want people sacking their own teammates, surely they’d put that in the game Rules, on the main menu?</p>
<p>edit: I’m not trying to be confrontational, haha! I’m just like seeing less common tactics used in TOL, and also playing devils advocate a little.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t confirmed BD exactly. But I wasn’t accused of being neut or cult. I wasn’t put up for being suspicious at all. He just found out I had a merc and was like oh hey then let’s kill him because I’m prince and I want the merc.</p>

            <p>Yeah I reported and said that I know you can’t bus a teammate without their permission but I’m not sure if this is the same thing. Etc.</p>
<p>and then I had to note that I had no part in all the toxic yelling at the end of the game because a couple people laid into the guy for what he did.</p>

            <p>Might I suggest that the rules become slightly less vague, especially since the Prince, in this example, could be considered to be not gamethrowing, since he is using the Mercenary further his investigative abilities.</p>
<p>I understand it’s a really assholey move, but to allow BD to win, some sacrifices might have to  be made.</p>
