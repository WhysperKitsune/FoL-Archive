</aside>
<p>Here’s my thoughts on the Priest change,I get the idea behind one time immunity you get a chance to res before you die.But here’s the thing i don’t really thing it is OP like magna said it was.Heres why-Priest can do a multitude of things but what stops him from just dying?Of course priest has one time immunity.The other thing is priest has  some inherent counters like servant,alcoholic,and invoker but those aren’t good enough.Heres the thing there are some  classes that can just destroy lets say a revive prince.Those 2 being the enforcer and sage.Also you can just poison a revived prince.But i do agree Priest is really strong and is probably one of the power classes for BD but that was always true.I dont know about making it guaranteed but i get why you did it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>copy-pasted from another thread:</p>
<p>Okay look</p>
<p>What basically happened is the powerful BD roles got swapped from Prince and Paladin/Sheriff to Prince and Priest.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’s okay for the Priest to be powerful. As long as balance is maintained with two BD “Power” roles in play (somebody come up with a better name for this), Priest should be able to be powerful.</p>
<p>The issue right now is that there is literally zero counterplay to the Priest. This is somewhat expected with the Prince - evil jailor is broken, plain and simple, so conversion is off the table, and although it should probably be able to be occupied it isn’t a huge deal that it isn’t because it’s always worth using a kill on it, even as Cult where that kill comes with a price tag. But the Priest has the same issues the old Paladin did - it’s an unstoppable God amongst puny men. The current Priest has only one weakness, and that is occupation. But if he just revives N2, that pretty much no longer matters. If there was some way to counter his ability, it’d be fine. But there just isn’t.</p>
<p>What the Priest needs is counter-play, of some sort. Losing conversion immunity post-revive is a great solution that ensures that the game can be balanced for 1 BR revive, but reduces the cheese effect that two more conversion-immune classes has of the rest of the game. Removing the night immunity grant Priest has also allows that ability to be given to another, future role instead.</p>
<p>And while I can see where the night 1-3 immunity argument comes from, I think that we should wait and see if the other changes I talked about are enough first. ToL gets updated enough where it shouldn’t be a huge issue to take this one step at a time, and evaluate it needing timed night immunity later. After all, it should have different weaknesses than the Prince.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Perhaps we should look into borrowing how they deal with power classes on the unseen side.</p>
<p>the one time immunity is important because the priest dying before he gets a chance to revive, is a huge swing.</p>
<p>So what if the priests one time death immunity automatically expends at night 3 or 4. This gives the priest a reasonable time to use his revive. He may not be able to be as super picky only will revive the prince.</p>

            <p>Because every other BD class in the game is technically useful with a priest. The priest however is the one exception so it needs a way to not die N1/N2. Other classes are either A) BD and are useful with priest. B) Are cult and are technically useful with an apostle (which unlike the priest is not unique). C) Neutral and you have already won/lost. Or D) Unseen which 100% needs a death interaction.</p>

            <p>There is a point you could confuse role blockers and the prince.You also can have a death when there is no physician.It also ups your KPN bc the poisioned person dies.It also can confuse some as to whether or not its cult or not.It also gave physician something to do.</p>

            <p>May I ask two questions concerning the mechanics of noble’s “Private Matter”.<br>
1.If one noble spies on another noble, will he be able to see his whispers regardless of “Private Matter”?<br>
2.If I use this ability at night and, on the same night, I get converted to cult, are my whispers still invisible for the day?</p>
<p>Also, as a sidenote,  I played a game earlier where possessor jumped into Prince. I thought he couldn’t do that. Did the last patch change that or was i just wrong before and possessor could always jump into prince?</p>

            <p>Prince and Priest are literally the only unconvertable BD classes in this game now.</p>
<p>2…</p>
<p>And potentially anyone who’s resurrected but most likely it’ll be Prince who’s resurrected.</p>

            <p>I find convert immunity a bit scary, we do factor in that now every game will have 4 unconvertables. The king, the prince, the priest and the revived.</p>

            <p>Well, if I have my facts right, priest is death immune only once, right?<br>
Maybe he should be convert immune only once as well? Would that help?<br>
Though I don’t know if full convert immune is such a problem. We’ll find out soon, I suppose.</p>

            <p>Depending on the class that might actually happen if its with a Cult class or Unseen class that is converted from a class that needs to be convertible to work (such as Illusionist turned from Psychic). Luckily class changes happen quickly with this game unlike a certen other game.</p>

<p>Then what’s the point having Soulcatcher, hmm?</p>

</aside>
<p>It would appear soulcatcher will no longer exist.</p>
<p>While I’ll point out I’m not so keen on the priest keeping night and convert immunity as a BD role. I do have to say the premise of being able to remove a role if it no longer works, is a good general thing to have.  I am glad to hear the concept that if at some point a role became fundimentally unworkable, it won’t stick around for a year with a “we can never remove a role until we can replace it”. mentality, that can really ruin a game like this.</p>

            <p>Not gonna lie, BD needs a crutch now that I think about it. They’re always so trigger happy in the beginning and will kill anybody off with no info. Maybe once there are more experience people than new, they could revise.</p>
