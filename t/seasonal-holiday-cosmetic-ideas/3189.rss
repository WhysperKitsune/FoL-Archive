            <p>I would say tier three should be 3000-4000 in my opinion as it would be harder to earn, but the other prices seem reasonable.</p>
<p>Though final question, are the weapons and cosmetics only able to be bought during the season? This is why I would have bumped the prices down slightly for tier three</p>

            <p>Only one thing. Would the cosmetics have to be bought with GP, or will everyone have a chance to access the executions or costumes if they wish?</p>
<p>If they have to be bought and the other people cannot afford it but show interest with like a vote to wear cosmetic button in the lobby, a person or two will be able have the executions or the costume.</p>
<p>This may sound daft I know, but then depending how much the cosmetics and executions cost, they may not be able to get them. Or will the be a bit like the Alpha and Beta games, where the people can rent them for around 50GP and get to keep them for a week or two after the event so they are bale to have a bit of time with it still if they didn’t have a chance to go on trial and see the costumes for themselves or make their own executions.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like a fun idea. Well, if the devs decide to do this that is. Otherwise Plex, I feel like you hammered the nail on the head!</p>
