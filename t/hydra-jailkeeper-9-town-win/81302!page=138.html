<p>I’ll do you one better - this read is mostly fabricated. Literally nobody looks at someone actively trying to apply pressure to various people and paying attention to everyone’s reactions to it in a game that was early on very dead otherwise and honestly concludes “they are expressly trying to be a discussion leader, ergo they are scum” because neither of those statements follow at all logically from the quoted behavior. You have literally seen me do this same exact shit as town and be <em>exactly on the money</em> . Remember FEFM? Don’t give me any of this “oh he’s pressuring people so he’s scum” bs, I’ve literally caught half your team out before with the same exact trick.</p>

<p>Nowhere did I say that I was going to gamesolve D1 (Priestess admittedly did but I think she misinterpreted what I was saying considering I’m adamantly against PFA and that’s pretty much required to “gamesolve” with no flips).</p>
<p>But that’s not the bad part</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Because I am entertaining the idea that Society might be worth listening to and asking them to walk me through their thought process, I am somehow <em>not</em> trying to solve their slot, just applying baseless pressure.</p>
<p>What the actual fuck?</p>
<p>I didn’t think this was town before the sub and I think I like it even less now. There’s a high chance that Vulgard was entertaining the thought beforehand, but I really don’t think he enters with a read that fully agrees with his partner and literally nothing else before longer discussion by chance, especially when the quotes literally directly oppose the points he’s stating with them. That’s just gross.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m pretty sure he never actually <em>said</em> anything about why this was - how do you know he’s right for sure? Seems like a leap to me, especially given I really don’t think actively choosing to put them there is at all inherently town, and you even brought up the fact he was your pr read <em>again</em> later in the day. I can’t see the logical throughline connecting trying to hide a PR in your nulls and then deciding to just bring it up again later on.</p>

<p>that guy is actively interjecting everywhere and inserting himself wherever he can to push the thread in the direction <em>he</em> wants and i feel like he’s completely overconfident too early because his pushes have an extreme amount of conviction relative to the stage of the game we’re at<br>
that’s why i think tmi is influencing his reads. his takes are far too confident and it doesn’t look like he has much of a progression whatsoever. he just goes on attacking everyone, going down the list and making the entire thread (or TRYING to) listen through sheer postcount and loudness of his voice</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this isn’t even a good take when I was actively postcapping myself</p>
<p>If I was going to try and drown out the thread why would I do that</p>
<p>I can easily hit multiple hundreds in a day, and I have done that on purpose before for sure</p>
<p>But you can’t really say I’m drowning out the thread when not only have I limited myself, but I’ve also spent a large chunk of my posts actively trying to engage with people that just won’t</p>

<p>people have done that before as villagers, i’m perfectly aware of that<br>
but i’ve also correctly v read villagers doing that in the past. perfect example: geyxy hydra in mafia academy. the difference is that their posts were far more analytical, their tone was better and they weren’t trying to bully the thread<br>
in orange’s posts i see an inherent desire for control and confidence is way too high too early, both of which combined I consider wolf traits<br>
which is why i’m voting there<br>
and which is why i want that slot to be today’s lynch<br>
i can’t wait for him to call this illogical too because apparently that’s his thing this game</p>

</aside>
<p>I call illogical things illogical</p>
<p>This isn’t illogical but the reason I don’t really believe you is you have seen me be literally way more hyper-aggressive as town before and it lead to the death of half of your team by mid-D2</p>
<p>fmpov it really looks like you’re trying to prevent that from happening again and if you aren’t I’ma need to to actually look at what I said about your slot and start figuring out how to explain your thoughts</p>

<p>We also called you out on it, so if you honestly think you’re scum you’re gonna need to rectify that one <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png!v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
<p>fwiw I think the answer is less “we’re town” and moreso that calling that out is objectively beneficial from any angle but SvS</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> starting to get real tired of people not just responding to my issues with them and instead providing unhelpful blanket statements</p>
