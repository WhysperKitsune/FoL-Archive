    <description># Welcome to Jailkeeper 9: Now Featuring Hydras!
### Hosted by @Arete with VCs by @KyoDaz and @Simon 
# Rules:

Follow the Global Forum Rules, given in this post:

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926

Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of **15 substantive, on-topic, game related posts** per in game day are required per slot, unless the day ends early. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing *solely* a vote. The first time a slot fails to meet this requirement, they will receive a warning; the second time, they will be replaced out if possible. If a slot zero-posts, they will be replaced out without a warning.

The game will begin when it is filled.

# Hydras!

This game features hydras! That is, rather than playing as individuals, each slot will be filled by two players, who must work together. Hydras sign up as a pair.

Hydras will have a private chat on the forums which they can use at any time, and may create private chats elsewhere so long as the host is added.

#### A note: by moderator request, all participating players will have their title changed to designate their hydra name, to minimize confusion. This will be reverted after the game.

A single member of a hydra replacing out will be handled on a case by case basis.

If there are insufficient hydra sign-ups, non-hydras may be allowed to join so that the game can fill; however, hydras will have preference.

# Role List

**[color = green]Vanilla Townie[/color]**

**[color = red]Mafia Goon[/color]**
**[color = red]Mafia Goon[/color]**

Sample role PMs:


[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
&gt; # [color = green]  Vanilla Townie [/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You are a Vanilla Townie. Your only weapons are your voice and your vote.
&gt; 
&gt; *Defeat the Mafia.*

&gt; # [color = green]  Town Jailkeeper[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You are the Town Jailkeeper. Each night, you may jailkeep a player in the game. You will simultaneously roleblock that player, and protect that player from any number of nightkills.
&gt; 
&gt; *Defeat the Mafia.*

&gt; # [color = red] Mafia Goon [/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You are a Mafia Goon. You share a 24/7 private chat with your fellow members of the Mafia. Each night, the Mafia may kill a player outside your faction.
&gt; 
&gt; *Reach parity with the town.*
[/details]


# Gameplay

- The set-up consists of 1 Town Jailkeeper, 6 Vanilla Townies, and 2 Mafia Goons. **Note that this differs from some other set-ups with the same name.**

- Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Lynches are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the lynch will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.

- No-lynch is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-lynch and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-lynch will have priority in the rand.

- Self-votes are considered valid votes.

- Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios. That is to say, in situations where a mislynch or a no-lynch will guarantee a Mafia victory, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes. Votes for either member of a hydra, or for a hydra&#39;s hydra name, will count as votes for that hydra.

- The Mafia factional kill is NOT mandatory.

- The Mafia factional kill IS assigned. That is, a specific member of the Mafia must be chosen to perform the factional kill. If no member is selected, the last member who submitted a kill will be assumed to perform it.

- To prevent &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; scenarios: if the Mafia chose not to submit a factional kill, and there was subsequently a no-lynch, the Mafia must submit a kill on the next night. This *does* mean that two consecutive nights with no deaths can be used to derive mechanical information. If the Mafia fails to do so, the kill will be randed among non-Mafia members.

- The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

<em>In Rokugan, name and history is everything. A samurai is defined by their family and clan. Their deeds only matter in the context of how they effect those ideals. The Lying Darkness strips all that away, leaving the samurai with nothing.</em><br>
<strong>Neutral Killer</strong><br>
<em>‚ÄúSeven Thunders entered the Shadowlands. One returned.‚Äù</em><br>
<strong>Named, not Tamed (Passive) -</strong>  At the start of the game, it will be publicly informed that  <em>‚ÄúAkodo is watching your every step, from all clans alike‚Äù.</em><br>
<strong>Faceless (Passive) -</strong>  You will appear as a member of the uninformed majority (random class of that faction from the GI thread) to investigative checks from the uninformed majority. You will appear as an informed minority lost wolf (random class of that faction from the GI thread with a lost wolf modifier) to investigative checks from the informed minority/informed minorities.<br>
<strong>Shadow Corruption (Passive) -</strong>  You know the effects of the Shadow Corruption, who is Shadow Corrupted and the degree of Shadow Corruption they possess at all times. The Shadow Corruption has three degrees. If someone already has the Shadow Corruption, they will gain a new degree every time an even day starts.<br>
In the first degree, nothing happens. In the second degree, all abilities and passives they have will be disabled. In the third degree, they will die, their flip will be cleaned, and they will be prevented from joining the Dead Chat. You will be given their original rolecard, and any further rolecards they had throughout the game (if they were converted, for instance).<br>
Aditionally, you are immune to the Shadow Corruption. Finally, if someone claims at least one of the following: flavor, class type, role type, ability/abilities; they will be Corrupted automatically.<br>
The only people informed of being Corrupted are the ones who start the game Corrupted.<br>
<strong>Dangerous Deal (Day) -</strong>  Make an offer to a player. ‚ÄúDarkness wants to embrace you. If you accept, you will be [effect]. Be careful, though, that dealing with the Nothing is dangerous business. You have 24 hours to decide if you accept it or not. Do you accept?‚Äù<br>
The following effects are disponible. Choose one to offer:<br>
-Immune to attacks tonight<br>
-Cleaned from all Bleeding<br>
-Given an alignment peek<br>
-Given a gun<br>
-Aware from all feedback on you for the remainder of the day.<br>
-Shown as a member of the uninformed majority to all checks tonight.<br>
You will know whether they accepted, refused or did not answer to the request. If they accept, they will gain the benefit and one degree of the Shadow Corruption. If they refuse, they will not gain the benefit and the Shadow Corruption. If they don‚Äôt answer, they will not gain the benefit and will gain one degree of the Shadow Corruption.<br>
If someone already has a degree of Corruption, you may give them more than one benefit in any subsequent Dangerous Deals. You can‚Äôt target anyone who is immune to the Corruption with this ability.<br>
<strong>Direct Elimination (Night) -</strong>  Select a player to kill. You can choose between one of the following effects: You can‚Äôt be seen by any trackers or watchers tonight, you will be bulletproof tonight, you can‚Äôt be roleblocked or redirected tonight, the target of the kill can‚Äôt be healed or protected tonight.<br>
If they have claimed flavor, class type, role type, or ability/abilities, you can choose two effects instead of one.<br>
<em>Win Conditions: Only one of those need to be completed.</em><br>
<em>- All players are dead.</em><br>
<em>- All players but you are dead.</em><br>
<em>- All alive players possess the Shadow Corruption.</em><br>
<em>- All alive players but you possess the Shadow Corruption.</em><br>
<em>- Half of the game (rounded up) has claimed at least one of the following: flavor, class type, role type, ability/abilities.</em><br>
<em>When you win, everyone else loses, regardless if they have already completed their win condition. The game won‚Äôt end if you are still alive. You can win even if you are dead.</em></p>
