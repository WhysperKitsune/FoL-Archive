    <title>Question on possible throw?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/question-on-possible-throw/66939</link>
    <description>So I was alchemist, and I claimed d1. 

On d2, someone comes out and says &quot;Im butler, the alch isnt alch because he was immune to occupy&quot; and they hang me. Find out Im really alch so they hang him the next day and find out hes actually sellsword. I didnt really care until he told me in dead chat &quot;I just did it because I dont like d1 alch claims&quot;.

To me, this is a case of throwing - He outed himself, got killed, and possibly lost the game just cuz he didnt &quot;like the way I played the game&quot;.

But I didnt report since its the only time its ever happened. I just wondered what you all think. If it happens again I should report or no?</description>

            <p>I was in that game haha</p>
<p>The sellsword basically suicided in order to kill an alchemist D2</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s gamethrowing for reasons others have stated, just bizarre</p>

            <p>Gamethrowing by definition is going against your win condition. As stated above, Sellsword’s aim is to ensure BD loses.<br>
Now, this means the only way they are throwing is if they intentionally vote an ally. This being either final NK in a 3 people alive situation or final scum faction member when the other person is BD.<br>
Alchemist, while a potential ally, is not important to the Sellsword’s wincon so it is fair to get the Alchemist killed especially since Alchemist abilities are very bad for the wincondition of Sellsword due to healing.<br>
I’d say it should be considered to try and get the Alchemist to ally with you but as I stated, it’s not that important. It’s up to the preference of the Sellsword really</p>

            <p>Yeah, it’s not throwing, it’s just being toxic.</p>
<p>Someone doing a questionable but legal play just because they dislike the way you play is just plain old toxicity.</p>
<p>There’s a certain sense of entitlement in a player taking active steps to do you harm because they dislike the way you play, as if they had any authority/validity when it comes to how you play a game.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s sound more like a toxic behavour.  Being Toxic =/= Throwing. If you’re thinking about reporting him, i would rather do that for toxicity.</p>

            <p>I get the getting rid of the alchemist thing - and I would normally agree, but thats not what happened.</p>
<p>He outed HIMSELF as sellsword, causing himself to die, in order to (as he put it) “Kill you because I hate d1 alch claims”. He could have waited a day or two, giving himself an airtight alibi, instead of the flimsy one he used. He didnt even try to defend himself when upped on the stand afterward.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that if someone gets themselves hung taking out someone just because they dislike his/her play, and ADMITS THAT in chat, that should be throwing.</p>
<p>I have NO problem with unseen/sellsword taking out an alchemist - Thats just part of the game.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t a throw. Sellsword goal is to defeat Blue Dragon and survival is secondary thing. The hard truth is outed Alchs usually sides with BD and it’s kinda hard to deal with them as Evils.</p>
<p>If it was a quality play or no, it’s up to you.</p>

            <p>No, it’s not throwing. He might’ve been lying to get rid of the dangerous Alchemist (becuase Alchemists can turn on Unseen/Cult). Alchemists generally side BD so getting rid of one is not throwing. It’s just bad play.</p>
