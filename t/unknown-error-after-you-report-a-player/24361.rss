    <title>&quot;Unknown Error&quot; after you report a player</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/unknown-error-after-you-report-a-player/24361</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
After I reported a player after the game with in-game menu (hint &quot;Report Player&quot; popped up) instead of &quot;Report Player&quot; &quot;Unknown Error&quot; popped up.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Another message or no message should be popped up instead of &quot;Unknown Error&quot;.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Read above.

#### Comments:
It&#39;s an old bug, idk why it wasn&#39;t reported/fixed yet. On my screen the message was &quot;Unknown Er&quot;, not &quot;Unknown Error&quot;, but I guess &quot;ror&quot; just doesn&#39;t fit my screen.</description>
