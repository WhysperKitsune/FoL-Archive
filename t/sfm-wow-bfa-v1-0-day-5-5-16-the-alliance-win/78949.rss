    <description>**Welcome to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth!**

Hosted by @KyoDaz and x.

This setup follows simple forum rules

1. https://toli.es/rules
2. https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926/

The setup will start once 16 players have signed up. Backups, spectators and co-hosts are appreciated.

**Gameplay**

Days will be 48 hours long, or shorter if someone is lynched.
Nights will be 24 hours long or until everyone has submitted their actions.
Actions are done by messaging me.
Players receive both a class and race. The race determines their alignment.
All players on the outnumbered faction will be aware of their faction superpower&#39;s identity and role.
You will become permanently occupy immune after 3 occupation attempts. This is not affected by or affect redirection.
You may choose one specialization once you receive your class. This cannot be changed.
All of the outnumbered faction will have a chat at all times. The faction Superpower is excluded from the chat.
The outnumbered faction automatically win once their numbers become = the majority faction.
The outnumbered faction do not have a faction kill. They however do have KPN thanks to their superpower. If the faction superpower dies the outnumbered faction will be able to kill every odd night.
Your specialization will be revealed upon flip.
Positive effects are anything that are mostly beneficial to a player such as visit prevention or healing.
Negative effects are anything that are mostly harmful to a player such as occupation or redirection.
There will be a period of silence once all of the classcards have been dealt. This is to enable players to select pre-game things such as specializations.

**Executions**

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
There will be a day one lynch.
Executions end the day.
Executions will be majority + plurality.

**After The Night**

Only investigative abilities will return feedback. It will either be a result or &#39;You could not investigate your target.&#39;
