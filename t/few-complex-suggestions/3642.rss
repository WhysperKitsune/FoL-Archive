    <description># Some Generic Ideas For ToL&#39;s Future

* **Empire System:**

A clan styled system, people being able to make groups that give them a clan tag type thing in lobbies. With this, people can put their Empire buddies on top of others on their friends list. The tag would show up in lobbies like:
``[i42] Plex``
 You have the potential to add an option to &quot;Quick Invite Empire&quot; to a private lobby, so they all get an instant invite button while on the main menu rather than waiting for a group invite code. 
I hope most of this makes sense. In the Empire, you could also have it show people in that Empire the game statistics of each member, and compare things like &quot;Hours Played&quot; or &quot;Games Played&quot;

----

* **Achievements**

The Achievements is another basic thing, and I just came up with an example list of the more basic achievements, which I&#39;m calling &quot;Bounties&quot;

[details=Example list]
Bounties:

Class Specific Bounties:
Win a game as *class*
Win 5 games as *class*
Win 10 games as *class*
Win 25 games as *class*
Win 50 games as *class*
Win 100 games as *class*

Faction Specific Bounties:
Win a game as *faction*
Win 5 games as *faction*
Win 10 games as *faction*
Win 25 games as *faction*
Win 50 games as *faction*

Secret Bounties:
Be converted into Unseen
Be brainwashed into Cult
Be possessed by a Possessor
Be reaped by a Reaper
Be Occupied by a Butler or Fool
Be cured of Poison
Be cured of Bleeding
Be guarded by a King
Be saved by a King
Be guarded by a Merc
Be contracted by a Merc
[/details]

* **I was thinking about that whole &quot;Ranked&quot; thing**

I had a &quot;League&quot; mode in mind which didn&#39;t rank people on their wins or losses but instead it scored people on their actions against others

I&#39;ve got a big chart that would determine points:

It&#39;s a lot of Information, but it&#39;s how I would write up the &quot;Ranked&quot; system. It promotes scum reading on a major level and it encourages players to think before they act.</description>

            <p>at what number does a number switch from being insignificant to significant then ?<br>
given a 1 in x chance of an event occurring at what stage can you say that x is insignificant .</p>
<p>I’m gonna use dice</p>
<p>If I roll 4 d4  is the chance of rolling a 4 on one of them insignificant ?<br>
If I roll 6 d6  is the chance of rolling a 6 on one of them insignificant ?<br>
If I roll 8 d8  is the chance of rolling a 8 on one of them insignificant ?<br>
If I roll 10 d10  is the chance of rolling a 10 on one of them insignificant ?<br>
If I roll 20 d20 is the chance of rolling a 20 on one of them insignificant ?<br>
If I roll 100 d100  is the chance of rolling a 100 on one of them insignificant ?</p>
<p>the trouble is significance is set at an arbitrary level so is only valid if you state your level of significance.<br>
Which means starting something is insignificant is only valid against a pre agreed level of significance.</p>
<p>Also you are using base probability to define statistical insignificanace , where as you should be comparing it to sample size .</p>
<p>1 – (999999 /1,000,000)1,000,000 (“to the power”  no superscript on forum)= probability that given a million goes , someone pushes the button = 0.6321 or 63%</p>
<p>So unless you think a 63% chance of the event occurring is insignificant …<img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5dbe498068e0fdb106b61d7ab96966f5c8e0b91a.PNG" alt="Capture" data-base62-sha1="dni5LyuNr3r5wvzLuWXuNnc5iVc" width="112" height="32"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it was statistically known that only 1 in 1000000 wanted to destroy the world  If you gave 1,000,000 a big red button that destroyed the world if they pushed it , would you be happy to say that because we know of these people that only 1 in  1000000 people are likely to press the button that the risk is insignificant ?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Correct. As extreme as that example sounds, that risk is insignificant.</p>
<p>If there was a 1 in a million chance something would happen and you provide a million instances of the function, then yes, you shouldn’t be surprised that it might happen. But remember - just because you test a million people doesn’t mean the button is automatically pressed – that is a common fallacy of probability. It works the other way around too – don’t expect the first person given the button to not to blow up the world.</p>
<p>When n=1,000,000 you can expect intense accuracy of the stated probability.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep us on base here – I doubt anybody will reach 1 million games of ToL.</p>

            <p>Better than you mate. Then again that is not saying much.</p>
<p>Sorry if I’m being harsh but you are just so hilariously ignorant about this. It is like arguing that gravity does not exist. There is no room for argument. You are arguing against long-established fact which you are too arrogant/not clever enough to understand, so therefore dismiss it.</p>
<p>I’m not gonna reply again as you’re clearly never gonna admit how stupidly wrong you are as you are too proud.</p>

            <p>but there is conversely a chance that within that 1,000,000 more than 1 person will do what you say .<br>
That’s pretty awful statistical analyayze .<br>
Claiming statistical insignifigance on an event that has a pre defined probability then arguing it wont be significant takes out the purpose of statistical accuracy .</p>
<p>If it was statistically known that only 1 in 1000000 wanted to destroy the world  If you gave 1,000,000 a big red button that destroyed the world if they pushed it , would you be happy to say that because we know of these people that only 1 in  1000000 people are likely to press the button that the risk is insignificant ?</p>

            <p>that depends<br>
if everyone was playing randomly, there are 2 players in every game, and you played, say, 100 games, then it would be statistically improbable (or unlikely), yes<br>
but theres a <em>big</em> difference between statistically insignificant and unlikely<br>
if something is unlikely, and you use a big sample size, its reasonable to assume that it will happen<br>
if something is statistically insignificant however, its just that, insignificant<br>
even if 1000000 people did something statistically insignificant, there’s less than a 1/1000000 chance that at least <strong>1</strong> of them will do that thing</p>

            <p>Rope fuck me you’re so wrong it hurts. You won 45% of games because YOU ARE BETTER AT UNO THAN THE OTHERS. That is not luck. That is skill. If that were converted into a rank you would be higher than your friends which is correct, as you are clearly better at uno than them.</p>
<p>You literally just gave evidence to disprove your point but somehow thinks this helps you. It’s fine if you’re young or whatever but you need to learn to not argue about shit you have 0 understanding of.</p>

<p>I have played tens of games of uno, and have won about 45% percent of the games I played (about 4 people average)</p>

<p>I’m assuming that you have played more than 30 games of ToL and that most players have played more than 30 games. They’ve been subjected to a large sample size and therefore have the allowance to reduce those levels of significance much lower than 0.05, and eventually you can reach levels of 0.00001. Once you do, that number becomes zero.</p>
