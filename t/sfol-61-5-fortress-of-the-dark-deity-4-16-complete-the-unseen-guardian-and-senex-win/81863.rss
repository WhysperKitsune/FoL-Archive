### SFoL 61: [color=darkred] Castle of the Blood God[/color], Hosted by @Amelia and @Marshal 

## Rules
Follow the https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244, and the https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926. Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.

## Gameplay

* Days are 48 hours long or until an execution ends it, Nights last 24 hours. The first day is an exception, it lasts only 24 hours and has no execution.
* You will be provided a DM with your classcard by the host, send your actions there.
* The Unseen or Blue Dragon will talk through a special Discord server or forum message.
* The Apostle/Marquess/Soulcatcher will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server or forum message.
* Both scum factions will cap at 3 members.

## Executions

* To accuse someone say “/vote [player]”. Please make the life of the hosts easier by bolding it (by putting ** ** around it)
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.
* When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.
* Voting &quot;/no lynch&quot; is an option.
* There is a special mechanic involving the votes, listed below:
 [details=&quot;The Voting Mechanic&quot;]
Some basic rules involving the voting.

* The First Two Voters
The first two voters on a player for the day will “tag” that player, and will be the ones Mithras rewards or punishes. There are exceptions, however. The Archdeacon is unable to tag anyone as the first exception. Secondly, a player can only be tagged twice per day. Future attempts to tag them will fail. Thirdly, each player can only tag one person per day. Fourthly, you cannot tag yourself. They automatically tag the first person they vote and it doesn’t change. 
* The Judgement
Mithras will attempt to judge those who tag the sacrificed. If the person who is sacrificed flips either groupscum or NK, the ones who tagged that player will receive an ability charge they can put in an ability of their choosing. However, if the sacrificed flips Cult, the same thing happens, but they must LOSE an ability use instead. If the sacrificed flips Neutral non NK, there is no judgement. If the one who tagged the sacrifice has no uses in any ability and the sacrificed flips Cult, they will commit suicide. If the one who tagged the sacrifice has maximum ability uses and the sacrificed is scum, they will save the point for later usage. An important fact is that ONLY CULT are affected by this, if any other faction is supposed to receive the judgement, it does nothing to them. 

[/details]


## Picking a New Archdeacon

* If there are less than 4 players a new archdeacon will not be selected.
* When the archdeacon dies a 12 hour period starts. In this, players may vote in their class PM for who they want to become the next archdeacon.
* Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned archdeacon. If votes are tied, an archdeacon election will be held the next day to determine it.

            <p>More or less.<br>
On D1, bleeding someone else would out the presence of a real Mauler (or Frostweaver), which would work against us.<br>
On D2, we dayocced you because we were hoping that you are the Vessel and we’d get to convert + 2-f-1, then waste another day on CRichard.<br>
On D3, I was alone in the court and couldn’t bleed anyone if I wanted to – thankfully my ‘plan’ from Allies provided me with an excuse.<br>
On D4, I had to confirm myself with my “wolf”.<br>
