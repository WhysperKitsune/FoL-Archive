    <description>Highwayman (Neutral) - A traveling kidnapper and extortionist.

Passive 1:
**Leering Mask** - You are immune to death on nights when you successfully use a night ability. (Lore reasoning: You&#39;re out doing your crimes, you have on your mask, you&#39;re ready for trouble. If you&#39;re prevented from doing your actions, your plans have been thrown off and you don&#39;t see the knife coming. XD )

_^ So if you&#39;re blocked, don&#39;t do anything, or you otherwise fail to use either of your 2 night abilities, you are not immune to death._

Day Ability:
**Costly Informants** - Select this ability to see how many players of each faction are left alive. (**Single use**.)

_^ For example: &quot;Your paid informants claim there are 3 Blue Dragon, 2 Evil Classes, and 2 Neutral Classes currently living.&quot; It doesn&#39;t tell you if it&#39;s Unseen or Cult, etc. Evil King would be counted in &quot;Evil Classes&quot;, Neutral King in &quot;Neutral Classes&quot;, etc. You get no information other than current numbers in each sub group._

Night Ability 1:
**Discreet Disposal** - Select a player at night to kill them and have them &quot;go missing&quot; the following day. There is no notice of the player missing, they are simply gone and it&#39;s up to players to notice. 2 nights later, they are revealed as &quot;presumed dead&quot;, and the standard death notices are shown, along with an empty room with no corpse. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Lofty Ransom** - Select a player at night to &quot;go missing&quot; the following day. This works the same as &quot;Discreet Disposal&quot;, but the abducted player **is not killed**. They will simply be absent for one day **as if** you had killed them. You will be able to hear the abducted player speaking, but cannot speak privately to them yourself. IE: You can see them talk, but can&#39;t whisper to them, etc. (Limited Use: 2?)
 
_^ This ability allows you to protect other Neutrals from the day&#39;s events, or &quot;test&quot; a pick if you&#39;re unsure about whether you actually want to kill them, and more. Players will never truly know if someone who is missing has died, or will be back the next day._

Lore:
A man of mystery, the Highwayman is the bane of wealthy travelers and all who find themselves lost on dark, twisting paths. For a few coins, he&#39;ll make your enemies disappear. For a few more coins, he&#39;ll make you disappear for those enemies.

Comments:
I like the idea of players having to actually _notice_ someone has gone missing. The Highwayman can also severely screw with people by abducting someone and letting them live - instantly making that victim seem suspicious. Why did the Highwayman spare them?? Hmmmmm...</description>

            <p>“I don’t think teen pot heads would fit in Throne of Lies.”</p>
<p>The info you supplied is irrelevant.<br>
1.) “North of Scandinavia” - didn’t know Throne of Lies took place there.<br>
2.) “Generally been believed”.<br>
3.) No mention of recreational use in your citation.<br>
4.) <strong>Teen pot heads.</strong> If you think the teenagers of northern Scandinavia were hanging out at home and on corners smoking hemp in the middle ages, by all means enjoy that mental image. <strong>They still weren’t called “Road Men”, then.</strong></p>

            <p>Also, I think a better name for this class might be “snatcher” or something, not highway man.</p>
<p>If you are up to it, I think the <em>best</em> name would be “road man”</p>

<p>I don’t think murder is legal, but murder is a concept modern-children are familiar, and comfortable with (cough CoD). Kidnapping is err, another story…</p>

<p>Any good parents tell their kids “stranger danger” and stuff like that and so do schools. I am a child and am familiar with kidnapping.</p>
<p>This game includes alcoholism, murder, flirting, and the like. Why is kidnapping off limits but not these?</p>

            <p>I have seen and read several novels involving issues like rape,  kidnapping,  and even incest.  While such acts are horrid and should not be condoned, I never once thought that that such things should not be included in a fictional landscape.</p>
