    <description>:game_die: &lt;big&gt;[color=gold] What is Auction mafia?[/color] &lt;/big&gt;

Auction mafia (previously known as poker mafia) works like a standard mafia game, with a town faction and a mafia faction. However, in Auction mafia all players start without any abilities and instead must get their abilities by placing a bid on the **Ability Pool**. 

(If you have played Poker Mafia before, you can skip to the &quot;What&#39;s new?&quot; section. If you are interested in reading the previous games you can find them [here](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fm-poker-mafia-the-mafia-leprechaun-and-gambler-win/60564) and [here](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fm-poker-mafia-2-the-elite-and-the-entertainer-won/66245)).

The classcards are the following:

:game_die: &lt;big&gt;[color=gold] Tokens[/color] &lt;/big&gt;

**Tokens** are the main currency of the game, and they are used to place bids on the **Ability pool** or to buy tickets for the **Raffle**.
All players get 5 tokens at the beginning of each day, and any unspent tokens will carry over to the next day. You can also get more tokens from **Events** or by **Selling back** your abilities.
Besides normal tokens, there are also &quot;Special tokens&quot;.
* **Special tokens:** These can only be used to place a bid on the ability pool. A special token will always get the highest bid on an ability against any amount of normal tokens.

----

:game_die: &lt;big&gt;[color=gold] Ability Pool[/color] &lt;/big&gt;

Every day there will be an **Ability Pool** with a certain number of abilities. The ability pool works similar to an auction: every player can place any number of tokens on one or more abilities in the pool, and at the end of the day the player that placed the highest bid on each ability will get said ability. Please note that unlike most auctions, **players who lose a bid will NOT get their tokens back.** Also, every bid you place will be private and won&#39;t be revealed to anyone.

The abilities on the pool will change every day, and the number of abilities in the pool will be equal to the number of living players minus 1, with a minimum of 3 abilities. Two of those will always be [color=gold]**Golden**[/color] abilities. Golden abilities are really powerful abilities that only have 1 use.

To place a bid on the pool, send a message to the host saying which ability and the number of tokens you want to place, for example: &quot;I want to place 5 tokens on ability #4&quot; or &quot;/bet 3 tokens on 4&quot;.

The abilities that can appear in the pool are the following (note, there is no need to read every single ability in order to play the game):

----

:game_die: &lt;big&gt;[color=gold] What&#39;s new? [/color] &lt;/big&gt;
If you played the previous poker mafia game, here you can find what changed. Basically, the game is a lot simpler now than it was before. The exact changes are as follows:
* All neutrals were removed

* Mafia now has a factional kill.
* Day is faster now, lasting 48 hours instead of 72.
* Mafia has a shared token pool and they don&#39;t lose tokens on death.
* Simplified the roulette. Renamed to &quot;Raffle&quot;.
* The number of events was lowered, but events are more impactful now.
* New abilities were added


----

:game_die: &lt;big&gt;[color=gold] Gameplay and special interactions[/color] &lt;/big&gt; 

[details=&quot;List of special rules and interactions&quot;]
* Days will last 48 hours, nights will last 24 hours.
* Lynching a player will instantly end the day.
* Lynching a player ends the raffle immediately.
* Bids are private and will not be revealed to anyone, except for some specific abilities or events. 
* You can place or change your bets at any point during the daytime.
* Each night, a player will get **ALL** the abilities in which they had the most tokens.
* If there is a tie for the highest bid, it will be solved by RNG.
* There are 8 different ability types: Support, Offensive, Social, Investigative, Killing, Gambling, Passive and Scum. 
* The abilities from the pool are given to the player at the beginning of the night, which means they can use them that same night.
* You can have more than 2 day and night abilities. There is no limit.
* You cannot target yourself with an ability unless specified otherwise.
* If you buy the same ability multiple times, you will get extra uses instead.
* If you use all uses on an ability, you will lose said ability. This means investigators won&#39;t be able to see that ability and you won&#39;t be able to sell it. This also applies to &quot;limited&quot; passive abilities such as one-time death immunity.
* You will know whether you got an ability or not at the beginning of the night. If you lose a bid, you will not know who got the ability.
* You cannot place a bid on abilities you sell back.
* The only way for town to get a scum ability is by bidding on it. You cannot get scum abilities randomly.
* There are certain abilities that scum cannot get randomly, these are abilities that don&#39;t benefit mafia in any way. The only way for them to get these abilities is to bid for them.
* For the purpose of abilities, each mafioso is considered to have tokens equal to the total amount of mafia tokens divided between the number of living mafiosos, rounded up.
* Framing abilities will make a player appear as mafia, abilities they use will appear as Killer and their current amount of tokens will appear doubled. They will also appear to visit whoever died that night. Abilities that &quot;hide&quot; a player do the opposite, they will appear as town, all abilities they use appear as support and their tokens will appear halved (rounded up).
* To prevent angle-shooting, every player is able to delay their actions or bids by asking the host.
* To help with fakeclaiming and prevent angle-shooting, players can ask the host for any flavor text such as &quot;You were occupied last night&quot; etc.
* Every player is able to ask the host any questions regarding mechanics or interactions, but asking for info about the game that can be considered cheating or angleshooting might result in a modkill
