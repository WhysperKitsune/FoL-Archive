    <title>The Whisper Mule King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-whisper-mule-king/17394</link>
    <description>I made this suggestion before as a Tongue-in-Cheek suggestion but because there has been a lot of drama with the King lately, I thought I officially suggest this because the more and more I think about it, I think this could work!

**The Problems with the King**:

1. King&#39;s Investigation checks were called out being too powerful.  So then the devs changed the King to only check royal blood but caused an uproar with people because the King was deemed useless and random executions were occurring due to the fact that the King wasn&#39;t leading the charge like before.

2.  People looked at the King for leadership and if the King didn&#39;t find SCUM in the first 4 days, people will call out the King as evil and execute him/her.

So let&#39;s say we remove the King&#39;s checks and still has the ability to lead the kingdom as a leader, how do you ask?

So the King&#39;s greatest asset is leading the charge in following up with leads and is the symbol for people to whisper leads to even though the king might be Good/Neutral/Evil. 

Let&#39;s empower the King&#39;s ability to be the whisper mule and have an ability called:

**King&#39;s Quarters**:  (Limited uses or Unlimited uses/day passive) - Allows the King to hide whispers from the public to and from the king.

This can be really useful because the smart players in ToL always notice and records who whispers who which leads into the social deduction if they are a Merc or if they are important classes in the game.  By hiding the whispers to and from the king, people will feel more safe in whispering leads to the king and scum can take advantage of this as well if they are wise.  So the Pros are a benefit to all factions.

Now for the night ability, let&#39;s remove the investigation check (still keep the x4 guards) and replace with:

**Royal Spy:**  Have your Spy report back conversations in a (room)

* If its the prince you selected, you can see both conversations from the prisoner and prince
* if its a scum, you can listen in the room of the scum whether its 2 or 3 scums
* if its the pyschic you can listen to both the pyschic and the linked (maybe we can remove this if you want to keep true lore)
* if its a person not talking to anyone,then you get back nothing from your spy

EDIT:  Or have limited options to either select to listen to the prince, pyschic or DK

By having the spy this will keep the pace going still with the kingdom when people ask for leads every day from the king thus still empowering the king to take charge.

I believe with these changes, this can open up more possiblities of deceit and clutch plays from BD so both sides can have fun with this while still making the King feel useful but not overpowerful before with the investigative checks.

All hail the new whisper king!!</description>
