    <title>Typo in ToS agreement window</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/typo-in-tos-agreement-window/45133</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Button says: View ToS, EULA, &amp; PP (Oepns External Browser)

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Button should say: View ToS, EULA &amp; PP (Opens External Browser)

#### Steps to reproduce:

Open game after the ToS update.

#### Comments:
I have no idea if you plan on translating the game to other languages but if you do you should work on making it more translate friendly. Slim it up and reuse text. (saves a lot of time and money)

Having ToS, EULA &amp; PP twice in once with article once without, once with an ampersand (&amp;)  and once with an and is unnecessary work and written lines.</description>

            <p>I use that last comma because I pause before saying the last item, so I put a pause before the last item in text</p>

            <p>Afaik the ampersand purely stands for ‘and’<br>
Andin that case I believe it is optional whether you use a comma before the final item in a list of at least 3 items</p>
