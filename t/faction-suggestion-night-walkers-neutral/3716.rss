    <title>[Faction Suggestion] Night Walkers (Neutral)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/faction-suggestion-night-walkers-neutral/3716</link>
    <description>Comment: Ok, so I haven&#39;t played this game yet, (gonna get it by the end of this week) but I really wanted to suggest something since I like how in depth this game is ( Been watching a lot of Videos about it). So if there is something I made a mistake on please let me know!

**Night Walkers: (Neutral)**- A Faction that wishes to Convert everyone into Night Walkers

**Passive 1:**  **Fetching:** If an investigative role invests you, you will come up as not suspicious

**Passive 2:** **Royal Blood:** Allows the player to step forward for next King nomination
_Note: Can only be Royal if you started out as a Night Walker or if you were a royal role and Converted into a Night Walker_

**Day Ability 1:**  **Hypnotic Gaze :** Lets you control the target player action (2 uses)

*Note: This ability prevents the target from speaking, voting, OR day ability. you can only choose one.*

**Day Ability 2:** **One Thought:** You send a message, but to a random person (2 uses)
*Comment: This is just to cause confusion and the person wont know it&#39;s you, a random persons name will show up with the Message*

**Night Ability 1:** **Forbidden Kiss:** You will be able to select a target, they will be converted into a Night Walker. But you can&#39;t convert Priests, Knights, Paladins, or Good Kings ( if you hit any of these roles they will be alerted that there is a Night Walker). You can convert Everyone else. (Unlimited use) 

**Night Ability 2:** **Open Mind:**  Allows you to see what faction your target is apart of after the first night (1 use)
_Comment: I say one use because it would be really OP if your are able to know multiple peoples factions (IMO)_

**If A Night Walker Becomes King....**

**GrandMaster (Evil Alignment):** 

_Note: You will still be able to win with your Night Walker brethren and the Grand Masters Goal is still the same now, but they have more power._

**Passive 1:** **Loyalty:** The King can&#39;t be executed for the first 3 days

**Passive 2:** **Glamour:** The Butler can&#39;t Occupie you and you can&#39;t get drunk (Wears off after the 3rd day of being king)

**Day Ability 1:** **Dark Rite:** Gives Target one extra day ability usage ( 1 use)
_Note: Can only work on your own faction, if it is not your own faction the target will know you tried to give them an ability. Then your Basically Screwed_

**Day Ability 2:** **The Royal Finger:** Next vote for treason will count twice

**Night Ability 1:** **Prey(Stronger Version of Forbidden Kiss):** allows you or one of your Night Walkers to convert two people in one night( you can now Convert Priest, Knights, and Paladins), but you can&#39;t convert for the next 2 nights (1 use)
**Night Ability 2:** **Dark Meditation:** Allows you to restore the use of your dark rite (1 use)

**Lore:** You were once a noble, but you were banished for using dark magic. Once you perfected it, it granted you immortality and a desire to not be alone....

_Comment: The goal of this faction is not to kill off others that will oppose you but to convert all (well most) into Night Walkers, I thought I&#39;d come up with something challenging (That is not just straight up killing), since no other faction can win with you, they will most likely try to kill you XD._</description>
