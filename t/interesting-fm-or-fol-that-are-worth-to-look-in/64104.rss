    <title>Interesting FM or FoL that are worth to look in</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/interesting-fm-or-fol-that-are-worth-to-look-in/64104</link>
    <description>My request is in title.

I would like to look into cases that were including very well at least one of the factors like: Scumreads/Deduction or Teamwork regardless of the alignment.

If you have any good examples on this is site please let me know and which factor is included(Can be multiplied). :male_detective:

And I’m talking about past games.</description>

            <p>SFoL 12 was kinda weird for some reason…high presence of Teamwork that’s for sure however those soft claims almost screw up BD… <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png?v=9" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"></p>

            <p>Jeez FoL 5 was indeed a salty mine especially with an argue between PKR and Orange. Deduction was indeed the most visible factor here. I enjoyed it. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>
