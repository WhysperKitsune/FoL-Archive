        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>About two o’clock, after lunch, the director came in to the discing room.<br>
I have something to tell you, he said. He looked terrible; his hair was untidy, his eyes were pink and wobbling, as though he’d been drinking.<br>
We all looked up, turned off our machines. There must have been eight or ten of us in the room.<br>
I’m sorry, he said, but it’s the law. I really am sorry.<br>
For what? somebody said.<br>
I have to let you go, he said. It’s the law, I have to. I have to let you all go. He said this almost gently, as if we were wild animals, frogs he’d caught, in a jar, as if he were being humane.<br>
We’re being fired? I said. I stood up. But why?<br>
Not fired, he said. Let go. You can’t work here anymore, it’s the law. He ran his hands through his hair and I thought, He’s gone crazy. The strain has been too much for him and he’s blown his wiring.<br>
You can’t just do that, said the woman who sat next to me. This sounded false, improbable, like something you would say on television.<br>
It isn’t me, he said. You don’t understand. Please go, now. His voice was rising. I don’t want any trouble. If there’s trouble the books might be lost, things will get broken…<br>
He looked over his shoulder. They’re outside, he said, in my office. If you don’t go now they’ll come in themselves. They gave me ten minutes. By now he sounded crazier than ever.<br>
He’s loopy, someone said out loud; which we must all have thought.<br>
But I could see out into the corridor, and there were two men standing there, in uniforms, with machine guns. This was too theatrical to be true, yet there they were: sudden apparitions, like Martians. There was a dreamlike quality to them; they were too vivid, too at odds with their surroundings.<br>
Just leave the machines, he said while we were getting our things together, filing out. As if we could have taken them.<br>
We stood in a cluster, on the steps outside the library. We didn’t know what to say to one another. Since none of us understood what had happened, there was nothing much we could say. We looked at one another’s faces and saw dismay, and a certain shame, as if we’d been caught doing something we shouldn’t.<br>
It’s outrageous, one woman said, but without belief.<br>
What was it about this that made us feel we deserved it?</p>

            <p>I said there was more than one way of living with your head in the sand and that if Moira thought she<br>
could create Utopia by shutting herself up in a women-only enclave she was sadly mistaken. Men were<br>
not just going to go away, I said. You couldn’t just ignore them.<br>
That’s like saying you should go out and catch syphilis merely because it exists, Moira said.<br>
Are you calling Luke a social disease? I said.<br>
Moira laughed. Listen to us, she said. Shit. We sound like your mother.<br>
We both laughed then, and when she left we hugged each other as usual. There was a time when we didn’t hug, after she’d told me about being gay; but then she said I didn’t turn her on, reassuring me, and we’d gone back to it. We could fight and wrangle and namecall, but it didn’t change anything underneath. She was still my oldest friend.<br>
Is.</p>

            <p>They’ve given me a small electric fan, which helps in this humidity. It whirs on the floor, in the corner, its blades encased in grille-work. If I were Moira, I’d know how to take it apart, reduce it to its cutting edges. I have no screwdriver, but if I were Moira I could do it without a screwdriver. I’m not Moira.<br>
What would she tell me, about the Commander, if she were here? Probably she’d disapprove. She<br>
disapproved of Luke, back then. Not of Luke but of the fact that he was married. She said I was poaching, on another woman’s ground. I said Luke wasn’t a fish or a piece of dirt either, he was a human being and could make his own decisions.<br>
She said I was rationalizing. I said I was in love. She said that was no excuse. Moira was always more<br>
logical than I am. I said she didn’t have that problem herself anymore, since she’d decided to prefer women, and as far as I could see she had no scruples about stealing them or borrowing them when she felt like it.<br>
She said it was different, because the balance of power was equal between women so sax was an evensteven transaction. I said “even Steven” was a sexist phrase, if she was going to be like that, and anyway that argument was outdated. She said I had trivialized the issue and if I thought it was outdated I was living with my head in the sand.</p>
