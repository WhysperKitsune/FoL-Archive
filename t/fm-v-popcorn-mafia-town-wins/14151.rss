    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fm-v-popcorn-mafia-town-wins/14151</link>
    <description># Pop pop pop!

### Rules
Follow the general forum rules and the FoL rules.
In addition, inactivity will not be tolerated. If a player has not posted within 24 hours, they will be prodded.
If a player does not respond within 12 hours of recieving a prod, or recieves two prods, they will be forcibly replaced.

### Gameplay
Before the game starts, the Mafia must elect a townie to be the gunbearer.
That player has 48 hours to shoot another player. Discussion will take place during this time.
If they do not shoot another player within these 48 hours the gunbearer will commit suicide and the gun will go back to the Mafia. The Mafia will then be given 24 hours to choose a new gunbearer. Discussion will still take place during this time.
If the gunbearer hits scum, they keep the gun.
If the gunbearer hits town, the gunbearer dies and the targeted townie becomes the new gunbearer.
The gunbearer is always announced and confirmed as innocent.
Mafia wins when the number of living mafia members equal or exceed the number of living townies.
Town wins when all mafia goons are dead.
Shooting must be done in thread by saying **/shoot [player]**, bolded and on its own line. You should also notify me by typing @orangeandblack5 in the same post. 
Mafia will talk through a PM chain I create. They may talk at any time.
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it.
There is no voting in this game. The gunbearer takes the place of a lynch.
There are no last wills or death notes.

### To Join
To join, simply say **/join**.
Priority will be given to newer players, should capacity be reached.
The game may be shrunk or expanded depending on expressed interest.

            <p>11-player Popcorn is a pre-established variant. Town still doesn’t lose that often.</p>
<p>Basically, the game is always either somewhat Town-sided or heavily in favor of the Mafia.</p>

            <p>Hip, I congratulate you for your shot.<br>
That was impressive, managing to pull that shot off, good job.<br>
At least Meth won the popular game out of the 2 people who could be shot.</p>

            <h1>DISCLAIMER:</h1>
<p>The Town always has an advantage in Popcorn Mafia due to the game’s mechanics.</p>
<p>Changing a slot to another Mafia member to try and counter this means that if the first Townie misshoots the game ends immediately in Mafia victory.</p>
