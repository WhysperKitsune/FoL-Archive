    <description># Topaz Championship of Rokugan
![image|320x226](upload://9MeiRt1qXkR13vUiH244evQDHbo.jpeg)

There is a tourney in the village of Tsuma! Held each year, the invites to the Topaz Championship are sent to the most brilliant students all around of Rokugan to prove their skills as the best samurai that was trained this year. Your character received one of those invitations. This is the kind of chance that only happens once in a lifetime.  Do not disappoint.

[details=&quot;Further Information - Topaz Championship&quot;]

&gt; The Topaz Championship is a competition that tests young men and women in all the skills that a samurai is expected to know. Points are awarded to those who receive the highest marks in each contest. Those who gain enough points may also participate in the climactic iaijutsu (duel) tournament, the winner of which is declared the Topaz Champion for a period of one year.
&gt;
&gt; The position of Topaz Champion is accompanied by numerous material rewards, the most significant of which is an exquisite suit of armour crafted and maintained by Imperial smiths. 
&gt; The Topaz Armour is the most immediate badge of authority associated with the position, but it is typical for a Topaz Champion to be offered a number of different prestigious positions as part of the victory. 
&gt; The most frequent appointment is as an Emerald Magistrate (FBI investigator), indirectly serving the Emerald Champion (head-chief of diplomacy). The prestige associated with the position ensures that the competition is fierce.
&gt;
&gt; Individual competitions during the Championship take the form of a match, wherein two contestants compete directly with one another, or tests, in which elder samurai ask questions of the contestant. Each competition completed successfully grants the contestant a single point. In the case of a match, only the victor receives the point. 
&gt; A competitor must attain a total of five points to pass their gempukku (assuming they still did not) and gain entry into the iaijutsu tournament.
&gt;
&gt; At the beginning of any contest using the match format, the master of ceremonies withdraws small ceramic tiles from an exquisitely crafted vase. Each tile has the name of a single contestant on it, and two are drawn at a time to determine who will face each other during the matches. For a test, the tiles are simply used to determine in what order the contestants will be tested.
[/details]
---

## Character Guidelines
&gt; The characters are young samurai who are about to be tested before undergoing their gempukku ceremony (a coming-of-age test), after which they will be awarded their daisho (pair of swords), signifying their status as adult samurai. 
&gt; Some may have undergone private gempukku ceremonies at home, according to the family traditions (the Crab would be notable examples, since their regular gempukku ceremonies are tests of readiness for combating the Shadowlands). For others, their clan may view this as their official gempukku. 
&gt; For all the contestants, though, the opportunity for both great recognition and embarrassing ignominy is ever present.


[details=&quot;Changes to the system&quot;]
&gt; The campaign is set in 1120. As such, assume that the following changes are true:
&gt; 
&gt; - The Agasha is a Dragon Clan family instead of a Phoenix Clan one.
&gt; - The rulling imperial line is Hantei.
&gt; - The Mantis Clan is a minor clan.
&gt; - Moshi Shugenja is a Centipede Clan school instead of a Mantis Clan one.
&gt; - Tsuruchi Archer and Tsuruchi Bounty Hunter are Wasp Clan schools instead of Mantis Clan ones.
&gt; - Toritaka Bushi is a Falcon Clan school instead of a Crab Clan one.
&gt; - Advantages and disadvantages related to *Maigo no Musha* are not available.
&gt; - Advantages and disadvantages related to the Gozoku are not available.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; [details=&quot;Changes - Advanced Mechanics (Book of Water)&quot;]
&gt; - Some minor clans may not be present. Contact the GM to sort things out if you are interested on them.
&gt; - The Spider Clan does not exist.
&gt; - Ask the GM for assistance regarding minor clans, ancestors and vassal families.
&gt; - Shosuro, Yogo Junzo, Bayushi, Togashi, Shinjo, and Kuni Yori are not available as Ancestors.
&gt; - Moshi Azami is a Centipede Clan ancestor instead of a Mantis Clan one.
&gt; - You can&#39;t play non-hyuman characters, although other advanced mechanics are allowed.
&gt; [/details]
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Homebrewing, optional rules and GM preferences**
&gt; * Lore: Heraldry is not used to identify people based on their Glory Rank anymore, and now solely exists to identify mons. Lore: [Their Clan] will be used for this purpose.
&gt; * Lore: [Clan of School] is a school skill for all characters, given for free.
&gt; * Cursed by the Realm: Yume-Do has been replaced for the following: 
&gt; &gt; **Cursed by the Realm: Yume-Do** [Spiritual] (3 or 5 points)
&gt; &gt; *You suffer from terrible nightmares that impact the quality of your resting times. Every night, roll a die: On 1-5 (3 points) or 1-9 (5 points), regain half Void Points rounded up, +5 TN for Meditation and Tea Ceremony. Shugenjas can take this disadvantage for 4 or 6 points.*
&gt; * The *Battle Healing* advantage is not in use.
&gt; * *Touch of the Spirit Realms: Yomi* costs 5 instead of 7.
&gt; * The *Dark Fate* disadvantage is not in use.
&gt; * Assume the optional gender conventions in the Book of Air are in use.
&gt; * Assume that the traditional male hairstyle is not in use.
[/details]

You will be playing children, aka rank 0 characters. The guidelines for character creation are as follows:

[details=&quot;Level 0 Guidelines&quot;]
- You will start with 1 on all attributes instead of the usual 2. Family and School bonuses still apply.
- You will start with only four out of your eight school skills, at your choice. You can buy the other  school skills with XP, but they will not count as school skills mechanically speaking.
- You start with 25 experience points instead of the usual 40.
- Your cap for disadvantages is 5 points instead of the usual 10.
- You don&#39;t have a level 1 school technique.
- Shugenja don&#39;t have Affinities or Deficiencies.
- Remove all weapons (but a wakizashi) and armors from your starting equipment.
- Your travelling pack has 5 items instead of the usual 10.
- You start with a number of bu corresponding to the number of koku you usually would have.
- Whenever you would lose honor due to a breach of etiquette, you instead only lose half this amount.
- Your starting Status is 0.6, and your Glory is 0.
- Character&#39;s age should be between 12 and 20, with the average being 15.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Courtesy of Mindshred, GM of the Hollow Throne Campaign.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/0/a0c4e3120d2cf7b9c6a97db9bb9e02f815fca310.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="mWedRWHDVZFuUK39HPnWEcPTK5G" width="200" height="215"></p>
<p>We’ll be using <a href="http://orokos.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">~Orokos~</a> to roll dice for this game. Rolls made on other dice rolling programs will not be considered valid rolls.</p>
<p>I’ll go over a brief walkthrough of how Orokos works.</p>
<p>Firstly, you’ll want to sign up for an account.  <em>Please sign up using your forum name so I can tell it is Ami, not ‘banana’, who is making the roll.</em>  It’s under the “Dice Roller” tab at the top.</p>
<p><strong>When Rolling Dice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Place your character’s name in the Character box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place “i42” in the Campaign box, just like that, without the quotation marks. If you do not do this, the roll will not show up in the i42 campaign folder, and your roll will not count. Please do not forget this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the description for your roll in the Description box. This is where you note what you’re rolling, why, and any Raises that you’re calling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you just need to put your dice code in the Dice to Roll box and hit the “Roll 'em” button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to roll five ten-sided dice and keep two of them, with exploding 10s, that would be 5k2 in L5R terms. To make that work in Orokos, it would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>5d10o10k2</li>
</ul>
<p>The “5d10” is five ten-sided dice, the “o10” is exploding 10s, and the “k2” is keep highest.</p>
<p>If you wanted to keep the lowest dice, such as when you’re sparring, you would use “l2” instead of “k2” in the example above.</p>
<ul>
<li>5d10o10l2</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t want your dice to explode - such as with an unskilled roll - just remove the “o10” part of the equation and go from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>5d10k2</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing is that you have everything in its specific order: each “rule” must go in the order above (and there’s a pull-down help list in the roller to explain it) or you’ll just get an error message. For instance, you must have the “5d10” before the “o10” which must be before the “k2.”</p>
<p>If you need to roll multiple dice (such as three rolls at once), you would prefix this with N#, where N is the number of times you want to roll. For instance, to roll the 5k2 listed above three times, you would need to put:</p>
<ul>
<li>3#5d10o10k2</li>
</ul>
<p>The last bit of coding applies if you’re rolling a skill for which you have a relevant emphasis, such as the Honesty emphasis for Sincerity when making a Sincerity (Honesty) roll. In this case, you add the “roZ” coding to ensure that it rerolls dice results of “Z” or lower (in our case, Z will usually equal one). Using the above 5k2, that would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>5d10ro1o10k2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Noting Raises and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Please remember to note why you’re rolling dice and any Raises you might be calling on your roll. If you do not note your number of Raises - or you call one Raise when you intended to call three, or visa versa - then you’re out of luck, because what you wrote in the description section is what counts.</p>
<p>If you somehow make a mistake when making a roll, contact the GM before you reroll, so that I understand the circumstances and don’t just assume that you’re cheating by rolling again.</p>
<p>Many players other than the GM watch Orokos, so do not be tempted to cheat. You will get caught, and you will be removed from the game.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to ping me.</p>
