# QUEEN

This is a new take on King. Instead of changes kings abilities I think we have to mix things up. This queen version has a 50% of spawning instead of King. She also has a 35% of being evil just like current King. This will add management and more interaction with Queen. 

New mechanic: important to read 
No matter if day or night any player in the game can donate to the Queen. There will be a donate button next to the current Queen. When clicked the player then selects one of their limited abilities to donate to the Queen and she will gain 2 bridles from it. The Queen will know who donated to her. The player will lose one of their uses 

# ALL OF HER ABILITIES WILL COST BRIDLES

Now all of her abilities come in packages similar to Alch. i know  this seems a bit over powered but hopefully the Bridle system balances it out

&gt;**Passive 1**: _Hard worker_ 
You are immune to most occu and redirection. You can use more than 1 ability every day and night,at the cost of bridles .(can use different day abilities in the same day but cant use the same ability twice during the same day)
&gt;
&gt;**Passive 2**: _Kingdom&#39;s taxes_ 
You start with 4 bridles at the beginning of the game. Each day you gain 1 bridle. If someone is executed then you gain 2 more bridles


&gt; [color=orange] **Day ability 1:** _Queens power kit_   [/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Royal finger** [color=yellow](1 Bridles) [/color] - your next vote will count twice
**Decide fate**  [color=yellow](3 Bridle)[/color]- (same as before)
**Private messages** [color=yellow](3 Bridles)[/color] - all messages from you and to you are hidden 


  &gt; [color=orange] **Day ability 2**; _Queens guards_  [/color]
**Public execution**  [color=yellow](20 Bridles)[/color] - ,select a player, they will be killed on the spot,{WHEN YOU USE THIS ABILITY, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE _QUEENS GUARDS_ ABILITY AGAIN)
**signed papers** [color=yellow](3 Bridles) [/color] - select a player, that player can not be voted or vote for today
**Queens pet** [color=yellow](3 Bridles) [/color] - select a player, that player can not be effected by any day abilities except for Prince


 &gt; [color=orange] **Night ability 1;** _Queens night shift guard_  [/color]
**Allies** [color=yellow](1 Bridles) [/color]-  [color=Blue](Good Queen) [/color]  protect a player other than yourself, giving them death immunity  and discover if they are BD  / [color=Red](Evil Queen) [/color]  protect a player other than yourself, giving them death immunity and discover if they are (Unseen/Cult)
**Self Guard** [color=yellow](2 Bridles) [/color] - have a guard protect you giving you death immunity 
**Order execution** [color=yellow](10 Bridles) [/color] -  Kill a player, bypassing death immunity(Will be announced to court)
**safe guard** [color=yellow](7 Bridles) [/color] - make a player occu immune 

   &gt; [color=orange] **Night ability 2;** _Queens personal agenda_  [/color]
**Royal guards** [color=yellow](4 Bridles) [/color]  
** throne** [color=yellow](5 Bridles) [/color]-
**Overtime** [color=yellow](6 Bridles) [/color]- select a player, that player can now choose two targets tonight, BUT the following night they will be prevented from using that ability again(Cant be used for conversion) (cant be used for personal abilities like butler&#39;s party ability)


This hopefully allows the leader of the group take charge more with a variety of abilities. If you have any questions please ask</description>

<strong>Court law</strong> (10 Bridles) - declare no trails for the rest of the day [will be announced]<br>
-Extremely abusable by evil queen shouldent even be considered</p>

<p><strong>Public execution</strong> (20 Bridles) - ,select a player, they will be killed on the spot,{WHEN YOU USE THIS ABILITY, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE <em>QUEENS GUARDS</em> ABILITY AGAIN)<br>

<strong>Force vote</strong> (3 Bridles) - make a player vote for selected player<br>
-No. Just no<br>
<strong>Night ability 1;</strong> <em>Queens night shift guard</em><br>
<strong>Allies</strong> (1 Bridles) - (Good Queen) protect a player other than yourself, giving them death immunity and discover if they are BD / (Evil Queen) protect a player other than yourself, giving them death immunity and discover if they are (Unseen/Cult)<br>

<strong>Order execution</strong> (10 Bridles) - Kill a player, bypassing death immunity(Will be announced to court)<br>
-how about n o<br>
<strong>safe guard</strong> (7 Bridles) - make a player occu immune<br>
-so expensive its not worth it unless the occ immunity is perm and can be used on evil<br>

-…ok<br>
<strong>Devoted throne</strong> (5 Bridles) - declare no voting the following day(will be announced to the court) (once used, you can not use again)<br>
-again abusable AF by evil queen<br>
<strong>Special delivery</strong> - Good Queen (0 Bridles) Use any of your abilities free of charge, <em>can not be used for public execution</em> or order execution / (Evil Queen) (3 Bridles) ] send a message to the unseen/cult tonight<br>
-where did this even come from dont even think about this one<br>
<strong>Overtime</strong> (6 Bridles) - select a player, that player can now choose two targets tonight, BUT the following night they will be prevented from using that ability again(Cant be used for conversion) (cant be used for personal abilities like butler’s party ability)<br>
-redundent and pricey</p>
