<p>Bleh. I can’t see why a wolf wouldn’t do that, as Light is easy to push and put suspicion on. Fluffposting/not caring shouldn’t clear people unless in specific circumstances; it’s fine to take it into consideration when solving a slot, but that alone shouldn’t dictate the read. That’s what I did to Hippo in DGADT, and he was a wolf.</p>

<p>As for Cecil, am I the only one that he rubs the wrong way so far? His reads just don’t look that genuine, and I find it unrealisrtic tol have that many reads on so many people so quickly.

<p>Her reads look just fine to me, she has good reasonings behind them as well. If a player is competent enough to fake that, there’s no need to think they couldn’t genuinely make those kinds of reads as well.</p>

<p>The problem is that you seem to think about “would a townie do this?” instead of “would SETH do this as town?” Seth has somewhat of an extraordinary playstyle, so the latter should be applied to him more.</p>

          <p>Those scumreading me for asking questions but not making conclusions - would you feel the same if I posted a useless ‘Noted’ after the answers? Because I am bareing them in mind and just had nothing to add to the answers so saved a meaningless post.</p>
<p>They are forming my reads, and you’ll see that before day end (hopefully within 10 hours depending on how much time I get to skive off at work today). Several people have caught my eye and I’ll be posting my detailed thoughts later.</p>
