Passive 2: Sworn loyalty - You cannot be converted for the first 3 nights

Day Ability: Oversee - Learn who the Prince is jailing and listen in on the conversation (3 uses)

Retainer - Unseen Support
Passive: Royal Support - You know who the Prince is.

Day Ability: Oversee - Learn who the Prince is jailing, the unseen will listen in on the conversation (3 uses)

            <p>I really like this idea, lets the n1 prince death not happen but also gives the unseen a really good convertible target that would swing the tide of the game in their favor if they convert him.</p>
