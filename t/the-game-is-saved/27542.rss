    <title>The game is SAVED!</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-game-is-saved/27542</link>
    <description>Thank you devs for getting rid of the NK to king Meta. It was ruining the game and I almost even quit playing because it was driving me nuts. But the game is saved. And now you can&#39;t out yourself as NK and have BD vote you king for it. Glad devs could see that blue dragon looking a reaper in the face and saying &quot;yes, we should make him our king&quot; is ridiculous. Thank you.</description>
