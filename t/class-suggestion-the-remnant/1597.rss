**Lore**

_Long ago, there was a Young Prince who excelled at his job at bringing justice to The Unseen. Late one night, he was paid a visit by The Unseen Mastermind. After hours of back and forth battling, the Mastermind managed to get into his mind. The Young Prince succumbed to the Mastermind and gave him his loyalty._

_This was the only record of a Prince ever being converted over to The Unseen. Huge precautions were taken after that. After years of service to The Unseen, he was soon promoted to Mastermind. However, his ties with The Blue Dragon made him very risky to keep around. Many of The Unseen were jealous that a young man such as the former Prince were given such a high ranking._

_During one of the nights, the Young Mastermind paid a visit to the Blue Dragon Sheriff to attempt a conversion, but he saw through the Young Mastermind and saw his true self. He saw the man he was before, the Young Prince. The Sheriff took his sword and attempted to cut him down but the Young Mastermind escaped, barely. He retreated back to The Unseen hideout to report his failure. He was banished._

_A former Prince. A former Mastermind. The Remnant was said to have been one of the only Princes and Masterminds who had lost their way. A failed Blue Dragon and a failed Unseen. All he could think of now was to see them all burn._

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>All in all, this class wants both sides to suffer.</p>
<p>Forcing the Mastermind to convert means one less BD, but that also means a higher chance for them to be discovered.</p>
<p>A lot of the abilities here would be to cause utter chaos.</p>
<p>People get hung for bad reasons, and this creates them.</p>
<p>Sheriff said he found Unseen but was Blue Dragon? Is he fake?<br>
Princess said this person was not BD but he’s BD? Execute her?<br>
Observer gave wrong results? Clearly evil?</p>
<p>Same for not talkers… people get executed for not talking.</p>
<p>Butler says he served wine to 3, but 8 was Occupied? Liar?</p>
<p>Prince executing wasn’t something I was fond of writing <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> I’m not decided on that myself</p>
<p>The role is 100% Neutral. Only wants himself to win, but can win with Reaper/Possessor. So it gives those two roles more control should they be in the same game.</p>

<p>This is overpowered</p>
<p>Basically the whole Night ability is overpowered.<br>
Also the fact that it would make Prince execute (bad for bd, in most cases) while it would make Cult/mm target someone convertable would benefit them.</p>

<p>Bad idea. You could lose/win due to a missclick.</p>
<p>Creative lore.</p>
<p>Generally I think you haven’t really decided if this class is Neutral, Cult, Unseen or BR. Even though you claim it’s a Neutral class, the abilities clearly benefit the evil side.</p>

            <p>I know, I just wanted to combine the two in and that’s why I put (If able to) mainly for the Butler.</p>
<p>Basically, I realize that a role like this where he’s against both Dragon and Unseen, he’ll want complete chaos and everyone to get executed, and giving things like, false results for investigative and straight killing from others and things like that, just utter chaos.</p>
<p>Yaknow?</p>
<p>I like it… (still not sure about Lore)</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>*Royal Blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the goal is kinda bad in my opinion. The Remnant’s abilities don’t help him get rid of the King meaning the King may live forever and you just lose with nothing you could do. Also, the lore kinda messes up the alignment; He is opposed to both BD sisnce he was BR and also opposed to Unseen, since he remains BR, so being a Neutral King would just get him the goal to survive, while he should try to bring br back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having the goal to become King would be bad as his goal would change again when he becomes King. So he would have to complete <strong>TWO</strong> goals instead of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counter-Suggestion/Fix: Goal changes to Eliminate all enemy factions and Royal Blood gets removed</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p><em>Long ago, there was a Young Prince who excelled at his job at bringing justice to The Unseen. Late one night, he was paid a visit by The Unseen Mastermind.

<p><em>During one of the nights, the Young Mastermind paid a visit to the Blue Dragon Sheriff to attempt a conversion, but he saw through the Young Mastermind and saw his true self. He saw the man he was before, the Young Prince. The Sheriff took his sword and attempted to cut him down but the Young Mastermind escaped, barely. He retreated back to The Unseen hideout to report his failure. He was banished.</em></p>
<p><em>A former Prince. A former Mastermind. The Remnant was said to have been one of the only Princes and Masterminds who had lost their way. A failed Blue Dragon and a failed Unseen. All he could think of now was to see them all burn.</em></p>
