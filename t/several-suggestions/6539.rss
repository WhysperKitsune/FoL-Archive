    <title>Several suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/several-suggestions/6539</link>
    <description>Hello

I suggest several improvement in Throne of Lies:

1) Make full descriptions of game mechanics at least in wiki or maybe in game too.
There are alot of things in game mechanics that new player can&#39;t know until he screws a game. For example:
- If there are 2 players left and one of them is Possessor than Possessor wins even if he can&#39;t kill another player. For example, Mastermind and Possessor remain alive - Possessor wins.
- After 3 occupations player becomes immune to occupation.
- Does Court Wizard &quot;visit&quot; players or not?
- Bleed and poison can make you die at the end of the night. Though players that are immune to death at night still can die at night.
This is only small part of hidden in-game mechanics.

2) Mathcmaking: experienced players should not be matched with newbies.
This is obvious. Random execusions without real evidence, silent chat during days and no logs are okay for new players and still can be fun for them, but are very annoying for experienced players. Also you often can&#39;t distinguish newbie player from the evil one: you have strong and hardly calculated evidence that he is evil, but after execution he appears to be just first time Blue Dragon player who doesn&#39;t know very basics of the game. I think this is not fun.

3) Players that left the game before they died or were accused should be punished for this.
Maybe this system already exists, i don&#39;t know, but there are still some players who do that.

4) Draw should not be considered as defeat for everyone.

5) Ability changes.
- Replace Noble&#39;s &quot;Order&quot; with Marshal&#39;s &quot;Snoop&quot;.
Many people say that Noble is useless class. Such update should make him more interesting to play and does&#39;t conflict with an idea of Noble as a social class who can spy. Reading players journals can be good for Blue Dragon because they can catch the one who writes fake logs.
- Change in Trollbox ability.
In hands of a strong Scorned player this ability becomes extremely annoying. In a game where all players are good this ability makes half of the chat be filled with &quot;3, confirm?&quot; &quot;16, repeat?&quot; messages and does nothing except irritation. When not all players are good this ability is extremely imbalanced and allowes Scorned to easily kill his targets and often ruin the game of Blue Dragons.
I suggest to change Trollbox to an ability that would mute a chosen player in chat for 1 day and allow Scorned or Fool to write message for this player in that day, so this player can&#39;t object. 1 charge per game. Such update should save Trollbox as Trollbox while become powerful and not annoying ability.
- Make Merc immune to Brainwash/Convert.
I&#39;m not sure about this, but the fact that Merc can be converted makes her untrusted even for her target. Unseen/Cult still can convert her target and make Merc their ally. Also she would become fully Neutral as all other Neutrals are immune to Brainwash/Convert. So Neutral would mean that it remains Neutral for the rest of the game.

6) Tiny bug: confusing messages about how many souls remains at reaper after been attacked.</description>

<p>That’s true. Where should this be displayed? There isn’t enough room for it in every class card. Maybe create a general info page in the handbook.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just a thought. The developers could make it so that each ability icon/name in the class cards is clickable. When you click it, a new window pops up with a more detailed description.</p>
<p>This way you can keep the current layout of class cards, but add all the relevant information (and maybe some simple pointers too).</p>

<p>From the pattern I’ve seen with tie-breakers in a 1v1 scenario, the game checks to see who would win over an infinite amount of nights. If nobody wins, the priority goes to Neutral Killers &gt; Unseen/Cult &gt; Blue Dragon.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think it would be so overpowered because everyone would know that player could be Trollboxed. Prince could jail player and ask him in prison was he Trollbox or not. Everyone could wait one day to ask player if he was Trollboxed or not. Of course, waiting a day could be critical. So this would be powerful ability (with 1 charge) but would remove the fact that noone can trust messages in the chat till the end of the game and remove the need of “confirm?”, “repeat?” messages after each sentence.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I suggest several improvement in Throne of Lies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make full descriptions of game mechanics at least in wiki or maybe in game too.<br>
There are alot of things in game mechanics that new player can’t know until he screws a game. For example:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If there are 2 players left and one of them is Possessor than Possessor wins even if he can’t kill another player. For example, Mastermind and Possessor remain alive - Possessor wins.</li>
<li>After 3 occupations player becomes immune to occupation.</li>
<li>Does Court Wizard “visit” players or not?</li>
<li>Bleed and poison can make you die at the end of the night. Though players that are immune to death at night still can die at night.<br>
This is only small part of hidden in-game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Mathcmaking: experienced players should not be matched with newbies.<br>
This is obvious. Random execusions without real evidence, silent chat during days and no logs are okay for new players and still can be fun for them, but are very annoying for experienced players. Also you often can’t distinguish newbie player from the evil one: you have strong and hardly calculated evidence that he is evil, but after execution he appears to be just first time Blue Dragon player who doesn’t know very basics of the game. I think this is not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players that left the game before they died or were accused should be punished for this.<br>
Maybe this system already exists, i don’t know, but there are still some players who do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw should not be considered as defeat for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Replace Noble’s “Order” with Marshal’s “Snoop”.<br>
Many people say that Noble is useless class. Such update should make him more interesting to play and does’t conflict with an idea of Noble as a social class who can spy. Reading players journals can be good for Blue Dragon because they can catch the one who writes fake logs.</li>
<li>Change in Trollbox ability.<br>
In hands of a strong Scorned player this ability becomes extremely annoying. In a game where all players are good this ability makes half of the chat be filled with “3, confirm?” “16, repeat?” messages and does nothing except irritation. When not all players are good this ability is extremely imbalanced and allowes Scorned to easily kill his targets and often ruin the game of Blue Dragons.<br>
I suggest to change Trollbox to an ability that would mute a chosen player in chat for 1 day and allow Scorned or Fool to write message for this player in that day, so this player can’t object. 1 charge per game. Such update should save Trollbox as Trollbox while become powerful and not annoying ability.</li>
<li>Make Merc immune to Brainwash/Convert.<br>
I’m not sure about this, but the fact that Merc can be converted makes her untrusted even for her target. Unseen/Cult still can convert her target and make Merc their ally. Also she would become fully Neutral as all other Neutrals are immune to Brainwash/Convert. So Neutral would mean that it remains Neutral for the rest of the game.</li>
