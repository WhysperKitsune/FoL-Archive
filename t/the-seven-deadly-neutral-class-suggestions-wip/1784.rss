            <p>Hey wait a second. What happens if the outsider swaps with the MM? Or the CL? Or the King? What if he gets converted as his new class? (Outsider -&gt; Knight -&gt; Enforcer? Is this what happens?) And was if you swap yourself with other Unseen/cult? Do you join the night chat? Do they leave to night chat? Does the alignment of anyone change to invest? Does he refresh limited use abilities? I could see 2 cult passing back and forth a Prince.</p>

            <p>I really like them all actually, especially the investigative one. Investing neutrals is hard to do well but I think it works really well here.</p>

Immortal Sin(Night) - Survive death tonight - 3 uses(I guess)<br>

            <p>the idea of Sleepwalker is that it can find shit out and use it to blackmail people into letting it live<br>
e.g. you find someone with the type “Special” in an unseen game, they’re the Mastermind, you can whisper them telling them to keep you alive or you sell them out<br>
tbh finding just type could be a little weak</p>

            <p>I would say you should make them  unique in a way, some of these classes look bland. the egotist and The thief are very weak. I like the sleepwalker however why would a neutral have an investigative role ? I approve on the connoisseur and i also kinda like The succubus.</p>

            <p>I’ll work on conversions for some of these at some point<br>
Not Soldier or Connoisseur, maybe not Succubus</p>
