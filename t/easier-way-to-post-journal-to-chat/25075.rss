    <title>Easier way to post journal to chat</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/easier-way-to-post-journal-to-chat/25075</link>
    <description>There should be a button in the journal that will post highlighted text to the chat box. I find I can spend too much time copy/pasting logs, then figuring out where it cut off so I can copy/paste the rest when every second is valuable during a vote. Also it becomes unclear in the chat where the nights in logs start and end so it would be nice if it would maintain the same formatting as the journal. While trying to make an informed decision on a vote, my brain spends way too much energy trying to parse poorly formatted logs.</description>

            <p>Left page of the journal for automatedly sendable version (maybe button for send to chat) and right page to be private for players own notes, player can choose if he wants to publish right page of the journal. Send button for left page could be also in layout somewhere next to chat window and also inside the journal.</p>
<p>I like your idea very much.</p>
