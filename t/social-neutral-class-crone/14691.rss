    <title>[Social Neutral Class] Crone</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/social-neutral-class-crone/14691</link>
    <description>Crone
Unique, Social, Magic User
Win Condition: Become the King or survive
Unseen converted class: Witch

Passive
  Misanthrope - If more than one player attempts to visit the Crone at night, all visitors are blocked.
  Former Clients - At the start of the game, the class type of two random players who have patronized your dark arts in the past is revealed to you.

Day abilities
  Hex - Causes the first target to appear as the second to other players when speaking for the rest of the day. The second target cannot see anything the first target says. 2 Charges.
  Icy Touch - Same as reaper. 2 Charges.

Night abilities
  Will o&#39; Wisp - Same as princess. Still messages the target that &quot;X visited the princess.&quot; Includes targets blocked from visiting you due to Misanthrope. 3 charges.
  Shapeshift - Transform into a princess. Misanthrope will be disabled tonight, you will appear as a non-magic-user Blue Dragon to visitors, and may step forward to become king as though you had Noble Blood until tomorrow night, when the transformation ends. 1 charge.

The Crone has the same abilities as the Fool after becoming King.

=============

Witch
Unique, Social, Magic User
Win Condition: Unseen victory

Passive
Misanthrope - Same as Crone

Day Abilities
Jinx - The target will be unable to hear or speak to the Prince, the Psychic, and the dead at night. 2 Charges.

Night Abilities
Wicked Wisp - Uncage a Wicked Wisp, informing the second target that &quot;the princess&quot; was visited by the first target. 2 charges.
Shapeshift - Same as Crone.

=============

The idea behind the Crone&#39;s design embraces the existing standard for non-killer, neutral classes: A potential powerful ally for the BD that can quickly become a double-edged sword if left unchecked.

Gameplay for non-Crone players:
  With the information she is able to provide, it is advantageous for either faction to side with this person. However, should her win condition of becoming a King come to fruition, the remaining players in the game are left with an utterly useless king that they would be punished for executing.

Gameplay for Crone:
The Crone has a very similar kit to the princess, and has the tools to prove themselves as one to BD and prince. Without revealing themselves to be a Crone or that there is a Crone in the game at all, the player will want to use their day abilities to trick other players into executing the king. Successfully getting the King executed may lead to an easy win through the use of Shapeshift. However, it may also be necessary to use the Shapeshift charge before executing the King to avoid being outed as not an ally or neutral.

The Misanthrope passive serves a similar purpose to the alchemist&#39;s stoneskin. While it doesn&#39;t make the Crone immune to death, it reduces the likelihood of being randomly killed at night and has the added benefit of potentially blocking faction checks.

The Witch loses the Crone&#39;s abilities to manipulate player speech during the day, but gains the ability to block a player from speaking to or hearing the Prince or the Psychic at night. This can stop investigative roles from sharing information, or if you are extremely lucky, trick the prince into executing a BD. Wicked Wisp provides a way to distract the BD&#39;s investigation, but should be used carefully so as not to reveal the presence of a Witch in the game. Shapeshift continues to allow the Witch to avert suspicion while offering the opportunity for the Unseen to put one of their own on the throne.</description>

            <p>It should not convert to duchess, that is not how unseen work.</p>
<p>Don’t be lazy, make an unseen form. Also, if it can become unseen, it should be able to become cult.</p>

            <p>You’re right. Unseen conversion converts each class to an unseen analog of the previous one. You could call duchess a placeholder if you really felt that Crone needed it’s own unseen class. Crone is similar enough to Princess that it seems fine.</p>

            <p>I agree. Edited; the visitor is no longer randomly chosen.</p>
<p>If you’re referring to the two players whose types get revealed, I feel that the RNG there is fairly irrelevant for a neutral social role. The main point of it is to give a limited way for the player to claim princess.</p>
