    <title>[Class Suggestion] Treasure Hunter (Neutral)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-treasure-hunter-neutral/2870</link>
    <description>Treasure Hunter (Neutral) - A daring adventurer with a dark side.

Passive:
**Dungeon Crawl** - You are immune to the Prince&#39;s execution. (Lore-wise: You&#39;re a dungeon crawling adventurer! You escaped!)

_^ This will of course tip off the Prince that you&#39;re a Treasure Hunter when he sees you didn&#39;t die the next day, but that&#39;s probably better than being executed._

Day Ability:
**Daylight Robbery** - Select a player to &#39;steal&#39; a use of their ability, if they have limited usage. Gives you 1 additional use of &quot;Shared Bounty&quot; night ability. (Unlimited use.)

_^ In other words, if your target has limited uses, you will reduce their uses by 1 and add 1 use to your &quot;Shared Bounty&quot; night ability. If they have unlimited use of the ability, or have already used all of their uses up, you get nothing._

Night Ability 1:
**Shared Bounty** - Offer a treasure chest to another player. Target is offered a pop-up to open the chest. If they agree to open it, they will receive an additional use of any limited abilities they possess. (Single use, refresh it with Day Ability.)

_^ May be necessary to restrict this from things such as Priest&#39;s resurrection. Please note: This means that if you have 1 use of your ability left, and you open a Treasure Hunter&#39;s chest, you then get an additional 1 use, giving you 2 with the one you already had._

Night Ability 2:
**Pandora&#39;s Box** - Offer a trapped chest to another player. If they choose to open the chest, they will be killed. (2 uses. Does not refresh.)

Comments:
Is it the BEST suggestion ever made? No. However, I think it would be a pretty cool addition. Something that becomes a game changer and adds a touch of chaos to rounds. Essentially, you&#39;ll be moving ability uses around, taking away from people you don&#39;t like/trust, moving them to people you do like/trust, etc.</description>

            <p>Should be a blue dragon. Steals from outed neutrals (or an unseen/cult right before they are executed) and gives to the prince or paladin.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“I’m mercenary on (person who is not you), let me live”<br>
“Gimme all that loot bwahaha”</p>
<p>“I’m alchemist”<br>
“Gimme all that loot bwahaha”</p>
<p>“I’m scorned, thanks for the win n^(rd)s!”<br>
“Gimme all that loot bwahaha”</p>
<p>“I’m fool kek”<br>
“Here, another use of troll box for ya…”</p>
<p>“5 is unseen”<br>
“Lemme steal that poison boi”</p>
<p>“I am prince”<br>
“Heres all that loot bwahaha”</p>

            <p>“Trollbox” has a brand new meaning when it comes to this class lol</p>
<p>I’m not sure what goal I would give to this class. It’s incredibly easy to prove yourself by offering a chest to somebody or escaping the Prince’s wrath. I feel like a neutral class trying to survive should never be immune to the most powerful killing ability in the game. If this class were to simply survive, it would be incredibly easy and incredibly boring.</p>
