    <title>Court Wizard Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-suggestion/54620</link>
    <description>This comes from a noob that still is afraid to play, but loves to watch streams, don&#39;t be too harsh :sweat_smile:

- Court Wizard. Not Unique.

**Day Abilities:**
+ Simulacrum [2 Uses]
Target someone. Next night, all the abilities targeting you will target your target instead, and vice versa.

**Night Abilities:**
+ Perception [Infinite Uses]
Target someone. You will know if he/she uses a Day ability during the next day.

+ Invisibility [2 uses]
Your target is not visible at the table, and cannot be targeted by day abilities or voted up for execution next day.


**Reasoning**:

- Switching tornado to day ability and limiting it by including yourself in the switch should mantain the flavour of the class but leave some more space for the Night abilities.

- Perception could be useful to make bleeding and poison plays a bit more risky, but it&#39;s still targeted, but at the same time it doesn&#39;t show which day ability has been used, so it may promote a bit of extra lying space. Can also be a mean of confirmation but requires setup.

- Invisibility ... well, I just thought that CW could make use of something interesting and new, a mechanic that isn&#39;t already somewhere else. Making someone invisible avoids day execution for a specific player, which is something that isn&#39;t present in the game right now. Also could be useful to ward from bleeds or poison.</description>

            <p>Well cw is a good fake claim. With it being confirmable might as well give every class a ability to confirm themselves <a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a></p>
<p>He probably agrees with what I am saying to</p>

            <p>I see you posting a lot about CW and it being confirmable, the problem that I see a lot is CW claims CW and gets exe’d because the role isn’t confirmable unless very specific things happen.</p>
<p>The only way to confirm it is if someone visits someone you tornado, which is a limited use ability and early on people generally don’t use.</p>
