    <description>## The Squire # 
**Neutral Support**

Passives:
In training - At the beginning of the game you will be assigned a tutor, the tutor could be either bd or unseen but can&#39;t be unique. If your target dies you have 2 nights to pick a new target. If your target dies for a second time you will commit suicide.



Day Abilities:
Shined Armour - You clean your armour making yourself death immune tonight, start the game using 1 shined armour before hand you will be death immune n1, every time you successfully guard your tutor from an attack  or convert or make them appear ns to investigators( if cult/unseen) ,you will gain another use of Shined Armour.The max amount of shined armour you can gain is 2 per night.(1 use)

Squire for Hire! - If your first tutor dies you can select another player to become your tutor.( 1 use)

Night Abilities:
Shield Bearer -  Guard your tutor making them death immune, convert immune or make them appear bd ( if converted) tonight, you will be notified if they were attacked tried to be converted or if converted were visited by an investigator (4 uses)

I wanted to make this class to allow unseen to claim another class without rng I was thinking of making it a bd and if your target was unseen/cult you would become unseen/cult (although your abilities don&#39;t change), and also since they may not want to change merc this might be a good new replacement.</description>
