    <title>Reaped people can&#39;t be forced to vote, yet Chilled people can</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaped-people-cant-be-forced-to-vote-yet-chilled-people-can/71484</link>
    <description>This is an awkward mechanic and I think it needs to be fixed to be consistent.  Either both chilled and reaped people can be forced to vote, or neither can. 

Also and more importantly I believe that using force vote on a reaped player should **NOT** consume a use of political pressure.  At the moment it wastes your ability.  I would like instead to get a notification that the player is reaped.</description>

            <p>i guess, that means reaper would have to chill or reap noble</p>
