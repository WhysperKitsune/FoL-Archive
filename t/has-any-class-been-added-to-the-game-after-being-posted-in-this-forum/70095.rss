    <description>Has any member of the community posted an idea for a new class here, and then that class or something obviously based on it, was added to the game?</description>

            <p>Realistically I feel if you are putting a lot of time and effort into making the classes you are wasting your time because so many classes are made by rarely any classes get accepted or are used. IMO a persons time is worth more than the <strong>chance</strong> of having a class accepted. I mean if you really want to have a class or classes implemented into some form of change in this forum a person could implement them into an SFOL and the in game use <strong>might</strong> change some of the FOL classes (SFOL 18). But otherwise I wouldn’t recommend making any classes.</p>

            <p>All I’m really trying to say is I like how they have somewhat constant updates with balance changes. I would like to see some new stuff added to the game soon but I understand that it takes time(still really want new stuff soon). I am also against inqu/sorc. Don’t think they need to be in the game, but then again that’s my opinion.</p>
