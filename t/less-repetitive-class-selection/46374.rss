    <title>Less repetitive class selection?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/less-repetitive-class-selection/46374</link>
    <description>I am evil over half the time I play. I get some class almost always, and other classes barely ever. There should be some sort of like history of the classes I&#39;ve played recently, and have less chance of playing classes I&#39;ve gotten a lot.

Every day my first game is usually MM or CL or NK.

It&#39;s a 3/16 chance to get evil or NK class (in a full game), but it feels so much higher when I play.</description>

            <p>It’s just RNG, and very unlikely.</p>
<p>The class selection is fine, it doesn’t need to be changed.</p>

<p>You have no evidence supporting that fact. I like to play phys/knight/sheriff. I’m sure there’s people that love NK, and people that don’t like prince.  Some classes are least liked for a reason, because they don’t do much. That’s more of a gameplay problem than a player problem.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never implied that “No one likes” certain classes etc… I said that the vast majority of people like and hate the same classes, and thus for the MAJORITY of people we’d run into the same problems.</p>
<p>Also  as far as some classes not doing much being a “gameplay problem”, it’s pretty much a very necessary gameplay problem of which if anything the game runs the risk of having a problem of too few boring classes. IE most classes either leave a visible effect on the targets that can’t be faked by any evils other than the exact converted form of their class, Or obtain detailed information that again can’t be faked,  Which makes finding the Cult leader, mastermind, assasain and NK too easy too often, but while the game lacks fakable classes, it’s also a no brainer that possible to fake and exciting for most people to play, are pretty litterally oposites. As when people are unsure if you did or didn’t do anything, certainly makes one doubt the effectiveness of what you did.</p>

Some classes are least liked for a reason, because they don’t do much. That’s more of a gameplay problem than a player problem. Allowing player preference in the game would give the devs a gold mine of user data. It’s just a preference, not guarantee that you’ll get those classes. I just think the mostly random selection is too simple and could be improved so players have a better experience.</p>
<p>I’m not saying the game/class generation algorithm should be changed, just that there is some sort of player inputted weighting that affects who gets assigned to each class.</p>

            <p>I think it’s easy to go way further. Just rank every class from most to least enjoyable as part of your player profile and the system will assign from the pre-selected random class list. This would also enrich the data the developers get, based on how enjoyable the current classes are, so they can make changes accordingly. I know I would love a system like this and it wouldn’t that hard to implement I think.</p>

<p>Almost no one wants to be the NK,</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not so sure.  While they have a low winrate, I suspect a lot of players enjoy playing them and want to play killers.  And there is <span class="bbcode-i">something</span> to be said for the people who play an important role being those who enjoy it rather than people who are annoyed and just trying to get through the game to play something else.  Even if that is a problem, it could just use the method ToS does with its picks - basically, the roles in the game are chosen first, then the game tries to assign people to them based on their preferences (so if everyone hates on a particular role, or everyone love a specific role, it will cancel out and have no effect at all rather than changing the chance of specific roles appearing.)</p>
<p>What I would probably do, though, is to let people blacklist one or two roles they don’t want to play as.  Then, we can automatically collect data on the most blacklisted roles and discuss if they need to be tweaked to make them more fun (I suspect that you’d see a ton of people blacklisting the Court Wizard.)  Again, this would use the method described above, so it wouldn’t affect the frequency with which roles appear, only who gets assigned to them.</p>

</aside>
<p>The main problem with that, is that I’m sure about 70-90% of players have very similar preferences. Almost no one wants to be the NK, and of course no one wants to be the BD classes that are possible to fake claim (Knight,phys,sheriff,CW) etc… meanwhile at least half of players are all going to want to be prince etc… the end result will be more or less the same frequency of getting what you don’t want, because almost everyone’s going to have nearly identical preferences.</p>
<p>there is indeed a weighing system supposedly in place for classes you’ve been, and I do think they could improve/stregnthen that.</p>
