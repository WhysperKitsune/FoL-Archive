    <description>Throne of Thanks Contest
 
The holiday season is officially upon us, and everyone here at Imperium42 Game Studio is extremely thankful that you’ve chosen to play our very first game, Throne of Lies. Now, with American Thanksgiving quickly approaching, we want to know what you are thankful for and we’re giving away 1,000 GP to five random people that share their thoughts with us in this thread.
 
The members of this forum, our Kickstarter backers and everyone on the official ToL Discord server have directly helped shape the game and are an integral part of its success. Throne of Lies would not be possible without such a strong and vibrant community supporting it.
 
Over the last two years, we have gotten to know many of you personally. Your lore brings depth to our world. Your death notes (almost) always make us smile. Your class suggestions have helped change the social deduction genre forever, and your passion inspires us to make Throne of Lies the best game we possibly can.
 
But we’ve also sat at the round table with thousands of players whom we’ve never spoken to. We want to hear everyone’s story and know who and what makes your life special.
 
So please join us in letting the entire Throne of Lies community know what you are thankful for and lets us all know a little bit about you. It will bring this tight knit community even closer, and you just might win some extra gold that you’ll need to purchase the many seasonal items that will be coming to the ToL store over the next few months.

Winners will be announced after Thanksgiving (11/23)</description>

            <p>I’m thankful of course for my friends and family, but also to be able to play this game although I’ve only been playing a few days, I always loved this type of game.<br>
However, might I suggest adding one or two different round table rooms? Just the main room so not everything has to be redone, and people get to see some variety. Unless you want to make a completely new “map.” <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (Sorry if you wanted this posted in feedback instead)</p>

            <p>After having a woman have a heart attack and another child seize out in front of me last week, I’m once again reminded that my health and the health of my loved ones is so very precious. Not having to worry about your continued existence every time you wake up is an invisible blessing squandered by many.</p>

            <p>Hail and well met! This game marks my first foray into this genre of gaming. I had heard of “the other one”, but it never stoked my fire ya know? Then one day a couple weeks ago I took a chance on this title, mainly based on Steam reviews…and holy shit I have been addicted ever since. The lies, the tricks, the curve balls at the end of a match…and the (mostly) great people that make up the community all come together to create one hell of a way to spend a few hours here and there. The best part is cussing out other players, only to learn that you were wrong the whole time…or vice versa with others. I never take offense to people when they flame me…I would be pissed to if someone blatantly lied right to my…uh…digital face.</p>
<p>I am new to the forums, and hope to lie to all of you at some point In Game. May Tempus guide your blades travelers, and Tyche your luck!</p>

            <p>I admit I haven’t really been active on the forums, but I am thankful to this community for supporting positive interactions and gameplay, and being quick to stop toxic behavior.<br>
Definitely thankful for my family, and some of the friends I have met on here, as well as real-life people who have supported me, Without my family’s support, I probably wouldn’t have pursued an education and be in grad school right now,<br>
Thanks also to all the mods and devs here for supporting the same cause above<br>
and Plex, stop changing my nickname!<br>
Have a great season y’all<br>

            <p>I am thankful for the long hours I have spent playing fol and sfol and writing lore. Each class just gives a specific feel to it and I love to express that in my writing. Tol made me improve as a writer made me create more in depth lore. I loved creating lore so much that I created joke lore which had no purpose at all but to express how much fun I had writing. With this I also met new people through the tol community. Although at times I feel ignored due to me living in EST and mostly everyone in Pacific or CT. I never got to chat with a player via vc other then my friends (ik i’m lonely) but it makes me want to. Before I came to tol I was really sensitive of my own voice, but it has made me open up. To be honest I don’t know how that logic works, its just probably me growing older. Tol made me think more in depth into deduction games due to fol. It also made me create things that I genuinely felt proud of. It introduced me to many players wether it be on the Forums, Writing Lore, Joking in Off topic, Throwing Games (Cuz im bored) and People getting salty, and role playing. I will never be able to give enough thanks to the community of Tol. I know my thanks are not good enough, but I changed as a person. I feel as though I completely changed as a person when I was introduced to the tol community.</p>

            <p>Thanksgiving north of the border is long gone, but I feel compelled to add some warm fuzzies specific to ToL! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> I’m happy to have stumbled into this community that has entertained me over the past five months. Shout-out to the awesome people that I’ve met here: <a class="mention" href="/u/ellie">@Ellie</a> for loving hockey as much as a Canadian and being equally hilarious and supportive.  <span class="mention">@i42-TeaHacker</span> for dozens of phone conversations about complete and utter nonsense into the wee hours of the night.  Meth, Plex, N9ne, Cbman, Kdawg, Magna, Hyper for being endlessly entertaining on VC, teaching me a lot of new games, and also occasionally pity laughing at my puns. <a class="mention" href="/u/%C3%AD42-elsa">@í42-Elsa</a> for keeping the ToL female representation alive ( <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) and being super positive and friendly to everyone.  Aaaand everyone else that’s just plain ol’ great to be around in the game and the discord.<br>
Whew—time to retreat back into hibernation indefinitely!</p>

            <p>I am thankful that the game has almost infinite gameplays because each person plays a role differently. I’m also very grateful that for the most part the community is really nice and helpful.</p>

<p>I am thankful to have amazing memories of the time I spent together with Tess, though.</p>

            <p>I’m thankful for my job, my friend, and Steam.</p>
<p>I’m working at 16 as a Cashier above min. wage so I’m happy for that.<br>
My only true friend, <a class="mention" href="/u/luxx">@Luxx</a>  has been there for me through thick and thin. They’ve saved my life countless times, I go on the Discord or the forums and luxx throws a smile on my face.<br>
And finally, ToL is on Steam among many also great games. And I’m very thankful for that.</p>

            <p><strong>Obligatory ‘Not planning on entering, nor do I celebrate Thanksgiving yet’ message!</strong></p>
<p>I’m thankful for all the wonderful people I’ve met in this community!<br>
The Guides, the Mods and the Devs that I’ve talked to! All wonderful and hardworking people! ^w^</p>
<p>The friends I’ve made, the games I’ve played, the feeling of belonging…!</p>
<p>I’m thankful I’ve been able to help out the game in any ways I can!</p>
<p>Also I’m very thankful I got to know Boslof &lt;3 He makes me happier than I’ve ever been. I honestly can’t imagine my life without him at this point. (Even how cheesy that sounds lol )</p>

            <p>I’m thankful for all the streamers I can banter with.<br>
I’m also thankful for my depression, thanks life. Once I got over anxiety thanks for sending me into a much worse depression than I ever had.</p>
<p>I am also thankful that the devs are actually good at what they do and fix shit all the time. Reports are actually listened to so it’s cool.</p>

            <p>Also that this community is pretty great (it’s the first real one I feel like I am really a part of). There’s a lot of you guys who I get on with pretty well eventhough I can be a bit of a prick sometimes.</p>
<p>But mainly the body thing. That was real close.</p>

            <p>Hi there: one of <a class="mention" href="/u/pokemonkidryan">@PokemonKidRyan</a>’s sisters here.</p>
<p>(Sorry, I know this is super embarrassing)</p>
<p>I’m personally so grateful to all the people he’s met online, on this forum and others. The support network he has with you guys is truly beautiful and I imagine at at times it’s been the only thing getting him through his tough times - especially you, <a class="mention" href="/u/wolfy">@Wolfy</a> - welcome to the family. It’s been a pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p>Forgive me for interrupting your discussion of the game, but I just wanted to tell you how much we all love you, Ryan, even if sometimes we have a funny way of showing it.</p>
<p>(And I do wanna enter the prize draw thing, just give it to <a class="mention" href="/u/pokemonkidryan">@PokemonKidRyan</a>)</p>

            <p>I was going to say that I’m thankful for PKR. Even though he wishes not to enter, I wish to and if I win, I would like to share my winnings with him if that is possible as equals.~</p>
<p>When I first met PKR, it was on NotCalms Town of Salem Discord Server. At this time, I was the temp admin as Calm himself went away on a hiatus. After that, me and Ryan began chatting on the server, and we clicked. Some of you may know that I’m gay, others might not. But this isn’t the point. The main point is that Ryan was the one that confirmed it way before I knew I was gay myself, and he encouraged me to tell my parents. I always refused as I was scared to what they would say to me as my Mum is from a Russian heritage (hence the Russian flag on my icon). A few days after I thought I was happy, disaster struck when my first boyfriend had passed away from complications, and that broke my heart.</p>
<p>I fell into depression and there were times I thought that I couldn’t live anymore. I did lose the love of my life (that time I was thinking I was bisexual). However, Ryan (despite living in different areas in the same country) was always there to support me, always let me vent at him and scream at him when I was hurting the most. Now, a year and 2 months later, we have been together. The first time we met up was the day before my birthday, and even though he gave me the sweetest gifts, there was one gift that was the best for me. His presence. I am honored to have had someone help me fight my depression and someone to love now.</p>
<p>Here’s to the future that’s left to come, and I’m thankful that I can share it with <a class="mention" href="/u/pokemonkidryan">@PokemonKidRyan</a>. I love you with my heart and soul, and I’m thankful for everything you did for me during those awful times.</p>
<p>Once again, to the future and many more adventures for us to experience. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>
