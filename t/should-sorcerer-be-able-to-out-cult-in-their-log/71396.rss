    <title>Should Sorcerer Be Able to out Cult in Their Log?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/should-sorcerer-be-able-to-out-cult-in-their-log/71396</link>
    <description>Had a game where the Sorcerer outed the cult in his log out of spite. 

I know &quot;technically&quot; the Sorcerer is a neutral class and can do whatever they want.

Even then, it feels like a dick move. It&#39;s not in the spirit of the game and I&#39;d argue isn&#39;t much different from a Cult member outing the other Cult.</description>

            <p>Basically. It is legal for sorc to out scum in logs. Sellsword is a different story in that he can gamethrow this way. However even here there are strategies that justify doing this. Reverse psychology, opening conversion slots, accusing a BD ect.</p>

            <p>Sorcerer has no obligation to work or win with Cult. Me bussing every Cult in the event I die find gives Cult incentive to work towards preserving the Sorc and eliminating Inq. I always state ‘I will note every single Cult/Unseen I find in my log’ in my first dnote as soon as a Sorc game is confirmed by BD/Inq outing.</p>
<p>I’ve ended up bussing Sorcs before when they don’t co-operate with Unseen (i.e: refusing to vote when Sorc+Unseen majority is confirmed), so it works both ways. The peace between Sorc and Evils is maintained so long as the symbiosis is kept up.</p>

            <p>I thought you were meaning in terms of sorc bussing cult/unseen. If he is straight up dying then he is fine to out you.</p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> the same as a cult/unseen dying and outing all other members, because he can still get a win if his teammates happen to go on and win the game. The sorcerer has no such luxury.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s a huge mess with regards to the rules… it can’t be defined as gamethrowing however because you can’t gamethrow when you’ve lost. The definition of gamethrowing is knowingly making your odds of winning worse.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>Cultist dying with cult in his logs - he clearly lowered the odds of cult winning, of which his win condition was a part of, so 100% gamethrowing</p>
<p>Sorcerers logs - If you are reading his logs (I’m assuming he’s dead), his odds of winning are 0%. if this behavior were to be stopped it would need it’s own rule because again it’s litterally not possible to worsen his position.</p>
<p>Living assasain bussing sorcerer - This one here is a judgement call on the unseens part… actually the non illegal nature of the previous makes this a very high risk (as the sorcerer may know him and/or other unseen). But technically unseen or cults concern is to maximize their own odds of winning The sorc is a potential ally, but not their responsibility</p>
<p>Last unseen/cult outing sorc in logs - Same as sorc outing unseen/cult.</p>

            <p>Giving the Sorc a one-time use day ability that allows them to send a secret one-way whisper seems like it could solve some of these problems.</p>
<p>Or change Perception to inform the target of the attack that “something was off” as well.</p>

<p>Previous to the Merc rework when you could have anybody as a contract I was told that outing your contract to get a new one is throwing and against the rules, this feels like the same thing.</p>
<p>And yeah it would have been cool if he whispered us, we didn’t even know it was an Inq/Sorc game until he was dead and outed us out of spite.</p>
