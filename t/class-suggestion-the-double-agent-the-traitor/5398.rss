    <title>[Class suggestion] The double agent / The traitor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-double-agent-the-traitor/5398</link>
    <description>&gt;**The Double agent**
Blue dragon investigative
**Passive: Infiltration**
If the mastermind or cult leader attempts to convert you, you will become the traitor.
**Passive: Reliable sources**
You know if the cult or unseen are present at the beginning of the game
**Day ability: In plain sight**
Choose what class you appear to be to the evil classes if you are converted tonight*
**Night ability: Informants**
(2 use) learn how much of every faction is currently present in the game, ignoring the king.

&gt;**The Traitor**
Blue dragon Investigative
**Passive: Intelligence**
Hear the chat of the unseen/cult at night, with their classes as names instead of names. You do not meet with them the first night of your membership, as though you were imprisoned by the prince. After one night of membership, you learn the identities of the cult/unseen.
**Passive: Convincing**
You appear to be the class you choose with &quot;In plain sight&quot; as the double agent. You are so convincing that you appear suspicious to investigators.

*For example, if you choose physician and are converted into the unseen, you will appear to be the herbalist to the unseen. If you were converted to the cult, you will appear to be the ritualist.

Just an outline, this is the basic idea</description>

            <p>Passive Deep Cover : Only Unseen and Neutral can see your private and public messages . Your journal will appear empty when you die and you will appear as an assassin or cult leader if you die .<br>
day ability : looks legit : members of the unseen/cults available targets will show as if you are a member of their faction tonight .<br>
day ability 2 : leak information (1 use) : tomorrow your first whisper will be visible by the recipient even if they are bd .</p>

            <p>The thing is,what if your not converted?This is a really unique class but if your not converted this class looks like shit.Like really what are you doing on nights 1-4 if your not converted.Even after that if you claim double agent you might get hung for no info.I will agree though this is a easy fake claim which(This is debatable)this game could use.Also you would only get info for 2 days bc the leader will notice they can convert.(Unless its cult but then they might sacrifice you or realize they can convert.(Which is actually good this class shouldn’t be able to look at chat forever.<br>
For improvements i think you should add another night ability as the double agent.</p>

            <p>To fix some of the problems with the Traitor I will propose an alternative class card</p>
<p>Traitor - Blue Dragon Social</p>
<p>Passive 1: Under cover - You meet with the unseen/cult at night. You don’t know who is who and you will see thier class instead of thier name. You are not considered part of the unseen/cult and if you are visited by an unseen/cult member you will instead be attacked. The assassin cannot select you as a target however. The cult leader may sacrifice you.</p>
<p>Passive 2: Convincing - If you are investigated or you die then you will appear as the class you selected as Double agent.</p>
<p>Night ability 1: Act - does nothing. The unseen/cult will see you as using the first night ability of the class you are disguised as (Unlimited)</p>
<p>Night ability 2: Lock doors - you cannot be visited by the unseen/cult. They will see you as using the second night ability of the class you are disguised as on your target. They will see nothing if your disguised class does not have a second night ability. (2 Uses)</p>

            <p>How exactly is the unseen supposed to counter this class? The cult can always just use a sacrifice to kill the traitor but the unseen doesn’t have anything like that. In other words how does the unseen kill someone they think is the traitor. Fix that problem before moving on.</p>

            <p>I’d have to say at a fundimental level it is kind of broken. Cult especially has to really rely on converting as often as possible, Unseen it’s a bit more fuzzy in that it might be in their interest to wait a bit longer and get a conversion that “isn’t likely to be protected” isn’t the first concern.</p>
<p>The fundimental premise of the game, and more or less all games of the sort, is the informed minority vs uninformed majority. The big thing that the unseen and cult have to count on, is that they know 100% who is fully on their team, save the king, and they have a secure chat in which they can co-ordinate their plans.</p>
<p>Trust me one of the highest userbase games of this genre tried really hard to make a role which could see what the uninformed minorty could say etc… and after a year of trying to  make it work, they realized they had to take that out.</p>

            <p>It just means evil will have to consider more deeply who to convert.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that unseen know they are traitor if they convert him N1, as he will not have had the chance to use in plain sight.</p>
<p>I know this class is broken:</p>

            <p>if, barring extenuating circumstance, the traitor cannot see the names of the evil, how so?<br>
also, if the evil finds out for sure that someone else was jailed that first night, then they know whos a traitor</p>

            <p>i’d say make the traitor permanently only able to see class names, and give it a 1(maybe 2/3) use ability to learn their names, but only if none of them successfully do an action</p>

            <blockquote>
<p><strong>The Double agent</strong><br>
Blue dragon investigative<br>
<strong>Passive: Infiltration</strong><br>
If the mastermind or cult leader attempts to convert you, you will become the traitor.<br>
<strong>Passive: Reliable sources</strong><br>
You know if the cult or unseen are present at the beginning of the game<br>
<strong>Day ability: In plain sight</strong><br>
Choose what class you appear to be to the evil classes if you are converted tonight*<br>
<strong>Night ability: Informants</strong><br>
(2 use) learn how much of every faction is currently present in the game, ignoring the king.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Traitor</strong><br>
Blue dragon Investigative<br>
<strong>Passive: Intelligence</strong><br>
Hear the chat of the unseen/cult at night, with their classes as names instead of names. You do not meet with them the first night of your membership, as though you were imprisoned by the prince. After one night of membership, you learn the identities of the cult/unseen.<br>
<strong>Passive: Convincing</strong><br>
You appear to be the class you choose with “In plain sight” as the double agent. You are so convincing that you appear suspicious to investigators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*For example, if you choose physician and are converted into the unseen, you will appear to be the herbalist to the unseen. If you were converted to the cult, you will appear to be the ritualist.</p>
<p>Just an outline, this is the basic idea</p>
