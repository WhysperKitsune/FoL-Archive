    <title>New Class Card Layout</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-card-layout/2889</link>
    <description>Class Card Screen
=


This is my redesign of the Class Card Menu. In its current state, the classes being sorted alphabetically adds absolutely nothing to the clarity and concept of the game. 

**Example**
If I am ever explaining a game to someone I usually first set up the pieces/ cards/ etc in a grouping that helps them categorize what I&#39;m about to tell them. The separation of each faction is nice... but alphabetization is not helpful 

**Visual Structure**
If you structure it in this way it makes sense just looking at a glance. New players will understand how things are organized and certain classes turn into others (even with cult). Mercenary turning into a Sellsword is very intuitive when set up this way. I am a Teacher for my profession and I color code things all the time. 

**Benefits:**
- 
- The &quot;leaders&quot; of each faction are separated away from the others (as they should be) since they are so important/ distinct to the faction as a whole.
- Sorting the main chunk of classes by their type helps people see the groupings AND see how each type converts into a specific type of cult class.
- Converted classes are easily seen at a glance, without having to be inside one of the class cards to see what it converts to.
- Mercenary converting to Sellsword is obvious this way... AND lets everyone know it is also the only neutral that can be converted.

This image can teach people the game just by seeing the structure. I am very familiar with this game and play it every day, while making this I even made some connections about certain things after seeing it like this.

So this is my first draft of it, let me know what you think!

Side note:
-
Whenever someone clicks on the &quot;Classes&quot; button at the top of the screen, they should be taken to the actual class layout... NOT to the specific Kings Class Card. I dont know why it is like this. When you are in game and are already a specific class, then yes it should pop up as what you are. But if you are in the lobby, it should take you to the overall picture.

            <p>Hmm, I see what you mean.</p>
<p>Maybe put a small white arrow inbetween the BD and Unseen classes to clarify the fact that Unseen classes come from those converted BD classes.</p>

            <p>If I showed this to someone who’s never played the game before… The only thing they’d get from it is that some classes have different colors, and also that some classes have plus signs for some weird reason?</p>
<p>And that Cult only in Unseen, and Unseen only in Cult???</p>
<p>AND that Sellsword might fall under unknown.</p>
<p>And they might be able to guess what some classes do from their name alone but not really?</p>
<p>Not really the optimal way of doing it no…</p>

<p>This is a steamlined version that takes out the “Class Type” category. This might be the cleanest way to do it, since they have recently added the picture on the side that shows the class/ converted class/ and type.<br>
So this might be the way to go.</p>

<p>Even if there are ‘inconsistencies’ it is still much better then the current one.</p>
<p>SUGGESTION TO DEVELOPERS:<br>
If you do not adopt this layout, please make the unseen line up with what they were converted from.</p>

            <p>Even if its difficult to come up with a nicely fitting layout, you have to admit anything that Alkander is suggesting is logically more reasonable than the alphabetical order. Even if types change, knowing what classes BD turns into is important.</p>

            <p>also maybe put something next to paladin/sheriff (in the space normally used by the unseen/cult conversions, respectively) with something to indicate that they’re only in cult/unseen games, respectively<br>
like in the space next to paladin, write in red “only in cult games” or something to that effect, and for sheriff, put a line under Seeker, re-center it, and put “only in unseen games” or something to that effect</p>

            <p>This is awesome work. Nicely done, Alkander.</p>
<p>What do the white plus signs mean? Oh, I just realized that means unique.</p>
<p>Can you put a " + = unique" legend in the bottom right corner? I think that is the final touch. I’m not sure there can be any other iteration that is clearer than this.</p>

could organize/ label the Wildcards better… but Wildcard isnt a super important thing to know in a Class Card layout anyway.</p>

            <p>This is a good point, I already know what I would do for it… but I also believe that the Prince should be categorized as “Special” Class.</p>
<p>Cult Leader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can kill</li>
<li>Can Convert people to the Cult</li>
<li>Talk to other Cult members</li>
</ul>
<p>Prince</p>
<ul>
<li>Can kill</li>
<li>ONLY Blue Dragon that is Immune to Conversion</li>
<li>Can Occupy any class (even classes that are immune to occipying)</li>
<li>Talk to his prisoner and interrogate them</li>
</ul>
<p>The Prince actually seems more “Special” than the Cult Leader.</p>

            <p>The only way I can think of is to simply put an asterisk above Poacher and Enforcer and leave a footnote explaining they are Offensive, not Killer classes.</p>

            <p>Thats the problem tho, If I did that it would disrupt the rest of the “cleanness” of everything else. I dont think disrupting EVERY other class in the overall layout would be worth those 2.</p>
<p>That being said, I am working on a layout that addresses this problem, Ill make a post here once I’ve done that.</p>

            <p>I think separating things if they are different class types when converted would be helpful.</p>
