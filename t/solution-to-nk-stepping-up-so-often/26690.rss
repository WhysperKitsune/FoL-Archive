    <title>Solution to nk stepping up so often</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/solution-to-nk-stepping-up-so-often/26690</link>
    <description>My idea is to make the nk a special type of king, something like the insane or genocidal king. They become king, have normal king abilitys but there win condition is the same as a normal NK. This will stop the common cheese strat of nk revealing themself and saying who there immunes are etc, etc. Best scenario to step up would be when its late game and some cult/unseen were still alive. This king would probably not be able to be started off as. 


Here is a overview:

Genocidal King 

Passives: 

Determination: Immune to Occupation and Death

Deception: If you are voted to be executed by the court you will turn back to the nk you orignally were and will be unable to be jailed, occupied, attacked, Prevented from Visting or Switched targets. The day will end after you are executed (This could make the king a lot more strong or it could just be replaced with the normal passive) 

Abilitys: 

Standard King ability&#39;s
