Steps to reproduce this issue:

2. Twitch Prime LoneLilly: Talking outside of game is cheating if you cant say it in game dont say it at all u.u finding out who ur friends are outside of game is cheating aswell if a Dev of the game jumps into ur stream and sees it u can be banned
3. Twitch Prime LoneLilly: tryen to save u here dear</description>
