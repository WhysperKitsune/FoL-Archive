    <title>Poor Fellow should only last one day</title>

    <description>Poor Fellow should only last one day. It&#39;s already huge that it can stop an entire day of voting, but the fact that it can stop 2 days early game is crazy to me.

It already nullifies the entire day phase which sucks for the Blue Dragon, which is very irritating since you have to basically do nothing for a whole 90 seconds (I think?), so it definitely shouldn&#39;t do twice that.

I would prefer something that didn&#39;t negate the entire day (like the FoL version), but I think one day is punishment enough, maybe even more than enough.</description>

            <p>Honestly poor fellow is fine as is.<br>
It already usually only takes one day from the BD.<br>
If the BD is SUPER lynch heavy and the fool gets SUPER lucky by framing the same day they are investigated then the 2 days come in IF AND ONLY IF fool gets hung between D2-D3.<br>
Now in this scenario poor fellow seems OP but it misses some points.<br>
A-You might get outed as fool from your immunity to occupation and your behavior<br>
B-The Unseen/Cult/NK might kill the fool(Hide prevents this but might out the fool to other BD’s)<br>
Some other points.Fools might be super obvious and get CS/Alch bombed/Prince exed.<br>
Also I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@Vandalay</a> there is little to no point in lynching before D4 as MM and CL will be replaced and you would be way better just jailing/occupying the MM/CL.<br>
Now the other thing is fool might not even spawn. Seriously 3 neutrals besides NK MAX. Could be 2 alchs or mercs. Maybe a scorned or inquisitor. Fools don’t spawn that often and when they do(at least in my experience) don’t hurt BD that much. Don’t take this the wrong way poor fellow is extremely bad for BD and maybe it’s my leadership and scum reading that help BD get back in the game but poor fellow is only really game winning for NKs and Unseen if the fool survives that long.<br>
And if a fool can survive until N6-N7 and still look scummy without being obvious then they are doing a great job.Also if a fool does manage to get hung within the first 3 days then BD deserves that punishment 100%. Why wouldn’t they get punished for a potential scorned or fool like in the scenario?</p>

            <p>I am not sure I like this idea. Like I don’t know why but the idea sounds like a no to me. Maybe it is because the whole time I have been playing the game fool had this passive</p>
<p>I will how to think about this a bit more</p>

            <p>well while I dislike the fool’s existane in general… honestly the best game theory option IMO would be fool comes out and BD executes it, day 1 always (in the event that poor fellow was only 1 day early game) Honeslty there’s little merit to even executing in the first 3 days anyway. Especially in unseen games MM’s get replaced, you free up an extra slot for the MM to convert, you effectively wind up doing more harm than good and would be way better off occupying/jailing any suspects you find (unless there’s darn good evidence it’s the NK… then yeah you wanna kill that)</p>

            <p>It’s because people do not usually lynch for the first 3/4 days and most fools are either really obvious and get executed or ignored until Night 3 or are wait silent until someone points out that they aren’t talking much and ask for their class.</p>
