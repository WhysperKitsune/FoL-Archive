    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/games-crashed-mid-game/63472</link>
    <description>#### What happened?  I was in jail chatting with prince and game froze/crashed.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? NA

#### Steps to reproduce: Relaunched game, verified files via steam, Game is working fine.

#### Comments: First time the game has crashed on me. I tried uploading screenshot but the file is too big. The error message said to report folder named &quot;2018-05-19_221520.&quot;</description>
