    <title>[Class Suggestion]: Bailiff (Blue Dragon/Support) Plus converts</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-bailiff-blue-dragon-support-plus-converts/49793</link>
    <description>Bailiff (Support - BD)

Day Ability 1:
Point Finger (2): Just like the king, can turn his vote into 2 votes to put somebody up on the stand (best used later honestly...)
(**Probably not a good idea. Need suggestions**)
Night Ability 1:
Nightwatch (not sure if I want unlimited or not...) : Guard the Prince. **Edit:** If prince is attacked, you sacrifice yourself in his name.
Night Ability 2 (Optional)
Search Belongings : (2) : Search Prisoner&#39;s belongings **(TO BE EDITED - Not sure if I should discover class, class type, or faction, but no RNG)**
Lore:
Bailiff is a unique optional (not in all games) class that watches the jailhouse at night while the prince interrogates his prisoner. While the Bailiff keeps watch on a nightly basis, he turns a blind eye for the kingdom whenever the prince is expected to visit.  
Comments:
The Bailiff may be unique, but he is also easily convertible and killable.  I can&#39;t really think of a unique convert for him for the cult, however I like the idea of his unseen counterpart...

Bribed Bailiff (unseen support)
Day Ability 1:
Point Finger (2) ((Keeps the same count as before convert))
Day Ability 2:
Sneak Key (2): Gives a key to that night&#39;s prisoner, allowing him to use his night abilities during jail time (even before execution). If prince dies this night, the prisoner is immune to prince&#39;s execution (He escaped!)
Night Ability 1:
Easedrop (infinite): Listen in to the conversation between the prince and the prisoner.
Night Ability 2:
Confront Prince (1) Surprise the Prince, and stop him from executing the prisoner. Prince will be alerted of who you are, and you will see who exactly the prince is!
Lore: The Mastermind dropped a bag of gold to the Bailiff to hire his &quot;services.&quot; No longer loyal to the BD, this class turns from Prince&#39;s guardian angel, to Prince&#39;s demise. 
Comments: 
I

&#39;m not sure if I like this idea or not...but I feel like this class is useless once the prince dies...so maybe he can evolve from Bailiff to Jailer, which would pretty much be a prince without royalty and is still convertible...

Jailer: (BD - Killer)
Same exact abilities as the prince, minus his nobility and convertibility

Serial Killer: (Unseen - Killer)
Day Ability:
Jail - Put so and so in prison
Night Ability:
Dispose Evidence: Destroy the Prisoner beyond recognition. Bypass Death Immunity. When the body is discovered, their logs will be destroyed, and the player can not become a DK
Quick Lore:
What else would you expect from the unseen if given their own prison?
Comments

This seems very OP tbh...however its the idea I came up with in order to allow the bailiff/bribed to have some sort of purpose after the Prince&#39;s death, because princes tend to either die early, or last the entire match, and if they die early, the current suggestion would make the B/B only good at pointing fingers, which would put an instant target on their back for no good reason really. 

I believe this would require much further discussion before being implemented. In the meanwhile, I believe that Bailiff and Bribed make an interesting, yet not overcomplicated twist to the regular game.

What do you guys think?</description>

<p>You’re right. You’re right. Let me change that up real quick. Just thought of a better substitute. Instead of being prince’s personal guard, I’ll make him more of a meat shield. One guard KO without killing the attacker.</p>

<p>Honestly I’m just trying to think what use is a Bailiff without anyone imprisoning anybody? With the way I had the Bailiff set, he’s as useful as a hunter that used up all of his bears and wolves, except can happen as early as D2. Bailiff is keeping watch of the jail, so why not inherit the ability to use said jail?</p>
<p>Might help the BD too much however…</p>

<p>Bailiff (Support - BD)</p>
<p>Day Ability 1:</p>
<p>Point Finger (2): Just like the king, can turn his vote into 2 votes to put somebody up on the stand (best used later honestly…)*<strong>Why? There’s no reason to give the class this.</strong> <em>On second thought, that doesn’t seem reasonable at all…I’m just trying to think about what a bailiff would do in court however…any replacement suggestions?</em></p>
<p>Night Ability 1:</p>
<p>Nightwatch (not sure if I want unlimited or not…) : <strong>Guard the Prince Way too OP. The Prince is the strongest BD class in the game, and this makes him basically immune. Also, it only works on 1 class. Still applies even if convertible</strong>. <em>Also true…maybe it should be more of a sacrifice so the prince can stay alive for one more night?</em></p>
<p>Night Ability 2 (Optional)</p>
<p>Search Belongings : (2) : Search Prisoner’s belongings to identify either their class type (80% chance) or faction (20% chance) <strong>RNG is bad. Also this is a Princess flirt where you can’t control the target, and have 2 uses. 20% It is an Observer peak.</strong> <em>I made this idea while thinking the Bailiff is able to see who the prisoner is, and forgot to mention the passive (which would use the second day ability slot I suppose…). I guess adding RNG to this game would be a bad idea however. I just thought that identifying the faction would be OP. Maybe just the exact class type maybe? Hmm…</em></p>

While the conversation between the prince and the prisoner is an all night occurrence, I don’t really imagine the prince has his axe on hand while he interrogates.I guess this also requires the Bribed to know who is being jailed too…should that be a passive between both Bailiff and Bribed?. _</p>

</aside>
<p>Thank you for the input. I responded to your comments in <em>emphasized text</em>. The Jailer/Kidnapper roles were just my attempt at countering B/B’s uselessness after the prince’s death. Might be too extreme on both sides after second thoughts…</p>
