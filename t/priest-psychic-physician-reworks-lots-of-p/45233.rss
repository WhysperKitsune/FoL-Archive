            <p>Exhume is certainly Investigative.</p>
<p>However, it’s not Investigative in the way that Investigative classes should be, and on its own I’m fine with Physician having it.</p>
<p>Just make it not be a public reveal and you’re really set.</p>

<p>While I do think that the ability works on phys (Information gathering is not and shouldn’t be locked away just to Investigators) It does not make it Support. Plus anouncing it makes phys confirmable.</p>

            <p>Very well then, but I still argue that having Exhume as an ability that reveals to everyone the causes of all deaths for that night is a proper support, as in my opinion it isn’t really investigative if you show information for everyone at the exact same time.</p>
<p>But there’s still a benefit for Psychic’s Link Minds, as I find that the more night communication a team has, the more coordinated they can get. Psychic can work with other BD together in real time while Prince has to keep them shut in so they don’t do their job. I’ll still argue for that.</p>

            <p>I agree completely. Realistically, if you weren’t always lynched the next day for not claiming then nobody would claim. Psychic can be converted after all, and they can’t really do anything with the info aside from just have it or give it to someone (prince) the next day.</p>
<p>The only useful thing a psychic brings to the table is CotD and the occasional coordination.</p>
<p>These changes would make phys less fun to play imo. Exhume can be wasted, and then you’re just a heal bot. Even if it’s not wasted, it will be very very rare that the information you get for it is useful. The only scenario I can think of where you’d care is if someone is claiming yolobomb alchemist, and those are usually exed immediately. BD kills are claimed the next day, in my experience.</p>

            <p>I love exhume! (or autopsy?) However I think it should only target a specific dead player.  This would make phys fun.  Someone said this makes phys investigative however alch is both killer and support yet is classified as support anyway.  Also herbalist is offensive yet has a investigative ability (defile reveals class).</p>
<p>Make Reanimate a day ability and add Exhume to night abilities!!!</p>

<p>The premise is still practically the same. You speak to them, and get claims. It rarely helps confirm your target, since if they claim Offensive, they usually are offensive. Perhaps you can have them act that night, but that usually tells you nothing.</p>
<p>The only downside to Prince is that it blocks investigative, but it also blocks murderers and converters, and Prince has the power to kill.</p>
<p>Psychic is just a poor copy of Prince.</p>

            <p>But I will say this: Psychic allows for night communications with the person on the other end working with them and using their abilities. Prince jails them, so they need other nights to confirm or act.</p>

<p>But I agree, Noble does need some reworking.</p>

            <p>Even so, Priest pretty much has to be Unique, since otherwise the Priests can just learn each others identities, and realize if the other one is converted.</p>
<p>Also Possessor has a pretty good Noble claim. As long as you can do the whispers, they usually don’t ask for vote manipulation. Sheriff/Paladin is also a pretty effective claim since it lacks the same suspicion as Knight or CW, and your logs usually are technically true.</p>
<p>Plus, Priest as unique wouldn’t limit claim space, since CW, Knight, Paladin and Sheriff still exist. Just doesn’t add new claim space.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>There can be more than one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean is, only one of those two types of classes can be present in the game, so you can’t claim both.  That effectively means there are only three “easy” claims.  (If they were unique, I’d bump it to “difficult” immediately - this is part of why I’m so strongly against unique Sheriffs.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also usually you claim what you used to be, and that solves your claim space problem. And even if a class is unique, they can converted. I wouldn’t mind some more easy claims, but there is stuff to work with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t do that as a Mastermind, starting Assassin, NK, or Scorned.  And those roles need claimspace, too (especailly the Mastermind, since having them caught is fairly catastrophic for the Cult, and the NK, whose “side” is over when they’re caught.)  It’s slightly less of an issue for the Scorned because they can try and win before everyone claims, but IMHO the game is still better when more valid claims exist for people to lie about.</p>
<p>(This also means that BD can generally conclude that someone who claims a difficult role is <span class="bbcode-i">probably</span> either that role or its converted version, and anyone who claims an impossible role is definitely that role or its converted version.  I don’t think being able to make such a decisive conclusion from a claim is a good thing; it’s a game of trust and deception, so there needs to be more room to lie or to distrust people.  And every new “hard to claim” role that gets added increases the overall change that courts will be stacked with people whose claims are straightforward and unlikely to be fake, aside from them maybe being converted - which narrows MM / NK claimspace further.)</p>

<p>…that’s not enough.  Since only one of Sheriff / Paladin exists in a game, there’s only three really “easy” claims, plus maybe the Princess and Physician, who are borderline but noticeably more dangerous.  And ToL has at least three roles who collect claims, so not claiming is rarely an option.</p>

Going over the list of possible claims for someone who didn’t start as BD, I’d sort them into “easy” (can’t be contradicted without outside information), “difficult” (requires a will that can people can confirm or contradict; or people can demand that you prove, but it takes a night or has costs) and “impossible” (can prove immediately, requires a will that can’t reasonably be faked, or is a suicidal claim for other reasons.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Easy</span>: CW, Knight, Sheriff / Paladin.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Difficult</span><br>
Physician / Alchemist: Works at first but falls apart as soon as anyone dies of poison / bleeding.<br>
Princess:  Requires will with flirt results (although MM can do that); can be asked to use WoW.<br>
Butler: Requires a list of occupies, can be asked to poison king.<br>
Drunk:  Requires list of debs.<br>
Hunter:  Often called out by real hunter; gets asked to bleed people; gets you killed if real Hunter dies.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Impossible</span>:<br>
Observer: Will is flatly not reasonable to fake.<br>
Prince: Immediately gets you executed by the real prince.  Requires will with jail record anyway.<br>
Psychic: Will impossible to fake, can instantly prove themselves in multiple ways.<br>
Noble: Can instantly prove themselves by making someone vote.</p>
<p>…that’s not enough.  Since only one of Sheriff / Paladin exists in a game, there’s only three really “easy” claims, plus <span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span> the Princess and Physician, who are borderline but noticeably more dangerous.  And ToL has at least three roles who collect claims, so not claiming is rarely an option.</p>
<p>My feeling is that most of the time, contradicting a claim should require a degree of coordination and trust among the BD, not just “knight claim lol, gg.”  It’s bad enough that the claims that are reasonably usable for starting evils are often lynched on sight, especially in the late game.  (Demanding that all Knights yolo CS immediately has also become increasingly common.)</p>

            <p>I don’t really feel the claims space is a problem, you could probably drive a truck through it.</p>
<p>What on earth would an evil do with information from the dead? It’s really just one suggestion, just a few things would have to change to fit it.</p>
<p>Also, Psychic’s power already sucks. Prince does it better.</p>

            <p>I don’t like splitting Call the Dead from the Psychic’s powers.  The interaction between it and Link Minds is interesting, leads to more useful communication, and can occasionally backfire on the Psychic if they link with someone evil and end up leaking info from the dead to them as a result.</p>
<p>Overall this feels like it’s cramming too many changes into one suggestion.</p>
<p>Also, this would add a new unique role.  I feel that’s a mistake - unique roles should be avoided, since they inherently limit claimspace.</p>

            <p>Better than current Psychic, which is redundant. Also a Whisper Psychic would be serve the same purpose as Maid Spy does, which works well for Noble, and Private Matter helps avoiding looking too helpful and making yourself a target for evils. Also Illusionist could help coordinate with Mercenaries, Alchemists, Sorcerers, Fools, Scorned, etc.</p>
<p>Anyways, whispers hold a lot of power. I have seen many games in which they outed the unseen. It is far from a useless ability.</p>

            <p>Okay got it, but then what ideas do you have for conversion? Which Heretic are we using</p>
<p>And <a class="mention" href="/u/nightx">@NightX</a>  I don’t know about a whisper Psychic though because it seems too niche and a bit too useless to properly work consistently</p>

            <p>Psychic: Redundant to Prince still. Better with no Call of the Dead. See <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/psychic-rework-whisper-based/44142/34">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am okay with Physician changes, but Exhume is more of an investigative ability.</p>
<p>Priest: Reanimate works. Bind Soul is one time Phys, rather not have that. Wield Soul is good. It would be better if it could be converted, since each conversion immune person makes it harder for Unseen/Cult.</p>
<p>I’d also personally limit the number of times you could use each dead person. I have one way to do that <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/priest-blue-dragon-support-and-soulcatcher-unseen-support/43853/25">here</a>.</p>
<p>I really think Priest should be guaranteed.</p>
