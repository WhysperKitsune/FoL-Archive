            <p>?</p>
<p>Are you talking about the Physician to Healer thing? That wasn’t nonsense though. I was using process of what there could be. The fact there was no Cult death when they made a kill before, that was because I was thinking healer. Obviously, after finding out that Orange was Psychic here, that disappointed me because I thought I had a good idea there.</p>
<p>But Mole, people need to remember, Cult can avoid death at least once when making a kill.</p>
