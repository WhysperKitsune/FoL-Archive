    <title>[Suggestion] Reaper execution, revived with prince - change?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-reaper-execution-revived-with-prince-change/1510</link>
    <description>####Basically what people claim happens is that reaper gets executed by the prince and they get revived with their souls.

####I&#39;m pretty sure the reaper _should_ die in this case just like in the lynch case.

####Steps to reproduce:
1. Imprison reaper with at least one collected soul
2. Execute them
3. See them be alive next day.

####Comments: I&#39;m not 100% sure it&#39;s a bug. But it feels like it. I hope I&#39;m not in the wrong category. If it&#39;s not a bug... I guess this should go to Feedback/Suggestions.

            <p>Keep an eye on who you execute to make sure they stay dead <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I am pretty sure this question has come up a couple times already and devs have confirmed it is not a bug.</p>
<p>So yeah - this would go into feedback as it is a balance issue (and as such it should be considered as one, I for one don’t believe Reaper needs a nerf).</p>
