    <title>[Class suggestion] The idiot (&quot;fool&quot; was taken)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-idiot-fool-was-taken/2748</link>
    <description>blue dragon special
Inspired by tormental(&#39;s suggestion made in ToS a few years ago)

---------------------------------
**Illusions of grandeur** (passive) you think you are another class (see below)

**Blissful Ignorance** (passive) Immune to death at night. You are not informed that you were attacked, however. In addition, if you are occupied, you will think that something prevented you from visiting your target instead (I.E. you think target had visit immunity)

---------------------
The idiot thinks he is an observer, princess, butler, or knight.

As the idiot observer, you will be told your target visited a random player, but only if they left their room. You will be told players who visited your target randomly, but the amount of names told will be the same as the amount of players visiting them.

Example: you &quot;follow&quot; player 1. player 1 visits player 2, and player 3 and 4 visit player 1. You may be told that player 1 visited player 8, and that he was visited by players 6 and 5.

As idiot observer, window peak will reveal a random faction of the target, unless they died that same night or you targeted the prince.

As idiot princess, flirt will reveal two random class types. If you will-o-wisp, you will be told who visited you, but no one else will.
You actually do have royal blood as idiot princess. When you become king, you will think you are good, but are actually the neutral king.

As idiot butler, when attempting to serve wine, you will think you served wine to the target when you didn&#39;t. You will think you occupied them if they are not occupy immune, and you will think they declined if they are.
If you try to use concentrated wine, you will think you succeeded and all visiting players will think they were occupied, but they will not be.
If you try to poison king, the king will be told they were poisoned, but the king will be told they were cured either the next night or in 2 nights.

As idiot knight, you will be told you watched over your target if they are not attacked (you do visit them, but nothing else). If they are attacked, you will be told you were occupied.
If you attempt to cold steel, you will be told that you were occupied.

-----------------
In other words: you won&#39;t know you are an idiot, you are to stupid to recognize this (cue Normie is stupid jokes). your class card will be of whatever type of idiot you are, even if you click on it.

idiot has no conversion.

what this contributes: probably really funny; give players a moment of pause when killing observer, princess, butler, or best of all, knight.</description>
