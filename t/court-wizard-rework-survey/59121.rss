<p>I can do one better:<br>
There must be 2 Court Wizards in game<br>
One must target a Healer<br>
The Healer must target a player that is jailed.<br>
The other Court Wizard must target the Prince<br>
The Prince must decide to execute his prisoner</p>
<p>My initial idea was to give no empower to Killer classes. But that seemed a bit lame, so I came up with a very situational buf. In short: The Court Wizard probably does not want to target Killer classes. For instance: A buf on a Butler is far more useful. This is deliberate. Some classes have less use for Empowers since their impact is pretty decent already. Also, this makes the choice who to Empower as Court Wizard far more relevant.</p>

            <p>That sounds like the most useless thing ever still.</p>
<p>First, a killing class must be attacking the hunter.<br>
Then the hunter must use bear.<br>
Then a healer must target the killer.<br>
Finally the cw has to target the hunter.</p>

            <p>In general, the empower for killer classes is the most modest one anyways, since the killer classes (along with the investigative classes) are impactful enough. (The bonusses for social, offensive and support classes are more powerful on purpose)</p>
<p>The high natural impact is especially true for Prince. So, it would almost never affect Prince and that is a okay.</p>
<p>As for Hunter, it wouldn’t affect Wolf, since a Wolf bleeds rather than kills. But I did have Bear in mind.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem with this is that the knight would be the only one to benefit from this, since prince execution cannot be healed and hunter doesn’t attack directly (unless you mean that his wolf cannot be healed).</p>

            <p>While I really like the idea of 1, it is a bit complicated as a whole, and rather OP as well.</p>
<p>Can we have the love child of option 1 and 2?</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability - Magical Barrier (4 uses)</strong> - Make another player conversion immune tonight<br>
<strong>Night Ability – Empower (Unlimited uses)</strong> – Empower another player based on class type.<br>
<strong>Night Ability - Tornado (2 uses)</strong> - Swap players. Bypasses redirection immunity.</p>
<p>Empower will bestow a bonus for that night on the target based on their class type. Note that it can help Unseen/Cult when used on them. A Court Wizard would do good to avoid that just like a Physician would do good to avoid healing Unseen/Cults.</p>
<p>Support: Target will be <strong>guaranteed</strong> to visit their intended target (Bypasses occupation, redirection, visit prevention, etc.)<br>
Social: Becomes conversion immune<br>
Offensive: Becomes death immune<br>
Special: Will appear as Blue Dragon<br>
Investigative: Will always get accurate results (immune to Warp, Frame, etc.)<br>
Killer: Their attacks cannot be healed</p>
<p>The target will <strong>only</strong> get a feedback message if the empower was relevant that night.</p>

            <p>Court Wizard 3 (Generic Empower Based) is the one that seems the most appealing to me. I like the idea of having limited uses of Magical Barrier as a day ability. Keeping the Tornado also provides more survivability and Empower seems much more useful than Barrier when it was as a night ability before.</p>
