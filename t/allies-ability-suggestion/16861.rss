    <description>With the King&#39;s ability reverted, games will once again become too king-reliant. I agree that finding royals wasn&#39;t really helpful or good for the game, but what if we tried something new?

What if the King would be able to check 2 different people, and the result would tell the king if these 2 players belong to the same faction? Good King could use in on a most-likely-confimed BD and some other player. Evil King could easily lie to make good players fight each other... 

No idea how it would work out for a Neutral King. This idea could use some improvements. What do you think?</description>

            <p>How about:</p>
<p>Meating - Basically a non-anonymous psychic link (Unlimited cuz its not that powerful)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Interview - Chose a unique class. You will talk to them and they can talk back to you anonymously. If no one has this class you will talk to the Evil faction leader instead. You cannot talk to the Prince (4 uses)</p>
<p>This would emphasize how the king is the person that does the accusing so others don’t have to (aka actual invests whisper a king leads and he announces them) while also giving people more to use for scum reading the king.</p>
<p>BTW it goes without saying that only the starting king should have these.</p>

            <p>The devs need to brainstorm powerful support and social abilities for the King. Any sort of investigative ability is a bad idea honestly.</p>

            <p>Sounds good to me. But it would be kind of weird to leave king with nothing and I can’t find a good replacement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if we changed Allies to a parity cop check between two players at night? It would tell you whether two people were of the same faction or not. This could be powerful but also not entirely damning a single person to death. It would provoke discussion and have the two players “duel” in a way to convince the King that the other person is the scum. Make it so you can’t check the same person twice, so you can’t simply find the Prince and pair everybody up with him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>lol deja vu</p>
<p>I agree with Orange for the most part. We should just introduce the Maid to the game instead of giving parity to King.</p>

            <p>This is a good idea for a new class, but King shouldn’t really get to investigate anything at all in my opinion.</p>
