    <title>Emergent gameplay and how to build it</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/emergent-gameplay-and-how-to-build-it/56369</link>
    <description>Some of the most fun things to do is to take advantage of the games fringe rules to take something normally useless or otherwise weak and make it game changing. This mostly involves taking advantage of the details on how an ability works.

For example take the Knights defend. It does 4 things:

1: It checks if anyone visiting your target is attacking your target.

2: It prevents those people from attacking.

3: It counterattacks those player with an attack that ignores night Immunity.

4: It expends armor and kills you if expended but only if 2 and 3 trigger.

The most obvious case of this becoming emergent gameplay is with the Possessor forcing someone to visit and attack the Knights target.

Other details include that indirect attacks such as a Hunter Bear or a Sorcerer CoD are uneffected. It also means that things that don&#39;t visit or that aren&#39;t attacks go through such as a Hunter wolf or an Inquisitor RE. 

Most things that interact with weather or not someone visits are like this.

CW empower and weaken are great because they allow for more complex interactions.</description>
