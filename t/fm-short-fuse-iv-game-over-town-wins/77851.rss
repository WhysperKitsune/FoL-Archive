    <description># Short Fuse IV
![bomb|272x241,75%](upload://6gWSMU8Vn2CRXlOKBzIXsQ7hqnN.jpeg) 
### Host

Astand
### Setup

**9 [color=green]Town[/color]**
**3 [color=red]Mafia[/color]**

Mafia requires parity to win rather than the total obliteration of the town faction

Nightless
Mafia have a factional chat, but do not have a factional kill
Days are 48 hours long
Prods will be sent out every 24 hours of non-activity. A second prod means a force replace out.
Lynches happen through either majority or plurality
Votes are cast with command **/vote [insert playername]**
You cannot vote for a nolynch

### Game Gimmick

Each player has a bomb strapped to them, the bombs can only be disarmed when 1 faction wins.

At the beginning of the game, each player is publicly given a detonator.

At any point, you may type **/detonate** in the game thread to kill the player whose detonator you hold.

When a player dies for any reason (detonation or lynch), the detonator they hold is given to the player who holds their detonator, so if A can kill B and B can kill C, if B dies, A then has the detonator to kill C.

A player may detonate a maximum of one player per 24 hours.

Before the game starts, the Mafia must tell us if they want a Town detonator, a Mafia detonator, or for it to be random. A maximum of 3 Mafia detonators can be taken. A 12 hour time limit holds for pre-game. It is allowed to talk during this period. If no choice is made, it will be random.

Once the player who has your detonator types **/detonate** , you can no longer detonate anyone.

<summary>
Screen 1</summary>
<p>Tries to keep the possibilities open than make statements. ‘Could’ and ‘Probably’ have been used a lot.  They’re only stating mechanical help. It’s kind of towny but I’m pretty sure mafia posted it.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Screen 2</summary>
<p>He’s trying to defend someone based off of term-misusage. Not a towny thing to do. Mafia posted this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Screen 3</summary>
<p>Interacting with another player trying to convince them specifically than the entire court and tries to go outside of a dome. If he thinks it’s important why isn’t he lynching inside of them? Mafia posted this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Screen 4</summary>
<p>This depends on the type of game be played. If it’s turbo then I completely agree, however it isn’t nessecarily true if it’s not turbo. However he’s being bold about it and trying to convince others. I believe town posted this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Screen 5</summary>
<p>This reminds me of when I was trying to have Centuries hung in RRM. However the bottom paragraph is what I would have said if I wasn’t trying to get a town killed. This is town that posted this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Screen 6</summary>
<p>Points out that’s what they should be doing rather than what they think. That’s what mafia thinks (what they should be doing if they were town) rather than what they think about that player (noted by why he’s used the word of ‘natural’. Mafia posted this.</p>
