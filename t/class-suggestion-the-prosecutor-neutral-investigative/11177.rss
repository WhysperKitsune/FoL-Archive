    <description>The prosecutor - Neutral investigative

Passive: Diligent - Occupy immune

Day Ability: Background check - Learn your targets class immediately. (Unlimited)

Night Ability 1: Tampler - Your target will have thier invest results flipped (BD &lt;-&gt; Unseen/Cult Neutral -&gt; BD) (3 uses)

Night Ability 2: Silver toung - Make your first target target the second. Ignores occupy immunity. Will fail if they did nothing or if it wasn&#39;t a valid target. (Unlimited)

Goal: Ensure that there are more executions than night kills when the day ends.

(Unique)

Notes: I mostly wanted to make a neutral invest who&#39;s ability&#39;s directly help his goals (forming a basis to accuse people on and learning who they need to control to slow night killing) while having a goal other than &quot;Find X classes&quot;.</description>

            <p>Claiming Prosecutor probably won’t get you killed by BD but you are just threatening enough to Evils for them to kill you while being just unhelpful enough to BD to not be protected. You would claim it late game when you know everyone’s classes to survive afterward when you claim. Plus there is the fact that you would have reason to keep the game from ending if there have been less day kills than night kills.</p>

</aside>
<p>When the <strong>game</strong> ends, right?</p>
<p>It’s an interesting win condition, but this class can die night 1 and then win the game just out of sheer luck. Sometimes there are games where there are naturally more executions than night kills. Especially Cult games.</p>
<p>Here’s my question: what stops the Prosecutor from claiming Day 1 to avoid death the entire game? He can confirm himself through his night abilities and is fairly benign to BD.</p>

            <p>Prosecutor cannot be occupied, because there is still work to be done ;p i mean, in his mind “justice must be served!”, so he cannot be stopped at night so easily.</p>
