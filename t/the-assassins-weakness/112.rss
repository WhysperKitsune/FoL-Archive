    <title>The Assassins Weakness</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-assassins-weakness/112</link>
    <description>in the game, town of Salem the mafia has 2 killers the mafioso and the godfather and because of this the town roles such as jailor and escort may not be able to prevent the killers from attacking. 

this is where the black roses biggest weakness comes from because the
Assassin is the only killer and because the 3 blue dragons that are able to block them only needs to block him once and the black rose won&#39;t be able to kill anymore. 

you could counter this by saying the Nightshade power could kill even if he is blocked but if that happens the person who died could write when they died they yesterdays they died from poison effectively making it more likely for the blue dragon to keep blocking the assassin while they find the other members 

my 1st idea to solve this is by making it when you are affected by nightshade you are unable to write in your will
the 2nd one is if you are role blocked instead of doing nothing if you have a use of nightshade you will use the nightshade to kill your chosen target. this makes it very important to use your nightshade sparely because normally what you could do is just use the nightshade then get some other than use it the following day but with this, you should only use the nightshade when needed</description>

            <p>Simple answer: add in tactical kills, and find a different night use for Assassin. I believe a thread similar to this reply already exists. Tactical kills allow any Rose member can kill someone, sacrificing their night action to do so. Of course, only one Rose can kill per night. This adds depth and interesting strategies to the game. Is it more important for X to perform his action, or should Y?</p>
<p>It also doesn’t make Occupies practically useless, like in the GF/Maf setup in Town of Salem. Escorts are trash in Ranked mode, because Godfather counters pretty much any hope of blocking Mafia kills. With tactical kills, they can still block a kill from happening if they guess the Rose killer for the night. However, it doesn’t hard-counter it either, as the Roses can then switch the kill to someone they doubt will be Occupied.</p>
<p>Just an idea, but I think it would be a cool addition.</p>

            <p>if someone is gonna be occupied 3 times its likely from the same person and that’s already 3 deaths avoided and 3 more nights for everyone to figure out who the black rose.once the 3 night occupied limit is reached they will kill him off since no one died the last few nights.</p>
<p>anyway we still don’t know how much of a problem this is gonna be anyway its still a better idea to wait for the alpha/beta to see how much it affects gameplay</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maybe if the Black Rose is full (aka no more players can be added), and the Assassin is occupied, then how about the Mastermind kills the target instead?</p>
<p>It might be too powerful, but it can also reveal the MM, so…I’m not sure on how balanced this is.</p>

            <p>I know, that’s why I was sharing my experience in All Any. There is no guarantee that there will be a GF, and it doesn’t seem to be a problem. If it turns into a problem in ToL, then we will look into it.</p>

            <p>Yeah it looks like the Black Rose will need to compliment each other as currently designed, the idea for poison to prevent the poisoned player from writing in their journal makes sense as an expected reaction to poison, for sure. Now that there won’t be anything written for that previous night might be a more vague clue still, but not a perfect clue.</p>

            <p>I play a lot of All Any in ToS, so there is no guarantee that there will be a GF and Mafioso in that. I have rarely seen it be an issue. There are also some Black Rose classes that can help the Assassin bypass occupation.</p>

            <p>We actually have a 2nd killer. The Possessor is our neutral SK. Also there are more killers, but The Assassin and The Possessor are indeed the main ones.</p>
<p>The idea about nightshade use is in interesting. Since there are limited uses it’d make sense. Then they can’t do it in the day.</p>
