    <description>Duke - Neutral Offensive

Passive - Rally Allies
You will be able to talk to the King at night.

Passive - Commander
If you step up to be King you will be aligned with whatever the Original King was.

Day Ability 1:
Royal Announcement

Reveal the King&#39;s alignment to everyone. Not usable until Day 4. - 1 use
Comment: This could be extremely powerful but if you reveal a Evil King that could be bad into your favor so you have to be very careful when using this.

Day Ability 2 (Optional):
Bribe

Bribe someone forcing them to guard the King and occupying them. If the target is occupy immune they will not guard the King. - 3 Uses
Comment: Useful when the King is using Allies or has ran out of guards.

Night Ability 1:
Blood Transfusion

Transfuse two people&#39;s blood. If one of them had Royal Blood the other now has it and the person previously with Royal Blood no longer does. You are able to transfuse yourself. - 2 Uses
Comment: This could be useful if the Original King dies.

Night Ability 2:

The King can use two Day Abilities tomorrow.
Comment: The amount of times I&#39;m Evil King and are against 2 confirmed people is outstanding. This could win it for the King. Also, the King can use Royal Finger twice.

Lore:
Doubt this role will get a lot of support and I am not good at writing lore so if someone else wants to then I would be very grateful!

Win Condition:
Ensure the Original King survives. If the Original King dies you must be crowned next or you lose.

            <p>Seems like it could be fun to play. All though for “Royal Announcement”; I think it should be only usable after Day 4 or something.</p>
