&gt;*[color=gray]Neutral Support/Offensive [/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Complete the Mission)** - On nights you attack a player, you will be occupation/redirection immune.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Target)** - Choose a player. They will now be your target. _5 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Lone Wolf)** - Make all players attackable tonight. _1 use._
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Avenge)** - If your target was executed for treason the past day, bleed the first or second voter (They will die the next night). If your target is alive, kill them (If they were &quot;innocent&quot;, you will commit suicide) (This bypasses death immunity). If you have used lone wolf, you may kill anyone without penalty. _Infinite Uses - 1 day cooldown_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (You Killed Him)** - Choose a player. You will be shown of how many times they have visited your targets. _Infinite Uses_.

*Goal: Kill 2 players that were &quot;guilty&quot;. If your target was killed during execution, avenge them through the first or second accuser bleeding to death. If they died at night, make the killer your target and kill them yourself.*

**Guilty = killed or voted up one of your targets for treason.**
**Innocent = didnt**</description>

            <p>Before, as retribution, you may only attack your target or the first or second person who accused your target for treason. On the lone wolf night, you can attack anyone without penalty. Kind of like an alch bomb.</p>
