    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-for-reports/9402</link>
    <description>Is there ANY chance of getting some results of our reports posted somehow? Its frustrating to see someone obviously throw and throw HARD and yet we never hear if they got punished. It makes alot of people not want to report because they feel nothing happens. And it also makes the trolls braver and other people do things they normally wouldnt if they knew these reports actually got read?

I just had a priest get pissed for no reason and refused to rez all game, or give info to BD all game. I reported him, but Ill never know if the person got what they deserved.

Just a suggestion that perhaps you SHOULD post the information of the reports as part of the punishment to trolls and throwers.</description>

            <p>Just like Weizen said, if the report is valid (which means having a proper summary) it will be dealt with. If I get a report that has this summary <code>He's a noob</code>, that’s either gonna be ignored, since being a noob is not reportable or it may even backfire if the reporter is insulting the player during the whole game.</p>
<p>If you wanna take a look at reports actually punishing people, check the reviews of the game LOL. Most of them are from people that got banned and decided to revenge review <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smirk.png?v=9" title=":smirk:" class="emoji" alt=":smirk:"></p>

            <p>Super early morning jumbled ramble incoming, I’m sorry for any lack of clarity.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, I can assure you every report is looked at individually by a staff member, so the reports are definitely read. It does help to be clear when reporting “bob did x starting night 2” is more useful than “he noob revenge kappa” or  “s” or the like, speeds up report handling i would assume if they know what to look for. More on topic, to alleviate that feeling of not knowing, or feeling no one reads your report, perhaps an automated “report recieved” and/or “your report has been processed” message to the reporter when a punishment is handed out?</p>
<p>But in general, I can tell you that every report filed is looked over by the mods, and that from what i know of them, they would never ignore a report, but so many of them come in that it could take a while to get caught up I would imagine.</p>
