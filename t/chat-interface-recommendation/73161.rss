    <description>After 305 hours of game time, I would like to have more customizable options with the chat box. E.g. Multiple windows to seperate general message with whisper or even if it is a tab that blinks, or the option to choose either or. After 4 games within 2 hours of being King, the massive amount of whispers with the general chat and people randomly accusing others it is difficult to manage every detail.</description>

            <p>I think it replicates the chaos of how a court might have been 600 years ago.</p>
<p>You can still navigate and read whispers in the [view history] tab and still read the general chat on the bottom left, all the while moving your log to the side to type in claims. It works pretty well already, just have to practice moving stuff around a little</p>

            <p>I understand would like the option to see the View History being able to change in size so I can have 2 boxes upon or more at once.</p>

            <p>you just click view history on the top of your chat box and it separates sytem, whispers, general, and mystic/prince(if your mystic/prince)</p>

            <p>Hey, there is a way you can filter chat into just whispers/system messages using the view history button. I’d love to give you some screenshots to point you, but I’m on mobile atm. I’m sure someone will clue you in how to do it soon.</p>
