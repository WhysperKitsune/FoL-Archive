    <title>Reconnect Error when in-game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/reconnect-error-when-in-game/7307</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Every time I get the reconnect error, it goes to the black screen and attempts to reconnect. My game always crashes and I cannot rejoin the game. It won&#39;t let me click the &#39;cancel&#39; button either.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should be able to reconnect and I never can. I worry I am going to be reported for leaving the game when I&#39;m still alive, but when it isn&#39;t my fault. Also, the cancel button should let you go back to the main menu.</description>

            <p>Since your game crashes you should post your specs and upload your output_log.txt from the game files after a crash.</p>
