    <description># [New Thread](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/deception-murder-in-hong-kong-rerolled-10-10-pregame/74153?u=pug)

# Attention Gamers, it is time to rise and grind as the Forensic Scientist needs your help. The murderer has murdered somebody and he has to somehow tell you all who the murderer is without speaking. Now all he needs is your /joins and a witness to help him and all he needs is your credit card number, a stale joke and the expiration month and year. BUT BE QUICK SO HE SHOW THE INVESTIGATORS THE MURDERER, THE EVIDENCE CARD AND THE MEANS OF MURDER CARD AND WIN THE GAME EPIC STYLE.

### Rules

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515

### Gameplay (the tl;dr version)
### [Official Rulebook](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a3fb191cd39c31f96b9b371/t/5ad3f81388251b90ed5d9196/1523841065448/Deception+Murder+in+Hong+Kong+%28Rules%29.pdf)
#### The Crime Phase

When you receive a card you will have ~24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it in your classcard.
The murderer will also gain the identity of the accomplice and vice versa.
Everyone except the Forensic Scientist will also gain 4 clue cards and 4 means cards upon this.
The Forensics Scientist gains the identity of everyone.
Upon this. The murderer must choose his means of murder and key evidence.

#### The Investigation Phase
**Forensic Scientist**
The Forensic Scientist must place a bullet on each scene tile that is entered into play.
Even if some of these scene tiles don&#39;t have clues relevant to the case. The Scientist MUST place a bullet to one of these clues anyway.
If an Investigator presents their findings for the case, this is when the Forensic Scientist may reply with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; response as to if the ENTIRE CASE is correct.
The Forensic Scientist and the host are the only ones who are allowed to use big text.

**Investigators**
During each round, each Investigator looks at the clues the Forensic Scientist is providing and this may lead to them discussing who the murderer is.
Via each phase. Every non Forensic Scientist will get to present who they think who the murderer is and which two cards of theirs is related to the crime (the cards you own will be in your class DM).
This will be in order of who uses **/thesis** first in their classcards. You may still talk when thesis&#39; are open.
All thesis&#39; will be timestamped.
Additionally if a player feels strongly about their findings. They may use their **/badge token** to present their case to the Forensic Scientist.

### Using Your Badge Token
Once per game, every player (this includes the murderer, witness and accomplice) and present their theory of how the murder occurred in the thread. The accusation must get all three variables correct in order to solve the case.
1. The Murderer
2. The Key evidence card
3. The means of the Murder card

If any part of the theory is incorrect, the Forensic Scientist will state that the accusation was incorrect and the player who guessed it may no longer officially guess to the forensic scientist.

#### End of Game
The game ends if one of the following conditions occur:
* An investigator uses their Badge Token and correctly accuses.
* All players have used their badge tokens with incorrect acussations/
* The third round completes without a correct accusation.

#### Who Wins?
