    <title>[Class Suggestion] Crone - Neutral Killing</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-crone-neutral-killing/2966</link>
    <description>**Crone** (Neutral)

Passive 1:
**Dead Tongue** - You will be able to see the dead speaking at night, but their words become more faded with each passing night. (You cannot speak TO them, however.)

_^ On the first night a player is dead, you will see their &quot;ghost chat&quot; normally. On the next night, their words will be &quot;faded&quot; into the background color of the chat box. (IE: Lower opacity.) On the next night, it will be barely visible. Next night, you no longer see that player speaking._

Passive 2:
**Heart of the Enemy** - You are immune from murder on nights you successfully kill.

Day Ability:
**Foul Justice** - Enable the dead to vote up a living player of your choice during the trial period if they so choose. (Limited use. One?)

_^ This is announced to the dead, telling them they can vote, but is not announced to the living. Votes simply pile up unexpectedly for living player. So for example, if you use this ability on PLAYER1, the dead will be given an option to vote PLAYER1 up for execution if they so choose._

Night Ability:
**Revenge Killing** - Choose to kill a player. This ability starts at ZERO uses, but you are given 1 use of this ability for each player who dies from night one forward.

_^ So if two people die night one, you will have two uses of your killing ability given to you based on those deaths. If one person dies on the next night, you&#39;re given an additional one use, and so on... If nobody dies during the night, you aren&#39;t given any uses, since no one died._

Lore: Y&#39;all cray-cray.

Comments: Goal is same as Reaper, etc. Basic stuff.</description>

            <p>i agree with Ashe and semi-Jammy, but my main suggestion is to change the name of the first passive to “Fading Spirits” or if you remove the fading (but keep the night-limit on dead chat) “Lingering Spirits”</p>

            <p>Ah, okay.</p>
<p>In that case, it needs more than 1 use, seeing as most BD won’t just lynch who the NK wants them to…</p>

            <p>Very weak. Can read ghost chat, can kill a little bit, and can enable the dead to vote for a day; the dead might even vote them!</p>

            <p>I don’t like the fact that night immunity isn’t permanent</p>
<p>This is gonna leave the Crone with the same problems the Reaper used to have, namely the fact that it can get sniped by the Unseen, the Cult or even a ballsy Knight</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that people must die in order for it to kill is going to really cripple it in cult games, even moreso if there isn’t a second NK<br>
I’ve seen games go up to 3 or 4 nights without killing, which gives Investigative classes ample time to find the Crone before she can do absolutely anything, plus killer classes</p>

            <p>I feel like passive 1 shouldn’t fade. People will inevitably turn up the contrast on their screen just to see it. It would be better imo if it’s normally visible for the first three nights.<br>
Do you get a use of Revenge Killing for using it to kill someone?</p>
