            <p>I have an idea for a slightly different twist on this idea</p>
<p>Role: Avenger (Neutral Wildcard)<br>
Goal: Get revenge for a killed player<br>
Convert role: Convert immune</p>
<p>Abilities: Day - Avenge: Select a dead player to seek justice for. You must ensure that player’s killer is executed [Killer is defined as any role that killed them at night or the person who performed their execution]. If the player’s killer dies through any other means, you may select a new target. (Unlimited use).</p>
<p>Night: - Frame: Plant evidence on a player to make them look evil (Will look like unseen to sheriff, Killing class to Princess, Cult/Unseen to Psychic](3 uses)<br>
Investigate: Check a player to see if they were guilty of killing your target (Infinite uses)</p>

            <p>Will the dead be able to choose a target for you to go after during the night?</p>
<p>Also, it would be a good help to be able to read the dead chat at night as well.</p>
<p>In addition, would this role be suitable for full night immunity?</p>

            <p>I reckon that the Avenger will have already won once a voted target is executed. Perhaps once he’s won he will be able to generally do what he/she likes</p>

            <p>Once they have achieved their role’s goal what happens?<br>
Also, would the dead then have a voting system to pick which person they want dead?</p>
