    <title>SFoL Concept: Adapt and Evolve</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-concept-adapt-and-evolve/62036</link>
    <description>Im planning to host a SFoL in the future named Adapt and Evolve. The SFoL is pretty far down the list so it won&#39;t be happening any time soon (SFoL 33), however I wanted some feedback and/or suggestions about it. 
The reason why I&#39;m looking for feedback this early is because the game will have a big number of classes so I want to post some of the class cards from time to time so you can help me with stuff like balance.
 
The game is similar to classic FoL, with an added &quot;evolution&quot; mechanic. Basically, all classes are divided into 3 tiers. All players begin in tier 1 and must perform certain actions to &quot;evolve&quot;, which will change their class to one of the tier 2 classes, depending on which &quot;quest&quot; they completed.
Evolving from tier 1 to tier 2 is really easy and is more like a choice than a quest. Evolving from tier 2 to tier 3 however is harder. 
As an example of this, here is the King&#39;s evolution tree (Spoiler, there are 7 different &quot;King&quot; roles):


[details=&quot;The Leader&#39;s Evolution tree&quot;]
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**The Leader**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; **Unknown faction, Special, Tier 1.**

&gt; **Guards! (Night)** – Send your guards to protect a player, making them immune to death. Can target yourself. - 1 use.

&gt;**The Leader evolutions:**

[details=&quot;Evolution chart&quot;]
**Special**
The Leader _evolves into_ The King or The Queen
The King _evolves into_ The Emperor or The Tyrant
The Queen _evolves into_ The Empress or The Monarch

[color=steblue] **Blue Dragon** [/color]
The Waiter _evolves into_ The Butler or The Drunk
The Butler _evolves into_ The Innkeeper or The Executioner
The Drunk _evolves into_ The Butler or The Drunk
The Investigator _evolves into_ The Princess or The Observer
The Princess _evolves into_ The Librarian or The Empress
The Observer _evolves into_ The Gravekeeper or The Executioner
The Healer _evolves into_ The Physician or The Court Wizard
The Physician _evolves into_ The Medic or The Gravekeeper
The Court Wizard _evolves into_ The Mage or The Captain
The Eavesdropper _evolves into_ The Noble or The Mystic
The Noble _evolves into_ The Elder or The Monarch
The Mystic _evolves into_ The Psychic or The Maid
The Thug _evolves into_ The Knight or The Trapper
The Knight _evolves into_ The Royal Guard or The Mage
The Trapper _evolves into_ The Hunter or The Innkeeper
The Lawman _evolves into_ The Scientist or The Jailor
The Scientist _evolves into_ The Biologist or The Bailiff
The Jailor _evolves into_ The Prince or The Tyrant

[color=green] **Reptilians** [/color]
WIP

[color=gray] **Neutrals** [/color]
The Alchemist _evolves into_ The Medic (BD) or The Komodo (Reptilian)
The Sellsword _evolves into_ The Mercenary or The Bounty Hunter
The Hermit _evolves into_ The Cleric or The Diseased
The Jester _evolves into_ The Fool or The Scorned
[/details]



Other stuff you need to know about the game:

* Every class type has a tree, and with some exceptions every tree has 7 classes (1 tier 1, 2 tier 2, and 4 tier 3).
* Not all tier 3 classes are unique. For example, both &quot;The Butler&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; can evolve into &quot;The Executioner&quot;.
* Some classes will change class types when evolving. These evolutions are extremely situational and hard to achieve. For example, to evolve the Butler into &quot;the Executioner&quot; you must kill an Evil or Neutral King with your &quot;Nightshade Wine&quot;.
* You will be told when you fulfill the requirements to evolve. You can evolve at any time after that by telling the host. Evolving doesn&#39;t count as an action and you can do it at any time. Once you evolve, you cannot go back to a previous tier, however.
* There will be some of my class suggestions in the game, many of the classes of the &quot;Golden Dragon&quot; will appear as tier 3 evolutions.
* The scum faction will be a modified version of my faction suggestion &quot;The Reptilians&quot;. 
* The reptilians have a different evolution tree than the BD, with more tier 1 classes and fewer tier 3 classes.
* There will be a special NK for this game, called &quot;The Collector&quot;, which will be a combination between a Neutral Killer and an investigative role.</description>

            <p>Also I dont want to scrap this idea, but I was thinking about maybe delaying it and do a more normal SFoL first to test the GD classes since they are the tier 3 evolutions. And also because I plan there to be around 50 class cards so I want a bit more expetience first.</p>

            <p>I do have neutral trees and was planning to make some neuts able to change “sides” when evolving. As for the prince, you probably noticed that there is no hard counter class like sheriff in the investigator’s tree and thats because both prince and an unconvertable hard counter are on the same tree.</p>

            <p>Also, there is still like 10 SFoL before I host mine, but I will need a cohost that has some experience playing or hosting classic FoL games since I don’t have much experience with trials and that kind of stuff.</p>

            <p>I do plan to host both eventually, but I want to know which would be better to host first.</p>

            <p>Before I continue making more evolution trees I have a question. Should I host a more classic SFoL but with my class suggestions (Golden Dragon, etc). instead of this? I’m starting to think this might be too complicated for my fist SFoL.</p>
<div class="poll" data-poll-status="open" data-poll-public="true" data-poll-type="regular" data-poll-name="poll">

<div class="poll-container">
<ul>
<li data-poll-option-id="d692b2a70236113d829caa730d907cf1">Change it to a more normal FoL but with your class suggestions</li>
<li data-poll-option-id="98376a9cfb5fdcb5bc68681604df4456">Keep the whole evolution concept</li>
