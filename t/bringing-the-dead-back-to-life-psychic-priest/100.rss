    <title>Bringing the dead back to life. Psychic/Priest</title>

    <description>hey, i just wanted to share my options on the classes psychic and priest.
I believe 1 of these classes should be able to talk and revive the dead both. 

in noncult games, the priest ability sets is a little more limited seeing how she can change cult members role back. giving the priest the power to talk the dead would be a good idea because she will be able to make more of a use with her Revive ability. 

Also, I can think of many reasons why the priest power restore is a terrible idea. for one when the cult member is brought back he can just tell everyone who the other cult members are. the only way to counter that is to never show who the other cult members are, then you have no idea who to vote for or not! Likely killing your own teammates.

secondly, if the paladin&#39;s mark tells&#39;s everyone that they are a cultist they are way more likely to kill him instead of hope that is priest is able to bring him back to his former role once again making this power kinda in this situation kinda useless.

and if the cult leader wants to kill with the member whats happens if he is restored? does the member die or did the cult leader just waste a night trying to kill someone? so it&#39;s my hope that you change the restore power of the priest it&#39;s honestly not gonna work to well.

if you do this then the psychic may need a new power or not seeing how she has the ability vision can give you the users faction and combined with Misdirect you would easily be able to kill an evil member. or maybe not.

and honestly, I do not see psychic having much use with the power to talk to the dead. it likely won&#39;t be needed for the psychic when the priest would gain a much more use than the psychic ever the world</description>

            <p>Yeah there’s a special passive that a few classes have, Prince, Princess, Noble, and their converted roles. At the beginning of the day it’ll check if anyone of them want to be King, if not it’ll see if anyone else wants to. They can also step forward during the second phase if they don’t want to reveal what class they may be.</p>

            <p>Whenever the King dies, the following day there will be a chance for people to step forward to become the new King. If only one person steps forward they’ll become King. If two people step forward, voting will start. People choose one of the two that stepped forward. If no one steps forward that day, then it’ll see if anyone wants to the next day. If there is still no one after that, it just stops checking.</p>

</aside>
<p>so it’s possible for there to never be a king at a chosen point cool, also making it that the king can’t be revived if there is already a king is a good idea because it  would make the game a lot more complicated other wise.</p>

            <p>Currently the King is classified as a unique role, so the Priest won’t be able to revive him. We could possibly set it up, so that if no one becomes the new King, then the Priest could revive a good King.</p>

            <p>Funny enough, at one point I was thinking about having someone that could convert the Black Rose back, but I thought about the knowing all the members problem. Totally glossed over that fact for the Cult. We’ll switch the Priest to talking to the dead and reviving. We’ll give a new ability to the Psychic, and might change up the Paladin some.</p>
