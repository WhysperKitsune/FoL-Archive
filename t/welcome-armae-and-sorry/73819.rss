    <title>Welcome Armae! (and sorry)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/welcome-armae-and-sorry/73819</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to take a minute to come as close as I can to unlocking @Armae&#39;s introduction thread.

I apologize that your introduction has had to be drowned out in a large response to a change you suggested and the actions of another dev. You really don&#39;t deserve to have either of those define you as a member of the team, so I wanted to make this thread to get back on track.

Welcome to the team, we&#39;re glad to have you on board for the wonderful game we call Throne of Lies. :blush:</description>
