<p>With court fee, there will be less players leaving alive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><em>That’s</em> the reason??? Honestly, I’d say having a timer lockout would be a better alternative, like if you leave a game while alive, you’re locked for 15m. A second time the same day and it’s 30m, then an hour (times are examples, but it keeps going up each time you do it, resets daily). Why is <em>that</em> not an alternative? I’m sorry Xblade, but that’s a really flimsy reason for adding the court fees. Or better yet, have the fees for people who leave while alive, like you have to pay a fine for leaving in the middle of a match (of “court”).</p>

<p>Since you get coin at the end of each room (essentially punished for leaving early , which was already reportable and now has coin loss) +and possibilities for bonuses (dead bets, vote mvp x3, win 1 of 3 mvp, brilders, win bonus, upcoming login promos, and other promo features absolutely coming since f2p needs this kinda stuff)… <strong>Statistics are on your side.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, but you’re still losing at least 50g per match compared to pre-patch when honestly I think it’s unneeded. Stuff’s already decently expensive (gold-wise I mean) and pumping out more things (especially stuff like death note colors and nice cosmetics) will keep people wanting more.</p>

<p>f it wasn’t court fee, it’d be something else: Remember, I work full time in Throne: I’m giving up a paycheck to solely and 100 percent rely on folks buying gold for aesthetics to survive. Without a gold sink, you won’t have an active dev. The court fee essentially hires me to update the game as a live service <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png!v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> not to mention more players means wayyy more server fees id need to cover.</p>

<p>Trust me, despite being gone for quite awhile, nothing would hurt me more than seeing ToL die, which is why I did even throw down 2 $20 purchases awhile back and bought a handful of keys for friends. I totally get and understand that, but I think adding more stuff rather than sapping gold would greatly incentivize people to buy more. I personally don’t care to have every armor and weapon, so I’m set on that and I only hold out for death note colors (or any other new and exciting potential cosmetics on the way). Still saving up for the Beta Scorned avatar I helped push through!</p>

<p>It’s just any indie f2p model, but better. Go to “other games” and all updates focus on bloaty and expensive store items. It’s a f2p patch and I still did balance and bug fixes. Because of our model, I can keep concentrating on what’s important instead of trying to shove items in your face with 0 true updates.<br>
Compare us and you’ll see why we went with court fees.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Which I totally understand and do recognize, and am glad you’re working hard on the game, I still just don’t think taking away gold is the right call here. Incentivizing people with more stuff to get rather than limiting their ability to buy stuff seems more sensible to me. Especially with AAAs pulling that crap on top of Pay2Win stuff, I always vilify people who pull that stuff, and it’s generally why I avoid games like that. By no means am I saying court fees are up there with that, I just think it doesn’t feel great to know you’re losing gold every match, and I really do feel that losses that aren’t your fault will cause significantly more toxicity and cause the community to degrade (which is really bad) because without getting an MVP vote, you’re literally stagnating. Making 0 progress towards a thing after 20 minutes of your time feels <em>awful</em>. At least <em>some</em> level of progression should happen, even if it’s like 15g (a loss should at least give your court fee back and then some, or again, just make the court fees be for people who leave).</p>
<p>On top of that, I don’t think people who wish to play with a stream or have a private match should be penalized in any way, especially not at the cost of 500g (equivalent to 10 losses, assuming you voted 3x MVPs each game).</p>
<p><strong>To give a more structured suggestion, I propose to do something like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Court fees changed, now costs 50g if you leave a public match while alive (leaving a fully private match does not incur this penalty). Staying in a match completely incurs no fee to pay. This penalty of 50g increases each time you leave a match while alive. It can-and-will get extremely expensive if you’re a scumbag.</li>
<li>Wins now give ~50, Losses give ~25, MVP votes still give 5 each. MVP rewards about the same (adjust slightly if needed)</li>
<li>Fully private matches (16/16 private) only reward 5gp for winning and nothing for losses. MVP is just for fun. Reason for this is private matches are meant to just be for fun and you could easily speed games up quickly by having a fully private group target someone specifically to shower with MVP and gold, plus all the dead people will make tons of gold off predictions as well since that can also be gamed. That said, there’s no 500gp cost for the host, it’s free just like public matches.<br>
Note: If you want, you can also make private match rewards scale with how many people are private, e.g., if it’s 8/16, the 8 private players only get 50% of the usual gold for everything [public players still get the full 100% they were supposed to get]. Your call on that though. The incentive is to not generally play private matches unless you really want to just for fun, as you’ll get virtually no gold, rather than the host losing 500.</li>
<li>Small price adjustments if needed, but stuff coming in the future will generally cost more (and hopefully be even cooler than stuff we’ve had? &lt;3 Needs more Beta Scorned feels, lol)</li>
<li>A suggestion to add the scroll system from Town of Salem as a nice gold dump. Maybe like 500gp per scroll? In case someone doesn’t know the scroll system, it’s a temporary item that greatly increases your chance to get the class listed on the scroll, and is not used until you actually get the class the scroll was increasing your odds of (because it’s not guaranteed, just greatly boosts your chances)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will make sure you’re always progressing towards that next purchase unless you’re constantly leaving games because you didn’t get a class you didn’t like, while also having a non-P2W consumable that keeps gold infinitely useful. Honestly, the addition of the scroll system alone would make me really value gold, especially when I have nothing I really want left to buy.</p>
<p>In the end though, Xblade, it’s your game and obviously you will do what you think is best. I just really hope you know for sure that this is the best way to go about it. I’m just saying, as a player, that losing my gold through no fault of my own (i.e., not being a scumbag and leaving games while alive) feels <em>awful</em> and will often demotivate me from caring about it. I’m just giving my own personal experience as a gamer of nearly 3 decades. Regression is one of the worst things you can feel and even though it’s statistically unlikely, the fact that it technically still happens before you get to the results screen doesn’t feel good at all.</p>

          <p>I’m not sure about the court fee system, but I’d like to see it in practice before I make any judgements.</p>
<p>I am concerned, though-- if a player enters a match with 50 gold, loses, and doesn’t MVP anyone, are they just locked out of the game until they buy gold? Or is there something I’m missing here?</p>

<p><strong>Allow Enforcer to target himself with “Protection” also Allow Sellsword to target herself with "Stonewall"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"This should help them protect themselves from being found as evil as well as reduce the chance of players being able to confirm anyone as unable to be either of those classes.</li>
<li>This will also allow players to more-easily fake offensive classes - all while reducing the overall confirmability of those.</li>
</ul>

</aside>
<p>not sure if i agree on self-stonewall, self-protection is fine</p>
<p>every other balance change is right on the money tho</p>
<p>court fee system definitely is something ill need to play with to gauge but the pros probably outweigh the cons, although i think its not perfectly implemented at a glance</p>

<li>When you start a public game and fully enter the game without being disconnected, there will be a 50gp “court fee” consumed.</li>

<p>Also, I agree with what other players have been saying about this being too much. Subtracting gold for leaving is fine, but I don’t think requiring gold to start is a good choice.</p>

<p>A suggestion to add the scroll system from Town of Salem as a nice gold dump. Maybe like 500gp per scroll? In case someone doesn’t know the scroll system, it’s a temporary item that greatly increases your chance to get the class listed on the scroll, and is not used until you actually get the class the scroll was increasing your odds of (because it’s not guaranteed, just greatly boosts your chances)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree that more incentive to buy would be better than punishing people for playing. Here are a few other suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faction/class type scrolls. Basically work the same as normal scrolls do, but for a specific faction/class type instead of a class</li>
<li>anti-scrolls. They’re basically scrolls that lower your chances of getting a specific class</li>
<li>Saveable deathnotes</li>
<li>Text-based deathnotes</li>

<p>I agree that more incentive to buy would be better than punishing people for playing</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For a premium game? I’d agree with your words. However, for f2p? This is a bit of an absurd way to word it, as the game is <strong>free</strong>, so there must be a gold sink in some form – it’s not punishing to play, it’s how folks get to play it for free (and even then, you start with 500gp and get gold whether you win or lose). In 1 way or another, it’d be a sink, whether it’s hidden in store prices and dominantly in patch updates (or no updates at all).</p>
<p>Trust me, it’d be way easier for me to just jack up the store prices and focus on store items instead of content (f2p model for numerous games) – but with court fees, there’s enough gold sink where we only have to make minor adjustments and still have patches focus on non-store. This is the “freemium-feels-premium” alternative.</p>
<p>We could do Valorant style where every skin is $20 USD, or ToS style where every decent item is about 1 month of grind – however, even then, store is finite, so our updates would all be aesthetics.</p>
<p>We’ve compared a ton, and if you compare too (and remember we’re not a paid game, anymore), you’ll see why we chose this. We’re not $10 anymore, and servers fees are expected to triple. This is the best way to keep it free (there has to be a source of flow), and keep the updates relevant to <em>you</em> instead of <em>earning money</em>.</p>

<p><font color="cyan"><strong>Why court fees?</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of bloating our store with finite items, jacking up the prices 10x, and having updates concentrate only on the <em>store</em> (like many other f2p games do), this route allows us to concentrate on the <strong>game</strong> like we did while premium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, we don’t have to shove buying gold in your face! We calculated it: <strong>It’s pretty much impossible to go broke</strong> (you even get gold when you lose; we also won’t allow players to buy items if it’ll mean they’ll go below 50gp).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To further aid this, we’ll continuously add more promo/progression goodies to help get more bonuses (eg, login promos and achievements are planned). Isn’t it nice that we can actually concentrate on login promos / achievements / progression <strong>instead of just store items</strong>? This is why court fees!</p>

          <p>Clarified private court fees into OP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Games
<ul>
<li>Semi Private (1~15p) court fee = 50 gp (same as public; merged into public queue)</li>
<li>100% Private (16p) court fee = 500gp (Host pays; all guests play FREE)

<strong>^ Why?</strong> 100% private means -16 players in the queue, to encourage public queues. However, this also can lead to cool things like a gold-rich player treating the community to a hosted game with 0 court fees (eg, drop a Discord link invite).

<li>During offpeak (that won’t exist anymore, later), if the “Start Early” pops up in a public match, it says 500gp - it’s not, it’s just 50gp.</li>
<li><s>There is a “weapons” text at the bottom-left of the store. This… was meant to say “*Store filters coming soon!”</s></li>
<li>Tutorial can’t reopen class cards in the tutorial <em>after</em> the introduction to them is over by clicking – but you still can open them via TAB.</li>
<li><s>“Queue as Group” was supposed to be renamed to “Merge into Public”.</s></li>

<p>This f2p patch was crunched a bit (<em>no, not gonna fire myself!</em> I prepared for this), so if there are bugs - no worries! Like always, I’ll fix em <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink.png!v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
