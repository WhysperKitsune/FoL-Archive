    <title>[Class Suggestion] Master Vampire</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-master-vampire/36308</link>
    <description>Neutral Killer

Win condition - Get voted up as new King. Make sure BD does not win the game.

Passive 1 - Noble - He will be first in line among Prince and Princess etc. to become the new King
Passive 2 - True Vision - Can see if the current King is Neutral, Evil or Good.

Night ability 1 - Drink Blood - Will visit a player to drink their blood. The Master Vampire will gain one charge of Transform. The visited player will be occupied for the night by this, and will be marked as &quot;Vampire Servant&quot; for the Master Vampire. Vampire Servant is a hidden passive that only the Master Vampire can see, so people that get bitten will not know they have it. Does not work on players guarded by a Knight or Cult/Unseen Members, or players that already have been bitten. (Same as Sorceress Kill)

Night ability 2 - Transform - Useable after the Vampire has 3 charges from Drink Blood. Transform into a giant Bat to kill the current King. Bypasses any protections on the king like Knight Guarding or Phys Healing. The King dies 100% from this.

When voted for new King, the Vampire will always be an Evil King.


Vampire Servant Passive
People will not know when they are vampire servant. The Vampire Servant will automatically vote for the Master Vampire when electing a new King. They will also be unable to talk for the day.</description>

            <p>I like your idea, although I do agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/kyodaz">@KyoDaz</a><br>
It doesn’t make sense for a Vampire to start out with Royal Blood, but should get it if he drinks Royal Blood.</p>
<p>However, I’m not too sure on the Vampire Servants, because the Vampire will be caught the night after. But when killing the King, I feel that it should only bypass night immunity and heal immunity, allowing for Knights to still protect the King, but not letting a King use Guards on himself.</p>
<p>Also, this class doesn’t feel like a Neutral Killing, it’s more like a Neutral Offensive.</p>

            <p>I guess I did not explain it well enough.</p>
<p>The passive “Noble” is the same as the one Prince and Butler  etc. have.  It just makes him “Royalty” so that he can step up first when a new King has to be voted. So he would step up along with Prince, Princess, Butler, Drunk  etc. etc.</p>
<p>Also yes, the people that have been bit would realize that they have been bit on the day where they have to vote for a new King. Because on that day, they will automatically be forced to vote for the Vampire. For that reason, I explained that they will also be MUTED for that day. Means they will KNOW who the Master Vampire is, but they won’t be able to talk for that day. Just as if they had been reaped or chilled. The following day they can talk again. So the Master Vampire has to be a bit clever on WHEN he assassinates the current King and how he gets rid of the remaining BD that know about him the following days FAST.</p>
<p>He is just like the Sorc. He will work with Unseen/Cult. The Inquisitor could be his counter part. Would also make Inquisitor a bit more interesting since at game start you won’t know who you are up against. Sorc or Vampire.</p>

<p>This is Royal Blood. I do not understand how a Vampire should have Royal Blood. I believe because his win-con is so easy that he should have to Drink Blood from a Royal Blood character to become Royal-Blooded as a nerf and for lore. How about:</p>
<p>Passive 1 - Blood Transfusion - If you have drank blood from a Royal you will become Royal Blooded permenantly.</p>

<p>Too easy to confirm that the Master Vampire became the King. “Everyone talk. If someone doesn’t talk then they were forced to vote for the Master Vampire.” It’s a bit like Possessor jumping when there is a Psychic. You’ll also need to prevent them from voting.</p>

<p>This ensures that BD will not automatically confirm Royal Bloods. I agree with this.</p>
<p>Very interesting idea, you’ve just got to fix some errors with it. I will be very curious if you fix these points and rework the “broken” abilities/passives.</p>

            <p>Would people know who the vampire master is when they are bit. Because they would have to vote for him as King and just realize that he is King. I also have an question about the passive “Noble” that allows you to become King before everyone else. Wouldn’t the drunk and princess get wary when they can step forward as King or how does that work?</p>
