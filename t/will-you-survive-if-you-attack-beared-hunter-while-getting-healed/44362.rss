            <p>No. It isn’t even the only time an ability interacted with someone who was prevented. Survalence reports who it prevented for example and if they are Unseen.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Summon a bear to protect you from all attacks at night. The attackers will be dead in the morning (Bypasses night immunity). You will be death and conversion immune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says nothing about prevention … Hope a dev can clear this up for me because I’m confused</p>

            <p>It is very clear that it is Prevention. I see no reason why night immunity piercing should matter.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t seem right, my situation happened after that patch. So it still is just a prevent against normal attacks, not by pass night immunity.</p>
