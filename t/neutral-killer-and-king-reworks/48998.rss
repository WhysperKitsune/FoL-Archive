<p>As for the reaper, I think editing reaped people’s logs would be too powerful, I think just being able to read them would be enough since it would help you fake claim easier, and you could even make a believable obs claim.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually being able to read someone’s logs early (without editing them) is borderline useless. You only have access to hidden Information for 1 night at most and people also would know that you do.</p>
<p>Editing logs makes it harder to discover the existence of a reaper while also giving you a way to deal with someone who knows who you are (chill them and then reap them). It makes Reaper more interesting much like what facelift did for poss.</p>

            <p>I really like Sorc/Inq rework. As for the reaper, I think editing reaped people’s logs would be too powerful, I think just being able to read them would be enough since it would help you fake claim easier, and you could even make a believable obs claim.</p>
<p>Also I do not think fool king would work unless something is changed. You can get rid of the fool by letting a prince, knight or hunter kill him, or even just ignoring him, but if you get a fool king you are stuck with him unless you have a butler. And you cant really ignore him because he has too much power as the king.</p>
