    <title>Utilization of the Steam Community Market, and Steam User Inventories</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/utilization-of-the-steam-community-market-and-steam-user-inventories/456</link>
    <description>Well, my thing is: Why make your own trading system, when you can utilize an already in place popular market? On top of that, if you utilize the Steam Inventory system, you (the developers) can set Item&#39;s to nonmarketable &amp; nontradeable (for items such as the Kickstarter exclusive armor and sword, heck you could probably even use it to assign the Kickstarter role/rank to a steam profile to verify it&#39;s them.. like you know, so no one gets any funny ideas and starts selling their account, or being hacked by someone)

And considering Throne of Lies is going to be a game on Steam, might as well, right?


Some links relating to this topic:
1. An item store to purchase the gold, or skins. http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/ (&lt;--- an example of how it could also be used)
2. https://dev.doctormckay.com/topic/332-identifying-steam-items/

Images: http://image.prntscr.com/image/1c084161bbd04941a4ba7b76d87657ec.png (Example of a game that does this already, many games do it, because it&#39;s a good way.)

Let me know what you think below.</description>

I actually get two different answers for this, one being 15k, and the other being a way-more whopping 781 million. But anyways, either way- of those two numbers,  about only 70 games actually UTILIZE this feature, that’s a whole niche being underly used.</p>

            <p>well, steamworks (steam development) has snippet’s of code and examples how to use these function’s so it probably isn’t to much of an issue for Bos and xBlade, but for one person it’s a bit of a headache to get inventory to work right. At least for me. I’ve played around with it some.</p>
<p>but steamworks development is awesome.</p>

            <p>Well, my thing is: Why make your own trading system, when you can utilize an already in place popular market? On top of that, if you utilize the Steam Inventory system, you (the developers) can set Item’s to nonmarketable &amp; nontradeable (for items such as the Kickstarter exclusive armor and sword, heck you could probably even use it to assign the Kickstarter role/rank to a steam profile to verify it’s them… like you know, so no one gets any funny ideas and starts selling their account, or being hacked by someone)</p>
<p>And considering Throne of Lies is going to be a game on Steam, might as well, right?</p>
<p>Some links relating to this topic:</p>

<li>An item store to purchase the gold, or skins. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/</a> (&lt;— an example of how it could also be used)</li>
