    <description>Well now, welcome to the ninth game of Blood on the Forums, hosted by me, myself and I, Amelia. This time, we seem to be invaded by a peculiar sort of foe, infiltration from inside the Town itself! Also we seem to be harboring a princess from another realm as well.

[details=”Character List”]
This game will be running an entirely custom script, this time with a few new characters, some of whom may strike fear into a player&#39;s heart, while others bring a saving grace to the ailed Damsel or dying out town. Old and new shall mix together here.

Townsfolk:
[color=29b6f6]**Pixie**[/color]: You start knowing an in play Townsfolk. If you are &quot;mad&quot; that you are this Townsfolk, gain their ability when they die.
[color=29b6f6]**Bounty Hunter**[/color]: You start knowing 1 evil player. If this player ever dies, you learn another that night. [One Townsfolk starts Evil]
[color=29b6f6]**Sailor**[/color]: Each day, choose a player; either they malfunction until dusk, or you do. You cannot die. You act on the first night as well.
[color=29b6f6]**King**[/color]: Each night, If the dead outnumber the living, learn 1 alive character. The Demon knows who you are.
[color=29b6f6]**Balloonist**[/color]: Each night, you learn 1 player of each character type until there are no more types to learn. [+1 Outsider]
[color=29b6f6]**Fortune Teller**[/color]: Each night, choose 2 players. Learn if either is a Demon. There is a Good player who registers as a Demon to you.
[color=29b6f6]**Oracle**[/color]: Each night*; learn how many dead players are Evil.
[color=29b6f6]**Lycanthrope**[/color]: Each night*; choose a player, if Good they die, but they are the only player that can die tonight.
[color=29b6f6]**Pacifist**[/color]: Executed Good players might not die.
[color=29b6f6]**Tea Lady**[/color]: If both of your alive neighbors are Good, they can&#39;t die.
[color=29b6f6]**Huntsman**[/color]: Once per game, at night, choose a player. The Damsel, if chosen, becomes an out-of-play Townsfolk. [+the Damsel]
[color=29b6f6]**Amnesiac**[/color]: You have an ability created by the Storyteller, but don&#39;t know what it is. Each day, you may publicly declare you are visiting the Storyteller, then attempt to guess what your ability is; you learn how close you were.
[color=29b6f6]**Choirboy**[/color]: If the Demon kills the King, you learn who the Demon is. [+the King]

Outsiders:
[color=29b6f6]**Sweetheart**[/color]: If you die, 1 player malfunctions from now on.
[color=29b6f6]**Heretic**[/color]: Whoever wins the game will instead lose the game, and whoever loses the game will instead win the game, even if you are dead.
[color=29b6f6]**Drunk**[/color]: You think you are a Townsfolk character, but the ability that you think you have instead malfunctions.
[color=29b6f6]**Saint**[/color]: If you die from execution, your team loses.
[color=29b6f6]**Damsel**[/color]: All Minions know you are in play. Once per game; a Minion may publicly attempt to guess your identity, if they are correct, your team loses.

Minions:
[color=red]**Boomdandy**[/color]: If you are executed, all but 3 players die. After 6 hours, the player with the most votes then dies.
[color=red]**Pit-Hag**[/color]: Each night*, choose a player and a character they become (if not in play). If a Demon is made, deaths tonight are arbitrary.
[color=red]**Devil&#39;s Advocate**[/color]: Each night; choose a player (not the same as last night); if executed tomorrow they don&#39;t die.
[color=red]**Poisoner**[/color]: Each night, choose a player; they malfunction until dusk.

Demon:
[color=red]**Lleech**[/color]: Each night*, choose a player, they die. You start by choosing a player; they malfunction and you die if and only if they are dead.
[color=red]**Fang Gu**[/color]: Each night*, choose a player; they die. The first Outsider this kills becomes an Evil Fang Gu and you die instead. [+1 Outsider]
[color=red]**Vigormortis**[/color]: Each night*, choose a player, they die. Minions you kill keep their ability and cause 1 Townsfolk neighbor to malfunction. [-1 Outsider]


[/details]
[details=&quot;Town Composition&quot;]

This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the standard composition of the game at each possible player count.

Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons
5: 3/0/1/1
6: 3/1/1/1
7: 5/0/1/1
8: 5/1/1/1
9: 5/2/1/1
10: 7/0/2/1
11: 7/1/2/1
12: 7/2/2/1
13: 9/0/3/1
14: 9/1/3/1
15: 9/2/3/1

Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Magicians at the start, for example).

Certain characters may contain parts of their ability which modify the game setup; some add character types (and subtract others to compensate), while others change elements of the game entirely. Be sure to take notice of these. You’ll find them in [square brackets], like those ones.

[/details]
[details=&quot;Phase Length&quot;]

Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.
12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.
12 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.
24 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.

The night phase will last for no more than 24 hours. If all relevant actions have been submitted and processed, Storytellers reserve the right to begin the next day early. 
[/details]

[details=&quot;Storyteller&quot;]

The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.
[/details]

[details=&quot;The Fabled&quot;]
The Fabled aren&#39;t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters can be found below.

**Angel:** Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.
**Buddhist:** Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.
**Doomsayer:** If more than four players live, each living player may publicly invoke the Doomsayer once per game to cause a player of their own alignment to die.
**Fiddler:** Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.
**Hell’s Librarian:** Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.
**Djinn:** The two specified characters cannot both be in play, however Evil knows which ones are. Or, the Djinn&#39;s special rule is in play instead, known as a &quot;jinx.&quot;
The following Fabled character must be added before the game begins; please speak to the Storyteller if you wish to see it added.
**Revolutionary:** Two neighboring players are known to be the same alignment. Once per game, one of them may register falsely.
[/details]
[details=&quot;Scum Info&quot;]

On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.


[/details]

[details=&quot;Malfunctions&quot;]

The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the character is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning character’s ability simply does not have any effect.

[/details]

[details=&quot;Nominations and Voting&quot;]
Once the discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will formally announce the opening of the nomination phase. Players must be nominated before they may be voted on that day. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day.
When a nomination is opened, the storyteller begins to track votes for that nomination. The players may precast votes, but the votes will lock in a clockhand format. Starting with the player below the nominee on the list, and working downwards, the votes will be locked if they are cast. As an example, take the following five players;
&gt; Alex
Brianna
Cameron
Derek
Ellen

Brianna is nominated. Cameron’s vote will be locked as soon as he places it, because he is the first person below Brianna on the list. Derek may cast his vote before Cameron, and may alter his vote if Cameron has not yet voted, but once Cameron has voted and had his vote locked, Derek’s vote will be the next to lock, and if it is placed when Cameron’s vote locks, then Derek’s vote will lock as the vote cast by Derek at that time.
Any votes that are not cast by EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players (not half+1, that&#39;s an important distinction), and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. If there is a tie between two or more players for the highest count of votes, the day will end with no execution. The Storyteller may only declare an early end to voting if it is no longer possible to tie or exceed the highest nomination.

[/details]
[details=&quot;Whispers&quot;]

Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Whispers to your neighbors (those seated next to you) do not have to be announced. Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper.

[/details]

[details=&quot;Death&quot;]

When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of the game. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.

[/details]

[details=&quot;Victory&quot;]

Good wins by eliminating all Demons (Minions do not necessarily need to die for Good to win, but eliminating Minions can be helpful). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (irrespective of either player’s alignment). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain class abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the class list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win simultaneously), Good wins.

[/details]


[details=&quot;Jinxes&quot;]
With this specific set of characters, comes 3 jinxes this time.

Pit Hag + Damsel - If the Pit-Hag creates a Damsel, the Storyteller chooses who the new Damsel is.
Pit Hag + Heretic - A Pit Hag cannot transform a player into a Heretic.
