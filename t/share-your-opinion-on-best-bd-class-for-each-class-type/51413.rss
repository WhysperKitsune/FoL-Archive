    <description>I was just curious what people are thinking about that.
_My own list -_

**Killer:**
Definitely Prince. But it&#39;s too obvious and he&#39;s Unique on top of that.
If we wouldn&#39;t count Prince, it&#39;s up to Hunter vs Knight.
And this might shock you, but i think Knight is better than Hunter.
Why?
Because: A good, not throwing Knight can CS _as much as he can,_ while Hunter is limited to 2 uses that has 1 day break from actual death and on top of that his attack _can be healed._
Also, Knight have basically a slightly worse bear that has _unlimited uses_ and can be casted on anyone. The downside is however that after two successful guards you&#39;re killed. But, let&#39;s be honest... Has anyone ever striked two people down with two different bears?
However, Hunter has Retribution which can be sometimes really important for BD.
Also Knight claims are really tough to confirm these days and BD is just going &quot;Knight claim? EXECUTE!&quot; But any reasonably thinking BD won&#39;t follow that thinking.
_**My winner for Killer: Knight**_ (Not counting Prince)

**Offensive:**
This is a pretty easy one. As for now, we have only 2 Offensive classes for BD. _The Drunk_ and _The Butler_.
Many people will say that Drunk is better, and i have to agree with that.
Drunk, just like Butler, can &quot;Occupy&quot; people and prevent them from taking action that night. In case of Drunk, he just takes the effect of choosen guy on himself. _This can out potential evil killers, like Assassin, CL or Reaper._ Butler can only prevent them from taking action; Drunk would already know it&#39;s a Killer in that case. Drunk can also _Happy Hour_ someone to make  100% sure he&#39;ll take no action that night, even if he&#39;s immune to occupation - Very powerful if used correctly.
However, Butler has higher survivability than Drunk thanks to his _Concentrated Wine_ (Party), allowing him to prevent Killers from killing him, or not be converted into a lose.
Butler have also _Nightshade Wine,_ which can be powerful if you suspect King of being evil but you have to execute someone else on stand.
_**My winner for Offensive: Drunk**_

**Investigative:**
Oh boy. Four candidates. Princess, Sheriff, Paladin and Observer.
Let&#39;s start with Princess:
Her _Flirt_ can easily confirm other people&#39;s claims; A guy is claiming Alchemist but is Killer/Offensive? Out them! This is probably NK! (Or a framed fool...)
Her _Will O&#39; Wisp_ can confirm Princess and other people&#39;s claims on top of that. You can also bait attackers into killing you while you wisp confirmed BD/King, successfully outing them. 
People seem to not like playing Princess and they think she&#39;s kinda useless. But i have to say that i do enjoy playing Princess much more than Sheriff or Paladin and i think she&#39;s useful.
Sheriff and Paladin: Two different factions, both work almost the same.
In case of Sheriff, he can only _Investigate_  people to look if they&#39;re _Unseen._ He can also _Scout_ people to see if they got converted. Considering MM is showing up as BD first three nights, Sheriff can be kind of a pain to play; Especially considering Scout is useless most of the time, since MM is converting only once at the start and you&#39;re probably not gonna get a scout off N1.
Paladin, on the other hand, can&#39;t see if people are converted. _But he can Kill CL with Smite._ This can be very powerful and if Pally is lucky enough, he can end Cult even N2. It happens rarely, but it&#39;s possible. Unlike MM, CL isn&#39;t hidden first three nights so it&#39;s not that bad too look for Evils as Paladin. I find myself finding much more Evils as Paladin rather than Sheriff. Cult is also more conversion-based, meaning Paladin can find much more evils, since Cult can have four members at the same time, that are always visible to him. (Unless Cult has Ritualist.)
Observer:
My personal favourite. His _Follow_ is in my opinion the strongest ability in game. Being able to see who a guy visits and who visits them is very powerful, since it can out basically everyone, if Obs plays well. With his simple _Follow_ he can out _Conversions,_ _Killers,_ _Fake Claim,_ _Evils_ and probably much more. If Obs is lucky and plays correctly, he can carry the game, without even using _Peeks,_ that work exactly the same like old King&#39;s checks. Peek is also very strong, but imho **Follow &gt; Peek**
_**My winner for Investigative: Observer.**_

**Social:** 
Two candidates. Psychic and Noble.
Many people would pick Psychic without even thinking. But i&#39;m gonna say &quot;No&quot; to that, and i&#39;ll say that Noble is better.
Psychic can link people at night to learn their claims and write them in logs. He can also speak to the dead, allowing him to out potential Possessor or Evils, that dead has deduced the time they died.
He can use his _Telepathy_ at day to out the people dead said are evil. He can also hide his whispers from others, if that has any use...
Noble, on the other hand, has a very powerful voting game - he&#39;s basically a second king. If king is evil and you&#39;re in tough situation, Noble can cancel out King&#39;s finger allowing you to stall, or just get a free vote on your side. He can be the deciding vote to Execute or Pardon the person on trial. He has Royal Blood on top of that, allowing him to become king before any other sus claims. His Spy allows him to hear a choosen person&#39;s Whispers; a good tool to get claims for yourself, to then _Snoop_ sus people&#39;s logs and see if they have anything useful in them. Snoop is very powerful and should be used to it&#39;s full potential.
A single spy can also out evils, like EK and MM whispering with eachother or MM claiming to his Merc. 
_**My winner for Social: Noble**_

**Support:**
The last class type. Two candidates, as well: Physician and CW.
It&#39;s pretty obvious, who&#39;s the winner here. But let&#39;s talk about them anyways.
CW can _Magic Barrier_ someone to protect them from negative effects, like _Conversion,_ _Occupation,_ _Mind Warp_ etc.
MB can be very powerful if Evils still have MM or CL; you can prevent them from getting a member for their team. You can also barrier a confirmed Physician/Alchemist to make sure they won&#39;t be occupied by Invoker or Servant, so they can heal the poisoned/bled target.
Tornado can be used to swap two people. I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s the exact use for it since it mostly kills BD rather than help, but it can at least confirm CW.
For Phys, he can heal and revive a dead member to protect BD. Pretty straightforward.
I think that we all know who&#39;s the winner for this class type.
_**My winner for Support: C... Physician**_


So, i already wrote a lot about my thoughts on best BD class for every class type. Now, i wanna hear YOUR opinion with reasons WHY you think this class is the best for the certain class type.
Thank you for answers.

(Holy, i really did write a lot.)</description>

            <p>Killer: Prince &gt; Hunter &gt; Knight.</p>
<p>Prince is obvious. Knight is great and all but hunter does the job that BD Killer is supposed to do better (that job being leading and putting pressure on others).</p>
<p>Offensive: Drunk. His main ability is just better in every way and HH is great at locking down scum power classes late game when they are about to swing the game.</p>
<p>Invest: Observer &gt; Sheriff/Pally &gt; Princess. Obs is by far is the strongest. He can’t be CCed, he can get info on lots of players at the same time and he can find neuts reliably. Sheriff is great late game where everyone is a convert, Princess has her uses but its not really accusing usually so she is less important.</p>
<p>Social: Psychic, getting a claim every night is better than getting a more detailed claim on some nights without them knowing.</p>
<p>Support: Physician. Already a million posts about why.</p>

            <p>Court Wizard is <em>way</em> better than you give it credit for, but at the moment Physician wins because it’s buff as hell.</p>
<p>Otherwise I pretty much agree with your list, although as others have pointed out Hunter makes a very strong case for itself with confirmable abilities, and Princess is also really really good.</p>

</aside>
<p>I dunno, maybe in lower skilled games, I push for and demand logs the second someone says their class publicly and volunteer it myself. the risk to BD is the claim to begin with, if they’ve already taken that hit of outing themself, there’s no reason not to get their logs as well and compare them to your own notes to either spot their own lies, or combining it with what you know may catch an evil if they are BD. There’s no sane reason to have a claim without logs to accompany it, the risk part is in the claim, the utility is in the logs. Why on earth would someone accept the risk without the benefit.</p>

            <p><strong>Prince &gt; hunter &gt; knight</strong><br>
well hunter can use bear and become unconvertable, and wolf alcn/phy to confirm them.<br>
I do think that knight is underated, if you know how to use cs well its very good.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic &gt; noble</strong><br>
Well in late game noble can help, but noble have no way to use his votes.<br>
A good psychic can lead bd to victory with talking to the dead and getting claims.</p>
<p><strong>Pally &gt; observer &gt; sheriff &gt; princess</strong><br>
I think observer have better ways to find MM in unseen games, and if you find mm early you usully win. in cult games I find paladins more usefull with the new smite ability. 1 point: observer is more usefull in unseen games then pally in cult games.</p>
<p><strong>physician&gt;CW</strong><br>
Because of Dk mostly</p>
<p><strong>Drunk&gt;butler</strong><br>
Better at everything besides party</p>
<p><strong>Overall rating:</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>ass type. Now, i wanna hear YOUR opinion with reasons WHY you think this class is the best for the certain class type.</p>
<p>Thank you for answers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>my opinion,</p>
<p>Hunter &gt; knight, because regardless of how good knight is, I do fall into the category of what you’d consider bad players that think execute the knight claim regardless. At least if he hasn’t killed anyone bad when it comes up. Hunter is mostly a terrible fake claim because it’s unique, and can kill anyone that CC’s him. As 70% of the classes in the game are semi or fully confirmable. knight falls into that tiny window of classes that evils can claim and nobody can tell one way or the other. meaning even if you kill a knight claim, and it’s a knight, you’ve crushed any claimspace for the assasain, NK MM or CL.</p>
<p>I hands down agree drunk &gt; butler, more or less same reasons you gave, he can confirm 100% if he occupied a reaper or assasain</p>
<p>Observer I hands down give the victory in investigative… in terms of BD, unfakability &gt; anything else. and observer is truely impossible to fake if bd isn’t totally idiotic (any competent BD should execute any observer that window peaks n1-2, and any competent bd should call out any missing visits if they visited anyone the observers log claimed to have visited.</p>
<p>Princess I’d give second, again same reason. Whisp is an amazing confirming ability. and I still hold to it, proving yourself &gt; finding anything. BD can win quite easilly by eliminating the unconfirmed classes.</p>
<p>Sheriff/pali - sure they are the strongest investigators at finding cult/unseen… but it’s their word vs their competitions word. Super easy to fake.</p>
<p>CW vs phys… I’d honestly have to call that one a lot closer than it appears. CW’s barrier is probably stronger than healing, but because nobody knows (good or evil), we never really feel how often it screws over the opposition (even the unseen/cult doesn’t know why their conversion failed). Plus tornado is a strong confirming ability. As far as getting BD killed, I don’t really comprehend that arguement. unless you are moving targets that a knight is likely to charge. Otherwise you are more likely at worse changing which bd the unseen/cult kills. while also changing their odds of killing themselves from 0% to 10-40%. IMO CW is the most underated class in the game simply because nobody knows what heroics he does, not even himself or the unseen/cult he stops.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was just curious what people are thinking about that.<br>
<em>My own list -</em></p>
<p><strong>Killer:</strong><br>
Definitely Prince. But it’s too obvious and he’s Unique on top of that.<br>
If we wouldn’t count Prince, it’s up to Hunter vs Knight.<br>
And this might shock you, but i think Knight is better than Hunter.<br>
Why?<br>
Because: A good, not throwing Knight can CS <em>as much as he can,</em> while Hunter is limited to 2 uses that has 1 day break from actual death and on top of that his attack <em>can be healed.</em><br>
Also, Knight have basically a slightly worse bear that has <em>unlimited uses</em> and can be casted on anyone. The downside is however that after two successful guards you’re killed. But, let’s be honest… Has anyone ever striked two people down with two different bears?<br>
However, Hunter has Retribution which can be sometimes really important for BD.<br>
Also Knight claims are really tough to confirm these days and BD is just going “Knight claim? EXECUTE!” But any reasonably thinking BD won’t follow that thinking.<br>
<em><strong>My winner for Killer: Knight</strong></em> (Not counting Prince)</p>
<p><strong>Offensive:</strong><br>
This is a pretty easy one. As for now, we have only 2 Offensive classes for BD. <em>The Drunk</em> and <em>The Butler</em>.<br>
Many people will say that Drunk is better, and i have to agree with that.<br>
Drunk, just like Butler, can “Occupy” people and prevent them from taking action that night. In case of Drunk, he just takes the effect of choosen guy on himself. <em>This can out potential evil killers, like Assassin, CL or Reaper.</em> Butler can only prevent them from taking action; Drunk would already know it’s a Killer in that case. Drunk can also <em>Happy Hour</em> someone to make  100% sure he’ll take no action that night, even if he’s immune to occupation - Very powerful if used correctly.<br>
However, Butler has higher survivability than Drunk thanks to his <em>Concentrated Wine</em> (Party), allowing him to prevent Killers from killing him, or not be converted into a lose.<br>
Butler have also <em>Nightshade Wine,</em> which can be powerful if you suspect King of being evil but you have to execute someone else on stand.<br>
<em><strong>My winner for Offensive: Drunk</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Investigative:</strong><br>
Oh boy. Four candidates. Princess, Sheriff, Paladin and Observer.<br>
Let’s start with Princess:<br>
Her <em>Flirt</em> can easily confirm other people’s claims; A guy is claiming Alchemist but is Killer/Offensive? Out them! This is probably NK! (Or a framed fool…)<br>
Her <em>Will O’ Wisp</em> can confirm Princess and other people’s claims on top of that. You can also bait attackers into killing you while you wisp confirmed BD/King, successfully outing them.<br>
People seem to not like playing Princess and they think she’s kinda useless. But i have to say that i do enjoy playing Princess much more than Sheriff or Paladin and i think she’s useful.<br>
Sheriff and Paladin: Two different factions, both work almost the same.<br>
In case of Sheriff, he can only <em>Investigate</em>  people to look if they’re <em>Unseen.</em> He can also <em>Scout</em> people to see if they got converted. Considering MM is showing up as BD first three nights, Sheriff can be kind of a pain to play; Especially considering Scout is useless most of the time, since MM is converting only once at the start and you’re probably not gonna get a scout off N1.<br>
Paladin, on the other hand, can’t see if people are converted. <em>But he can Kill CL with Smite.</em> This can be very powerful and if Pally is lucky enough, he can end Cult even N2. It happens rarely, but it’s possible. Unlike MM, CL isn’t hidden first three nights so it’s not that bad too look for Evils as Paladin. I find myself finding much more Evils as Paladin rather than Sheriff. Cult is also more conversion-based, meaning Paladin can find much more evils, since Cult can have four members at the same time, that are always visible to him. (Unless Cult has Ritualist.)<br>
Observer:<br>
My personal favourite. His <em>Follow</em> is in my opinion the strongest ability in game. Being able to see who a guy visits and who visits them is very powerful, since it can out basically everyone, if Obs plays well. With his simple <em>Follow</em> he can out <em>Conversions,</em> <em>Killers,</em> <em>Fake Claim,</em> <em>Evils</em> and probably much more. If Obs is lucky and plays correctly, he can carry the game, without even using <em>Peeks,</em> that work exactly the same like old King’s checks. Peek is also very strong, but imho <strong>Follow &gt; Peek</strong><br>
<em><strong>My winner for Investigative: Observer.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Social:</strong><br>
Two candidates. Psychic and Noble.<br>
Many people would pick Psychic without even thinking. But i’m gonna say “No” to that, and i’ll say that Noble is better.<br>
Psychic can link people at night to learn their claims and write them in logs. He can also speak to the dead, allowing him to out potential Possessor or Evils, that dead has deduced the time they died.<br>
He can use his <em>Telepathy</em> at day to out the people dead said are evil. He can also hide his whispers from others, if that has any use…<br>
Noble, on the other hand, has a very powerful voting game - he’s basically a second king. If king is evil and you’re in tough situation, Noble can cancel out King’s finger allowing you to stall, or just get a free vote on your side. He can be the deciding vote to Execute or Pardon the person on trial. He has Royal Blood on top of that, allowing him to become king before any other sus claims. His Spy allows him to hear a choosen person’s Whispers; a good tool to get claims for yourself, to then <em>Snoop</em> sus people’s logs and see if they have anything useful in them. Snoop is very powerful and should be used to it’s full potential.<br>
A single spy can also out evils, like EK and MM whispering with eachother or MM claiming to his Merc.<br>
<em><strong>My winner for Social: Noble</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Support:</strong><br>
The last class type. Two candidates, as well: Physician and CW.<br>
It’s pretty obvious, who’s the winner here. But let’s talk about them anyways.<br>
CW can <em>Magic Barrier</em> someone to protect them from negative effects, like <em>Conversion,</em> <em>Occupation,</em> <em>Mind Warp</em> etc.<br>
MB can be very powerful if Evils still have MM or CL; you can prevent them from getting a member for their team. You can also barrier a confirmed Physician/Alchemist to make sure they won’t be occupied by Invoker or Servant, so they can heal the poisoned/bled target.<br>
Tornado can be used to swap two people. I don’t really know what’s the exact use for it since it mostly kills BD rather than help, but it can at least confirm CW.<br>
For Phys, he can heal and revive a dead member to protect BD. Pretty straightforward.<br>
I think that we all know who’s the winner for this class type.<br>
<em><strong>My winner for Support: C… Physician</strong></em></p>
<p>So, i already wrote a lot about my thoughts on best BD class for every class type. Now, i wanna hear YOUR opinion with reasons WHY you think this class is the best for the certain class type.<br>
Thank you for answers.</p>
<p>(Holy, i really did write a lot.)</p>
