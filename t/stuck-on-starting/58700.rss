    <title>Stuck on starting</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/stuck-on-starting/58700</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
The game was stuck on starting. I was with a live streamer, so when I checked the stream, it took a while for the starting screen to go away, but it eventually did. There were also a number of people with one of the default random names.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
For it to simply continue onto the name selection screen.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Start a game? I&#39;m not certain on the exact requirements.

#### Comments:
A side-by-side image of the stream and my game: https://imgur.com/a/ugD7g
Sorry about the darkness on the stream, I got the image in the middle of a transition and by the time I realised, the streamer lost internet connection. Also, no, I was not stream sniping, I only checked the stream when I realised nothing was loading. the stream was paused until then</description>
