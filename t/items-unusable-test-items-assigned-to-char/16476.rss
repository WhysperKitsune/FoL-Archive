    <title>Items unusable, test items assigned to char</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/items-unusable-test-items-assigned-to-char/16476</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Items have been bugged for me for a while. I bought the Pumpking and the coffin execute and I don&#39;t remember having actually ever seen them work. I bought the leather tunic armor a while ago and it worked for a bit. Right now my items show stubs. A sword named something like &quot;super long sword of blah blah&quot; with a Lorem Ipsum for the description.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should be able to buy and use items seamlessly

#### Steps to reproduce:
Log into my account and repro: yup459
