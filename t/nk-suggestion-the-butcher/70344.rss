    <title>[NK Suggestion] The Butcher</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/nk-suggestion-the-butcher/70344</link>
    <description>**The Butcher**
![Ironhead|257x499](upload://mO8ilDTfumVISIZnB4O5AqzFgSv.png)

* **Steel Behemoth (Passive)** - Immunity to occupation, redirection, bleeding, poison and death at night.
* **Unwarranted Provocation (Day - 2 Uses)** Force target player to target you tonight
* **Butcher&#39;s Wrath (Day - 2 Uses after N3)** Bypass any redirection or life immunity tonight
* **&quot;Self Defense&quot; (Night - Infinite uses)** Kill any players that target you tonight
* **Hidden Nightmare (Night - Infinite uses after N3)** Chose target player, kill all that target/defend them
* **Possible ability: Meet Your Maker (Night - Infinite uses after N3)** Only usable while jailed. If you were jailed and the Prince does not execute you, you may kill the Prince.
* Idea was from Shrimpy and I honestly like the concept
*Win Condition*
* Take down any who stand in your way

**Strategy** 
I would suggest imitating either a drunk or a butler. I haven&#39;t quite thought of a strategy to take out the prince but definitely use the Unseen/Cult to your advantage; Anyone they poison/bleed is your target for attempted mass murder

I have been thinking of a change for his Butcher&#39;s Wrath to make it so he also kills who he targets that night as a way to take out the prince and whatnot.
Let me know what you think</description>

            <p>But yeah I think this may be the NK that will have the most strategys to get players to visit you. This is a really off the wall idea but what if he had a troll box to maybe have the king tell people to check you tonight and stuff (Though it won’t fit with the lore of the class)</p>

            <p>Maybe he should have a way to attack players directly who may be redirection immune or don’t visit at all. Maybe add a Option to Hidden Nightmare to either kill all who visit them or kill the target player. The downside to killing a Player directly is you have less KPN potential but it allows you to kill valuable targets.</p>

            <p>The thing is that the reason you love sorc is because you love being a killer who wins with scum.</p>
<p>NK isn’t suppose to do that. Sorc defeats the purpose of NK and you might as well not add NK at all if your adding a NK that can win with evils (not complaining about your class complaining about Sorc being added)</p>

            <p>Please people. It’s not that hard. NK isn’t meant to win every time nor are they suppose to win with the evils.</p>
<p>They are suppose to be neutral and are suppose to be a balancing act. They are suppose to kill the unseen/cult when they are gaining numbers and BD at the beginning. Sorc isn’t a true NK. NK shouldn’t be able to work with scum.</p>

<strong>Butcher’s Wrath (Day - 2 Uses after N3)</strong> Bypass any redirection or life immunity tonight</li>
<li>
<strong>"Self Defense" (Night - Infinite uses)</strong> Kill any players that target you tonight</li>
<li>
<strong>Hidden Nightmare (Night - Infinite uses after N3)</strong> Chose target player, kill all that target/defend them</li>
<li>
<strong>Possible ability: Meet Your Maker (Night - Infinite uses after N3)</strong> Only usable while jailed. If you were jailed and the Prince does not execute you, you may kill the Prince.</li>
<li>Idea was from Shrimpy and I honestly like the concept<br>
<em>Win Condition</em>
</li>
<li>Take down any who stand in your way</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br>
I would suggest imitating either a drunk or a butler. I haven’t quite thought of a strategy to take out the prince but definitely use the Unseen/Cult to your advantage; Anyone they poison/bleed is your target for attempted mass murder</p>
<p>I have been thinking of a change for his Butcher’s Wrath to make it so he also kills who he targets that night as a way to take out the prince and whatnot.<br>
Let me know what you think</p>
