    <title>CW changes that might be good</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cw-changes-that-might-be-good/22451</link>
    <description>I have three options in mind:

--------------
-**Make CW a neutral survivor**
It&#39;s current abilities are great for one

-**Make CW a neutral evil**
Wants to see the blue dragon lose. Again, abilities perfect for it

-**Completely change CW**

&gt;**Day ability: Prepare spell**
Choose from your spell book a spell to have available to you tonight

the five spells (keep in mind you do not recover any uses of a spell when it returns to your spell book)

**Divination**
(1 use) Determine your target&#39;s faction and class type

**Abjuration**
(1 use) Cast a ward on 3 players, protecting them from all negative effects except death

**Necromancy**
(1 use) turn a dead player into a death knight

**Teleportation**
(1 use) make all the visitors of one player move to another (one way tornado, basically). 

**Fireball**
(1 use) send a fireball to kill a player. If they somehow survive the attack, they will start bleeding

credit to aldggerlen on discord for reminding me of this idea and mentioning fireball

basically, CW would choose one of these spells to cast each night. Each is good, but one use. lots of strategy.

if you have any other ideas for good but 1 use spells, suggest them here</description>

            <p>I was thinking the same</p>
<p>Maybe give CW’s abilities away though</p>

            <p>It is a mix of several other classes, which I’m not a big fan of (classes should be as diverse as possible)</p>
<p>But because all these spells are 1-time abilities, I wouldn’t be against it. However…</p>
<p>… not instead of the current Court Wizard! (he is awesome!)</p>
<p>So if it were to be a Mage, I would be fine with it. Also note that Teleportation is already a spell with a different effect. The Ritualist has it. I would rename it for the new class to avoid confusing.</p>

            <p>This is a brilliant concept… a neutral Wizard with many spells to choose from during the day to use during the night. Maybe even expand on it from 5 to maybe 8 spells. It’d be a blast to play that class.</p>

            <p>these were just my first ideas. they are in no way the permanent suggestion. They give the gist of the class</p>

            <p>The “prepare spell” thing is an interesting take, and I like where you’re going with it, but some of your spells should probably be tweaked. I’ll probably come back to this later, but I feel strongly that CW should be a viable claim, so let me think about this.</p>
