<p>You just wouldn’t be able to select reaped players with the mark ability. A reap on a marked player counts as a kill.</p>
<p>I’m not sure because I’m lazy.</p>

<li>It only has to see 3 targets die. If it finds, say, the Neutral Killer or The Assassin, it’s almost a guaranteed win by D6, if not sooner.</li>
<li>Why would it want to use stonewall? That is an ability heavily tied to the Sellsword, which is something people want out.</li>
<li>Does it or does it not lose it’s abilities after winning? If it doesn’t, how does it win?</li>
<li>How would reap kills work? Could it mark someone who is reaped and gain a mark, or would they have to mark them before they got reaped?</li>
<li>Possession kills. Since the player the Possessor possesses dies, would that gain a mark, or would it not?</li>
<li>What about people that suicide or die by being inactive? Do those count?</li>
<li>Can it mark the King?</li>
