    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Pyromaniac</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-pyromaniac/45719</link>
    <description>This is my attempt at making an indirect Neutral Killer for tol (based of the Arsonist from Tos)
Tell meh what you think

&gt; ## [color = orange]The Pyromaniac[/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color = gray]Neutral Killer[/color]**
**Firehexed (Passive)-** You are always firehexed. Immune to **Ignite.**
**1000 Degrees (Day) -** Burn somebody. They&#39;ll die tonight unless healed. -Infinite Uses (1-day cooldown)
**Impatient (Day) -** You will Ignite your next hexed target. (3 uses)
**Firehex (Night) -** Firehex a player. They will become death immune and appear as a Pyromaniac to investigators. -Infinite Uses
**Ignite (Night) -** Attack all those who are **Firehexed**. Bypasses death immunity. - Infinite Uses
_Kill all members of the main factions._

Changelog:
Changed **Impatient** from igniting the first to the next hexed target.</description>

            <p>It still wastes kills. If the unseen attacked a firehexed person, you just saved them for no reason and wasted unseen kill. That goes against your goals. Sure, you kill the same number of people but A: It is delayed, and B: You waste unseen kills. It’s not like if Possessor and Unseen kill the same person, that has one chance of happening. But if someone is firehexed for three night, Unseen are 3 times as likely to waste kill, as well as the Pyromaniac’s</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, why is this in the general category?</p>

            <p>The night abilities are essentially the same , otherwise this wouldn’t be not arsonist. :^)<br>
I can rundown each ability:<br>
<strong>Firehexed</strong> is this NK’s main form of death immunity. All Nk’s need one , or their gonna have a rough time. Immune to <strong>Ignite</strong> so he doesnt die when he uses it.<br>
<strong>1000 Degrees</strong> Just for some more direct killing. Keep in mind Phys, Alch, and Herb arent immune to this.<br>
<strong>Impatient</strong> Is the main method for direct killing, if else.<br>
<strong>Firehex</strong> Is the Pyro’s main form of deception. The targets of this ability will recieve 2 main characteristics of the Pyro , death immunity , and a class change to investigators. This means you wont also be immediately outed if you are attacked.<br>
<strong>Ignite</strong> is Pyros main ability. lets them all burn. &gt;:)</p>

            <p>Arsonist has one huge problem: The delayed kill. The odds are high one of your targets will be killed before you can do it, thus wasting your kill. Impatient helps, but I think the truth is that an Arsonist like class/role is just unworkable.</p>
