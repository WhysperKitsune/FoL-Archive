    <description>#### What happened?

Another physician reanimated a player Night 2, I reanimated the same player Night 3 with Orange Text confirming &quot;You reanimated (...)&quot;

Made one of the physicians logs look like a lie

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Shouldn&#39;t it, wouldn&#39;t it, make sense for second reanimation to fail? Or say already reanimated? Or anything to prevent misleading by game text.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Have two physicians reanimate the same player on consecutive nights

I.e., Physician A reanimate Night 2, Physician B reanimate Night 3.

Both say succeeded

#### Comments:

If this doesn&#39;t get changed that&#39;s a huge misunderstanding.

If it&#39;s left to be misleading that&#39;s a huge problem for the Physician class and balancing.</description>

            <p>You can’t have two different Death Knights at the same time, but if two Physicians reanimate the same player both reanimations work. If the reanimations were during different nights, the Death Knight’s abilities reset.</p>
<p>For example, PhysA reanimates a player as a Death Knight during Night 2. Then PhysicianB reanimates the same player as a Death Knight two nights later (Night 4).<br>
The rotting of the DK will reset (i.e. they will die on Night 7) and they will regain all uses of their abilities (i.e. they will have 2 Sacrifices and 1 Cold Steel regardless of what they used during the previous nights).</p>

            <p>I thought if there were two Physicians, only one of them could raise a Death Knight as it would make the other Physician lose their ability if they revived the same person. As well as that, pretty sure there can only be one DK in play until the other one had rotted.</p>
