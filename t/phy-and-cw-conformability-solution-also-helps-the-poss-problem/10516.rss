    <title>Phy and CW conformability solution (also helps the poss problem)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/phy-and-cw-conformability-solution-also-helps-the-poss-problem/10516</link>
    <description>Physician - Currently reanimate can be used to A: Give someone the ability&#39;s of a death night (this part is fine) B: Give an extra vote to BD (this would be fine on its own but it has indirect problems) and C: Can be used to confirm a phys (the main problem).

Phy being unconformable is important so that it isn&#39;t easy to create healing chains and so alchs have a fake claim too.

Solution: Make reanimate give a dead player the death nights ability&#39;s for the rest of the game (until they run out of uses anyway) but have it inform no one other than the chosen player.

Court Wizard - Currently barrier has the perfect amount of conformability. It can be coordinated but you can fake it reasonably well if you say you barriered no one or someone no one visited. The problem is that recharge is far too good at confirming himself especially if it works on king. The fact that he can confirm himself to someone isn&#39;t the problem but rather how easy it is.

Solution: Make recharge only work if they are out of at least one of thier ability&#39;s. This makes it harder to confirm himself easily because you need to wait for late game and unseen can easily kill the people you would refresh by then. It can still be powerful on classes such as hunter.</description>

            <p>Cw idea is great. If you are being pressed to use it you would have a way out.</p>

            <p>i think as well as being good for the game it also has a pretty cool characterful flavour to it .<br>
I am thinking of someone like the mountain in game of thrones. Protecting the queen but not really eloquently  arguing his point .</p>

            <p>So you are meaning that the death knight, should for all intents and purposes remain dead, untargettable, unable to talk, but able to protect and cold steel?</p>
<p>I like that actually, it gets rid of the “free confirmed BD” that can gather everyones roles etc…</p>
