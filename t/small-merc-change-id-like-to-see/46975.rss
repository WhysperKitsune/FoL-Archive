    <title>Small Merc change I&#39;d like to see</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/small-merc-change-id-like-to-see/46975</link>
    <description>In general, I have no problem with mercenary being a convertible class but I would like to see this one little change to him. Passive: On The Job - You cannot be converted while Guarding your target.

I go to guard my target on Night 1, get converted, only to find out they didn’t get the notification that I had stood outside their door. I did not have fun that game.

It’s also really awkward mid-game for this to happen as you have no way to prove you still the merc without using the Guard ability.

This is a repost that I put in the wrong category before.</description>

            <p>The notification should just be removed. If that’s implemented there is no need for this. Still wouldn’t hurt though.</p>
