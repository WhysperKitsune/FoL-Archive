    <title>The Topic of Sheriff and Paladin</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-topic-of-sheriff-and-paladin/35300</link>
    <description>I know there are a lot of people who talk about Sheriff and Paladin, and while it is useful to have a class hunt down one evil faction, I feel like each should have their own distinct places. They shouldn&#39;t both be trying to find their respective members. So my proposal is to set Sheriff as the pure investigative role and make Paladin an anti-conversion support role. How does this work? Well...


Sheriff and Marshal:
Keep all current Passives, and abilities (Includes Surveillance)

Expert Investigation will determine if a member is part of the Unseen or part of the Cult. No changes here.


but for Paladin, I think we should spice things up a bit.

Note: Silenced Status - For the Next Day and Night, you cannot use Day Abilities and Night Abilities.

The Paladin

Unique Blue Dragon Support

_**Passives**_

**Zeal:**
If you successfully smite someone and make them silenced, you will be immune to your next conversion. 

**Devout:**
Your voice cannot be tampered. All attempts of Icy Touch, Distract, etc. will fail on you.

_**Abilities**_

**Consecration:** (3) (Day)
Choose a target, prevent all day abilities from targeting them for that day and if they are affected by Icy Touch or Distract, cancel it.

Exceptions are Day Abilities that activate that night:
Prince&#39;s Imprison
Sheriff&#39;s Scout
And More

**Smite:** (Unlimited) (Night)
Protect someone from Conversion tonight. If the Mastermind or Cult Leader tries to convert them, you will smite them, causing them to be silenced.

The Templar

Unique Unseen Support

_**Passives**_

**Devout:**
Your voice cannot be tampered. All attempts of Icy Touch, Distract, etc. will fail on you.

_**Abilities**_

**Coercion:** (1) (Night)
Allow the Mastermind&#39;s conversions for that night to bypass the maximum number for the Unseen. If MM&#39;s conversion fails, then the charge for Coercion will not be lost.

**Dark Traitor:** (2) (Night)
Prevent all visits to a player except for the Mastermind.

**Consecration:** (3) (Day)
Choose a target, prevent all day abilities from targeting them for that day and if they are affected by Icy Touch or Distract, cancel it.


Exceptions are Day Abilities that activate that night:
Prince&#39;s Imprison
Sheriff&#39;s Scout

I would still like feedback if this would be ok for the current Sheriff/Paladin replacement.</description>

            <p>Oh ok, but it’s kinda like that theme where, the Paladin gets a Cultist, and then gets that BOOST, and then he’s filled with holy light and even more determination, and yeah… lol, ok, Zeal activates for 3 Nights after every successful Smite</p>

            <p>I feel like Zeal is too good. Maybe it should be for the next night or 2 and not affect Smites usages?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Oh yeah, forgot to mention, I had this on my Priest and Heretic class thread, the Consecration prevents day abilities that work during the day, so that means Prince’s Imprison and Sheriff’s Scout would work perfectly fine, as they activate during the night. And I’ll remove the accusing and voting part from the Silencing, and change it so it disables day abilities one day, and night abilities one night. And who knows, maybe someday, other classes could have Distract as well.</p>
<p>Now on the topic of Coercion, I know that it could become insanely broken, but the moment MM dies, or even the Assassin, the Templar loses the actual converter, or becomes the Assassin. So what if I set it so if the target is not converted that night, the Templar does not lose his only Coercion charge?</p>

</aside>
<p>Not sure how I feel about silencing, because there’s potential for a meta where you go through the list of players and get them to vote for someone to determine who the Mastermind/Cult Leader is. It’s also powerful in Cult games because you could prevent sacrifices from happening, but less impactful in Unseen games.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is absurdly powerful. Not only are Unseen classes powerful on their own because of the 3 member cap making this ability overloaded already, there’s no limit to this, so converting The Paladin early could result in a 5+ member Unseen late game! If anything, I would probably limit this ability to 1 use.</p>

            <p>And personally, I used to like it when Sheriff and Paladin could both spawn in the game, and it would help figure out which Evil faction was in the game, as it made the whole thing more mysterious, not knowing who you’re dealing with.</p>

            <p>Ok, I’m just trying to mess around with stuff and see what works. I saw in someone else’s thread about a Dazed Status. I think maybe that should be in place instead of Smite causing Bleed.</p>

            <p>Smite seems way too strong against MM. You have effectively won if you successfully smite once (1/12th shot at the start of the game). Not only have you prevented his conversion, you cause him to die in (1/2?) nights or effectively out himself. At the very least it should poison MM and bleed CL, but then MM still needs to coordinate with assassin in order to not have assassin poison during the day and out MM too. Paladin would probably receive a message that he prevented conversion as well, I assume, so it wouldn’t be hard to gain great suspicion on the MM.</p>
<p>I’m personally not a fan of not having any unlimited skill. This class cannot do anything after night 6.</p>
<p>You also need to create an unseen variant, which is hard to do, because this is centered around preventing conversion. If you’re the 3rd unseen member, I presume you want to aid conversion, which goes over the member limit.</p>
<p>I personally like having separate unseen/cult classes as it is, because it makes it harder for the neutrals like scorned/fool to claim these investigatives at the start of the game.</p>
