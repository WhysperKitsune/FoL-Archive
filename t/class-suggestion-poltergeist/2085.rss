    <description>Alignment: Neutral Killing
Goal: Kill all blue dragon, unseen/cult, and other neutral killers. You must be in your &quot;alive&quot; state at he end of the game to win.
Class type: Killing

Note: You lose as soon as you die from a lynching

**Passive abilities** 

**Death barrier** You only have access to the abilities that are labeled according to your state of life/death

**Exorcism** If you are lynched, you immediately lose and can no longer use any abilities (Like a normal dead person)

**Soul power** If you die with 0 uses of haunt and capture soul, you will gain a use of each

**Life night abilities**

**Transcend life:** (1 use) Kill yourself, you cannot be saved by any class.

**Capture soul** (2 uses) Kill target player. 

**Death night abilities**

**Haunt:** (1 uses) Kill target player. If target is guarded by knight, the knight will save them and not die.  Target player cannot be saved just because they are in the dungeon. 

**Possess** (infinite uses) take over a players body; they die, but you take over their name and body. You are alive again.When this body dies, it will show Poltergeist as it&#39;s class.

Lore: The previous king of adiart was a tyrant. For years the taxes were over 50 percent, and any word of dissent was met with the opposition being impaled by a metal rod through the mouth and out the anus, with great care to make sure they lived in this agony for as long as possible. It all ended, however, when the prince, who was initiated in a humanitarian secret-society, killed him. His own son. The king-to-be was met with open arms by the kingdom, and he established his society, the &quot;blue dragon,&quot; as the ruling class. The tyrant king from before was given a chance by the god of darkness, Corax, at vengeance.</description>
