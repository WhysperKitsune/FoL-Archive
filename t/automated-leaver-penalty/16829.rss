    <title>Automated Leaver Penalty</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/automated-leaver-penalty/16829</link>
    <description>Hey.

There should be an automated punishment for people who leave games in the middle of the match (while still alive). Implement a counter on each player which monitors the games that they have ditched. If they ditch more than 3 games within a seven day period, they are automatically temporarily banned (possibly for 12 hours) from playing the game. If the seven day period is surpassed without the 3 game counter being exceeded, the counter is reset back to 0.

This should substantially discourage the behavior of streamer worshipers.
Let me know what you think.</description>

<p>Yeah. Last game I had 3 people leave by day two: the Butler, Observer, and Prince. Needless to say the Blue Dragon got completely crushed. I can brush off one or two leavers, but when they ditch critical roles it completely ruins a 20+ minute game for everyone else.</p>

            <p>You been seeing the mass leavers too recently?  I really hate it when stream viewers try to rush in games that their favorite streamers are playing in and when they find out they didnâ€™t make it in the same room as the streamer they leave.</p>
<p>Also, the spoiled class players where they keep leaving until they play their favorite class; these guys are the worst!</p>
