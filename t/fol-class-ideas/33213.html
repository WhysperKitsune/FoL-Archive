          <p>These ideas are intended for <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-official-hub/1515">FoL</a>/DoL games and would likely require tweaking for regular ToL. I’ve probably made a few mistakes in relation to FoL rulings v ToL rulings, so feel free to point those out, and please make suggestions as I doubt many of these are balanced/good as is.</p>
<p>Things in <font color="red">red</font> I will most likely change later.<br>
Things in <font color="lime">green</font> have been changed.<br>
Things in <font color="cyan">cyan</font> may be changed depending on vote results.</p>
<p>Idea 1: <strong><font color="cyan">The vote remains tied, so no changes yet.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="#ffd0b6">The Masochist</font></h2>
<p><strong><font color="gray">Neutral Offensive</font></strong><br>
<strong>Traumatic (Passive)</strong> - If you are killed at night, your killer(s) can’t use any killing ability the next night, and lose an extra use of the ability they used to kill you if it has limited uses.<br>
<font color="cyan"><strong>Smokescreen (Passive)</strong> - You appear to be the class of your killer if you are killed at night. In the case of multiple killers, the class you appear as is randomised between them.</font><br>
<strong>Cover-up (Day)</strong> - If you are investigated tonight, you will appear to be a member of the Blue Dragon. - 2 uses<br>
<strong>Intervene (Night)</strong> - Get in someone’s way, making them target you tonight. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Death Wish (Night)</strong> - Mark yourself for death. Killers who attack you tonight or tomorrow night can’t be prevented from doing so, no matter what. (Bypasses all immunities including visit immunity, prevents all statuses that would stop them from attacking you like occupation or redirection, goes through target changing done by Court Wizard/Sage) - 1 use<br>
<em>Be killed at night.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Masochist better/more balanced with <font color="cyan"><strong>Smokescreen</strong></font> or is the following better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncertain Death (Day)</strong> - If you are killed at night, you appear to be a class of your choice. - Infinite uses, “set and forget” so you don’t have to redo it every day</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercenaries can’t have you as a target.</li>
<li>Both Cover-up and Uncertain Death can be used on Day 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea 2: <strong><font color="lime">Updated.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>
<font color="#c1ffb6">The Ranger</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h2>
<p><strong><font color="gray">Neutral Killer</font></strong><br>
<strong>Silent (Passive)</strong> - Immune to occupation and death at night, and your visits can’t be seen by Observers/Princesses.<br>
<font color="lime"><strong>Track Their Movements (Passive)</strong> - When you attack a marked target or they die to poison, you learn who they visited and who they were visited by (other than you) that night.</font><br>
<strong>Mark For Death (Day)</strong> - Target is marked for death. They are notified of this at the beginning of the night. Your attacks on them while they remain marked pierce night immunity. - 1 use, get it back if they die from any source<br>
<strong>Fury of the Wild (Day)</strong> - Poison (not Nightshade) your marked target, killing them tomorrow. <font color="lime">This poison can’t be healed by a Physician</font>. - Infinite uses, can only be used on marked targets that have lived two nights already<br>
<strong>Between The Eyes (Night)</strong> - Attack a targeted player. If they are marked, pierces night immunity. - Infinite uses<br>
<em><font color="lime">Kill everyone that does not need to survive as an objective.</font></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="lime">Note that Track Their Movements works if you attack them but fail to kill them due to healing or guarding, but won’t work if you fail to visit them altogether.</font></li>
<li>Mark for Death can be used Day 1.</li>
<li>Your mark use is returned regardless of how your target dies.</li>
<li>If your marked target is going to die to execution, you are able to mark a new target in the same day. To do this, you would choose a target in your PM thread while your target is on trial (before they are executed/pardoned), and if they are executed the mark would then be applied to that chosen target, so that it may be applied without dipping into the night.</li>
<li>Between The Eyes does not pierce healing or a Knight/Enforcer guarding your target.</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea 3: <strong><font color="lime">Entirely different now! (I didn’t want to colour the whole thing)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="steblue">The Merchant</font></h2>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Blue Dragon Support</font></strong><br>
<strong>Ear for Demand (Passive)</strong> - You know what players currently have items you have given them, and know when they are used.<br>
<strong>Wares For Sale (Night)</strong> - Select a target player. Dependant on that player’s class type, they receive an item that grants them a bonus night ability. Killer/Offensive classes receive Rope, Support/Social classes receive a Shield, and Special/Investigative classes receive a Magnifying Glass. You will know which item you give out. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Total Recall (Night)</strong> - All players who currently have items you gave them will lose them, and have their target changed to you tonight. - 2 uses, can only be used when at least 1 player has an item<br>
<em>Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="purple">The Swindler</font></h2>
<p><strong><font color="purple">Unseen Support</font></strong><br>
<strong>Ear for Demand (Passive)</strong> - You know what players currently have items you have given them, and know when they are used.<br>
<strong>Junk Dealings (Night)</strong> - Select a target player. Dependant on that player’s class type, they receive an item that grants them a bonus night ability. Killer/Offensive classes receive Rope, Support/Social classes receive a Shield, and Special/Investigative classes receive a Magnifying Glass. You will know which item you give out. Additionally, you can also choose to give them an item of poor quality, which will break when used and give incorrect feedback.<br>
<strong>Total Recall (Night)</strong> - All players who currently have items you gave them will lose them, and have their target changed to you tonight. - 2 uses, can only be used when at least 1 player has an item<br>
<em>Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abilities granted by <strong>Wares For Sale</strong>:<br>
<strong>Use Rope (Night)</strong> - Choose a player. You will tie them up, occupying them. - 1 use<br>
<strong>Use Shield (Night)</strong> - Choose a player. You will guard them from attacks. - 1 use<br>
<strong>Use Magnifying Glass (Night)</strong> - Choose a player. You will learn their class type. - 1 use</p>
<p>Incorrect feedback given by <strong>Junk Dealings</strong>’s poor quality items:<br>
<strong>Use Rope</strong> will fail to occupy their target, and  tell them that their target was immune to occupation.<br>
<strong>Use Shield</strong> won’t guard their target from attacks.<br>
<strong>Use Magnifying Glass</strong> will tell them their target was a random class type other than the one they truly are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abilities granted from items given out by Wares For Sale do not “time out”, allowing them to be used at any point in the game after getting them.</li>
<li>A player can only have one item at once, and can’t be given another one until they have used that one.</li>
<li>If a player attempts to use an item on the same night the Merchant/Swindler uses Total Recall, they will fail to use the item.</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea 4: <strong><font color="lime">Updated.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>
<font color="#ffd0d7">The Trickster</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h2>
<p><strong><font color="gray">Neutral Offensive</font></strong><br>
<strong>Slippery (Passive)</strong> - Immune to occupation and target changing.<br>
<font color="lime"><strong>Watchful (Passive)</strong> - You gain the permanent immunities of targets that you occupy.</font><br>
<strong>Set Trap (Day)</strong> - Create a net trap in front of a player’s door. That player will be occupied tonight, as well as any visitors. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Lure (Night)</strong> - Players who visit your first target will instead visit your second target. - <font color="lime">Infinite uses</font><br>
<font color="lime"><strong>Trip (Night)</strong> - Target a player. They are occupied, and if they had occupy immunity, it is disabled for the night. They will only receive a notification about losing immunity if they had occupy immunity to lose. - 3 uses</font><br>
<em><font color="lime">Survive to see the Blue Dragon lose.</font></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lure only works one way, so players who visit the second target will not visit the first instead.</li>
<li><font color="lime">Watchful can cause you to gain Death Immunity and Poison/Bleeding Immunity, but only by occupying targets who are permanently immune to those statuses (so for example, a target guarded by the King who is otherwise not death immune will not grant you death immunity).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Idea 5: <strong><font color="lime">Updated.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>
<font color="#d4717d">The Usurper</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h2>
<p><strong><font color="gray">Neutral Social</font></strong><br>
<strong>Forged Bloodlines (Passive)</strong> - Your forged documents allow you to put your name forward for nominations to become the next King as if you had Royal Blood.<br>
<strong>Tiebreaker (Day)</strong> - If someone with Royal Blood stepped up on the same day you did and you both received the same amount of votes, you can break the tie and become King by using this ability, however everyone will be notified. - 1 use<br>
<font color="lime"><strong>Brigade (Day)</strong> - The next vote cast on somebody who isn’t the King today will be secretly be changed to vote for the King instead of their intended target. - 2 uses</font><br>
<strong>Eliminating the Competition (Night)</strong> - Check if a player has royal blood. If they do, you will take it from them and they will be notified it has been stolen. - Infinite uses<br>
<em>Become King, then survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>
<font color="#d4717d">The Tyrant King</font> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:">
</h2>
<p><strong>Neutral Special</strong><br>
<strong>Pass The Torch (Passive)</strong> - If you die, a new King may arise.<br>
<strong>The Royal Finger (Day)</strong> - Your vote for today counts as 2 votes - 1 Day Cooldown<br>
<strong>Decide Fate (Day)</strong> - You may change the result of a trial - 1 use<br>
<strong>Guard! (Night)</strong> - Choose a player, they will not die tonight (Includes you) - 3 Uses<br>
<font color="lime"><strong>Intimidation (Night)</strong> - Target two players. Those players can’t cast votes tomorrow, but only they will be notified of this.</font> - 2 uses<br>
<em>Survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Usurper would use Tiebreaker by expressing interest in using if a tie occurs, rather than using it post-tie.</li>
<li><font color="lime">Brigade is revealed to have taken effect if their intended target reaches enough votes that it should’ve been majority, or if the King receives majority vote with the Brigade vote included.</font></li>

          <p>I’ll go role by role I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Masochist:</strong> Nightkill Fool is not an idea I agree with on any lever, but this would be almost too easy. If you get jailed, getting yourself executed should be the easiest thing ever. Hell, just claim Prince and you basically instantly win. Then, just to give a final middle finger to the Prince, you appear as if you were Prince when you die? Its supporting abilities are also really strong, as you can just go around the circle trying to find a killer you force to target you. Not to mention that this wastes at least two kills from whoever gets it. I would strongly object to this being added to FoL or ToL.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger:</strong> I’m not convinced that FoL needs <em>more</em> NKs. In fact, I’m pretty sure we need less. That being said, nothing here caught me as standout good or bad. A solid role. Fury of the Wild, however, isn’t likely to see a ton of play in my opionion. Whether that’s intended or not is up to you. It’s just that giving somebody a two-day notice that they will be poisoned, then poisoning them for another night on which they may be healed, doesn’t seem as worth it as constantly killing your marks. That win condition has to go though. Autowin on Day 4 isn’t great.</p>
<p><strong>Merchant:</strong> Not very versatile, yet easily confirmable. Pass.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrificer:</strong> Cult visitor kills? No thanks. Cult is decently balanced as-is, and way more Cult kills isn’t the answer. There’s a reason they become Invokers in the first place, and even though I’d be happy to see that change, I don’t think this is the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Trickster:</strong> “Cause X players to Y” is, as you can probably already tell, not a wincon I’m a fan of. However, a Trickster that plays their cards right can win Day 2. There also isn’t really a reason for this class to exist. It serves no purpose to either faction, and only really serves to piss off players trying to do something at night. Not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Usurper:</strong> I have always kind of liked the idea of a class that wants to be King. I’m not sure how I feel about it straight-up murdering the King. Preventing itself from being voted is also kind of iffy, but I see where you’re coming from with that one. I’d probably remove the insta-gib and add the Greedy’s doublevote power or something else that makes it more likely the King is deposed, rather than just letting it off the King itself. Personally, I’d have it reverse the result of Allies or something.</p>
<p>So I will admit that I have a mostly negative opinion of most of these classes. The Ranger and Usurper are the most promising ideas here, so I suggest you work on tweaking those.</p>
