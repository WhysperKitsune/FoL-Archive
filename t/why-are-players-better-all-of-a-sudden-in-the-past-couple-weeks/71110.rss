    <description>I&#39;ve been dying and losing a lot more in the past couple weeks.  I sign on one day and suddenly people see through 3rd grade strats that use to work 99% of the time.

            <p>I go on Throne of Lies at a time when there’s lots of regulars playing, you can expect BD to win more when there are regulars because they know the inside outs of the game better and they will roll BD more often than anything else.</p>
