    <description>As a BD you have 2 thing&#39;s you need to do.

1. Protect the prince

2. Find the MM/CL

The details depend on if it is unseen or cult.

# Protecting the Prince

To protect the prince you need to find him before the evils do and create a chain of protectives to keep him alive. That much is obvious but there are something&#39;s to keep in mind. 

1. Unseen and Cult are doing the same thing and they will convert to get invest classes to speed things up. If you are an invest then don&#39;t out yourself in public early on even if you found an evil. Executing an assassin won&#39;t slow them down and you will be converted.

2. Do not let possable Prince&#39;s to get on the stand. If someone is killer/offensive then you wisper. Occupy Immune? Wisper! Not talking? Wisper! If they don&#39;t respond then you can out them and they will already be prepared to talk. 

3. At the start finding Ally&#39;s is more important than finding enemies (other than NK). You need to coordinate your Ability&#39;s with others as soon as you can. 

# Finding enemy leaders

Unseen: Finding the Mastermind at the start of the game is nearly impossible. The only ways to do it is either an Alch outing his Immunity or a Butler doing it. *IF THE MASTERMIND IS FOUND BEFORE D4 DO NOT KILL HIM*. Instead have the Prince jail him until D4 and THEN you execute. Some things to keep in mind when finding MM

1. The Mastermind will be the one initiating busses. If someone seems to be getting very lucky as sheriff or finds an assassin early on as princess then try to check them after N4.

2. Unlike the other members the unseen will fight tooth and nail to keep thier MM alive. If anyone is only clear because of something an unseen member said no matter how much sense it makes you should check them.

Cult: The cult can be tricky but it can also be a bit simpler. I unlike with the unseen the cult leader can be found immediately and occupy immunity is not suspicious. If you find someone as cult you should get there claim. If it&#39;s a seeker/invoker claim then execute them. A Ritualist&#39;s claim will be similar to that of the CL and will thus be lumped together. Once found you should throw the CL in jail for the rest of the game until the rest of the cult is found. Things to keep in mind:

1. If you try to repeatedly jail a cult member other than the cult leader then they will be sacrificed. This is a good thing because it means you spend less time jailing the wrong member.

2. If someone was Occupy immune within 4 nights of a Ritualist existing then they might be cult. 

3. The observer is the best invest class for dealing with cult. Save your peaks for when you think you have found a cult leader. Once you found him you should out him for the Prince.</description>

            <p>A suicide button would solve the problem, as the outted mm will simply suicide before day 4.  But right now, the only way the mm has to help his team, is to leave the game… which is warnable…and I find it weird that a warnable act can even be considered as a good move.</p>
<p>also, another proble with this, is that bd will not have used any abilities. like Prince’s exe</p>

            <p>While I understand your strategy, I think a game can only be fun, if people do not use gamebreaking play, this is reason I suggested to add the suicide button to the evils classes.</p>
<p>A gamebreaking play is any play that cannot be countered by the informed minority. Such as occupied/jailing the assassin of a 3-man multiple times. which has the consequence of giving 3 nights of investigations to the bd without the fear of any convert or any kill. Sooner or later, you’ll be found. Hoverer, very few bd will use this (strategy) which is one, it’s abuse to me.<br>
For me, its your find the mm day 3, you execute him day 3, if you find assassin, execute him… its simple and probably the way the game is intended to be played.</p>
<p>In ToS, its a problem to play as evil, as the town will win more then 70% of every games, especially when townies employ a mass claim and jailor out day 1 Meta. as least in ToL, some classes are able to get ride of the prince, even when protected, like the sage and the enforcer.</p>
<p>Also, I find that players in theses games does not correctly embraces the disposability of the members of the unseen or cult, except the mm. SO it does not happen that often that the mm out members of the unseen.</p>

            <p>If you are BD you WANT to doom the MM’s team.</p>
<p>You should always assume that everyone will do the most effective strategy at any given moment and balance accordingly. There is a reason why MM is invest immune. There is a reason why he is night immune. There is a reason why he is occ immune but doesn’t show it. It is all to avoid this situation from happening most of the time. The replacement is so if he is random lynched D2 or something it doesn’t make the Unseen loose for no reason. If people specifically realize he is MM then that is not no reason.</p>

</aside>
<p>There has to be a reason why the MM is remplaced if it is killed before day 4.<br>
And considering how important the mm is to the Unseen, I view this idea as a gamebreaking play, for the sake of fairness, if you found the mm day 2, because he’s a phys who came as special invest or he claim alch but appear as bd, just execute him already.<br>
A single bad play by the MM will doomed his team… unlike the Cult leader who can be remplaced, the mm cannot be remplaced.</p>

<p>Unlike the other members the unseen will fight tooth and nail to keep thier MM alive. If anyone is only clear because of something an unseen member said no matter how much sense it makes you should check them.</p>

<p>Cult: The cult can be tricky but it can also be a bit simpler. I unlike with the unseen the cult leader can be found immediately and occupy immunity is not suspicious. If you find someone as cult you should get there claim. If it’s a seeker/invoker claim then execute them. A Ritualist’s claim will be similar to that of the CL and will thus be lumped together. Once found you should throw the CL in jail for the rest of the game until the rest of the cult is found. Things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you try to repeatedly jail a cult member other than the cult leader then they will be sacrificed. This is a good thing because it means you spend less time jailing the wrong member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone was Occupy immune within 4 nights of a Ritualist existing then they might be cult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The observer is the best invest class for dealing with cult. Save your peaks for when you think you have found a cult leader. Once you found him you should out him for the Prince.</p>
