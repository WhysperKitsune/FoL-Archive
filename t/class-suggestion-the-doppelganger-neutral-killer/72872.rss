    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Doppelganger (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-doppelganger-neutral-killer/72872</link>
    <description>[color = &quot;red&quot;] **The Doppelganger** [/color] :shield:
 **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer [/color]**
**Mutable Anatomy (Passive)** - Immune to death at night, poison and bleeding.
**Unstoppable (Passive)** - Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities.
**Disguise Self (Day)** - You will appear as the chosen class to Investigative abilities. Cannot choose King. Lasts until a new class is chosen. - Infinite uses
**Worst Nightmare (Night)** - Attack a player. If your current Disguise Self class is the same as the class of the player, this attack bypasses night immunity and cannot be healed or delayed. Otherwise it is treated like a normal attack. - Infinite uses
**Mass Confusion (Night)** - Cause all players targeting you to target different players instead, chosen at random. Bypasses redirection immunity. - 2 uses
*Must kill all members of main factions in order to win.*

-----
**Example of Disguise Self Usage**: The Doppelganger chooses Sheriff as his Disguise Self class. An Observer using Follow on The Doppelganger will obtain the correct information as usual, but if the Observer used Window Peek, The Doppelganger would appear to be a member of the Blue Dragon. If Worst Nightmare is used on a Sheriff, it will bypass night immunity and cannot be healed or delayed. Otherwise it is treated like a normal attack. This lasts until The Doppelganger chooses a different class with Disguise Self.

-----
One of the most challenging parts of playing Neutral Killers is coming up with believable logs. Non Killer/Offensive claims can easily be debunked by a Princess, most Knight claims are already suspicous, and most other claims can be un-done by Observers, Alchemists and Maids. Disguise Self enables a wider variety of seemingly valid class claims while Mass Confusion can arouse suspicion with unverified target changes or just getting other players killed. In return for these greater deceptive abilities, this class loses the ability to kill multiple players at once and its ability to bypass death immunity is more situational while still allowing the class to kill those players in order to win.

The class should be relatively easy to tweak balance-wise. Giving Disguise Self a cooldown or a limited number of uses can power down the class if it&#39;s too strong, or it can be given immunity to most occupy attempts and target changes if it&#39;s too weak.</description>

            <p>I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tips. As long as you think I should err in that direction, I might tweak this a little more.</p>

            <p>Things with NK. If you think it may be a tad too strong, add it anyway. Push it over the edge a little bit. Don’t go all in with attacking everyone in one night but usually it’s safe to make NK’s tad strong</p>

            <p>I was actually leaning toward occupy immunity but I was trying to err on the side of caution. Still, that kind of situational occupy immunity might be just enough to make the killing better while still making it so there’s some ability to disrupt attacks like there is with Reaper.</p>

            <p>It’s a nice NK cause it’s an anti claim NK, however we need to push it a little more. Maybe if you disguise as the same class then you also gain occupy immunity/redirect and aren’t seen as visiting. It may seem much, but NK’s are meant to be powerful</p>

            <p>Maybe. I don’t think it necessarily shows which NK is in the game because there are still abilities like Tornado and Debauchery, and if each player is sent to a different target it should muddy it up quite a bit. But that might still be a good change regardless.</p>

            <p>Agreed because people are still informed they were redirected. It slows down logs for a day and people know which NK is in the game. It’s weak for that reason. If people weren’t informed of redirection then it’s be an on par day ability.</p>

<p>This is the only thing I’m not 100% sure of, but I think you may be underselling the ability a bit, as it can both get players killed and basically make every player’s logs suspicious.</p>

<strong>Mutable Anatomy (Passive)</strong> - Immune to death at night, poison and bleeding.<br>
<strong>Unstoppable (Passive)</strong> - Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities.<br>
<strong>Disguise Self (Day)</strong> - You will appear as the chosen class to Investigative abilities. Cannot choose King. Lasts until a new class is chosen. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Worst Nightmare (Night)</strong> - Attack a player. If your current Disguise Self class is the same as the class of the player, this attack bypasses night immunity and cannot be healed or delayed. Otherwise it is treated like a normal attack. - Infinite uses<br>
<strong>Mass Confusion (Night)</strong> - Cause all players targeting you to target different players instead, chosen at random. Bypasses redirection immunity. - 2 uses<br>
<em>Must kill all members of main factions in order to win.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Example of Disguise Self Usage</strong>: The Doppelganger chooses Sheriff as his Disguise Self class. An Observer using Follow on The Doppelganger will obtain the correct information as usual, but if the Observer used Window Peek, The Doppelganger would appear to be a member of the Blue Dragon. If Worst Nightmare is used on a Sheriff, it will bypass night immunity and cannot be healed or delayed. Otherwise it is treated like a normal attack. This lasts until The Doppelganger chooses a different class with Disguise Self.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of playing Neutral Killers is coming up with believable logs. Non Killer/Offensive claims can easily be debunked by a Princess, most Knight claims are already suspicous, and most other claims can be un-done by Observers, Alchemists and Maids. Disguise Self enables a wider variety of seemingly valid class claims while Mass Confusion can arouse suspicion with unverified target changes or just getting other players killed. In return for these greater deceptive abilities, this class loses the ability to kill multiple players at once and its ability to bypass death immunity is more situational while still allowing the class to kill those players in order to win.</p>
<p>The class should be relatively easy to tweak balance-wise. Giving Disguise Self a cooldown or a limited number of uses can power down the class if it’s too strong, or it can be given immunity to most occupy attempts and target changes if it’s too weak.</p>
