    <title>[NK Fanmade Class] The Ghoul</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/nk-fanmade-class-the-ghoul/73216</link>
    <description>Ghoul    Neutral Killer    Killer/Offensive

Passive /Overpower: Attack whoever visits you to attack at night, _healing yourself and leaving_
_no will behind if they die_

Night ability /2 charges/ Chaos: Attack 2 players if you kill them both gain a &quot;**Blood Stain**&quot; charge

Night ability /Infinite charges/ Feast: Eat a part of a dead body leaving a mark on their name visible to the court the next day.
You gain a &quot;**Chaos**&quot; charge and you heal yourself

Day ability /0 charges/ Blood Stain: Choose a player, make them attack you at night. You are
immune to death that night

Day ability /2 charges/ Reassemble: Change one of your body parts with one of a dead body to gain
a charge of one of their night abilities at random.
(Makes late claims that match dead people suspicious)

Lore:

The ghoul is a living corpse that strengthens himself by eating dead bodies or replacing his
old body parts with them.
Striving for a complete and perfect body waits hidden, wishing for the strong to die in order to
eat them.

sorry if I wrote something wrong (I&#39;m not english º^º&#39;!) 

Been having a blast with your game, I have social anxiety that keeps me from playing
games with social interaction, so I decided to buy one that needs you to write in order to play
to tackle it and so far so good!</description>

<p>As seen with the Possessor in the past, losing out on abilities because of poor luck is very unfun.</p>
<p>I’d change it to <em>if you kill less than two players</em>, you get a charge of Blood Stain.</p>
<p>Also reduce the uses to 1.</p>

<p>I have no problem with this, mostly. You should not make it obvious to BD that the player was feasted.</p>
<p>I would remove the clause that it would make it visible to the rest of the court.</p>

</aside>
<p>Randomness is something that should never be on abilities. In addition, none of these abilities help it to win against the king in the late game. All neutral killers beside the sorc (who suffers for it in winrate) can kill the king late quite easily.</p>
<p>Here is my suggestion for a fix to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dead Men Walking (Day) -</strong> Your votes today will count as equal to the amount of players you have used Feast on + 1. <em>(1 Use)</em></p>

            <p>I have decided it’s too UP.and too OP at the same time.</p>
<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>Nerf the double kill to one use. That way their KPN is delayed slightly more but won’t be overly delayed.</p>
<p>Buff the second night ability to not announce to everyone that happened. It’s terrible when you get POE’d here.</p>
