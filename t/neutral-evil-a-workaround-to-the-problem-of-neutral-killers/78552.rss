    <title>Neutral Evil (A workaround to the problem of Neutral Killers)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/neutral-evil-a-workaround-to-the-problem-of-neutral-killers/78552</link>
    <description>Neutral Killers are, by no stretch of the imagination, Neutrals who kill. But not all Neutrals that have a Neutral Killer&#39;s Winning condition must be &quot;Killer&quot;, For example, a Butler-like Neutral &quot;Killer&quot; who is practically identical to a butler with the goal of a Neutral Killer. Well, it&#39;s clearly not a killer, nut it&#39;s a Neutral &quot;Killer&quot;.

I propose: Neutral Evil, a special title for Neutral &quot;Killer&quot; Wincons.

What currently changes: Nothing

What could change: Neutral Non-Evil Killers could be brought into existence, as well as Neutral Evil Non-killers.</description>

<p>Execute is powerful, but the ability to prevent an Occupy Immune Evil from attacking is more powerful, especially when you delay them from dying to ultimately kill them, to give others the time to find their other teammates.</p>

            <p>I think the basis for what a class does is what it’s inf(or highest)use night ability does.</p>
<p>CW has empower. a support ability</p>
<p>Sherrif, invest. an invest ability.</p>
<p>prince, execute. a Killer ability.</p>
<p>Ritualist, brotherhood. a support ability.</p>
<p>Mastermind, convert. a special ability</p>
<p>The only class i disagree with is pretender, which i think needs a rework in general, but fits better as neut invest</p>

            <p>Prince should be special.</p>
<p>He isn’t claimspace so having him not match NK doesn’t matter since they couldn’t claim him anyways if pressed. And the “but then Princess will always out K/O” applies the otherway too. This means Princess is less likely to out S/I.</p>
<p>If it’s really a problem then swap Offensive and Support for the Princess’s results and then buff the Princess with a day ability or something.</p>
<p>In any case the question you should be asking to determine type is not “what does this class do?” because all classes do more than one thing. But rather “what is this class’s function?”</p>
<p>For example while Butler does have a killing ability, his job isn’t to Kill but to hinder his target’s ability to act, thus he’s offensive.</p>
<p>Something to note is that Support is the inverse of offensive. In otherwords:</p>
<p>Heal target player = Support<br>
Heal the player your target attacks = Offensive</p>
<p>This is because nearly all support effects (with the notable exception of some empower effects) work by preventing a negative effect. However preventing effects is also what offensive actions do. The difference is that Support actions prevent actions ON the target while Offensive actions prevent actions FROM the target.</p>
<p>This is why Tornado is Support but Debauchery is Offensive despite both of them having identical effects.</p>

            <p>Both Knight and Hunter have an ability that can’t bypass DI (HM and CS) but have an ability that can (Guard and Bear) even though every NK can bypass both of those.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Princes only killing ability bypasses anything bar having a crown on your head.</p>
<p>Like I said, If Allies/Princess never existed - I’d say Prince should be Special. But because Allies <em>did</em> exist and Princess <em>does</em>, Prince really could only be killer. Now? Sure, K/O gives them leeway to being Offensive, but I still don’t see the argument that Prince is more Offensive than Killer.</p>

            <p>Hm?</p>
<p>So like… debbing a CW into the king, having them swap someone with the king, and have the Possessor string the king into somebody?</p>
<p>That’s such a ridiculously specific occurrence I almost don’t think it counts. But sure, Knight <em>can</em> kill the King if the stars align and you cross your fingers.</p>
<p>With that logic, Hunter could too.</p>
<p>But in any normal circumstances, none of the BD killers can kill king.</p>

<p>Inqs intended purpose is to investigate people and then stab them, although a lot of Inquisitors play Inq like a mini NK nowadays. The class is designed around being an investigative class with the power to kill their 3 heathens, though. I think Inqs design doesn’t work very well at the moment, but he still falls under Investigative by design.</p>

<p>I think Alch is in a weird spot <s>bring back JOAT alch</s> but still fits Support much better than Killer - especially when every Neutral ‘Killer’ class is… designed <em>only</em> to kill. Alchemist has heals, which are objectively support, and two bombs which I think are there to speed up the game for your own wincon. But you know, yolobombing alchs exist. Still, having two kills with your infinite use ability being heal doesn’t mean you’re a Killer class, just look at Chrono.</p>

<p>Prince is a BD killer because Prince has the ability to kill <em>anybody</em> (minus the king reee). Sure, Jail/noexe is inherently the most offensive ability in the game, but every BD killer has the ability to bypass death immunity and the only “killer” classes that can’t bypass DI are Assassin (bleed can, technically) and Possessor.</p>
<p>If Allies/Princess was never a thing I’d say Prince belongs to Special more than anything.</p>

            <p>When the King had the Allies ability, which allowed him to find the exact class type of a target, it made sense for the Prince to be Killer over Offensive so as to make there be more risk to just blindly outing a Killer finding. (It was still optimal, but.)</p>

            <p>Prince should be BD Killer as he has the ability to kill without a limit on his target. He has the ability to kill anyone in game, whereas Butler is limited to King ect.<br>
This is why I believe Knight is a killer and not support as well.<br>
I’m in support of Prince being either BD Special or BD Killer. No offensive though.</p>

            <p>And yes having the number of neutrals with a large amount of kill power being variable causes problems. Hence why the game was extremely swinging back when there could be 2 or 0 NK’s.</p>
<p>Inquisitor is already pushing it.</p>
