    <description>&gt; # **The Musician**
&gt; **Neutral Social** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; **Dissonance:** You are death immune to attacks from players that aren&#39;t Entranced.
&gt; **Harmony:** You are immune to occupation and redirection.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day:**
&gt; **Aria (2 use):** Anonymously announce a message to the court.
&gt; **Coda (1 use):** Force all Entranced players into the same trial decision as yours.
&gt; 
&gt; **Night:**
&gt; **Overture (inf use):** Entrance a player with your music. Frame them if they are BD, or disguise them if they are not. Cannot target the same player twice.
&gt; **Crescendo (2 use):** Entrance everyone who visits your target and replace their feedback with &quot;You were distracted by a Musicians Crescendo&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; *Win condition: Have at least 8 Entranced players by the end of the game.*

            <p>Interesting take. Alternative win condition neutrals are difficult to make, as they need to add something substantial to the game. Otherwise they feel like a basketball player at a football game.</p>
<p>I’ll repeat what others have said:</p>
<p>Aria doesn’t make a whole lot of sense for the role.</p>

</aside>
<p>Mystic is already not considered confirmed by telepathy, especially in a Cult scenario. Only Linking confirms in general.<br>
I don’t think this has a proper purpose.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wouldn’t it make more sense that players who <em>are</em> entranced cannot harm you?<br>
Also for Cultseen it’s bad if they attack you, but you have no real way to let them know. With Scorned you attack them and know they are DI, but can often deduce whether they are NK or not by their claim and actions.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I suppose this is mainly to pardon an individual that you haven’t entranced? It seems kinda weird to me. Also how would it be represented? Would you just click a decision and then click Coda and then a bunch of names suddenly voted/changed their votes and cannot reselect?</p>
<p>As you cannot vote during your own trial, you cannot use it to escape accusation.</p>
<p>I feel like people will catch on to a Musician’s presence if not already hit by a Crescendo.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The frame/disguise feels a bit tacked on just to have it make some kind of impact, but it doesn’t interact with you or your win condition. It makes Cultseen want you alive to keep them hidden and BD wants you out as you’re messing with their invests - like a Scorned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Crescendo (2 use):</strong> Entrance everyone who visits your target and replace their feedback with “You were distracted by a Musicians Crescendo”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Does this actually occupy or does it only change the feedback? So Killers will still attack their targets but they’ll just see this line of text instead? That means they get aware of the Musician’s presence and that they are Entranced, but not much else. Being Entranced can potentially become a liability later in the game when a Musician can choose the outcome of a trial, much like a King.</p>
<p>How does this work with Overture? Overture cannot target the same player twice, but can you Overture a player that has already been Entranced by Crescendo?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Win condition: Have at least 8 Entranced players by the end of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I suppose this doesn’t mean 8 living Entranced players? Otherwise you’re never going to win as Musician - at least not with evils.</p>
<hr>
<p>I cannot help but feel like this is a second Scorned, that is disinterested with the actual game.<br>
You have little interest to follow the actual game, and the frame mechanic is not incorporated with your win condition, so it’s just a tacked on mechanic.<br>
It also seems weird to disguise evils and frame BD. If the target is already Entranced through Overture, why do you care if they live or die? And if anything wouldn’t you want both types to live to have influence with Coda? Framing just makes people execute and makes the game faster in general, where the Musician needs time to Entrance players.</p>
<p>I must say I’m not particularly fan of this suggestion as it is.</p>

<p>claim musician d1 and get everyone to target king, using crescendo<br>
everyone abstains during a trial on d2 and musician uses coda and 50/50s where they are going in order to force scum to guess if they want to fakeclaim visited king</p>
