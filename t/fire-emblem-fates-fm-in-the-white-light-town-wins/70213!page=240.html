          <p>HTM (Townlean) – Sheeps on to votes sometimes, however his motivations seem to be townaligned. Working with Firekitten a lot so possible scum team but highly unlikely.<br>
Firekitten (Townlean) – Is actively scumhunting and pressuring Marcus who does not seem to be town. His actions with the new player were a little iffy and trying to out Corrin was suspicious, but his explanation satisfied me.<br>
Livicus (Slight Scumlean) – ‘In short, his entire posts from the start by asking for protective classes to visit him and then low-key asking for mass-claims just strike me as odd, and the odder thing here is Shurian just blindly defending him. During late d1 his posting started getting better, so I’m somewhat split on his own explanation that he’s just a tool d1 is correct or if he’s a real scum player attempting to correct their slips. Vulgard’s habit of defending him strikes me odd and I’d say if one flips scum, then there’s no doubt the other will as well.’ - Sarun<br>
MtheJoker (Slight Scumlean) – Inactive and defended Ashe who flipped Scum (‘I see Ashe is being voted, why?’) Could just be his inactivity however, and reluctance to jump on a bandwagon which could suggest Town. Possible ITA target.<br>
Margaret (Null) – Lots of shitposting, could be evil trying to slow the town down.<br>
Hippolytus (Heavy Scumlean) – All posts have been fluff and added nothing to the conversation. My N1 check on him also revealed that he could kill at night, or at least more effectively. I believe he is the mafia killer.<br>
Tw1light (Townlean) – ‘Basically had the same reaction that I had when they noticed the clusterfuck that was the original wagon on Ashe. Albeit with Ashe flipping scum Tw1light can go either way as this could be another town player who also disapproved of their wagon or scum attempting to CFD the town off Ashe. This is a 50-50 for me as Tw1’s motivation can go either way, barring being a Neutral, however I’m leaning on him being town.’ - Sarun<br>
Sam17z (Townlean) – Reacted like a townie after orange’s bait. Inactive first day but that could be for a number of reasons. Possible Mafia since orange claimed NK but mafia would want NK’s extra night kills.<br>
MaximusPrime (Heavy Scumlean) – A little bit inactive. Main reason for scum lean is Ashe’s apparent want to marry him. He also defended Ashe.<br>
PoisonedSquid (Null) – Don’t know much about him/her at the moment.<br>
Vulgard (Townlean) – Reads seem typical of a town and has given out his/her scumreads. Seems to be actively scumhunting, however, I could be wrong.<br>
Simon (Scumlean) – Inactive and didn’t answer my marriage proposal. Should be ITA’d because he is a detriment even if town.<br>
orangeandblack5 (Confirmed Town) – Pushed the lynch on Ashe and confirmed by PKR, nothing else to say.<br>
Insanity (Null) – Should be ITA’d for inactivity.<br>
Shurian (Slight Scumlean) – Defending Livicus who seems scummy. Could be a Livicus + Shurian Scumteam<br>
Wolfy (Townlean) - Seems to come as a naturally good town leader<br>
Boss (Null) - Inactivity and the lack of analysis makes me feel this is scum. Boss typically brings good analysis when he’s town, so his playstyle just seems odd to me.<br>
Eevee (Scumlean) – Extremely scummy and no reads. I agree with Firekitten on this one.<br>
Blizer (Slight Townlean) – Pushing on Marcus who is obviously not town. However, concensus is that Marcus is neutral so mafia could push on him too.<br>
Memesky (Null) – Meme-ing as per his name. Can’t read yet.<br>
Captain (Scumlean) – Inactive, adds nothing to the conversation when he does post and hasn’t given any good analysis.<br>
Sarun (Townlean) – Seems to be scumhunting and posted all his reads. His reads are well reasoned and he helped the lynch of Ashe.<br>
Cassar (Null) – Inactive, ITA this guy.<br>
ConfusedtoLook (Null) – Inactive so ITA.<br>
Gamerpoke (Null) – Sheep, hasn’t provided any benefits for town, even if town.<br>
Marcus_Doodalee (Slight Scumlean/Neutral) - Lack of analysis, voting, and participation in general which is not like him at all. Replies and actions portray a neutral viewpoint and has stated he would ITA someone who he thought was 100% town. Doesn’t seem to care about town goals too much. Possible NK.<br>
Psychoneirik (Null) – I don’t know enough about him.<br>
CheesyKnives (Townlean) – Seems good in marriage chat. Didn’t take up to opportunity to claim mafia when I claimed Neutral to him. Used our child to protect me when I claimed town. Also claimed his abilities to me.<br>
PKR (Null) – Firekitten seems to trust and I believe firekitten is town.<br>
Solic (Heavy Townlean) – Sarun states that he has town motivation in marriage chat, nothing else for me to say right now.<br>
Luxy  - Me</p>
<p>Take all I have said with a grain of salt as I am new and don’t know how people normally play. Credit to Sarun for the format and some of the reads.</p>
