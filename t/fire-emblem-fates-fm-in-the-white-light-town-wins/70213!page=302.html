<blockquote>
<p>Well, to start off here’s my read list that I compiled overnight.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>HTM ( <strong>Slight Townlean</strong> ) - Sheeps a little, but overall seems very town-aligned to me via his motivations. I’m kind of odd towards his interaction with Unknown early on, but considering that his motivations, as in baiting is believable I can believe that this is consistent of his playstyle.</li>
<li>Firekitten ( <strong>Townlean</strong> ) - My read on him has been a complete rollercoaster. At the start he did seem to be Town!FK as it seemed he was scumhunting with genuinely good intentions and whatnot while also helping me apply pressure to other players and whatnot. However during the middle of the match his focus on outing Corrin and shepherding new players just struck me for the wrong reasons and intentions here here, especially after the random wagon on Ashe where he essentially sheeped Blizer and two other players on an inactive at the EoD. Since Ashe flipped scum, I’d put this read as a solid Town from the backread as I don’t think scum would bus this early.</li>
<li>Livicus ( <strong>Slight Scumlean</strong> / <strong>Village Idiot</strong> ) - In short, his entire posts from the start by asking for protective classes to visit him and then low-key asking for mass-claims just strike me as odd, and the odder thing here is Shurian just blindly defending him. During late d1 his posting started getting better, so I’m somewhat split on his own explanation that he’s just a tool d1 is correct or if he’s a real scum player attempting to correct their slips. Vulgard’s habit of defending him strikes me odd and I’d say if one flips scum, then there’s no doubt the other will as well.</li>
<li>MtheJoker ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Inactive and often more of a burden than a boon for town. I’d probably put him as the first player to be policy ITA’d due to his history.</li>
<li>Margaret ( <strong>Margaret/Memesky</strong> ) - Personal policy here is not to read Celeste until the second day due to excessive d1 shitposting.</li>
<li>Hippolytus ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Inactive as he’s traveling or some sort here.</li>
<li>Tw1light ( <strong>Townlean</strong> ) - Basically had the same reaction that I had when they noticed the clusterfuck that was the original wagon on Ashe. Albeit with Ashe flipping scum Tw1light can go either way as this could be another town player who also disapproved of their wagon or scum attempting to CFD the town off Ashe. This is a 50-50 for me as Tw1’s motivation can go either way, barring being a Neutral, however I’m leaning on him being town.</li>
<li>Sam17z ( <strong>Scumlean</strong> ) - Going on a gut read due to his last post “Then I will make constructive feedback. My opinions value isn’t a as strong since I don’t know all the facts.” Basically this just reads as scum excusing their lack of reading on lack of information. A good player to be policy ITA’d.</li>
<li>Pug ( <strong>Slight Townlean</strong> ) - Nothing out of ordinary here except that it looks like he genuinely tries to help town. Gut read on town here.</li>
<li>MaximusPrime ( <strong>Heavy Scumlean</strong> ) - Inactivity, which is typically a hit or miss from him alongside is present here. However the fact that he repeatedly refused to pressure Ashe strikes me as odd. To add here, the fact that Ashe wanted Maximus in particular as a husband is odd. My theory here is that within MaximusPrime/Unknown there is a scum player due to Ashe wanting to specifically bond with a certain faction as being Mafia, she’d know her scumbuddies.</li>
<li>PoisonedSquid ( <strong>Slight Townlean</strong> ) - Kind of typical for Squid to fluff most of d1. I kind of think she’s town, but I would really like to pressure her as she has yet to show any real town-sided motivation.</li>
<li>Vulgard ( <strong>Scumlean</strong> ) - Will put my justifications later for practical reasons.</li>
<li>Simon ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Inactive as always. I’d probably put him as a player to be policy ITA’d due to his history.</li>
<li>orangeandblack5 ( <strong>Heavy Townlean</strong> ) - To be honest, after the end of d1, I really read him as town due to the rightful suspicions on Ashe and Vulgard, albeit I’d rather focus more on his genuine reads than gut feelings due to him putting Ashe and FK on the same scumteam despite the fact that that’s technically an impossibility from the backread.</li>
<li>Insanity ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Again, inactive. Good player to policy ITA.</li>
<li>Shurian ( <strong>Slight Scumlean</strong> ) - Basically, hopped onto to Livicus’ defense without really thinking about it. I still believe that the scumteam is partly composed of Shurian <strong>OR</strong> Vulgard and Livicus.</li>
<li>Wolfy ( <strong>Townlean</strong> ) - Seems to come as a naturally good town leader. I’d put it townlean based on a gut feeling but I really want to further hear his motivations.</li>
<li>Boss ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Inactivity and the lack of analysis makes me feel this is scum. Boss typically brings good analysis when he’s town, so his playstyle just seems odd to me.</li>
<li>Eevee ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Spent much of the game active in the earlier phases. Can’t have a good read here.</li>
<li>Blizer ( <strong>Slight Scumlean</strong> ) - Excessive sheeping here and zero to no analysis. I don’t see Blizer as a serial sheep this often but here it’s just so noticeable it’s not even funny.</li>
<li>Memesky ( <strong>Margaret/Memesky</strong> ) - Personal policy here is not to read Memesky. Period.</li>
<li>Captain ( <strong>Heavy Scumlean</strong> ) - Comparing this with his average play as town, Captain is way too damn scummy to the point that I’ll eat my sock if he’s not scum as it looks like he’s not even playing the game due to zero original thoughts and whatnot. Additionally, he’s far more inactive than average. Something here is not right.</li>
<li>Sarun ( <strong>Me</strong> )</li>
<li>Cassar ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Inactive, you know the drill. Policy ITA and whatnot.</li>
<li>ConfusedtoLook ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Serial sheeper with zero analysis here. Frankly I’d file this under a policy ITA.</li>
<li>Gamerpoke ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - As above, serial sheeper. IMO we need to policy ITA them along with the lurkers as they are unreadable and provide no analysis at all. Additionally, they become too much of a burden if they sheep onto scum without thinking.</li>
<li>Marcus_Doodalee ( <strong>Slight Scumlean</strong> ) - Lack of analysis, voting, and participation in general which is not like him at all. I’d put a null read here, but this isn’t like him at all.</li>
<li>Psychoneirik ( <strong>Slight Townlean</strong> ) - As Pug and Squid, I have a gut feeling he may be town. Albeit his behavior feels too much like buddying in the early game.</li>
<li>CheesyKnives ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Posts have absolutely no content at all. I’d say he’s a good candidate to policy ITA.</li>
<li>PKR ( <strong>Slight Scumlean</strong> / <strong>Null</strong> ) - May be partially due to the burden of proficiency, but it’s as if he’s refusing to perform any form of significant analysis. I’m somewhat conflicted on this read as both Vulgard, who I have a strong gut reading is scum, seem to be throwing shade on him and intentionally jump along Orange’s suspicion. However, since I’m not familiar with PKR’s playstyle, this may be a null read from me. At this point I’d say it’s maybe Vulgard <strong>OR</strong> PKR on the scum team.</li>
<li>Solic ( <strong>Heavy Townlean</strong> ) - Seemed to have extremely town-oriented motivations in the marriage chat. Also CFD’d onto Ashe which allows me to backread him into a townlock.</li>
<li>Luxy ( <strong>Null</strong> ) - Sheeping, moderate activity, and whatnot.</li>
<li>Unknown ( <strong>Neutral</strong> / <strong>Village Idiot</strong> ) - His entire playstyle feels too be too much survivor-oriented to the point that I believe he may be a neutral, however his motivations does scream that he may be either town or scum. The backread on Ashe’s wagon is inconclusive as it felt as if Unknown was trying to prevent himself from being lynched by piling up on Ashe, so I sense an ambiguous purpose from him.</li>
</ol>

          <p>Wanted to steal ITA chance from Memesky, probably confirming Meme as town.</p>
<p>Our kid could steal ITA and add it to our own. I have higher ITA chance now.</p>
<p>He leaned town on Unknown, FK and Orange</p>
<p>Thought there was scum in Livicus/Shurian.</p>
<p>Said Blizer Sheeped</p>
<p>PKR rung scum for lack of decent analysis.</p>
<p>Marcus rung scum or neut for him due to fluff</p>
<p>He claimed the ability thief thing to me first, after I said we should claim to each other probably. I claimed neutral survivor with some things to bait out his alignment possibly. He denied it and insisted he was town. Since I claimed to him, mafia must know my class</p>
<p>I have 33% ITA chance by default. So I should have high accuracy now with the ITA stolen from Meme.</p>
<p>He suggested I’d ITA confusto if I could.</p>
<p>There is some more, I’m getting to it.</p>
