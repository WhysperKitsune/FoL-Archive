    <description>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

*You are the ocean&#39;s gray waves, destined to seek*
*life beyond the shore just out of reach*
*Yet the waters ever change, flowing like time*
***The path is yours to climb***

![image|690x365](upload://2n8Vjt9FZSRn5kogNLOtYqmTXdD.jpg)

Hosted by @Icibalus and @Marluxion. 

&lt;/div&gt;

# *In the White Light* // Rules

1. All standard forum rules apply, as usual.
2. Do not communicate about the game outside the game, and don&#39;t angleshoot.
3. Please be respectful to your fellow players. Keep your salt in until post-game.
4. Don&#39;t post in big text or otherwise pretend to be a host of this game.
5. Have fun.

# *Embrace the dark* // Rolelist

This game is **closed**. No sneaky peeks at the rolelist!
All roles will have some kind of ability, of varying levels of power. However, for the most part expect Forum Mafia levels of power.
The informed minority will be refered to as [color=red]**Mafia**[/color] and the uninformed majority as [color=green]**Town**[/color]. There may or may not be third party roles as well.
There are measures in place to make sure this game cannot be broken by a mass claim, including the game being unable to be flavor-broken.
Below is an example of a rolecard. These will flip in full upon death; mafia buddies and other such things will be sent in seperate PMs
[details=&quot;Example Rolecard&quot;]
![image|194x259](upload://ddk5C3F2IDAD9V14fqspou0o9x6.jpg)
 
 # [color=green]Lillith[/color]
 *&quot;Your kindness knows no limits, does it?&quot;*
 
 You are Lillith, an astral dragon who was rescued by Corrin and thus are serving as their attendant. However, since you aren&#39;t playable, who else could you be but the **Trancendentalist**.
 
 As you are not playable, you cannot be rolled by any player in the game, however your role-card is shown in the original post pre-game. 
 
 You win when all threats to the Town have been eliminated.
[/details]

# *Into the ground* // Mechanics

For 1 hour, during certain periods of the day, **in-thread attacks** can be fired.
These are public shots that have a 15% chance of hitting by default however roles can change this.
Events will be hosted throughout the game, like in FoLCFM. You can get prizes for participating in them, so make sure you keep track of events throughout the game.
There are additional special mechanics that will be explained once the game has begun.

# *The path is yours to climb* // Signups

This game is the largest one ever run on this site; A whopping 34 players will be required for this to run properly! Nag all your friends into **/in**&#39;ing this, I promise you all that it&#39;ll be worth it.
