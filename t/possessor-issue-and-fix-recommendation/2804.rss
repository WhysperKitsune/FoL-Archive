    <title>Possessor Issue and Fix Recommendation</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-issue-and-fix-recommendation/2804</link>
    <description>This will be me offering my idea on how to fix the Possessor to not be as confusing to everyone else involved in the game (the other 15 palyers)

I do love the new mechanic/ game play of the Possessor. Me and my friend made a whole alternate class around its cool new interaction of body hopping. (Class Forums - Spiritualist) 

**The Issue:**
- 
- You have NO idea when he is actually dead 

I understand how he works 100%... but it is almost impossible to know for a FACT that he is dead. This alone causes confusion to both BD and &quot;Evils&quot; and does not feel good... at all. I love the mystery of this game and the deduction of it all. Trying to figure out who the possessor currently is is deducible... but finding out if he is actually dead... is NOT. It doest feel good being presented with a problem that is unsolvable, I can try and find the Possessor... but even if we kill who I think they are... we never truly know.

**The Solution:**
- 
* Give the Possessor a death animation similar to that of Reaper victims. 

When a Reaper victim dies it has a blue ghost figure around it, helping people know what happened. My solution is to have a purple ghost animation for when the REAL Possessor dies. If he is voted to die/ killed at night you see a Purple Spirit coming out of the body upon death. His victims would still appear as normal bodies on the floor, but HE himself would have the purple ghost so that everyone knows that the Possessor is actually dead. 

I feel that this would solve the part of the Possessor that is not fun for the other players involved. Every other class or &quot;bad guy&quot; in the game you know when you have defeated them. This would give that &quot;YES&quot; feeling when you see the purple ghost fly out of the [insert class here] and know that you dont have to keep sending code words or trying to track bodies. 

Last point is that my opinion is that the Possessor should NOT continue to affect the games state of clairity after his death. The Possessor brings confusion to the game which is fun and make deducing what is happening harder and I like that. That confusion should END once the Possessor is dead. This is my opinion and I&#39;d love to hear what the community/ devs think! Thanks yall!

            <p>Haha sorry I just joined. And I read all the comments to see if anybody wrote down the info I was going to put forward but nobody had so I figured I’d comment in case the OP was still having trouble with possessor.</p>

            <p>If the possessor is killed by execution, they’re gone. They can only jump bodies at night. I believe possessors are immune to attacks at night meaning if a possessor dies over night, it is because he’s jumped. The only exception to that is if the reaper empowers his real and reaps the possessor. But that happens once in a blue moon. Also I think prince can jail and kill him.</p>
<p>TLDR- if possessor dies to execution, he’s gone. If he dies over night, it’s because he jumped bodies/reaped/prince. If prince doesn’t take credit, posessor jumped 99%. also he can only jump once. If he dies twice he’s gone. When possessor dies you should know if he died or jumped.</p>

            <p>uhh no whenever Possessor switches bodies he leaves the old body behind, with its old class being displayed.<br>
So:<br>
1.Possessor possesses Cult Leader<br>
Dead body shows up as Possessor.<br>
2. Possessor possesses Paladin.<br>
Dead body shows up as Cult Leader.<br>
3. Possessor possesses Fool.<br>
Dead body shows up as Paladin.<br>
4.The Possessor(in the body of the Fool) is executed for treason.<br>
Dead body shows up as Fool.</p>

            <p>That seems like it’s already the Herbalist’s job? Without a team there’s no point for the Possessor to do that. Just have them flip Possessor tbh</p>

<p>the reason you can’t know for sure if it was a poss victim was then obs could know if they followed them who the new poss is for sure</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am not saying that each victim should be marked with a “purple ghost” I am saying that the <strong>One True Possessor</strong> should be marked. So once you see the Purple ghost coming out of the body on the floor, or the purple ghost fly out of the player after they get voted to execute, you’d know hes dead.</p>
<p>The victims would still look like normal bodies</p>
<p>I will go back and clarify this in my wording. Thank you!</p>
