    <title>The Body Swap. [SFoL6 Lore]</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-body-swap-sfol6-lore/2657</link>
    <description>So when I got replaced as King when I was a dead Merc I though how it would work. So yeah. I made a Lore suggestion for a Forum game. Deal with it.

When the Castle went to bury Frostwolf they saw NozBugz&#39;s grave open. When they inspected the grave they saw Simion in Mercenary clothing Nozbugz was in when they were lynched! Creeped out they assumed they were weary from these past days. When they saw their king, they were shocked! Nozbugz was taking a nap on the throne in King&#39;s clothes. The prince seemed very accepting of his new father. Most people have no clue what happened. A few rumors say a witch paid by the prince swapped the two bodies due to the King&#39;s weariness from his crown. The truth is we have no clue. Wizards, Scholars and the smartest people can&#39;t figure it out. Only one person knows the truth, and they are the king.
