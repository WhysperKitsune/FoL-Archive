            <p>Kind of op<br>
Occupying/night immunities are there.for a reason, and talking during the day are pretty essential to the game. Making a number of people unable to talk at all during the day could severly hinder everyone involved (even the ones who aren’t silenced), if not their chance for winning, then maybe how fun the game is (although that varies wildly from person to person).<br>
In short, silencing one person can be okay, if some right, but possibly silencing a number of people is rarely good<br>
But for a first shot, I think it’s pretty good, you do have the right idea!</p>
