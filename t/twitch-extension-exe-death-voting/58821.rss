    <description>It would be totally killer to implement the exe/death voting that dead players get to do, ideally for real ingame gold , as a twitch extension :) giving people a reward for watching will bring more viewers, which will reward streamers. I wouldn&#39;t mind if a share of the gold I earned for good predictions went to the streamer as a direct reward as well. Totally agree they are super influential on this awesome game.</description>
