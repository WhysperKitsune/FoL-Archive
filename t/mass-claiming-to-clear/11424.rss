    <title>Mass Claiming to clear</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mass-claiming-to-clear/11424</link>
    <description>So i just played a game where i was pretty much proven to be clear. I proved myself as noble in a cult game. and got elected as BD King. It was day 3.

Then i asked people to mass whisper me their logs so we can easily find the bad guys.

Exactly 2 people did it. Everyone else refused to do it.

What&#39;s the reason why people hate this strategy so much in this game?
I come from epic mafia where whenever a setup has a clear and whispers, mass claiming is literally abused.

I see a tons of reasons why its good:

#1 Its very easy to detect liars for most roles. For example, try fake claiming butler when the king knows the logs of everyone else. Same for princess, etc.
#2 The king can now coordinate the investigative roles, as well as defensive roles.
#3 There is most likely going to be at least one role which is claimed 3 times, easily revealing a liar.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>here is why it’s not meta gaming</p>
<p>To prove something is not something.  you should probably define the something.</p>
<p>So rather than me defining it . I thought I’d let Wikipedia do that part .</p>
<p>Metagaming is any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. Another definition refers to the game universe outside of the game itself. In role-play situations, for example, it would mean to tell somebody some information about another player or something they are doing that the said player’s character should not intrinsically know about. In simple terms, it is the use of out-of-game information or resources to affect one’s in-game decisions.</p>
<p>So is the tactic of using whispers to gain information from players employing any of the characteristics of meta gaming.</p>
<p>is it outside the rules of the game ? no<br>
is it using external factors to affect the game ? no<br>
does it go beyond the prescribed limitations of the game envirobment ? no</p>
<p>So as it does not meet the prescribed characteristics of meta gaming.  it cannot be described as meta gaming.</p>
<p>So now the only remaining issue is . Is Wikipedia’s definition of meta gaming a legitimate source or should we use a definition that you would like to either define yourself or define from an alternative reputable source.</p>
<p>Please note if the only person who believes that your own personal definition of meta gaming is correct  then you are of cource welcome to continue to believe that you are correct and everyone else is wrong .</p>

<p>But I assume that when you said you would kill them in real life, you were trying to be funny. You could have meant three things by it:</p>
<ol>
<li>it was a joke and you wanted other people’s approval by making them laugh</li>
<li>you were trying to make us too scared to ever employ the tactic again</li>
<li>you actually want to murder people</li>
</ol>
<p>if it’s 2 or 3, speak up pal</p>

            <p>You’re destroying the game when you do this.  Social deduction games with strangers don’t work unless everyone is trying to win.</p>
<p>A lot of people think Allies isn’t well designed and the devs have said it will be changing.  So imagine you join a game, you’re BD, and the King announces he has no leads because he thinks Allies is overpowered, so he has decided to forgo using it.  Everyone executes the King.  He’s Good King.  Do you feel that’s acceptable?</p>
<p>Let’s say someone claims physician and is asked to revive to confirm.  He said as Phys he will never use revive, because Death Knights are overpowered. Maybe they are, the devs have said they’ll be changing, so he could be 100% right they’re OP.  But, the court executes him and he’s BD.  BD loses.  Do you feel that’s acceptable?</p>
<p>And if that is acceptable where do we draw the line? What if someone says he thinks Prince is OP so he refuses to give logs and role in jail,  Prince execs and he’s BD.  Is that okay?  Why? Who decides it’s okay to not use Allies, but not okay to refuse to claim to Prince?  Everyone is going to have different opinions about the game and how it should be balanced, so how do we draw the line?  If we just let anyone do anything because they claim the game isn’t how they feel it should be then we’re effectively allowing game throwing.</p>
<p>Demanding the game be played by your rules is incredibly selfish.  The game simply doesn’t work when people take this attitude.  It’s not a matter of if mass whispers <em>should</em> be allowed or not, the fact is <em>they are</em>, and you need to accept that and play the game by the rules <em>as they are</em>, not as you feel they should be. Because even if you’re right, you’re still ruining the game for everyone else when you act that way.</p>

<p>You never clarified on how whisper or be executed is not meta gaming.</p>
<p>There’s investigative classes in the game, the King is not the primary investigative role. If he was, then every King would get to investigate people’s allegiance and it would have infinite uses.</p>

            <p>LOL yea it is. Once I had the Rudest player playing as Prince, I was the Priest. He was toxic and power tripping, I told him I’d tell him my class If he asked me nicely. Instead he executed me - one of the best moments in gaming history for me personally and why I love this game <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I have to deal with people power tripping at work, when I get home and want to play a game you can’t flip out on me and make demands. I get enough of it IRL</p>

            <p>Throne of Whispering to the King</p>
<p>now on Steam!</p>
<p>That wasn’t an explanation on how a King demanding everyone whisper to him isn’t meta gaming. I’ve got my way of dealing with these types of players, I get them removed from the game while I’m 99% not paying attention and more focused on dangling a piece of string for my cat to play with. If I die I don’t care, It wasn’t worth my time anyway. It’s extremely funny to me when a BD King tries to pull this crap and ends up executing me as the Prince… or the Priest before it was removed xD</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please explain how is it not meta gaming to demand everyone whisper you their role or be executed. This is a game focused on deduction as it’s core game play. When you get a King that plays like this the only thing to deduce is how I’m going to entertain myself while AFK.</p>

</aside>
<p>it isn’t meta gaming if these events were actually happening then I would demand whispers as king</p>
