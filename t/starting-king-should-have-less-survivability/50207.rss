    <title>Starting King should have less survivability</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/starting-king-should-have-less-survivability/50207</link>
    <description>So, I get that Starting king needs to be stronger than regular king so as to make him not the objectively best choice to execute N2 or whatever. 

However, Just because he needs to be stronger does not mean he needs to be tougher. In my experience the most fun games were games where the starting king died before midgame. This is in my mind a good thing as it reduces the swing inherent to the starting king to negligible levels if he dies before he can make or break the game.

First of all make starting king have 4 guards again, He may have needed it with Order but not with Order Exe. 

Second of all make ALL poisons and bleed effects kill him in 1 night (also make then indistinguishable but that&#39;s another issue). 

Lastly there simply needs to be more ways to get around the king&#39;s guards. For example Happy Hour should be able to target the king.</description>

<p>The problem with trying this is that it doesn’t work if you are doing it right. If you are doing a really good job at seeming BD king then you are probably getting meny Unseen killed. This would make you more likely to lose. However as a neutral king if you try this and do too well then you just go all in and win with BD instead.</p>

            <p>Well only way you’re gonna find out if a person is alchemist would be if he just admits it or if you find  out that he is neutral by using observer’s ability</p>
<p>Same thing goes for neutral king except observer can’t find him</p>

            <p>The problem is that he looks exactly like good king until he betrays you (that or he looks like good king until the end). Normally that would be fine (Alch for example), however unlike every other class in the game the king has definite Ability’s and cannot be investigated. That means his kit NEEDS to make him relitively easy to scumread. However Neutral king makes this nearly impossible to do reliably, since Neutral king is getting in the way of good king games (as in king games which are good. Not games with Good kings) he should be removed to make way for the good and evil kings.</p>

            <p>Tbh I dislike both Alchemist and Neutral King because their goal is boring.</p>
<p>Neutral King is just a good King that can flip. It doesn’t have the subtlety of Evil King.</p>
<p>I’d like to see Mercenary King and Scorned King, though. They would actually be interesting.</p>

            <p>Personal Disclaimer:</p>
<p>I don’t expect everybody to come to the same conclusion as me so much as I expect people to learn from what works in-game and what leads to a loss.</p>
<p>The insistence on following my beliefs comes not from the expectation that everybody else will see the game the same way, but rather from the idea that you balance a game for those who will learn from their mistakes and improve as players.</p>
<p>While this may at first seem an “elitist” stance to some, it is worth noting that your players that learn and improve are the ones that will stick around and support you.</p>
<p>I understand entirely that not all changes can be made expressly for those that know what they are doing (at least, as long as the game doesn’t have a Ranked mode), and as you well know I’ve commended you for your efforts on that front before.</p>
<p>But I will never temper my suggestions just because people <em>might</em> not learn from them.</p>
<p>In this case, as I have already stated, Poor Fellow on GKing isn’t anti-Social Deduction like it is on Fool. Also, as I already stated, me breaking down over it was largely a joke. Just making sure we’re on the same page. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Right well in any case I’m not currently trying to get loyalty removed or replaced. I don’t care about the punishment for Good King dying in the context if this post. I’m just saying it should be easier to kill him in general. Mostly scum trying to remove a good king rather than good guys removing a scum king.</p>
<p>That way royal blood matters more and the starting king matters less without actually making any of those classes more or less impactful directly.</p>

            <p>See, you seem to think everyone will come to the same conclusion as you.</p>
<p>Not everyone is the same. A great example is how much the game had to change from beta to release, because the influx of players that aren’t big social deduction players.</p>
<p>We’re making a game thousands of people play. We have to account for that.</p>
