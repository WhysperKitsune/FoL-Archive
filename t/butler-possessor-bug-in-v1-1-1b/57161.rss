    <title>Butler/Possessor Bug in v1.1.1b</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/butler-possessor-bug-in-v1-1-1b/57161</link>
    <description>I was possessor, I took control of myself to attack another player (by accident, I forget my own number and don&#39;t pay attention sometimes).  The player I attacked was a Butler who partied, but I killed him. He got the message that he occupied all visitors, followed by the message that he&#39;d been killed.

His party should have occupied me.

Be possessor, control yourself to attack a partying butler, butler will die.</description>

            <p>Possessor is occupation immune though, right? I know party was buffed to prevent some things, but as you are being forced to attack, instead of just visiting, I think it ignores the occupation</p>
