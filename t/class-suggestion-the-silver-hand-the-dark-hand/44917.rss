    <description>**The Silver Hand (Unique)**
---

Neutral **Investigative**
**Goal:** Survive to see The Dark Hand defeated

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**Passives:**

**Tranquil Precision:** If you kill The Dark Hand with your own hands, you become permanently immune to death at night, If you both use your killing ability in the same night, it will fail.

**Elusive:** Immune to occupation and redirection, Immune to death once.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**Night Abilities**

**Holy Silver:** Kill a player, It will bypass all immunities. If you kill somebody who is not The Dark Hand, you commit suicide. **1 Use** **(You cant use it if the Other hand is dead)**

**Chaos Test:** Check a player, if they have a chaotic soul, you will know it. **Infinite uses.**

**Chaotic Soul Users:**

The Dark Hand
The Assassin (Not Unseen members or the Mastermind)
Cult members (Not Cult Leader)
Blue Dragon members who attacked at night or killed somebody with any ability (Interacts with Possessor)
The Reaper


-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**The Dark Hand (Unique)**
-

Neutral **Investigative**

**Goal:** Survive to see the Silver Hand defeated

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**Passives:**

**Insane Precision:** If you kill The Silver Hand with your own hands, you become permanently immune to death at night. If you both use your killing ability in the same night, it will fail.

**Relentless:** Immune to occupation and redirection, Immune to death once.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**Night Abilities**

**Unholy Darkness:** Kill a player, It will bypass all immunities. If you kill somebody who is not The Silver Hand, you commit suicide. **1 Use** **(You cant use it if the Other hand is dead)**

**Balance Test:** Check a player, if they have a balanced soul, you will know it. **Infinite uses.**

**Balanced soul users:**

The Silver Hand
The Paladin
The Sheriff
Blue Dragon members who can kill at night but they did not yet (Interacts with Possessor)
The Drunk
The Mastermind (Totally Balanced to Evil)
The Cult Leader (Totally Balanced to Evil)
The Marshal
The Alcoholic
The Possessor (Totally Balanced to Evil)

**Extra Information and FAQ**

**1-** If one hand wins without killing the other (Suicide or court vote/killed at night) does he gets Immunity?

**No.**

**2-** Inquisitor and Sorc interacts pretty similar!

**Inquisitor and sorc are really really different.** This is a **1 versus 1 concept.** The **court is not important if you are a Hand.** Also, the hands are **Investigative classes, not killers.** Both hands can help Blue Dragon on getting the Possessor (The Dark Hand) and the Reaper (The Silver Hand) So the **Blue Dragon can keep one.**

**3-** If there is a Sorc, all neutrals will be fighting each other?

**Yes.**

**4-** Why not a Day ability with a &quot;Fake Soul investigate&quot; power to fool the other Hand?

Because it would be sooooo similar to Inquisitor vs Sorcerer. Also, I want the investigate to be more powerful and unique.

**5-** Why the Holy Silver/Unholy Darkness kills the target even if they are not a Hand?

Because I want the ability to be a &quot;Cold Steel&quot; Upgrade. Also I want to avoid Cold Steel and the hands killing  being the same.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

**Changelog**
Now they are Immune to death Once
Added Possessor interaction
Added Possessor to the balanced Soul list
Updated information (unique, details about abilities, etc.)
The Winning hand is no longer silenced
Now if both hands use their killing ability at the same night, it will fail.
Changed abilitiy names
Killing abilities are no longer &quot;Cold&quot;</description>

            <p>I really like this. However I feel like they need night Immunity so they aren’t killed by other classes randomly.</p>
