    <title>Assassin with royal blood</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassin-with-royal-blood/42683</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Drunk was converted to Unseen and was alcoholic for a turn. The king died along with assassin during the night and the former alcoholic could up himself with royal blood to the throne even he became the new assassin.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Assassin should not have royal blood to step up to the throne.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Have any royal blooded Unseen members to convert assassin during night and try to step up with royal blood.

#### Comments:
Same bug happened on two different occasions, once with alcoholic turned assassin and once with aristocrat.</description>

            <p>Otherwise, if a dead Unseen showed up that night or previous night, and BD knows there is only two Unseen, if itâ€™s King election, everyone who steps up is confirmed BD. And someone with previous claims may not be able to stick to them anymore.</p>
