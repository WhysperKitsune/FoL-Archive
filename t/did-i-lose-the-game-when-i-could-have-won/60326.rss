    <title>Did I lose the game when I could have won?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/did-i-lose-the-game-when-i-could-have-won/60326</link>
    <description>Okay, so I was drunk and had one HH left.  However, I debbed the reaper (player 10) instead of HHing him.  If I&#39;d HH&#39;ed him and he&#39;d still used Empowered Reap, would I have lived?

            <p>Yep, learned that lesson the hard way in a game where unseen was wiped out and evil king made a deal with reaper to protect him until the end.  If you deb the reaper once, you gotta HH after that because the empower is coming.</p>

            <p>Yes, he would’ve been occupied and not targeted you.</p>
<p>Deb kills you in that case because it forces him to target you and Empower breaks through death immune to reap you.</p>

            <p>HH occupies but bypasses occupy immunity. So yes you would have lived.</p>
