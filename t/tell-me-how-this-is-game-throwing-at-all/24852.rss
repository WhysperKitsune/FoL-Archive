    <title>Tell me how this is game throwing at all?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/tell-me-how-this-is-game-throwing-at-all/24852</link>
    <description>Scenario:

Am a merc for a good king, the good king just became king, has 4 guards.
The MM has just died after converting me to Assassin.
The Possessor is alive and hasn&#39;t jumped.

So me vs good king (4 guards) vs possessor.

To me that doesn&#39;t look winnable.

I can&#39;t kill either one that night.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the Possessor is hung, it would auto-resolve to the king winning, because he has the finger.  And if we somehow killed the king, the Possessor would win via auto-resolve because I can&#39;t...kill...him.

But after the game ends (with a Possessor win) after we voted up the king (I literally cannot win so why not do so?)

I&#39;m met with screams of &#39;game-thrower&#39;.  Repeatedly.  And of course, the inevitable reports of game throwing.

If there was a way for me to win, please let me know.</description>

            <p>It doesn’t assume anything, it just gives them the win.</p>
<p>A reaper with 2 souls will beat guards, but the king wins anyway.  A possessor jump also beats guards iirc. The way it’s coded is that king wins any and all 1v1s <em>no matter what</em>.  Which is crazy annoying.</p>

            <p>I think it shouldn’t auto resolve at all. Though the situation you presented would be unfair to the king who could have survived the night. Right now it always auto resolves to king. It should just play it out however.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure last time I checked, it depends how it gets to a 1v1.</p>
<p>IE if there’s 3 people left and 1 is assasain 1 is king</p>
<p>If assasain kills the non-king in the night, and the day begins with assasain and king, it auto resolves in the kings favor</p>
<p>If the non-king is not killed in the night, but he is executed in the day, it auto resolves in the assasains favor.</p>
<p>That at least is to my knowledge how it auto resolves. I’m not 100% on this, but I am about 60% sure that is how it currently works (even though if I am right, I strongly disagree with that result).</p>

            <p>It clearly isn’t, this is a valid assessment of the situation and honestly the best outcome. Scum should favor other scum winning, ideally. If the autoresolve would have changed it to an Assassin win, the autoresolve needs to be changed.</p>

            <p>If you got reported, the mods will look over the report and see what happened. They are all nice people, so you should be fine, I mean that doesn’t seem terribly throwy or malicious to me.</p>

            <p>I believe you probably could have won due to the autoresolve mechanics… Which I do admit I don’t agree with, and are often hard to predict… I do believe though 1v1 assasain vs king, if the possesor was hung, it would have auto resolved in the assasains favor.</p>
<p>Yes if it played out the king would finger you… but the auto resolve tends to be funky.</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn’t have called it a full throw or anything… Especially as intent is the biggest defining trait of throwing… and even experienced players get pretty confused at the auto resolve mechanics.</p>
