    <title>Chat selection could be a lot more smooth</title>

    <description>One of the biggest frustrations I experience when playing as prince or psychic is trying to select what people have pasted at night in order to copy their logs into my private notes.

Notably, I can&#39;t drag across multiple lines, even within a single message. I have to select each line of their message one by one, copy it, open my notes, paste it, go back to chat, repeat.

This activity typically takes all the remaining time so that I don&#39;t have time to talk to them.

A little UI polish here would go a long way towards improving the game experience:

* Let drag-selection cross line endings
* Give me an easy way to select an entire message at once (double click? triple click? anything will do)
* If my drag starts after the end of the line, make it work. Currently it fails unless I start with the mouse pointer over a character, which adds some fiddly mouse control to the process.</description>

            <p>I can type faster than 250wpm, but the log window partially covers the chat window so that’s still terrible - keep closing/opening it. I’ve tried both ways. This is just bad UI, and really easy to fix.</p>
<p>Also, making the game turn based on who can type fastest seems like a bad idea.</p>

            <p>All chat besides public day chat shouldn’t be allowed to be copied tbh. Just learn to type short hand.</p>
