    <description>We truly value everyone&#39;s feedback and have spent the past year and a half+ crafting this game with the community. Because we&#39;re suddenly a big game (from 20 total users/day to almost 2500+ total users per day, throughout timezones), **it can be easy to forget that we only have two actual programmers, right now: Boslof and I.** We are an indie company and we are self-published (+Steam). Even if we hired an additional programmer immediately, it would take months to train and catch up; this would actually slow us down (for now).

Although we planned for success, we did it with a &quot;college budget&quot; (and very transparently). None of the team even has even received our first post-launch pay, so we&#39;re doing the best we can with what resources we have to deliver what you guys want. 

We can test up to 90% internally, however that leaves room for 10% of possible madness that we apologize for. This was originally due to time and resources restrictions. As time goes on, we plan to create more thorough test environments and get some private testers so things don&#39;t get out of hand. Leading up to creating a better test environment, we still first want to wrap up the &quot;core&quot; launch bugs that still exist (there&#39;s still some friends bugs, reports could use some tweaks, and we&#39;re still trying to make things easier for new players) before spending time on the test servers. 

So please bare with us between patches. We&#39;re here for you. But we&#39;re also very human, working 15 hours a day to ensure you get the best. What we can do NOW, though,  is avoid patching on weekends (even if it&#39;s a badass patch) and avoid patching ~afternoons/evenings (USA time) to avoid mishaps.

PS -- earlier today, we granted 500gp to everyone for being patient with us :money_mouth_face:</description>

            <p>This game is by far the most addicting game i’ve ever played.  Here is how I know this game is amazing: When i’m playing, I go into a game to have fun playing and it is very fun! When i play for hours on end it’s not becuase i’im grinding or farming for loot or trying to rake up as much gold as i can to buy all the stuff.  I could win and get 0 gold and I wouldn’t care.  A lot of games people think are so fun, are really just grinding games where you get a dopamine dump for opening a loot box you get after playing the game, and then when they have everything in the game they get bored and complain about lack of content.  This game is not one of those games.  People are playing to play.  And that’s amazing.  I’m buying some gold to support the devs to keep this game going.  Even though i already bought the only 4 pieces of equipment that i like with my in game winnings. but hopefully more awesome weapons and armour will come out in the future! Thank you for being so great to your players.  Don’t ever sell out.</p>

            <p>Agreed, The developers are doing a great deal of work. I don’t see the reason we should be “compensated” as if we are hungry velociraptors kept unfed with food for days.<br>
But, nevertheless, it’s much appreciated! -</p>

            <p>All Good! :3 You’re doing greatly. Besides, if you hire others You’ll have to brief, and make them see the game as you do. so it doesn’t loose it’s touch</p>
<p>I think i’m talking on behalf of all of us when i say. Take your time and respect for the many updates you put into the game. Your dedication is adamant, and very much appriciated!<br>

            <p>We truly value everyone’s feedback and have spent the past year and a half+ crafting this game with the community. Because we’re suddenly a big game (from 20 total users/day to almost 2500+ total users per day, throughout timezones), <strong>it can be easy to forget that we only have two actual programmers, right now: Boslof and I.</strong> We are an indie company and we are self-published (+Steam). Even if we hired an additional programmer immediately, it would take months to train and catch up; this would actually slow us down (for now).</p>
<p>Although we planned for success, we did it with a “college budget” (and very transparently). None of the team even has even received our first post-launch pay, so we’re doing the best we can with what resources we have to deliver what you guys want.</p>
