    <title>[Feedback] Knight&#39;s Guard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/feedback-knights-guard/36634</link>
    <description>We had a little Discussion in Discord earlier about how the Knight&#39;s Sacrifice works.

**Following Situation:**

_Person [1]_ is circled by **Sorcerer**.
_Person [2]_ is **Physician** and heals _[1]._
_Person [3]_ is a **Knight** and guards _[2]_

**The outcome:** 

[1] gets healed.
[2] lives cause guarded.
[3] gets attacked.
Sorcerer lives.


This makes no sense to me. I would suggest to change the Knight&#39;s Ability Description so he only guards when his target gets visited by an attacker directly.</description>

            <p>Should probably mention that 1 isn’t attacked in this situation.</p>

            <p>Had no clue this was the case, but ToS struggles from the same coding with their Bodyguard. I agree 100% that the Knight should only guard if their target is attacked, not if they walk into an attack at another player’s room.</p>
