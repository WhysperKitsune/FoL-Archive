    <title>Leave Game Early Warning?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/leave-game-early-warning/10095</link>
    <description>Hail and well met! First, let me kiss some butt and say as my first venture into this genre of gaming has been met with extreme awesomeness. Lying has never been more fun and acceptable! 

Now on to my issue....It clearly states in your &quot;In game rules&quot; that leaving a match early is ok when you are dead, as long as there isnt a priest who wants to revive you. Not once have I left a match before being firmly in the spirit realm, yet when I logged on this morning I was met with a warning telling me not to leave games early. Please explain in detail the parameters around &quot;leaving early&quot; prompting warnings and bans vs your claim that its ok to leave after you die. Thank you and I hope this issue will be resolved as my time is precious to me and I will not waste it watching others play a game I have no hope in being a part of again. Thank you.</description>

            <p>honestly, don’t leave as BD ever when you die, unless you know the phys as brought back the max number of death knights they can already. That’s what i would say.</p>

            <p>When you removed priest you added res to a class that may have 0 1 or 2 players…</p>
<p>this makes it way harder to know if you should be leaving early or not .</p>

            <p>Your warning was not for leaving when dead, it was for leaving a game while alive because you had to go, you were a Ritualist.</p>
<p>The rules regarding leaving when dead are pretty clear I feel, there’s no defined “safe to exit” time.<br>
Also the Priest was just removed so that’s one less barrier with the entire thing.</p>

            <p>Hey, my account name is Hauzey…it isnt a big deal…only wondering what the parameters are so I can avoid these warnings…like how long after I die before it is “safe” to exit…does it log as a early leave if I am BD and a priest is alive and I leave…etc</p>

            <p>This whole process would be much easier if forum and game accounts were tied</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/%C3%AD42-xblade">@í42-Xblade</a> have you considered giving users an account name that is the same on the forum and the game and under which you can search the user’s reports, but let them change a seperate username that appears to other players?</p>
