          <p>Hey nerds,<br>
I’ve been sitting on this for a while and trying to figure out how to properly encapsulate all my thoughts and emotions in written form, and I’m still not content with it, but figured fuck it, who cares. I don’t need to write an essay.<br>
<small>proceeds to write an essay</small></p>
<p>Anyways<br>
This game was a rollercoaster for the hosts. Firstly, <a class="mention" href="../../u/geyde.html">@Geyde</a> put his heart and soul into designing the roles and ideas you saw, and it was clear he was pretty emotionally invested in making sure this game was as fun and balanced as possible. While we all put in some effort to create the game, Geyde was the mastermind, and came up with all sorts of wacky ideas (Cult Leaders, red herrings, etc) and was the Main Designer™. He did this in <em>9 days.</em> 9 freakin’ days to design a game from the ground up. We treated it like a UPick and only started coming up with role ideas after we randed which flavors would be which alignments. I have nothing but respect for Geyde and the amount of effort and love he put into this game, and I think everyone should know just how hard he worked.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/osieorb18.html">@osieorb18</a> s a newer member of our community, but <em>definitely</em> not new to the world of forum mafia. He’s probably been in the FM scene for longer than all of the hosts combined. We absolutely wouldn’t have gotten through this game if not for him and his elderly wisdom (love you osie, but you’re a boomer), his keen eye when it came to the review process, and all his knowledge of how to handle tricky situations. He was the glue that held us all together. He noticed when we were starting to burn out, and would force us to take breaks while he took the reins. HUGEhugehuge thanks to osie. You’re the realest.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/datbird.html">@DatBird</a>. Wtf would we have done without ya. Dat was always a beacon of positive energy (except when he wasn’t, but hey, we were all stressed as hell at some point lol) and if I had to name his position during this game it would be similar to the Backup Town Leader - and I mean this as a giant compliment.  He literally changed his sleep schedule to be able to process ITAs and votecounts while the other hosts slept. That’s dedication. He was willing to be around when any of us were busy, and he held down the fort incredibly well. Whenever we had a question from a player, he was the first person we would bounce ideas off of in terms of answers. I love ya, bud. We couldn’t have done it without you.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have aroot. I feel like… when most people think of <a class="mention" href="../../u/arete.html">@Arete</a>’s contributions the first thing they think of is the flavor. I want to make it abundantly clear that flavor was NOT all Arete did (but it was indeed amazing), in fact they did so damn much that I wonder how they remained the most sane of us. They were busy as hell during this game, as they just started up a job/internship (congrats btw!!!) yet still took control of all the events (sorry for not helping more with those <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png!v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:">), processed actions, answered questions, helped with announcements such as VCs and EoDs, and brought a ton of ideas for ability names and ideas and alllll that stuff. Thank you Arete. You’re fantastic and deserve a lot of recognition.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay I lied I have more people to thank<br>
Thank you to all the people who played this game. I love this community to the moon and back, and seeing everybody come together to play a game we worked so hard to create made my heart incredibly happy. There’s nothing quite like it, and I’m having a hard time putting my appreciation for you guys into words.</p>
<p>This game had a lot of ups and downs for both hosts and players alike, but we got through it, and I hope you guys had as much fun as I did. I hope to help host next year’s FAM, and I have a huge list of things that need work and ideas I might want to implement. I’m too exhausted to be excited for next year’s game, but after a week break or so, I feel like I’m going to miss all this.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Thanks for being the best family I could ask for.<br>
