    <title>[FIXED] Email Verification</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fixed-email-verification/1130</link>
    <description>I was able to play normally yesterday, but today when I tried to log in, the game is asking me for an email verification. I never gave the game an email. I&#39;ve linked the game to this email. so I checked the email this account is under, but nothing to verify.

Also, when i ask the game to resend the email, since i have no idea which email it&#39;s sending the verification to, so I am not able to check the correct email.</description>
