    <title>(Class Suggestion) Guardian, Neutral Support</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-guardian-neutral-support/46243</link>
    <description>Neutral Support, Unique, convertable. (Converted class I haven&#39;t wrote out yet).

The Guardian is a Neutral Support class, with the objective of surviving until the end.
Night music: The Angels Weep (Inquisitor&#39;s music).

Passives:

Willpower - Poison/Bleed will have an extra day to kill you.
Survivor -  You will be immune to death at night once, and it cannot be bypassed.

Day abilities:

Important Matter - Choose a player, you will be able to communicate with them anonymously the following night. 2 Uses.

Night abilities:

Accompany - Watch over a player, making them immune to attacks. You will be notified if you protected the target player. Infinite uses.
Lockdown - Any **attackers** will be prevented from visiting you. 2 uses.

Lore:

Throughout the conflicts between Blue Dragon and their enemies, the Guardian does not care for who wins, he is only there to do what he likes doing, and that is protecting people from harm.

Info:

My idea for the Guardian came to mind since Alchs always bomb people, Mercs are stuck guarding one player, and blue dragon are like butter, the assassin/cult are knives. The way to balance out the Guardian imo was to make them NOT occupy immune, give them ONE death immune night, and make them Neutral.</description>

            <p>This seems like Alchemist.</p>
<p>Willpower is worse version of Coagulate.</p>
<p>Important Matter doesn’t really help you. You can claim Guardian, but you could just whisper.</p>
<p>Accompany is just like heal, except it doesn’t work on Poison, Bleeding, King Execute, or empowered Reap. Worse than Alchemist’s potions.</p>
<p>Lockdown is like Stoneskin, but with half the uses, while also stopping your abilities. It only helps you against Hunter, Empowered Reap, and King execute. But you have half the uses, so you can’t defend yourself as well.</p>
<p>Survivor is an auto Stoneskin.</p>
