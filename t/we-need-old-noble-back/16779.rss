    <title>We need old noble back</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/we-need-old-noble-back/16779</link>
    <description>I mean the one with private matter, maid spy, and order,

My most fun games I have ever played on ToL were with that noble. I felt as though i was a member of an underground movement, taking a look behind the curtain to see how the trials happen.

I worked with prince and investigators to communicate silently and kill unseen/cult at night.

New noble? Terrible. I kind of liked royal decree and order when infinite uses, but now they are bad.....

Please, bring back the private mattering maid spying noble.</description>

            <p>I miss the neighborhood Nobles. I’d just take away their night immunity and suicide mechanic.</p>
<p>What if the new Noble met with the King in chat every night? Like a King’s advisor.</p>
