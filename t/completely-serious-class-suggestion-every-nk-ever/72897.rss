    <title>[Completely serious class suggestion] Every Nk Ever</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/completely-serious-class-suggestion-every-nk-ever/72897</link>
    <description>&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=grey]Every NK ever[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]meirl[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Unique and Interesting passive (Passive) -** &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Immune to Death.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; When jailed on n3, replace all well made logs with horrible knight logs.
&gt;**Ez Clap (Passive) -** When YOU play nk, all investigative abilities target you n1. Otherwise, never get asked for class until there are 5, or 3, players left.
&gt;
&gt;**lul sorc (Day)-** Place a bomb in a person, probably. If YOU have this ability, King will never die even if being obviously evil with 3 butlers in game.
&gt;**The only reason poss is even decent (Day)-** When there are 3 players left, win the game. Otherwise, be dead weight.
&gt;
&gt;**Prevented (Night)-** Never do anything.
&gt;**Possess (Night)-** Take control of any player who decided to whisper a password to king. Otherwise, use Prevented.
&gt;
&gt; **Objective:** *Convince others that YOU are guilty of treason; get yourself executed.*

I&#39;d like some suggestions to make this class slightly less strong.</description>

            <p>You see, reaper often has a consistent win at 5 players if he plays his cards right and attains enough souls</p>
<p>And the way Sorcerer is intended to be played, you really don’t need to go late game; your bomb should take care of everyone still alive.</p>
