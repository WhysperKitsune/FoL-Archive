    <title>I love Death Knights!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-love-death-knights/10535</link>
    <description>Ever since the new patch, I was hoping to become a Death Knight because who doesn&#39;t want to be revived as a killing machine??  Well what do you know last night I got a chance to play 2 Death Knight games and I was able to pull off some clutch plays with the Death Knight and win both games!

Heres why I like Death Knights

1. I had a lead about an unseen and another dead player had a lead on the unseen but we couldn&#39;t communicate it with the Pyschic (weird I thought Pyschics always spawn) so when I was brought back to life I immediately told everyone my first unseen lead and I announced that if anyone opposes my accusation, I will kill them because I am verified BD and verified killing machine lol.  Well no one opposed me for the 3 days I was alive.

2. I told everyone in the 2nd game to whisper me leads and who ever doesnt whisper me leads, I will kill them overnight or execute them the next day, well what do you know, everyone was whispering me leads for fear of the DK and I was able to determine who was lying and who was telling the truth.  I treated this tactic like the Mayor in Town of Salem.  I am verified BD and I can&#39;t be killed so it would be foolish to oppose me, this tactic is amazing!!!

I only wish I had 3 uses of cold steel because heck a Death Knight should be a threat to all evil players but overall I still love playing the Death Knight, thank you so much for giving us Death Knights Devs, you guys rock!</description>

            <p>Except Death Knights cant be killed for 3 days, the old revive the resurrected NEED to be protected/guarded/healed while Death Knights can be left alone for 3 days and the other supports and prince can focus on getting more leads.</p>

            <p>Getting a death night up early can be strong socially . Especially at the moment .<br>
Turn 3 , everyone whisper class to death knight or die , please .<br>
As long as BD are smart and tell the truth here you have 3 days of coordinated investigation .</p>

            <p>I’d say the opposite. Reviving a death knight early is near useless. I don’t see the point of it.</p>
<p>With old revive, u could revive someone early if u wanted. There was many good choices. King, investigative classes, etc. And that person was generally protected by a knight.</p>

            <p>Id say its actually stronger in some respects , for instance you do not have to wait for someone useful to die , and he does not suffer as much with reaper . He is immune …</p>

            <p>If we compare it with the old revive, i think its clearly much weaker. I don’t see a problem with it.</p>

            <p>Lol well that’s the part people are somewhat worried about with regards to death knights, is being too strong. As you mention he’s powerful as heck as he is, and virtually unoposable as evil for the 3 days he’s in the game. Time will certainly tell on the winrates, but I have a strong feeling he’s going to at the very least get cut down to 2 days.</p>
