            <p>Why not thought? You would almost always have redirected 3 people by day 3 and all of them can confirm you because your day ability is not silent. Kinda like how the Merc can confirm himself except this class is unconvertible and never has to side with evil. You can get an assassin or a CL killed almost at will too.</p>

            <p>While you are still confirmable, you now have to use your abilities which disrupt people, and have to use them multiple times to win. People would be less inclined to help you, and less willing to help you confirm yourself.</p>

            <p>Still confirmable (though now only at night) and the goal addition is too easy to mean anything.</p>

            <p>A confirmable and practically invincible survivor? No way this won’t work. This is just like beta Alch. Charm someone to prove yourself and then you can coast for the rest of the game.</p>
