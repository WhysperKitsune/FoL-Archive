    <title>(New Class: Mistress (Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-class-mistress-offensive/54469</link>
    <description>Mistress is a new class I was thinking of to add to the game. It will be under the unknown category. She will be of same faction as the king himself. Mistresses are immune to conversion

**Passive**
Royal Honor: Can&#39;t be order-executed by the king

King&#39;s Love: Immune to Occupation and Target Changing and Conversion

**Day Abilities**
Future Ruler: Gives the prince immunity to death for that night. If you&#39;re a cult/unseen mistress, you&#39;ll give the mastermind a investigation-cloak, and give the cult leader night immunity and investigation-cloak (2 Uses)

**Night Abilities**
Affair: Visit a player and find out their faction. If they&#39;re other faction than your faction, you&#39;ll kill them. (Doesn&#39;t bypass night immunity) (2 Uses)

Luck of the Draw: Visit a player and disable their ability to step up as king if they&#39;re of a royal blood. If they don&#39;t have the royal blood passive, you&#39;ll disable their ability to use their day abilities. This ability ignores a player&#39;s faction, so that means if the target is of the same faction of you and you disable their ability to step up, they can&#39;t get confirmed. (Infinite Uses)

EDIT:

**Notifications** 

_Future Ruler_
You gave the prince immunity to death tonight! (Good Mistress)
You will make the Mastermind appear non-suspicious tonight! (Unseen Mistress)
You gave the Cult Leader immunity to death and appear non-suspicious tonight!

_Affair_
They were a (BD/Neutral Class), so you killed them! (Evil Mistress)
They were a (Unseen/Cult Class), so you killed them! (Good Mistress)
They were a (Unseen/Cult Class), so you won&#39;t kill them! (Evil Mistress)
They were a (BD/Neutral Class), so you won&#39;t kill them! (Good Mistress)
_Death Immune Target_
They were a (opposite faction class), so you killed them!
They was immune to your attack! 

_Luck of the Draw_
(Target) was a royal blood member! You disabled their ability to step up as king! (Royal Passive)
(Target) wasn&#39;t of the royal blood, so you disabled their day abilities instead!

If you have any ideas and change suggestions. Please feel free to comment</description>
