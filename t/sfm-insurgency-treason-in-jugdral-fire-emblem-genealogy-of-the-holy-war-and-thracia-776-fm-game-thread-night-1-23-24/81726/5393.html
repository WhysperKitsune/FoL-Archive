          <p>posting for the sake of posting</p>
<p>Why I think Alice is scum:</p>
<p>A: Her attittude towards her opening post as the game goes on.</p>
<p>So her first post basically explains that we should playing properly and all making reads not hero shooting blablablah.<br>
The thing is, Alice actually doesn’t do that good of a job following her own rules. Firstly she has already partly claimed. Yes, I know, claiming weak role isn’t that important but it’s actually quite a big clue as to what role she could be, I realize it could be lying or just fluff but you really not do that EVER. Secondly she also has posted a few reads, mostly regarding the first 2000 posts and there’s quite a lot of stuff that is wrong with it.</p>
<p>So firstly her reads don’t really evolve. The 2 main things I’ve noticed about her reads is PKR going from slight TR to Town core and EVO going from null to biggest scum. So my issue is that she never changes her reads, she’s so set on that one read list that despite reposting around 3 or 4 time, it never truly changes.<br>
Her TRs. PKR Vulgard oB_Light and Icibalus, those are the ones that I agree with, at least the reasoning, now there’s 3 reads that are truly weird and make no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Firstly she meta reads Sulit as town just for her amount of posting. Marshal said it very well “I think she’s town but not Town Core” yet Alice insists on her Sulit and on her Kyo read. She even told Marsh to actually add Kyo and Sulit to his Town Core. Back then Sulit wasn’t that weird but recently she’s been a lot more shy, she hasn’t done much. She hasn’t actually given a real opinion regarding the lynch situation and she just defaulted to an EVO vote which is really bad. I think Sulit is very slight Town AORN but she could evolve towards scum as more time passes by.</p>
<p>Next is Kyo, Kyo has very little game related posts, most of his posts are either fluff or IIOA. Mafia theory talk, regarding PoE mostly. This isn’t enough to think he’s town. Near the end of the day Kyo just vanished away, he hasn’t done much, no input on the EVO/Cheese/Seth case and no vote AT ALL. Why? I don’t trust him, certainly is a SR for me.</p>
<p>And finally is EG. EG had 130 posts when Alice made her first read list which is around post 1300, Guess how many actual game related posts (no memes, no IIOA) EG had made, well the answer is, it depends if you count questions as game related. There’s maybe at most 3 posts (including votes/pardon) that are game related and a dozen or so of questions, that’s oddly low. And what’s worse is that Alice thinks this is Town Core worthy, Why? Also, EG was on the EVO wagon despite very little game related posts.</p>
<p>Alice later on said that outside of 7 people (mainly inactives) she had no other people in her PoE, this is really weird no? She also said she only puts people she truly believes to be town in her Town Core, so why and how did Kyo and particularly EG get in here? Gut manages to land people in TownCore nowadays?</p>
<p>B: Her vote on EVO or how she managed to kill a Townie just by snapping her fingers</p>
<p>Do you know what EVO did in order to get at the bottom of Alice’s Read List? Alice is the one who started the massive wagon, so here’s what happened.<br>
EVO made a read list, a one that is made real quick just to give out small opinions, in this list there is a Leafia read, it says “Oh definitely town because of cute pfp!!” (the message is crossed out) Alice used that small tidbit of a read list in order to kill him, she used some weird meta and lead town to lynching him because he apparently had a similar read in the past and he was wolf along with that other person somehow. Notice that despite being the one who starts the wagon on EVO, Alice doesn’t actually push this hard.<br>
Weak reads, going agaisnt you own posts, Leading lynch on a townie for little to no reason and just bad play lead me to believe Alice is scum because town Alice would certainly try harder, the attitude coming into the game and what I’ve seen are vastly different.</p>

          <p>So, first off, I didn’t expect Alice to die. I thought FOR SURE she’d be protected, watched, anything. The fact she wasn’t makes me believe that the wolves used a strongman kill.</p>
<p>And they also cleaned her, which makes 0 sense from my perspective. It doesn’t take away much info. We <em>know</em> she was town. She also claimed something close to a VT, so it’s not even a benefit for the wolves that we can’t see her role. It’s just not super useful.</p>
