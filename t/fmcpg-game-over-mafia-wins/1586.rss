    <title>FMCPG: Game Over (Mafia wins!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fmcpg-game-over-mafia-wins/1586</link>
    <description>**Welcome to the Forum Mafia Championship Practice Game.**

**Rules**

0)Follow the [Global Forum Rules](http://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-rules-please-read-first/244)

1) Inactivity: If a player hasn&#39;t posted in the thread within 24 hours, the host will prod them for inactivity. If they do not respond to the prod within 18 hours of it being sent, they will be replaced. Receiving two prods will result in an automatic replacement. Posts must be productive to the game and anything else will be seen as prod dodging and will not reset the prod timer.

2) Be Respectful: The host will not tolerate any homophobic, racist, sexist, or any otherwise discriminatory behavior. Any type of behavior like this will be punished by being forcibly replaced. Remember that this is a game and if you feel that you&#39;re too on edge, take a break from it. The host will step in and ask people to calm down if it starts getting too heated. So please, refrain from personal attacks.

3) Gamethrowing: Any attempt to intentionally make your faction lose the game will result in being blacklisted from future games. This includes shooting a revealed Mayor as a Vigilante or executing a confirmed Town member as a Jailor. All your actions must be done with the goal of winning as your faction and have a clear, logical explanation for your actions. This can include Jesting.

4) Spam: Do not post multiple times in a row if it can be avoided. It detracts from the game and makes it harder for people to catch up. Use quotes and spoilers to make one large post instead of many small ones as well as using the preview function to look at your post before posting it. The host will spoiler excessively long posts at their own discretion. 

5) No Outside Communication: Do not use outside methods of communication to disclose your role or any other similar information about this game to another player. Dead players may only speak to dead players, with a Medium using their night action being the only exception to this rule. Breaking this rule will result in being blacklisted from future games.

6) Last Wills, Deathnotes, and Night Actions: Be sure to label all PMs to Schultz accordingly or you risk the chance that they&#39;ll miss the PM and not process whatever you wanted done. The proper way to label them is:

&quot;FMCPG Night Action&quot;

Last Wills and Death Notes will not be in this game.

7) Whispers: There will be no whispers this game.

8) Flavor: Flavor should not be used to infer anything or support arguments as it is as the title implies, flavor text.

9) Fun: The most important rule is to have fun because this is a game and shouldn&#39;t be treated as anything aside from that.


**Gameplay**
Days are 120 hours long and Nights are 48 with a Day 1 Lynch.
Plurality lynch is in effect. Tied votes result in no lynch. 
No feedback from roles except death.
Trials are disabled. 
Mafia have a day and night chat. 
Actions are done by messaging me.
All classes will be used, and will be used as they are 
When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it. 

Players:
1. @PolikShadowbliss 
2. @PokemonKidRyan
6. @tardispaten
7. @eevee 
9. @Hippolytus</description>
