<p>For those of you who are new to the game, I’ve not prepared a rundown of the things you’ll need to know, Tangled in 23 February 2020 has though.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Character List</summary>
<p>This game will be running the Royal Guidance script; this script is more focused on social abilities than mechanical solving.</p>
<p><strong>Townsfolk</strong> :</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong> : Executed good players might not die.<br>
<strong>Leech</strong> : Each night, choose a dead player. You learn who they have targeted so far during the game.<br>
<strong>Lovefool</strong> : Each night, you may choose a player. If you die, they might also die.<br>
<strong>Matchmaker</strong> : Each night, target two players that are neighbors. Learn if they are the same alignment.<br>
<strong>Queen</strong>: You are a minion, know who the Demon is, register as evil and register as that minion character. If the Demon publicly guesses you to be the Queen (can attempt once per game), you lose, even if dead.<br>
<strong>Newspaper Hawker</strong> : Each night, obtain a piece of feedback a player has received.<br>
<strong>Optician</strong> : Each night, choose a player; learn if they’ve ever malfunctioned or been mad this game.<br>
<strong>Prophet</strong> : Once per game, during the day, ask the Storyteller if a list of roles are present in the grimoire.<br>
<strong>Psychic</strong> : Once per game, during the day, publicly make a statement that a player is a minion. The Storyteller announces the result.<br>
<strong>Rattlewatch</strong> : Each night, choose a player; learn if an evil player has chosen them this game.<br>
<strong>Snitch</strong> : Each night, choose a player. Learn the total amount of whisper messages they’ve sent.<br>
<strong>Needs Renamed</strong> : On the first night, gain an ability of a Townsfolk out of script.</p>
<p><strong>Outsiders</strong> :</p>
<p><strong>Loudmouth</strong> : If you die, choose a player; all evil players learn their role.<br>
<strong>Needing Replaced</strong> : Needing Replaced<br>
<strong>Squire</strong> : Each night, choose a player; they might register as evil until dusk. You might register as evil.<br>
<strong>Needs Renamed</strong> : On the first night, gain the ability of an Outsider out of script.</p>
<p><strong>Minions</strong> :</p>
<p><strong>Copycat</strong> : You start the game with the ability of a Townsfolk or Outsider.<br>
<strong>Paralyzer</strong> : Once per game, during the day, lock all votes for execution or pardon.<br>
<strong>Sycophant</strong> : Each night, choose a player; they might register as good until dusk. You might register as good.<br>
<strong>Needs Renamed</strong> : On the first night, gain the ability of a Minion out of script.</p>
<p><strong>Demons</strong> :</p>
<p><strong>Arch’ian</strong> : Each night <code>*</code> , choose a player; they die. Each night <code>*</code> , receive a message from every whisper channel.<br>
<strong>Quack</strong> : Each night <code>*</code> , choose a player; they die. You may send as many messages directly through the storyteller as you would like at any time, with each message targeting every member of a specific alignment or role type of your choice (good, evil, townsfolk, outsider, minion, or demon).<br>
<strong>Wither</strong> : Each night <code>*</code> , choose a player; they die. Chosen players’ neighbors are poisoned until dusk.<br>
<strong>Needs Replaced</strong> : Needs Replaced</p>
<p>Townsfolk and Outsiders are good-aligned to start, Minions and the Demon are evil-aligned to start. If your character or alignment changes, you will be notified of this. There are no neutral parties in Ravenswood Bluff.</p>
<p>A note on Madness: Certain character abilities in the Sects and Violets edition (and now this one) reference a status known as “madness”. What madness means, in the simplest terms, is that when a player is “mad” about something, they are trying to convince the other players that it is true, even if it is not (especially if it is not). Ultimately, the Storyteller is the one who judges whether the “mad” player’s efforts are sufficient to avoid punishment, but this allows the Storyteller to be more lenient toward players who are unfamiliar with the concept, and by the same token, to expect more from an experienced player.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Town Composition</summary>
<p>This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the composition of the game at each possible player count.</p>
<p>Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons</p>
<p>5: 3/0/1/1<br>
6: 3/1/1/1<br>
7: 5/0/1/1<br>
8: 5/1/1/1<br>
9: 5/2/1/1<br>
10: 7/0/2/1<br>
11: 7/1/2/1<br>
12: 7/2/2/1<br>
13: 9/0/3/1<br>
14: 9/1/3/1<br>
15: 9/2/3/1</p>
<p>Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Ladies at the start, for example).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Phase Length</summary>
<p>Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.</p>
<p>12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.<br>
12 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.<br>
24 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.</p>
<p>The night phase will last for 24 hours, or until all abilities have been performed and resolved.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Storyteller</summary>
<p>The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Fabled</summary>
<p>No fabled are in play.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Scum Info</summary>
<p>On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Malfunctions</summary>
<p>The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the class is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning class’ ability simply does not have any effect.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Nominations and Voting</summary>
<p>Voting in this game works a little differently. After the formal discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will declare that nominations are opened. A player must be nominated before they can be voted on. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day. When a nomination is opened, the storyteller will begin to count votes. Votes may be precast, and may be altered so long as they are considered not to be locked in. A vote is locked in when everyone between the accused and the voter (going down the list from the accused) has locked in their vote, or once the day ends, assuming that not all votes on the nomination have been cast. Any votes that are not counted at EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players, and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. There isn’t such a thing as a quickhammer around here; we’re a little more careful with what we do.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Whispers</summary>
<p>Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Whispers to your neighbors (those seated next to you) do not have to be announced. Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Death</summary>
<p>When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of things. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Victory</summary>
<p>Good wins by eliminating all Demons (you don’t need to kill Minions to win). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (even if both players are good). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain class abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the class list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win at the same time), Good wins.</p>
