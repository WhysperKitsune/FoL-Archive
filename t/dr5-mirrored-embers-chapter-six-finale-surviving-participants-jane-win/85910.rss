# DR5: Mirrored Embers

A killing game.
Hosted by @Arete and @Icibalus.

&lt;/div&gt;

**What is this?**

- Dangan Ronpa is a forum game based on the approximately popular game series of the same named, except because I&#39;m hosting it, there will be a *minimal* amount of anime.
- In the game, you explore the map in the **Daily Life** phase, uncover evidence in the **Deadly Life** phase, and attempt to bring the killer to justice in the **Class Trial**. You can perform actions that could be- well, just about anything an actual human could do.
- In the game, the majority of players will be [color=teal]**Participants**[/color], but one player, lurking among them, will be the nefarious [color=brown]**Mastermind**[/color], plotting their destruction.
- There are two ways to win as a [color=teal]**Participant**[/color]:
- - Survive the killing game, unveil all the Blackened, and expose the Mastermind in the **FINAL TRIAL**
- - Commit murder and survive to escape the town.
- There are two ways for the [color=brown]**Mastermind**[/color] to win:
- - Ensure the Participants fail to expose N murderers. The value of N is unknown, even to the [color=brown]**Mastermind**[/color].
- - Survive the **FINAL TRIAL** without being exposed.
- Note that the [color=brown]**Mastermind**[/color] *cannot* directly kill, but they have other... advantages that they can use to help bring the [color=teal]**Participants**[/color] down.
- There are also the neutral [color=red]**Wildcards**[/color], who win by doing:
- - Something. You don&#39;t know what, but something.

**Daily Life**

- During this phase, players may perform actions freely (explained below), explore the academy, and do incredibly stupid and completely unjustifiable actions for the sake of ephemeral comedy.
- Throughout the map are secret items, hidden rooms, puzzles, and at least one secret passage. Some of these items are murder weapons. Do with them what their name suggests and you might win.
- During **Daily Life**, players have the option to become **Blackened** by comitting murder. This action is tiring, but could potentially win you the game if you go undetected.
- During this phase, the game will change between **Day** and **Night**, on a 12/12 cycle.
- The following changes will occur during night time:
- 1. Murders have a +2% chance of succeeding at night time, thanks to the low visibility.
- 2. Sleeping in your dorm room will gain you +30% of your AP per hour, and will allow you to have 150% more than your AP maximum. This is opposed to sleeping during the day, which grants +20% per hour and does not allow you to exceed your AP maximum.
- 3. The base cost for moving between locations will become 2 AP instead of 1 AP.
- This phase will end when a body is discovered by a group of three or more players encountering a dead body. This could, of course, include the **Blackened**.

**Deadly Life**

 - Players may investigate the school once more, but not to explore. Instead, they must determine the identity of the killer by finding evidence. The phase lasts for 24 hours.
- This phase is fairly simple, so I shall use the rest of this section to explain some finer points of homicide:
- - Killing a player is a mix of RNG and stats, and costs 40% of your total AP to work up the nerve to murder.
- - When a murder happens, it&#39;s extremely likely that physical evidence will be left behind, and there&#39;s not much you can do to stop that. Mostly blood.
- - Due to magical wards in place in the town, all items marked with blood cannot be dropped outside of the building the murder was comitted in.
- - Items involved in the murder that are not covered with blood can be placed anywhere, but cannot be easily destroyed.
- - A maximum of 2 players may be murdered in each Daily Life phase. If two seperate murders were comitted, only the  murderer of the first body to be disco :b: ered is Blackened. There are only a few, niche, exceptions to this rule:
- - - If the bodies were discovered simultaneously, the murder which was committed first chronologicaly decides the Blackened.
- - - If the murderer of the first victim is then murdered, their murderer will be the Blackened.
- - - If both murders were committed simultaneously and discovered simultaneously, the Blackened will be decided by luck.
- - A dead player can be Blackened in cases of suicide. However, without access to necromancy, it is impossible to win this way.

**Class Trial**
- For 48 hours, players may freely discuss the murder, the evidence, and the identity of the killer. No actions may be performed except for showing the class evidence in your inventory.
- Players may vote **privately** during the Class Trial. If all players have voted, the phase will end early.
- Votes are **weighted** according to your INT stat. Please check later sections.
- If all players excepting the Mastermind and the Blackened vote correctly, the trial is automatically a success.

**Items And Stats**

- There are 5 stats in the game:
- - STR - How strong you are, your ability to perform physically taxing actions.
- - CON - How resistant you are, rarely used for stat rolls, but determines AP.
- - AGI - How fast and dexterous you are.
- - INT - How smart you are, determines your vote weight in class trials, and affects your ability to perform complex, precise actions. 
- - LUK - Your affinity for the endless stream of random bullshit endemic to killing games.
- In addition, all players (unless otherwise stated) have 5 **Public Item Slots** and 1 **Private Item Slot**, each of which can hold one item.
- **Public Item Slots** can be inspected at any time. However, you may only check another player&#39;s **Public Slots** a maximum of 3 times per cycle.
- **Private Item Slots** cannot be checked normally. However, during the Deadly Life phase, one **Private Item Slot** from each player will temporarily become public.
- It is possible to steal another player&#39;s items from one of their **Public Slots** by passing a roll of (AGI/2)%

**IMPORTANT STAT INFO (FOR NERDS (AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE))**

- Melee Attack Kill Chance = (50 + (Attacker STR - Defender STR)/2 + Weapon Attack - (Defender&#39;s LUK/8))%
- Projectile Kill Chance = (50 + (Attacker AGI  - Defender AGI)/2 + Weapon Attack - (Defender&#39;s LUK/8))%
- Poision Kill Chance = 100%, unless an antidode is found.
- Time Until Poison Kill = (Poison Power)*(1+Defender&#39;s CON/5).  Symptoms will be experienced depending on the poison.
- Electrocution, Drowning, Burn, And Miscellaneous Kill Chance = 100% - (Victim&#39;s CON/2 + LUK/5). Advantage (roll twice, if  either roll kills, the victim is dead) may be given for strong miscellaneous methods, Disadvantage (roll twice, the victim may only die if both kill) may be given for weak miscellaneous methods of murder. Use with caution.
- Maximum AP = 25 + CON/4
- Vote Weight = 80 + INT/2

**AP And Actions**

- All players begin the game with an amount of AP. Moving rooms costs 1 AP during the day (2 AP at night). 
- **All actions, unless otherwise stated, cost 1 AP**
- Murdering another player costs 40% of your total AP to attempt.
 - AP may be recovered by the following methods:
- - Sleeping. During the day, recover 20% of your max AP each hour. At night, this moves up to 30% of your max AP.
- - Eating.
- - Magic

**Roles, and also Magic**

- All players will have a role granting them special abilities. You are free to reveal these abilities, but note that there are.. certain incentives not to claim your true capabilities. These cards also include a name and gender.
- Each role has a one-use ***ULTIMATE ABILITY***, which can only be used **once per game**, but have exceedingly powerful effects.
- Magic exists within this game, allowing players to violate the laws of physics, and additionally the laws of taste. However, magic obeys ***very*** strict rules, and is very hard to keep a secret. It cannot be used as a catch-all. Be sure to familliarise yourself with the arcane if you wish to use it as a weapon, or uncover the nature of its&#39; use.

------------

**Changes From Previous Games (TL;DR)**

- The nature of discovering bodies has changed somewhat.
- Some of the wording has been changed to be a bit more naturalistic.
- Magic exists and can be manipulated as part of the game. Otherwise, the game will stick more closely to reality. Expect slightly more detail forensics-wise.

            <p>Like from my experience with both games, I can say that hey I did not enjoy playing with you either times even if different reasons. Both games I kinda have been either in your crosshairs of get rid of me cause you were conf bias/ didnt want to die yourself or being screwed over by rulebreaking that sucks to see. Like I think i mentioned this before, but yeah the angleshooting mods messages to push the dat has to be a murderer thing kinda blew. It sure helped yall win the trial, and gave ya a safety net layer against losing to mm, but as a player seeing it sucked. I will admit the poe was small already, but i think I would have had a chance if that agenda wasnt pushed. I dont want to harp or like request a draw, as i dont need it, but this is to everyone stop reading into anouncements to push agenda thats just angleshooting. It ruined Jojos part 7, it ruined my game here. Like what was pushed didnt need to happen</p>

            <p>TBH the least satisfying part of final trial was voting Trochi, because before the incident in question I actually did think I had pretty good reason that it was you, not just the CON/AP post but the other stuff that I had mentioned before all that and even some new stuff that other people pointed out and I had missed because lolsubbedintwochapterslate, but after that I basically only had two worlds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You were participant and <em>that</em> was the thing that made me realize that, which is really harsh for Trochi because losing to that is particularly unpleasant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You actually were Mastermind and doing that, in which case I’d have lost a considerable amount of respect for you because the only thing worse than playing like that as town is playing like that as actual scum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of those felt like you’d need to slap an asterisk after the end result, and while I think the hosts handled it decently well all things considered (like, they even made good lore for it all, seriously, that’s some fucking props), that… should not have been a position we found ourselves in in the first place. And I don’t think you need more reminders of that, that’s not what I’m aiming for here, but… I just wanted to make my perspective on the whole thing clear.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t super bothered by your first few accusations of Tanstermind, because I did understand why I was in the suspect pool for a while. When it started getting annoying was when multiple other people were saying that I was socially not MM and you would say that people were socially not MM for doing the same things that I was doing, but when I did them they apparently meant nothing; at that point, I realized that it was full-on confbias and I just needed to ignore the back and forth, just work on actually contributing to the game and hope that some outside thing broke the vicious cycle you were trapped in so that you could actually help everyone else break the vicious cycle that we were all trapped in.<br>
Like I said, part of me was expecting to not get lorecleared because your tunnel on me would have made for a decently challenging wrinkle to have to overcome as town at final trial, and one of my first responses when I found my loreclear was “Ah fuck, I have to find someone before Harleck accuses me of having faked this”.<br>
(By the way, ever thinking that a loreclear going that deep into the lore is a real yikes thing to come from town, which is why I proceeded to lend more MM equity to Susannah when she kinda subtly implied the possibility of my having faked that loreclear.)</p>

what</summary>
<p>it has come to my attention that i have pissed off people this game possibly even more than i did in YTTD and i completely understand why</p>
<p>i have a problem where i think i am right way more than i should be when you compare it to the evidence/reasoning behind my thoughts and conclusions, and i really don’t like it when i’m wrong about things</p>
<p>it’s not my intention to put people off, but i entirely understand why people may have thought this, like katze in chapter 2 and tan <small> throughout most of the game </small></p>
<p>though i will say part of my push on katze was the fact that i learnt about a ritual which prevented your clothes getting bloodied and they kept saying that they don’t have a single drop of blood on them which seemed <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/joy_cat.png?v=9" title=":joy_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":joy_cat:"></p>
<p>part of my tunneling on tan was because i’m egocentric and part of it was because i wanted to see how she would respond to it, though this was (unknowingly, at the time) a fruitless endeavour as i would probably confbias myself into reading any way she responded as wolfy</p>
<p>but regardless, most of the way i acted probably wasn’t fair and it certainly wasn’t justified<br>
so i apologize</p>
<p>i really need to learn when to take a step back!</p>
