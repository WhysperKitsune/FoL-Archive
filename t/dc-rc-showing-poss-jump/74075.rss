    <title>DC/RC showing Poss jump</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/dc-rc-showing-poss-jump/74075</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I disconnected, reconnected and a dead slot had shown up as EK when original king hadn&#39;t died, effectively outing the Possessor

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Dead slot should have shown up as the Poss&#39; chosen class (In this case, Possessor)

#### Steps to reproduce:
Be in a Possessor game where Poss has jumped
Disconnect, and reconnect

#### Comments:
