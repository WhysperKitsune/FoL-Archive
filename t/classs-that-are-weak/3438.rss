    <title>Classs that are Weak</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/classs-that-are-weak/3438</link>
    <description>Hi I am new to ToL , I enjoy it but I kind of feel that when I get a few certain classes I really cant contribute much to the game . 

The two that I most feel this with are 
Noble and Court Wizard 

Nobles ability to hear whispers seldom bring out anything that&#39;s useful , usually &quot; I am your merc &quot; &quot;yay&quot;  or some investigator asking someone to back up there reasons for a &quot;read&quot; but the investigator will reveal this anyway if he is not happy .

The noble cry is weak as their is no way to know after turn 1 if the noble is converted or not . 

The few games I have had as a noble I have kind of floundered around waiting for a chance to go king . 

Court Wizard as well seems to be a bit of a bumble about .

The magic barrier in the first few turns unless you have some definite leads usually just leads to people being misidentified as some sort of scum because you made them immune to investigator . 
The investigator then declares oh guys X is immune to occupy , I know cos I am sherrif . Then the CW if he is paying attention goes , oh wait that was me and now nothing is known accept who the investigator and court wizard are .

Am I missing things here ?</description>

<p>IF. And even then, I’d rather have an observer on the Sheriff to catch the bad guys than just a CW. CW is weaker than basically every other BD class atm. His abilities are far more situational than other classes and even when they work another class is often preferable.</p>

            <p>I agree Noble and Court Wizard are both pretty shit atm. They were both majorly reworked in the last few months so hopefully the Devs are still looking into them.</p>
