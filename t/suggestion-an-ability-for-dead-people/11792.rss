    <title>Suggestion, an ability for dead people</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-an-ability-for-dead-people/11792</link>
    <description>Since the priest is gone and psychic is not in all games, sometimes a lot of info from dead people is lost. My suggestion is to make an ability for dead people. 

Day ability: Ghostly echoes

Can only be used once per game. To use this, at least three dead people have to click on the ability icon. The first person to click on the ability icon will be able to send a single message to the living. They will not know who sent the message.

This ability would work similar to the psychic, the game only tells you a dead person is talking, but won&#39;t tell you who it is, so for example dead unseen could use it to trick the living.</description>

            <p>Ya. Remove the Psychic ability to talk to the dead, and change death knight: A selected dead person(with all the info from the dead) will stay dead, but they can use Death Knight abilities for the next two nights: 2 charges protect, 1 charge Cold Steel. And <strong>no death note</strong>, and observation immunity(you cant see them).<br>
Neutral Killers cannot be killed directly by this(unless its a reaper that lacks souls), and dead info is kept within the dead.(but it can be used by the dead, in a limited way)<br>
Problem solved.</p>

            <p>Well generally the key point of a social deduction game is scenerios in which you aren’t sure who is good, who is bad. In this game that is doubled with conversions etc…</p>
<p>The reason people have issue with revived people breaking it down… is they are completely absolutely 100% BD and everyone knows it. That on it’s own, with zero abilities is insanely strong, gives the option for random, reads etc… in which every BD can follow that one person, because at the very least, he is the one guy that cannot be unseen trying to mislead the vote etc…<br>
That’s before adding in being an immortal protector, and a 1 chance shot to either kill an evil or prove an innocent.</p>

            <p>Personally, I’m of the opinion that the dead should stay dead.  I already dislike the idea of being able to revive the dead, allowing them to talk without the aid of psychic/apostle would be worse.</p>

            <p>Since the priest is gone and psychic is not in all games, sometimes a lot of info from dead people is lost. My suggestion is to make an ability for dead people.</p>
<p>Day ability: Ghostly echoes</p>
<p>Can only be used once per game. To use this, at least three dead people have to click on the ability icon. The first person to click on the ability icon will be able to send a single message to the living. They will not know who sent the message.</p>
<p>This ability would work similar to the psychic, the game only tells you a dead person is talking, but won’t tell you who it is, so for example dead unseen could use it to trick the living.</p>
