    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-steam-failed-to-initilize/2695</link>
    <description>What happened: I just got a new key from my Husband and tried to login... but every time I do it starts off with &quot;Offline - Start from steam!&quot;. After a couple seconds it says &quot;waiting for steam&quot; and THEN it says &quot;Steam failed to initilize, please restart steam (Not the application)&quot;. I&#39;ve tried everything from disabling my firewall/anti-virus protections to reinstalling the game/steam... yet nothing works.. help please :frowning:</description>

            <p>Hey again, got some questions related to your issue:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="FuzzyButtMomo" data-post="1" data-topic="2695">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/user_avatar/forum.throneoflies.com/fuzzybuttmomo/40/1356_2.png" class="avatar"> FuzzyButtMomo:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>(Not the application)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Does it literally say this? Could you provide screenshots of the “states” it goes into?</p>
<p>(A video containing launching the game from Steam until getting to the described error would be perfect).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
