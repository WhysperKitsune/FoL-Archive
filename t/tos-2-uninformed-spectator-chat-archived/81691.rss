Well I think I’ll be looking forward to seeing the spectator chat once this game is over.
[/quote]

fuck okay guys

uhhhh
make content
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:12, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Ugh im like halfway through this day and so much has happened already lmfao

A. Why did CRich claim with so little pressure on his slot??? Mayor claiming d1 is absolutely horrendous for town

B. Why is Alice buddying him? Doesn’t she usually call people out for poor plays like this? Its like she wants to be on his good side because he seems easy to manipulate. Seems scummy

C. Wazza probably town. Anger towards CRich outting seems genuine

D. As of this second i have a fat null on my sister. I’ll figure her out later
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:14, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
But i needa goooooo

Hehskdjeksjdhdhejs
Guess imma keep reading

Theyre talking about pkr being neut and magnus being jailor and i dont know how people cannot detect sarcasm, or read what pkr said

Aaaaa
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:22, topic:81586&quot;]
Catching up rn

Also i have zero doubt that informed chat is more talkative

I havent paid attn to the game until this morning
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:24, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Alright so we have two Vet claims

Alice &amp; Marshal

Marshal claimed with the intent of lynching Alice for her fakeclaim. In most worlds, Alice would be the lynch today. However, Alice has been buddying the Mayor (not calling him out for his shit play) - who very much dislikes Marshal.

Alice should absolutely be lynched today but shes in a great position not to be because of the Marshal x CRich interaction

The fact that she buddied up to the Mayor kinda (?) removes her from the Phantom/Shade possibility cuz she would wanna be lynched (but i could be reading into her interactions with CRich too much)

Claiming vet will deter people from visiting her at night. So I will remove Exe from the possibilities. Cuz who tf cares if you’re visited as Exe.

I don’t see any reasonable NK making this play so imma remove them as well.

Meaning Alice is any non-shade NB, a TI, or Coven? I guess theres a tiny world where she is Cit but why would you do this shit

Aaaaaa
Alice’s plays dont make much sense to me sometimes

If she IS Coven, they almost definitely have a Coven Leader from my perspective (or maybe there are other similar coven members). Baiting out *any* TK claims can almost guarantee that Coven get a kill using them. So yeah.

Mobile chloe thoughts Part 1
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:25, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
But why the fuck would you take that risk as Coven?

Hhhhnnnggg

I suppose it makes sense in the fact that Alice is usually a Policy Lynch since shes too good at the damn game.

Removing herself now, while not spewing anything to out her coven-members, yet also getting multiple Townies to out… isnt *that* bad?

This is a lot of shit on d1 lmfao
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:26, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Theres also the possibility that Alice is good and Marshal is NB/NE

Coven or NK would be suicidal to CC the d1 vet
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:29, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh Wazza really just claimed Vig

For the sake of my own sanity im going to just ignore that and brush it off as fake. That never happened.
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:30, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Watch her come out with that snazzy doc claim

Which is why she was buddying mayor

Oh yeah marshal rt could exist as well but
Hnnng
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:31, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Seems like a doc soft afterall, eh?

If she flips doc who did a vetclaim FPS i might ask to replace-in for the NK so i can murder someone

Like, i understand the logic behind it. Gets evils off your ass at night, stops TIs from wasting a check on you

But the amount of claims this brought out, if it *is* FPS, is kinda -EV
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:32, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh I was wrong on the Doc part. But still wanna kill someone
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:33, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Her first post, which she asked people to read regarding her soft, asked Mayor not to reveal until XYLO. I read that as a doc soft. I want to kill someone a little less if she is TI. If she were actually Doc who did this shit i would be upsetti spaghetti
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:39, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If Alice is fake, i *really* hope the true TI doesnt start softing here, or its suicide. Same thing goes for if Alice is real and RT is TI
[/quote]
In response to another spec&#39;s reads:
[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:44, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
You think Coven Marshal would cc a vet d1, not knowing if its FPS or not?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:46, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
With a Mayor up his ass for “forcing him to claim” I don’t see Coven (or NK) Marshal being this suicidal this early. He should lay low and let the heat dissipate
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:47, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Shade or Phantom are possibilities
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:54, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I don’t see a world where Marshal does this as NK/Coven. But I might not know him well enough.

Hes Vet/NB/Phantom to me - heavily leaning Vet
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:55, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I still have my eye on Alice. While her true claim makes sense, I still don’t see a super strong reasoning for her to do the claim swap
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:58, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I want more from EVO

So far I don’t see him being W/W with Alice, simply based on his progression on that slot

He had it as his lowest town/null read for being a lowposter, he brought up the idea of Coven Leader existing alongside Coven!Alice, and he parked a vote on her pretty early on into the thunderdome

Gimme more shit, EVO
Either theyre both town, or EVO is Coven pushing for the easy mislynch
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:59, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If Alice is Town, she shouldn’t live to see tomorrow. That is, unless Italy is true Transporter and he does some bonkers wifom shit

If Alice is alive tomorrow I will definitely question things. True TI would likely have a check on her as well

But now with her TI claim she has some nutty Medusa bait ngl
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:60, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I needa stop focusing on this slot sigh

Imma re-read EVO
but after the alice flip my mind has him 99.9% as coven

Or i GUESS nk but like
Pretty ballsy nk

I needa check vcs again to see if he switched around
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:141, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
So three people i townread (one of which is dead) were on the cheese wagon at the end. Which… doesnt look *great* for him - but he never pushed the counterwagon?

In fact, i think i remember him saying something about how he would take the lynch if it meant alice lived

He went down a townie point from the town votes on his slot, and went up two townie points for not voting alice, and saying he would rather be the lynch

But i could absolutely be remembering something wrong
So much happened d1
I really needa re-read errythang

Plus, the fact that alice died to *majority* and not plurality makes me think scum were on her wagon - thus its possible that the cheese wagon was all/mostly town…?

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:147, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Wait did EVO claim???

Oh shit
I think i skipped past like
400 posts

Im ISOing katze and i dont remember half of this happening
And theyre talking about a twilight and evo claim
Jejdkdjeksjd

Also kat hella town btw (could be pr tbh)

Time to see what i skipped
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:151, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I think EVO is Medusa here.

Either that or they have Soulbender

Wazza/vig should should someone in PoE who *is not* EVO.

They lose practically nothing for shooting - as, if there is a CL, they will be forced to do so anyways

They might as well go for a scumread.
If they have Soulbender and vig shoots EVO, like… 2 townies will be killed from it as well (vig and whoever else) so thats fun

I think EVOs TI claim makes sense from the perspective of a Medusa, as its practically suicidal, but will almost guarantee a visit on him tonight
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:152, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
The sad thing is that I do see the vig shooting EVO tonight

It makes sense theoretically but
There are many classes that can interfere with it, and going for an obvious target just makes that easier for Coven to fuck it up

I will not be surprised if EVO dies tonight along with a soulbound target
Or a vig claim dies tonight while visiting a Medusa
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:153, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
The fact that I scumread EVO without even knowing that he CC’d TI has him as almost lockscum in my books. His claim was the nail in the coffin
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:158, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Im on post 5280 (not caught up)

Wazza is true Vig or Shade/NB (leaning shade)

NK wazz doesnt do this
Shrug
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:159, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Town Power - CRich (Mayor)
Town Investigative - Tw1 (Sher)
Town Killing - PKR (Vig)
Random Town - Derps (Vig)
Random Town - Wazza (Vig)
Random Town - EVO (Lookout)

Reads by chloe:
**Town (kinda ordered, but eh not completely)**
CRich
Geyde
PKR
Zone
Tw1

Cheese
Derps
Magnus
Wazza (likely shade)
Pogman

EVO

**Scum**

I missed a lot of people but idc
These are the names i can remember

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:164, topic:81586&quot;]
I’m happy with an EVO lynch

What I’m not happy with is how mechanics-happy this town is
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:164, topic:81586&quot;]
Don’t lynch EVO because you have a “nightplan” for doing it - but lynch EVO because hes fuckin scum, and it makes more sense than lynching someone who is begging for it

Also Wazza is baiting the lynch *hard* - hes almost definitely Neutral Benign in my mind. Unless there is some coven role that benefits from being lynched. I just dont see why people are so obsessed with his NK claim and assuming its real
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:167, topic:81586&quot;]
[Wazza] If he isn’t a Vig FPSing, hes very much NB in my eyes

In the instance that hes shade:
He likely wants EVO to hammer him, as EVO will be killed tomorrow and coven will just spiral into a loss

PKR could also just shoot him tonight and become his killer

Basically, if wazza is shade, hes pretty set up for a win rn - whether he dies today or tonight
[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Jane, post:173, topic:81586&quot;]
NK Predictions?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:175, topic:81586&quot;]
I guess off the top of my head uhh

TBE, possessed, magnus - probably my top 3 candidates
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:176, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh cheese is also a candidate. I townread him, but apparently not many other people do
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:178, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Unironically think derps could be real vig here lmfao

That is probably so wrong
I just
WANT
Him to be vig
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:180, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Wazz could be Guardian Angel as well, but fuck if i know who his target is

He hasnt shown any signs of pocketing anyone
Shrug
He likely isnt
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:183, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Bigasssss tinfoil: Coven has a fanatic that empowered whoever was doing the nightkill - in order to kill Italy who was likely to be protected

(Idk if the empower makes you redir/occ immune for the night but if so, the killer woulda gone thru a swap if italy tried to save himself)
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:185, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh i forgot that Alice flipped TI LMFAO
Lets see

Town Power - CRich (Mayor)
Town Investigative - Alice (Tracker?iirc)
Town Killing - PKR (Vig)
Random Town - Derps (Vig)
Random Town - Wazza (Vig)
Random Town - Tw1 (Sheriff)/EVO (Lookout)

Reads by chloe:
**Town (kinda ordered, but eh not completely)**
CRich
Geyde
PKR
Zone
Tw1
TBE

Cheese
Derps
oB
Magnus
Wazza (likely NB)
Pogman

EVO

**Scum**

I missed a lot of people but idc - theyre probably slankers lul

If one/either of Wazza or Derps is fake, that opens up 1or2 PR slots. Likely to be occuped by… Geyde, TBE, MAYBE seth (but he probably woulda claimed by now :upside_down_face:)
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:186, topic:81586&quot;]
EVO flipping coven invest

Thats my theory
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:192, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh shit

If they Soulgazed katze’s slot, and the slot is the missing PR

RIP GEYDE OOF
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:196, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
So I went back and read Wazza’s ISO and I literally do not see him being *anything* but Shade.

Hes kinda fucked though since he didnt die to lynch? If hes vigged, he has to somehow help coven/nk win. Coven is down a member, and lolnk

I’ll have to go remind myself what abilities Shade has but… idk if they would help coven/nk?

Also this means Derps was lying (duh) - and is probably real vig tbh.

So, that gives us another PR slot, since Wazza aint town
Gunna keep that in mind. I’m sure people will forget it
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:197, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
My thought process:

Shade needs to die in order to achieve wincondition. They can either die during the day or at night. They have to make sure their killer loses.

Wazza set up so many fake claims and mech bullshit throughout the game, all leading up to him “giving up” as Neutral Killer.

Why the hell would he give up at that point in the game? Why would he try to die JUST so he could see EVO die

He wasnt Poisoned - you arent told if you are poisoned. So hes perfectly capable of killing if he IS NK. Also, EVO was Soulbender. If you are Soulbender, and you know you are getting vigged (because Alice flipped TI and you CC’d her) - why would you not use Link Souls on yourself and the vig. Maybe because… that person cant actually attack you?

He was pushing to get himself lynched today, but he can still die tonight to progress his wincon. However, getting EVO to hammer him was his best option - as its easier to see coven lose. If he’s vigged tonight, he has to somehow see that town loses
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:200, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If PKR/Derps end up not shooting Wazza because they realize that hes Shade

I will be hella hella happy
And love them forever

(But this probably wont happen smile)
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:206, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
[quote=&quot;Possessed, post:6622, topic:81585&quot;]
Agree with this. It also seems likely Derps is the actual NK. Who do we want gone first?
[/quote]

Oh this gives me baaaaaad vibes bro

Possessed you nk?

Imma watch out for Possessed trying to pocket Seth. Think it might happen
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:211, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Uni is appealing to emotion but like
Nerd emotion
Cuz hes missing school

Appeal to nerdmotion

~~i guess i should figure out if this is AI for him~~

Aight here comes a gamer moment

NK: Possessed

Coven:
Magnus
Gorta
Cheese/Derps/Uni (leaning Uni ngl)

Third coven could be a deepwolf
Fairly confident in the first two though

Also if they have a Hex Master, shit will be fucked

I cant quote and format things quickly on mobile but imma explain my thoughts later

Oh shit wait Fossil was in Derps’ slot. Guess i can go back and try to read Fossil
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:214, topic:81586&quot;]
You have permission to quote anything ive said - to anywhere. I dont care

I’ll probably quote my shit if i end up right lmfao

I’m already proud of myself for noticing that Wazza was NB

Yep

Tempted to throw TBE in there as a possible deepwolf - but hes a slight townlean so I’ll not put him in the PoE unless he posts something that gives me reason to

I mean, I wouldn’t.

But how would you react?

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:221, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Its a list of 6 people

I wouldnt be incredibly surprised

But i do think geyde is likely PR

[quote=&quot;Jane, post:222, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:219, topic:81586&quot;]
Geyde

[/quote]

I was referring to “those two”.
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:223, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I wouldnt be surprised if Geyde were PR

I heavily townread kat, and they were being a cautious townie. I dont wanna “preflip” or whatever its called, but im pretty sure thats a PR

TBE i see as very likely as well. I need to recheck his ISO for softs, but i just
Have a good feeling?
Idk

What im trying to say is that i wouldnt be surprised - but its still a possibility that i fucked up in reading TBE
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:228, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Alright so Geyde is TI

TBE noticed the soft and is saying nothing
if TBE is town, I really wanna commend him for how he plays, hes really freakin good for a newbie ngl
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:229, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Geyde why, honey, nooo

I don’t think he needed to out there, *at all*

I don’t want them to lynch cheese today. I want Possessed out. Magnus can die (or not die) to vigi tonight

If Geyde and PKR die tonight, town is left with (a few select players) to fucking lead things

Got it, so our missing RT is oB as vig, hence the “i will make sure PKR hits his target”

easy enough

If we shoot Wazza tonight, we are freely available to lynch again tomorrow. If we lynch Wazza, vigi can’t shoot tonight, and we need to spend tomorrow lynching EVO.
[/quote]

^ *we* (this is a stretch i know lmfao)

[quote=&quot;Aelin, post:7510, topic:81585&quot;]
And, if Geyde is lying, let me just say… I’ll make sure PKR gets their shot off.
[/quote]

^ If hes firebrand, he definitely has Geyde doused. Idk how to feel about this :eyes:

[quote=&quot;Aelin, post:7686, topic:81585&quot;]
Hmm… I’ll do the cloned vote and the Magnus shot.
[/quote]

^ (also a stretch shh)

**So, how does TBE have *mech* info on oB?**
If *one* of the Vigilantes/Firebrands is fake, this leaves an RT slot for TBE? (I don’t see this as likely - I’m fairly confident that PKR is vig, and oB is town)
If this is the case, TBE could be:

* *Investigator* who checked oB
* *Lookout* who was on Wazza
* *Tracker* who followed oB
* *Escort* who occupied PKR - mighta softed this? dunno
* HE could be a fuckin Vig/Firebrand
* *If possible* - Could be Shade master? Shade could have relayed info from dead
* Last but not least, he could just be megabrain Cit (most likely)

Also possible that TBE believes Coven occupied PKR - meaning we *have* to have another Vig.

Damn
Possessed boutta win?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:253, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Also fuck my reads have been good

Ugh
I wanna die
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:256, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Cheese might be back in PoE now

Gotta check gorta again as well

But Stalker is going to win this shit
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:258, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Ah so they did Snowstorm on Geyde n1
Hence the EVO Lookout claim

Why did they not have this class do last night’s factional kill? Magnus must have a shitty class?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:259, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Jane, if two Vigilantes shoot the same person, will it show that the player died to 1 Vig, or 2?

I still think PKR is vig
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:261, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Fuck

They can occ pkr tonight
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:262, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Why the hell did Twi have to die when checking who i think is NK

reeee
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:264, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If we have a Hex Master with 2 non-dead players hexxed, a stalker with a non-dead player stalked, and a factional kill

Thats
4 fucking kills

And they will stop the vig shot

If they dont have Hex Master, and Magnus is Medusa like I think, with the same scenario above, and PKR shooting Magnus

Thats 3 kills

AAAAA
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:266, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
two different scenarios

One has a hex master and an occupying coven

The other has medusa
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:267, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Wait fuck

Its medusa

Magnus cant be anything but medusa
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:268, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh fuckin shitballs

Pkr and geyde better not visit him
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:270, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
To stop the vig shot from hitting magnus

But it doesnt matter
They have no hex master

Unless

You cant do both a night action AND the factional kill at the same time, right?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:273, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Alright yeah they have a Fearmonger or something similar

And Magnus is Medusa

Magnus did the factional kill n2, meaning he isnt Hex Master, as he would have used his second hex n2. PKR was occupied somehow and neither NK or any of the PRs could have done that
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:275, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
So PKR dies tonight
Unless he thinks

Also Geyde better not visit magnus
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:277, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Tormentor could occ as well
I think
If thats even the name of the class, that is
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:279, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Magnus can be exactly poisoner, since he coulda poisoned PKR n1

But
Hfjdkskdjdkd
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:282, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Mayor absolutely dies to stalk soon

So thats fun
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:284, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Coven kills Geyde tonight

Town leader with a great PR role

Without Geyde’s and Blue’s voices… town is going to implode on itself tomorrow

Its not going to be a town win unless PKR somehow survives and tries to lead
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:288, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Yeah i just realized

If magnus lives until tomorrow
They are going to try to lynch him over the Neutral Killer

Which will result in an NK win
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:290, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If Magnus is medusa like i think, then PKR dies tonight

Damn
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:292, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
I think with a Jailor instead of a Mayor, this could be winnable
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:298, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Honestly, if Geyde survives the night, town might have a chance with a strong voice

oB could also try to lead town

I just see town imploding tmrw
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:302, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh one of Magnus and Possessed is getting a Shade tonight
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:303, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
PKR could be cit baiting a kill

Meaning oB is our last RT
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:304, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Meaning magnus likely isnt medusa
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:305, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Yeah my entire Magnus Medusa theory relies on PKR being vig - which is possibly fake?

oB might be vig tho
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:310, topic:81586&quot;]
WINNABLEWINNABLEWINNABLEWINNABLE

lets go geyde
im rootin for you
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:313, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
They might be able to afford getting stalker out *tomorrow* ?

Unsure

Also if Geyde is RTing cheese that would be pro gamer
But i kinda doubt it?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:318, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
[quote=&quot;Aelin, post:7913, topic:81585&quot;]
So, we hang Magnus, and PKR, assuming he is actually vigi, will shoot cloned
[/quote]

Inb4 PKR dies to stalker today, omegalul

Though i have a feeling there wont be any stalker deaths today. CRich was the most likely target
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:320, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Geyde can you pick up on the fact that Magnus performed the factional kill the other night - thus this entire thing is bullshit

FFS
Cmon
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:323, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
They havent realized that it means magnus is likely Medusa

Did pkr even try to shoot him? Maybe not? Hmm

Nvm he said he tried
Rip that theory i guess
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:324, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
We could have a poisoner/medusa combo

But why was geyde not poisoned? Hm
[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:339, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Im tunneling a player and i aint even in the damn game

I need to just ISO everyone in the nk poe and figure out my thoughts without as much confirmation bias
[/quote]


[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:357, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
actually a cheese lynch isnt horrible

if he flips medusa then magnus should be a free kill
if he doesnt flip medusa then shrug, magnus might live

just need nk out tomorrow, then deal with magnus

(this is assuming NK doesnt win tomorrow)
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:358, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If they get cheese out, they’ll realize Geyde is real. So thats all gucci

cheese just sealed his fate

Gamer situation would be for one of the two NK candidates to die to stalk tonight LMFAO
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:363, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
WAIT I WAS RIGHT

IT WAS POISONER WHAT THE FUCK

dude
What the hell
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:367, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
If a stalked player dies earlier than they would to stalk (from a vig, lynch, etc) will it still show that they died to stalker as well?
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Jane, post:368, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
No, it won’t.
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:370, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Poison probably counts as a day occ as well, so when NK stalked Geyde, they hit the occupier as well, that being cheese

Meaning NK was the n1 poisoner target
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:371, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Wait no that makes no sense
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:374, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
Oh the answer might be easier than i thought

EVO linked the souls of Geyde and cheese
[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:376, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
i wish i got a chance to do some big iso readslists but real life has been my priority and ive been busy af

I think i’ve been tunneling pogman too much. I still think that slot is nk, but the longer this game goes on the more i lose faith in that read and consider derps instead

I dont have enough pc time to go back and re-read both of them, so i guess i am where i am with reads
[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Chloe, post:390, topic:81586, full:true&quot;]
EVO linked the souls of cheese &amp; geyde n1
Uni used the lookout ability on Geyde, hence EVOs fakeclaim

Cheese poisoned PKR n1 or n2 (cheese probably did the factional kill n1, as Tw1 was not poisoned)

Magnus did the factional kill n2 - cheese poisoned someone (probably PKR)

Cheese did the factional kill n3 - Magnus stonegazed

Basically, PKR has been poisoned this entire time, and NK is sitting pretty. They likely win either today from this lynch, or tonight

This is a Stalker win in my books

Probably my last post on this game (yeah its only an hour into d5)
If they lynch PKR i will be upset with town for not being able to figure out these almost-basic mechanics and see that he has been omega-townie but *shrug* , what can ya do

GG NK

<p>A. Why did CRich claim with so little pressure on his slot??? Mayor claiming d1 is absolutely horrendous for town</p>
<p>B. Why is Alice buddying him? Doesn’t she usually call people out for poor plays like this? Its like she wants to be on his good side because he seems easy to manipulate. Seems scummy</p>
<p>C. Wazza probably town. Anger towards CRich outting seems genuine</p>

<p>Alright so we have two Vet claims</p>
<p>Alice &amp; Marshal</p>
<p>Marshal claimed with the intent of lynching Alice for her fakeclaim. In most worlds, Alice would be the lynch today. However, Alice has been buddying the Mayor (not calling him out for his shit play) - who very much dislikes Marshal.</p>
<p>Alice should absolutely be lynched today but shes in a great position not to be because of the Marshal x CRich interaction</p>
<p>The fact that she buddied up to the Mayor kinda (?) removes her from the Phantom/Shade possibility cuz she would wanna be lynched (but i could be reading into her interactions with CRich too much)</p>
<p>Claiming vet will deter people from visiting her at night. So I will remove Exe from the possibilities. Cuz who tf cares if you’re visited as Exe.</p>
<p>I don’t see any reasonable NK making this play so imma remove them as well.</p>
<p>Meaning Alice is any non-shade NB, a TI, or Coven? I guess theres a tiny world where she is Cit but why would you do this shit</p>
<p>Aaaaaa<br>
Alice’s plays dont make much sense to me sometimes</p>
<p>If she IS Coven, they almost definitely have a Coven Leader from my perspective (or maybe there are other similar coven members). Baiting out <em>any</em> TK claims can almost guarantee that Coven get a kill using them. So yeah.</p>

<p>I suppose it makes sense in the fact that Alice is usually a Policy Lynch since shes too good at the damn game.</p>
<p>Removing herself now, while not spewing anything to out her coven-members, yet also getting multiple Townies to out… isnt <em>that</em> bad?</p>

<p>I think EVO is Medusa here.</p>
<p>Either that or they have Soulbender</p>
<p>Wazza/vig should should someone in PoE who <em>is not</em> EVO.</p>
<p>They lose practically nothing for shooting - as, if there is a CL, they will be forced to do so anyways</p>
<p>They might as well go for a scumread.<br>
If they have Soulbender and vig shoots EVO, like… 2 townies will be killed from it as well (vig and whoever else) so thats fun</p>
<p>I think EVOs TI claim makes sense from the perspective of a Medusa, as its practically suicidal, but will almost guarantee a visit on him tonight</p>

<p>The sad thing is that I do see the vig shooting EVO tonight</p>
<p>It makes sense theoretically but<br>
There are many classes that can interfere with it, and going for an obvious target just makes that easier for Coven to fuck it up</p>
<p>I will not be surprised if EVO dies tonight along with a soulbound target<br>
Or a vig claim dies tonight while visiting a Medusa</p>

<p>My thought process:</p>
<p>Shade needs to die in order to achieve wincondition. They can either die during the day or at night. They have to make sure their killer loses.</p>
<p>Wazza set up so many fake claims and mech bullshit throughout the game, all leading up to him “giving up” as Neutral Killer.</p>
<p>Why the hell would he give up at that point in the game? Why would he try to die JUST so he could see EVO die</p>
<p>He wasnt Poisoned - you arent told if you are poisoned. So hes perfectly capable of killing if he IS NK. Also, EVO was Soulbender. If you are Soulbender, and you know you are getting vigged (because Alice flipped TI and you CC’d her) - why would you not use Link Souls on yourself and the vig. Maybe because… that person cant actually attack you?</p>
<p>He was pushing to get himself lynched today, but he can still die tonight to progress his wincon. However, getting EVO to hammer him was his best option - as its easier to see coven lose. If he’s vigged tonight, he has to somehow see that town loses</p>

<p><strong>So, how does TBE have <em>mech</em> info on oB?</strong><br>
If <em>one</em> of the Vigilantes/Firebrands is fake, this leaves an RT slot for TBE? (I don’t see this as likely - I’m fairly confident that PKR is vig, and oB is town)<br>
If this is the case, TBE could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Investigator</em> who checked oB</li>
<li>
<em>Lookout</em> who was on Wazza</li>
<li>
<em>Tracker</em> who followed oB</li>
<li>
<em>Escort</em> who occupied PKR - mighta softed this? dunno</li>
<li>HE could be a fuckin Vig/Firebrand</li>
<li>
<em>If possible</em> - Could be Shade master? Shade could have relayed info from dead</li>
<li>Last but not least, he could just be megabrain Cit (most likely)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also possible that TBE believes Coven occupied PKR - meaning we <em>have</em> to have another Vig.</p>

<p>Cheese poisoned PKR n1 or n2 (cheese probably did the factional kill n1, as Tw1 was not poisoned)</p>
<p>Magnus did the factional kill n2 - cheese poisoned someone (probably PKR)</p>
<p>Cheese did the factional kill n3 - Magnus stonegazed</p>
<p>Basically, PKR has been poisoned this entire time, and NK is sitting pretty. They likely win either today from this lynch, or tonight</p>
<p>This is a Stalker win in my books</p>
<p>Probably my last post on this game (yeah its only an hour into d5)<br>
If they lynch PKR i will be upset with town for not being able to figure out these almost-basic mechanics and see that he has been omega-townie but <em>shrug</em> , what can ya do</p>
<p>GG NK</p>
