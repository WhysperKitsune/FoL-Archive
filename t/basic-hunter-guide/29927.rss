    <description>So you want to know how to use the hunter? If so then this is the guide for you!

First a breakdown on his ability&#39;s

&gt;Passive 1: Retribution - Kill your first accuser if you are executed.

If someone tries to falsly accuse you then you will kill them. This means it is very important to claim on the stand to avoid double BD kills.

&gt;Passive 2: Isolation - Occupy immune

You are uneffected by butler, drunk ect...

&gt;Night ability 1: Wolf - Bleed a player killing them after next night. Can be healed and pierces night immunity. Does not count as a visit (2 uses)

This is used if you think you know who is evil. Use the next day to find out what their claim is under threat of not being healed.

&gt;Night ability 2: Bear - You are convert immune tonight and you will prevent all attacks. Anyone that attacks you will be killed, bypassing night Immunity.

This is your main Ability and is what makes you Special. Use this to make sure you survive to the next night.

Now in-game there are a few options available to you:

Option 1:

# The loud game

The strategy here is to out ASAP to get everyone&#39;s claims. If someone refuses to claim to you than wolf them. Otherwise expect to use up your bears early on. It is a good idea to step up to become king if you get the chance while doing this.

This is the defacto hunter strat

Option 2:

# The clutch game

Here you want people to not realize you exist. Try and avoid bringing attention to yourself for as long as possible to avoid having to use bears. Once it starts to transition to late game you wolf who you think are sus and start bearing. If someone ever claims hunter then wolf them and counter claim them the next night so they are not healed. If you do then continue as if it were a loud game.

Option 3:
# The hidden leader game

Remember that your job as hunter is to be agressive. Lead the discussion and get people talking because they are more likely to attack you if you do. And you want people attacking you instead of someone else so you can counter attack. So if you just are super active and lead discussions then you will likely be attacked. Use bear and switch to a loud game.</description>
