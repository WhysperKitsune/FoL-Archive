    <title>Scum having no excuse to avoid proving themselves with abilities</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/scum-having-no-excuse-to-avoid-proving-themselves-with-abilities/43864</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t like how hard it is to get away with faking a claim when demanded to prove yourself.  I think how  big it is now removes some of the social deduction aspect of the game.  There is almost no reason to let a Noble claim get away without force voting on request, for instance, or a Psychic using Telepathy to identify herself.  I think it would be great if such abilities were given just a single charge and made more powerful (if needed) in order to compensate, it would be an improvement.

This way scum would have a plausible reason for declining to prove themselves (they don&#39;t want to waste their ability).  Right now if a Noble claim declines to force vote to prove himself, it&#39;s suicide (if the players are experienced).

What do y&#39;all think?

EDIT:  After thinking over it a couple more minutes I figured I don&#39;t think the best judgement can be made on this subject anyways until we get a vet lobby.  But I can&#39;t find a delete button lol</description>

<p>Well sure there I get what you are saying. but we are in agreement, you should have effectively everything prior to that night down log wise, meaning you only have half between 1 and 1 half of a night worth of stuff to put down. Which again you should be at the latest starting to come up with at the start of the next day.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  I never fill in my logs for that night until the next morning, in case a Noble snoops me and challenges me to prove myself.  For example, if I write:</p>

<p>If a Noble snoops me and asks me who 3 visited, I’m screwed that very day.  But if I only write:</p>

<p>because it primarally comes in handy IF you didn’t have logs ready and need to explain why it took you 15 seconds to copy and paste logs that take most people under 5 seconds to copy/paste.</p>
<p>However if you are a skilled scum player, you already had your logs ready before the morning started. let alone before you hit the stand. Especially now thanks to the nobles new ability that makes posting anything other than the logs that were in your journal last night, or having multiple logs in your journal gotchas.</p>

            <p>I agree nobody ever does it but how is it not a legitimate strategy?  I don’t know what you mean by “if you think to do it then you don’t need to do it”.  Also if somebody claims distracted on the stand I’m more likely to pardon them, since Unseen can’t be distracted.  Almost the same situation if someone appears to be trollboxed on stand, however being distracted is proof you are not Unseen and being trollboxed only means you are PROBABLY not Unseen.</p>

            <p>I still don’t like giving it to the Butler or CW.  Not only is it outside the scope of what we’re trying to solve (BD day abilities being used to prove), it potentailly makes things <span class="bbcode-i">worse</span> because we’re adding a new ability that could potentially be used to prove.</p>
<p>Even with a wide variety of people with the ability, it could still narrow down possibilities a bit, and I just don’t think we should ever give a BD role a Day ability with an immediately-obvious effect unless it is <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely</span> necessary.  And beyond that, I just don’t understand why you want Butlers or CWs to gain this ability at all - what purpose does it serve for them?  As I understand it, the only purpose of this ability is so evils can use it to prevent people from using day abilities to prove.</p>
<p>As for having them work similarly…  it’s not essential, no, but it’s good because it makes the game slightly less complex.  Complexity is a resource, so to speak; there’s a limit to how complex the game can become before it becomes impenetrable for new players.  And Throne of Lies is already a hugely complex game where a single player failing to know the exact details of any one ability can lead to catastrophic failure for an entire team.  So all else being equal it’s better to go for a simpler solution.</p>

            <p>Cleaner version of the above</p>
<p>Fizzle = The ability was prevented and further Ability usage is stopped. Will still consume a use of the ability. Anything that causes something to Fizzle will give the same feedback</p>
<p>Butler/Servant/Scorned: Confound - The next day ability that target player uses will fizzle. (2 uses)</p>
<p>Invoker will have Bewilder changed to the above but with 1 use.</p>
<p>CW/Sage/Ritualist: Aura Guard - Limited use day Ability’s used on the target will fizzle. (3 uses)</p>
<p>Reaper: Just apend “Or use limited use day Ability’s” to the end of chill.</p>
<p>Assassin: Distract - Expends a use of the Target’s day Ability’s. Cannot target King (2 uses)</p>
<p>The assassin is good enough. He should be fine with a week Ability like that when he already has Poison. Plus this can make the “Im out of uses” excuse more plausible.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe that this would help then please remember that they are day Ability’s and dont need to be planned in advance. Plus if they don’t believe it then they can be used to get a power class such as Psychic lynched as Scorned or whatever.</p>

            <p>Not every instance of the ability would need to work the same way. For example the one we give to butler/servant/Invoker/Scorned (for the rest of the conversation I will refer to this as Confound) could work on anyone including King (Invokers already does and the Butlers current Ability straight up kills him) but the one we give to Mastermind might not (reaper’s also does right now as a side effect of stopping voting). Preventing Jail is actually something I would want to be a possibility for the Confound. If we do something like give CW or Mastermind a day barrier or whatever then it should only work on limited use abilitys. If you noticed there are no confirmable unlimited use day Ability’s. Jail doesn’t do anything until the night, finger is on king who is already confirmed and scout on gives feedback to the sheriff and is easy to fake.</p>
<p>Actually maybe we should give it to assassin? Distract is useless 90% of the time. He wouldn’t be able to use it on king/prince if we did.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure blocking day abilities is something BD needs.  I mean…  it could lock down a few nasty abilities, but do we want that?  Is it necessary?  The point here is to give evils an excuse for not using their abilities, not to add another tool to BD’s toolkit.</p>
<p>Also, Butlers could use it to prove, even if it’s silent (wasting an ability is worth it, and they could use it on the king to block Royal Finger, which the king doesn’t need most days.)</p>
<p>For that excuse to work, it also has to be widely-available.  If the only evil class that has it is Servants, claims that it was used on you wouldn’t be credible.  Giving it to eg. the Scorned instead makes it far more believable (and I’d even give it to a few other people, like the Cult Leader or something, so there’s a decent chance of it flying around and people have to take that seriously - someone who would have an incentive to try and block any BD confirm attempts, so either CL, Assassin, Mastermind, or an NK.  Maybe Mastermind and one of the Cult converted classes, since they appear more often than individual Unseen converted classes.)</p>
<p>The problem with letting it target kings, I guess, is that it makes it a much more powerful ability, since it entirely eliminates the king’s advantage in late-game standoffs and removes the pressure evils have to kill him before then.  This makes it harder to give it to a lot of people, which I feel is necessary for it to do its job of making day-ability confirmation unreliable - for it to work, there has to be a reasonable probability that someone is around who will immediately block you when someone demands you prove.</p>
<p>Like, no way we could give it to the MM or CL if it worked on kings, since having it be almost guaranteed that would negate one of the key points of kings.  But if it didn’t work on kings, it becomes a fairly minor ability that is only likely to be used when BD demands someone proves themselves, since there are few other BD with really important day abilities, and few enough BD day abilities overall that using it blindly isn’t likely to accomplish much.</p>
<p>(Oh, also, it doesn’t work on the Prince.  Obviously.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, in response to the basic idea here, perhaps we need an evil who can block someone from using any Day abilities (can’t be used on King.)  It could be given to the Scorned, one of the Cult, and maybe an NK - giving it to multiple people would keep its use from being a giveaway and would ensure that people can always claim to have been hit by it.  It’s not a terribly powerful ability, since you’d need to know to use it in advance, so I think it could be given to several people.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Someone on discord (RHcube I think) suggested that Butler should get that instead of nightshade wine killing 2 birds with 1 stone. Basically it disables targets day Ability’s and doesn’t inform them until they try to use it (which leads to it’s use being wasted). Invoker could have Bewilder changed to work like that. And TBH why NOT let it target king? It would be a useful possablely for Possessor to take advantage of. I would also be ok with Scorned having it and having Reaper chill have that as an additional effect. In this line CW/Sage/Ritualist could have a limited use day barrier that makes the target immune to limited use day Ability’s (not jail/Scout)</p>

            <p>I don’t think it’s necessary to do anything so fancy.  Just make the messages the same and allow the poison timers to be different with no warning or explanation - it doesn’t give people that much information, and if they can reason something out from that or a Butler can trick the King into thinking he has one more night than he does, good for them.  (Especially since the King will likely get healed immediately if a healer exists anyway.)</p>
<p>EDIT:  Also, in response to the basic idea here, perhaps we need an evil who can block someone from using any Day abilities (can’t be used on King.)  It could be given to the Scorned, one of the Cult, and maybe an NK - giving it to multiple people would keep its use from being a giveaway and would ensure that people can always claim to have been hit by it.  It’s not a terribly powerful ability, since you’d need to know to use it in advance, so I think it could be given to several people.</p>

<p>I believe it was the butler poison acceleration (intent wasn’t to make the butler more confirmable, was intended to make poisoning an evil king not take so long that you still lose). perhaps a solution to keep the best of both worlds would be.</p>
<ol>
<li>no poisons/bleeds can be applied within the last 15 seconds of a day.</li>
<li>King has a new passive “day vulnerability”, if harmed during the day, the king will die that night unless treated, in addition he is unable to tell what kind of injury he sustained.</li>

            <p>Think about what everyone else sees: You claim a class, they tell you to prove it, you find out you can’t, everyone executes you. Also bewilder still has 1 use. It’s the BD and Unseen versions that would have 2.</p>

            <p>I thought we were just making Bewilder targetable?  Personally I think disabling Prince’s jail is too OP.  I also think 2 uses is OP.  <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:">  But I still think your basic idea is a genius solution to the problem.</p>
<p>What is the reason for not being told their ability is disabled until they use it?  I know Bewilder at the moment warns the King immediately.</p>

            <p>It would be limited use and no one is going to use it randomly. If it is really a problem then we could make an exception for prince, but being able to disable the princes jail is a big reason to want that class as a convert.</p>
<p>Remember it only disables it for a day. Like this:</p>
<p>Day ability: Confound - Disable the target’s day ability’s. They will not be told unless they try to use a day ability (2 uses)</p>
<p>Bewilder would be changed to the same thing with 1 use.</p>
