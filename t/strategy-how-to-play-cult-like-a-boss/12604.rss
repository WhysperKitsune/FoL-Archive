    <description>Hey there, I finished writing my second guide, this one is about the Cult. It&#39;s a comprehensive guide, going from basic class mechanics down to more advanced tactics. Please, let me know what you think.

<p>If everyone followed what I wrote exactly, the best play would be to not follow my guide at all. I can point out patterns, show more advanced interactions, and lay out the tools at your disposal that might not be immediately obvious. But I can’t teach you to think.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re the fool, no one would ever tell you to claim it on the stand in a guide. Yet, I’ve done so in game, and gotten successfully executed for it. You can’t teach that.</p>

            <p>true but I’m happy to see more beginner guides out there… with many of the games I’ve been playing lately, I’ve certainly seen my share of “no idea where to even begin” players. So the more things out there to help them get into the game the better. Honestly advanced strategy doesn’t need or even benefit from guides, the very definition of advanced play is knowing when to throw out the book, and do the unexpected to fool people. Once the unexpected is in the book, it isn’t unexpected.</p>

            <p>There’s very little advanced tactics here.</p>
