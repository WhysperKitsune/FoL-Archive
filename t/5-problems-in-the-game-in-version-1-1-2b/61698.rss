    <title>5 problems in the game in version 1.1.2b</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/5-problems-in-the-game-in-version-1-1-2b/61698</link>
    <description>Hello

I guess I&#39;m pretty experienced player who has 500+ hours of game time. I just would like to post my opinion about current state of the game. In my opinion there are 5 things that are not good (not healthy) for the game.

1) Alch claims D1 work too good.

Killing classes (evil and NK) do not want to waste a night for an attempt to kill alch claim. Also BDs usually check him if he is not occ immune and support class and then just let him live for the rest of the game.

2) Jailing/occupying Assasins and CL is OP.

As soon as BD team finds Assasin or CL which can happen even in N1 they can just jail/occupy him for 3 nights and after that execute making Cult or Unseen team completely useless for 3 nights while investigative BD classes search for NK and other evil members and rest of BDs confirm each other.

3) Mercs are usually contracted to evil and neutral classes.

That means that Merc can&#39;t claim Merc to BD team (if he is smart). Otherwise his contract usually should be just executed cause it&#39;s just logically correct: BDs have high chance to get MM or CL together with thier Merc by doing that.
As Nobles have Spy skill Mercs cannot even claim Merc to their own target. This puts Mercs in a position when all teams (BD, evil and NK) are against them since all teams consider them as non-ally cause they do not know who is thier contract.
I think it&#39;s not the way it&#39;s gotta be.

4) NK aka Possessor/Reaper/Sorcerer has too low chance to win the game.

This makes playing them not that fun and I see many players who almost give up when playing them by making very weak claims or just leaving the game at start.
It&#39;s hard to say what can be changed in order to achieve balance. Maybe make Neutral King spawn sometimes who is allied to NK?

5) It&#39;s very hard to distinguish cult classes from BD classes.

Is it Butler/Drunk or invoker? Is it Cw or Ritualist? Is it Seeker or Princess? In most of scenarios the only way to understand who is who is just to random execute them and see the result. Of course, there are some differences between these classes that can make you unserstand who is who like Butler can Party unlike Invoker, Princess has Royal Blood unlike Seeker, but that&#39;s not enough.

Thanks for reading this</description>

            <p>First of all that’s a false dichotomy.</p>
<p>Second of all you control when someone is or isn’t bleeding as a member of the Unseen. In other words if you are worried about failing to heal poison then don’t poison people.</p>

            <p>The main issue with it is that it can’t fake heal bleeding or poison.  You’ll be outed as a herbalist if you don’t heal someone who is bleeding or poisoned.  It should either be changed so it could or it should be replaced with Aristocrat’s intrigue and aristocrat should be given another ability.</p>

            <p>Drug still has a surprisingly large amount of utility. Sure it’s not THAT big but it’s enough to supliment Defile.</p>
<p>TBH defile alone would make herbalist a great class. Drug is just a bonus.</p>

<p>Defile is great, but drug is weak.  It only has 3 uses and can’t fake heal bleeding or poison.</p>

<p>Not true actualy. Powerful Ability’s often need downsides or weaknesses but not all Ability’s do. For example every Investigative Ability has 0 downsides what so ever because they are always better off than if they did nothing.</p>
<p>Other Ability’s such as heal and barrier are almost always good too.</p>

<p>Offensive and killing abilities should have downsides though.  And that doesn’t change the fact that prince needs a (small) nerf.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NK aka Possessor/Reaper/Sorcerer has too low chance to win the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Disagree. Unpopular opinion incoming.</p>
<p>When the NK wins, that means the MAJORITY of the players lose. At the most, 4 players can win if the NK wins; the NK themself, and 3 other neutral roles.</p>
<p>If the NK’s win rate were increased to say, 25%, that means that <strong>at a minimum</strong> 12 players are losing all at once every 4 games. <strong>On average</strong>, it would be 14 players losing every 4 games.</p>
<p>Players like to win more than they like to lose. Players are more like to quit for the night if they are on a terrible losing streak rather than great winning streaks. If NK’s were statistically guaranteed to win once every 4 games, you only have a 4/16 chance of spawning as that NK or one of the neutrals who can possibly win with the NK. This 4/16 number is <strong>extremely</strong> generous. This would drastically increase the amount of losing players and seriously affect the psyche of players in a negative way. This would single-handedly make people quit the game because it would feel too difficult for them without ever truly understanding that, with this increase in NK win rate, almost EVERYONE ELSE loses as much as they do.</p>
<p>But that’s not how human behavior works. Players aren’t assessing the win rates of their neighbors, they’re only looking at their personal score sheet. And if they see a huge list of red, it is going to severely discourage them.</p>
<p>You need to earn your NK victory. You need to work hard at it. Because as the NK, your victory is at a great cost to every other player in the game. Don’t expect to coast on by with overpowered abilities.</p>
