Summary</summary>
<p>Basic Strategy Guide for D &amp; D3.5</p>
<p>In combat s in D &amp; D the group depends on three things to succeed. Each player needs to know their place, each player needs to know their role and the group needs to have a good harmony in their actions.</p>
<p>The presented strategies are general and simple and can be used in most cases. But there are always exceptions to using them.</p>
<p>Once again the guide is recommended for those who already know a little D &amp; D3.5, why you will learn more by reading the book of the player than this guide. The guide’s idea is to teach some basics that are not taught in the book.</p>
<p>Functions</p>
<p>The role of a character is something defined by his talents, skills, equipment and class skills. A character can easily accomplish multiple roles within a group, but for beginners a character with more than two roles is not recommended. But even the character of a veteran player should not have more than four roles in the group . P ois will end up not being good at any, just mediocre at all .</p>
<p>This is an important concept in D &amp; D, as it is a cooperative game and it is expected that the different abilities of the characters complement each other to make a functional group. In D &amp; D it is better to be good at few things than mediocre at several. Often being mediocre is the same as nothing. Several mediocre characters in everything make up a mediocre group. But, several good characters in their functions and with well-defined functions form a strong group.</p>
<p>It is also good to note that characters from more versatile classes can change the configuration of their abilities so that they can fulfill other functions in the group. Too common for spellcasters to do that.</p>
<p>Attacker: This character’s duty is to deal damage. Be in physical or magical form. A very common mistake for beginners is to make a caster thinking that he is filling the group caster’s role and fulfilling his role, when in fact he is just another attacker.</p>
<p>A clever attacker must know how to choose his enemies, first eliminating those who do most damage to the group, or those who are going to be defeated more quickly. Usually the most important thing for an attacker is to try to knock down more enemies in as few rounds as possible. When there are multiple attackers in the group it is of crucial importance that they focus on one enemy at a time.</p>
<p>Melee attackers can play any other role, but it is essential that melee attackers are also some kind of defender. Magic attackers must remember not to only have offensive spells that rely on reflexes. Diversifying the Resistance Tests that will be requested from the target, and using touch attacks is the best way to deal damage with spells. In addition to investing in CD and Caster Level.</p>
<p>This character must invest in everything that is useful to increase his damage, which can vary according to the form he uses to deal damage (melee, distance, magic, etc.). He must also invest in talents that allow him to perform different types of action in combat, as well as dealing with different types of enemies. Tactical talents are good for diversifying the character’s actions. Mobility is another important factor for an attacker, especially if he is melee. Because you have to reach out to enemies and position yourself well to reach them in the best way.</p>
<p>Common Classes : Warrior, Rogue, Monk, Wizard, Sorcerer, Ranger. Virtually any class can be made to be an attacker.</p>
<p>Defender: This character’s duty is one of two (or both): take a lot of damage or take too much damage. This is usually done through a large number of life points and / or High Armor Class. In this way these characters must position themselves in front of the most fragile colleagues in order to prevent them from being attacked.</p>
<p>It is also useful for defenders to have good Resistance Test values ​​to protect themselves from other forms of damage and effects such as poison and magic. If possible invest in Damage Reduction and Resistance to Magic, especially at high levels. The more “armored” the better character.</p>
<p>The player must invest in dexterity and / or constitution for this character, as well as good protections. It is important to remember that it is better to buy several cheap protection items than an expensive one. For example, +3 in CA in 3 +1 items may cost between 4 and 6 thousand PO, but a single item with +3 CA would cost between 9 and 18 thousand PO depending on the type of bonus it provides. Another important thing for advocates (and that many do not have ) is mobility, so you can position yourself where you can best protect your colleagues .</p>
<p>Common classes: Warrior, Cleric , Barbarian , Paladin.</p>
<p>Investigator : The investigator’s duty is to find hidden and hidden objects from the group. Whether it be treasures or traps. It is not exactly a combat function, but group formation is essential. For traps can weaken the group, which will make the next fighting more difficult.</p>
<p>The player must invest primarily in the skills to seek and operate mechanisms. Opening locks can also help in various situations. It is also good to invest in some defensive qualities, because if you fail to disable traps you may end up activating them by accident. Logo Reflexes and a high CA can save your life.</p>
<p>Common classes: Ladino, Batter.</p>
<p>Sentinel : The sentry has the simple function of seeing others without being seen. Being a function very easily found in a character Investigator, but it is not mandatory. Its function is to walk ahead of the group to ascertain the hazards and come back to alert you of these hazards without being seen in the process. In order to allow the group to prepare and organize to face or avoid the enemies seen by the sentinel . In case it is seen it is important that this character knows to escape and to avoid attacks, soon must have good mobility.</p>
<p>A second feature also associated with sentine it is looking for enemies. Whether in urban or wild environments. Your ability to see unseen is essential in a hunt. Allowing even the creation of ambushes.</p>
<p>The player must invest mainly in the skills to hide, stealth, listen and observe. Skills to facilitate mobility such as acrobatics, balance, climbing and swimming are also well appreciated. If you want to fulfill your optional role you should invest in survival and / or information, and get the talents to track and / or track urban.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Ranger, Beater, Ladino.</p>
<p>Tactical: The tactic has a complicated function that can be done in several ways. He must manipulate the combat field, usually by magic, to improve the terrain’s advantages for the group. Whether using spells to block parts of the map, or invoking creatures in positions that group members would have difficulty reaching to break enemy formation among several others.</p>
<p>A good tactician in the group, or at least one player who knows how to instruct others on how to use their skills tactically can easily turn a difficult fight into something trivial.</p>
<p>The tactical player must invest in abilities to manipulate the terrain, to block movement, to disrupt movement, repositioning of characters in the field of combat and several others. It is usually something expected of spellcasters according to the prepared spells. That is, spells like constriction, black tentacles, web, invoking creatures, stone in mud, wall, and several others.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Druid, Sorcerer, Magician.</p>
<p>Healer: The healer is responsible for keeping the rest of the allies alive. Keeping the advocates defending and being agile to reach distant or more fragile allies who need emergency help.</p>
<p>Their duty is not only to take care of the allies ’ VPs but also to remove curses, poisons, diseases, skill damage, negative levels, help them evade maneuvers. That is, to help allies avoid various effects. Being something very important, but many healers forget, and only remember when they need.</p>
<p>An important tip for the healer is to maximize healing in round-by-round combat. Leaving to use during combat the spells that heal the greater amounts of damage. Lower level spells or healing PVs / rounds are best worn out of combat.</p>
<p>The player must invest in diversified spells to solve the most diverse types of afflictions, as well as mobility, since many of these spells are touch. Cure skill can be very useful to help save spells. Being enough to deal with many poisons and diseases.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Cleric, Druid.</p>
<p>Support: Support has the function of strengthening your allies in order to increase the chances of success of the group in any combat. This is usually done through spells.</p>
<p>To succeed in your task the support needs to read its effects well and stick to the types of bonuses they have and the magic items of their allies. After all, bonuses of the same type do not pile up. Therefore, it is of no use preparing the bull’s strength if your ally already has a +4 armor belt, or armor armor if your ally already has an armor that has more than 4 CA bonus. That is, this character has a duty not to prepare spells or effects that he will not be able to use or that will not be useful.</p>
<p>The player must invest in effects with distinct bonuses not already possessed by their allies, as well as effects in area and increase their amount of use of spells.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Cleric, Bard, Wizard, Sorcerer.</p>
<p>Opponent: The opponent does the opposite of the support, but with the same intention. He has a duty to weaken enemies with spells of bad effects. For this he has to look for spells that depend on different Resistance tests and invest in ways to overcome Resistance to Magic, or spells not affected by MRI. That is, ensure that enemies do not avoid the effects, because each effect avoided is a wasted round. Note that this is a difficult task, it is usually easier to help allies than to harm enemies, but when done well it can help a lot the group.</p>
<p>Very important for the opponent is to invest in knowledge skills, so he can identify the enemies and know their weaknesses, resistance and immunities. Knowing exactly which is the best magic to use against it in a way that makes it unusable.</p>
<p>The player must carefully read the spells as to how they are affected by TR and RM, investing the best they can in their attributes to increase the CD of their spells. It can often seem like hard work and little payback, but many spells can wipe out an enemy in a round. Frequent use of spells on a strong enemy makes it just a matter of time and luck when it will fall.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Cleric, Wizard, Sorcerer.</p>
<p>Utility: A function not very associated with combat and common in spellcasters. Do things to make life easier for the group. Send messages to distant acquaintances, create food and water, teleports , create shelters, increase walking speed and various other effects that not only speed up the game but give players a greater degree of options.</p>
<p>It is usually an easy function to perform, and made in a character in conjunction with some other caster function.</p>
<p>The player should always keep prepared some spells to assist the group, and even removes them from dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Common classes: Wizard, Sorcerer.</p>
<p>Speaker : Although not a very used function in combat it will also be explained. The speaker is responsible for the risk conversations that the group has to face . This is not to say that the other characters can not talk during a risky conversation, just that they should try not to disrupt their speaker .</p>
<p>A speaker smart can be able to avoid fighting, getting to negotiate long before someone from any blow. Even why after the first drop of blood falls it is difficult for a combat to be stopped.</p>
<p>This character should invest mainly in charisma, in bluff skills, diplomacy, and feel motivation. If you want to avoid fighting you must have a high initiative to be able to take action before starting a fight.</p>
<p>Common Classes: Bard, Sorcerer.</p>
<p>Character Construction</p>
<p>To build a character the player must first of all worry about the interpretive issues and what kind of race and class he would find interesting to play. But after that comes the question of mechanics.</p>
<p>The player has to choose what kind of roles in the group he would like his character to be able to fulfill. A rogue could be done for example to fulfill the functions of attacker, defender (CA), Sentinel, Investigator and Speaker.However, a player who tries to make a rogue who performs these five functions will soon realize that he has failed to make a character that is excellent in each of them. It will quickly lack attributes or skill points to make a character with so many abilities. Hence the importance of selecting well what types of functions are desirable for that type of character.</p>
<p>Still using the previous example, it is possible to create 3 ladinos who seem to be as distinct as if they were of different classes. An Attacker / Defender (killer style) specializes in fighting in a dirty manner and causing powerful sneak attacks. Another Watcher / Investigator (thief style) who could be an intrusion and robbery specialist. A third Ladino Defender / Speaker (trickster style) of the sort that infiltrates cuts and lives among the nobles learning their plots and profiting from them. So depending on what the player doing with the character their choices can vary greatly.</p>
<p>Formation</p>
<p>A group should normally have two formations. An order of walking and training for combat.</p>
<p>Hiking Order: The order of walking is a positioning created to facilitate the exploration of hostile environments for the group. The front row is reserved for the group’s sentinel / investigator . If the investigator is also a sentinel he can go several meters ahead of the group checking the way forward by enemies and returning if found something. If the sentry is not an investigator he may also go forward, but is vulnerable to traps. If the investigator is not an infiltrator, he / she should walk next to the group, preferably followed by a defender.</p>
<p>The second line of the group is reserved for the attackers and defenders. Most of the clashes will come in front of the group, so they must be ready to position themselves in front of any threat and block the path to the most fragile allies.</p>
<p>The third line is for the healers and supporters of the group. The central position helps them reach any ally who needs their help as well as makes it easy to use area effects in the group.</p>
<p>Behind are rest of the group, preferably keeping the less fragile of the remaining at the end. For he must be able to resist until the defender arrives if attacked from behind.</p>
<p>Combat Training: Overall it should be an easily attainable formation from the Walk Order. The main change is that the second and first line are reversed in many cases. The attackers / defenders start up while the sentries retreat. A sentinel with a lot of acrobatics and good defensive ability may decide to advance as well. If the sentry has good acrobatics it can even pierce the enemy ranks and help flank, although it is a dangerous and risky action. This action is usually done by characters who benefit greatly from flanking, such as ladinos and duelists. But it is often best left for the Tactician to summon creatures to flank.</p>
<p>Types of Enemies</p>
<p>Each enemy has similar abilities and functions the players may have. So the first thing to do when you meet a new enemy is to identify what kind of character he is. This can be done from his description or appropriate knowledge tests. If your master did not give the full description, cover it. Ask what kind of armor they wear, what kind of weapon they wield, how they dress. All this can help to identify what kind of skill or character they are.</p>
<p>From the point you know what kind of character you are, you know what your weaknesses are.</p>
<p>Defenders with many health points usually have weak will. Already defenders with high AC usually have low touch or surprise AC, depending on whether they are agile or wear a lot of armor. Arcane casters usually have very poor physical defenses. Speakers too.</p>
<p>This information reveals not only weaknesses but the advantages of this opponent. Helping to know what not to use against them. If your enemy uses a lot of armor, it does little to attack him by surprise, or to fintando, becausehis AC will continue high.</p>
<p>More agile characters usually have high reflexes. Soon, area spells are not so useful. Many PVs usually indicate a lot of fortitude. Use of magic usually indicates high will.</p>
<p>Enemies with RD are usually more vulnerable to two-handed weapons than fighting two guns. For RD applies to every attack. Characters with many TRs and MRIs are usually strong against opponents, so these characters may want to play another role in combat.</p>
<p>Of course the type of enemy varies greatly according to the functions he can perform, so this analysis can be a bit complicated. For example, a healer could be both a healer and advocate as a healer and support. The way to deal with each of these characters would be different.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of more common enemies.</p>
<p>Agile</p>
<p>Functions: Attacker (Distance), Attacker (Two Weapons), Defender (CA), Sentry, Investigator.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Difficult to hit due to high AC.</p>

</ul>
<p>Usually fortitude or will will not be good, it remains to discover which of the two.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Those who make many attacks will not be so successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobility is something important, so maneuvers like grabbing, knocking down, among others put you into bad sheets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Targets with RD greatly decrease their damage per round.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Robust</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Will spells are usually useful against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your touch AC is usually very low, distance touch spells work well. (If you are a caster, you will not want to get close to a sturdy enemy . )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“There’s not much mobility.”</p>
<p>Conjurer</p>
<p>Functions: Healer, Tactical, Support, Opposer, Attacker.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>

<p>Types of Dating</p>
<p>Each combat can bring together enemies of the same type, or several in different situations. There are different ways of dealing with each type of combat.</p>
<p>Ambush :</p>
<p>The group was surrounded by enemies who attacked them by surprise. In this type of combat the group starts out in two types of disadvantages.</p>
<p>First the group is at a tactical disadvantage because the enemies have had time to position themselves. Possibly there are several enemies in high positions and attacking the distance. Just like enemies from all sides. The second problem is that the group will already start the encounter with some damage, because the enemies could act in the surprise round.</p>
<p>In this type of encounter the group Tactician can demonstrate his strength. A good use of wall spells or to block the passage of enemies can give the group time to heal and prepare for the encounter. The tactician should delay as many enemies as possible for the allies to gain time.</p>
<p>If this is not possible it may be a good idea to look for some shelter and wait for the approach of the enemies. The worst that can happen is someone advancing with open arms against the enemies (it’s a great way to change cards, though).</p>
<p>But clever enemies will use tactics to take the characters out of the shelter (such as setting fire to their shelters) rather than venturing forward. In that case it is best to step back to get out of the fence and not be flanked.</p>
<p>If even that is not possible the whole group must follow in the same direction and try to surpass and break the line of enemies, to leave the siege.</p>
<p>The priority of a group at a tactical disadvantage should be to gain tactical advantage.</p>
<p>Several identical enemies :</p>
<p>A common type of combat, especially when facing creatures weaker than the group. Like a group of goblins , skeletons or kobolds , for example. As all enemies are identical just need to identify the type of enemy they are and their weakness extends throughout the whole group as well as the advantages. If they have little reflexes a good magic in the area can solve everything quickly.</p>
<p>Another weak point of these enemies is how many are usually weaker than the individual characters, possessing less AC, PVs and TRs than the group. If the group concentrates on eliminating one by one the combat quickly becomes trivial.</p>
<p>But this fight also has several risks. Many enemies make lots of attacks, so regardless of the AC of the group there is always a good chance that at least one hit. This combined with added effects to the attacks can cause major problems. In addition they manage to occupy and control the battlefield, flanking and surrounding the group.</p>
<p>Powerful Enemy :</p>
<p>In this encounter the group faces a creature alone and much stronger than the group. The defender needs to do his work with excellence in this combat, because if that enemy reaches the most fragile characters he will possibly knock them down in one or two turns. The healer also needs to be smart, as an error can mean the death of an ally.</p>
<p>To defeat him, the group must find its weakness. If it’s TR, PVs , CA or whatever it has it down. The fittest member of the group dealing with this weakness then has to start doing everything in their power to eliminate it and the rest have to protect it and help it as best they can. Support must focus your spells on this character.</p>
<p>Leader and Servants :</p>
<p>This kind of meeting is a mix of the last two. There is a group of several creatures with a stronger one that leads them. The tactic here is a mix of the other two, with one though: it’s important to realize who is most dangerous in this combat, the enemies or the servants and focus on eliminating them first. It is usually a better strategy to focus on the leader. For this will demoralize the servants. If the leader is a caster this is doubly true. For a caster can use the time players deal with the servants to strengthen themselves for combat.</p>
<p>Adventurers:</p>
<p>A group of enemies with diverse and resembling functions and much to a group of adventurers. These enemies are of distinct classes and have members of various functions.</p>
<p>In this type of combat the ideal is to focus on the healer of the group and then on the spellcasters. If you have someone good with countermagica in the group the spellcasters can be left last, and the attackers should be eliminated first.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these well-balanced groups may have diverse backgrounds, so the strategy can vary greatly to address them. But as always, the first step is to identify the role of each enemy.</p>
<p>First Shifts</p>
<p>These shifts are crucial for you to put together your strategy as it all depends on how you manage them at the beginning .</p>
<p>Want to use support spells and protect the group for combat? Do this in the first round. Choose a spell with moderate to good power and use it early in the fight as it will last longer and your allies will benefit the longer from them.When enemies are already weak and close to being defeated it is not worth using a feature like this.</p>
<p>Do you want to summon creatures to combat? Do this in the first round. An invoked creature must be summoned as soon as possible so it can help and control the battlefield. Creatures invoked help flanking, dividing damage, can assist in maneuvering, etc. When enemies are already weak and close to being defeated, invoking a creature is only viable if the group is unable to continue combat and need help to escape.</p>
<p>Are you a sentinel / investigator and not good with defense? Retreat. Let the defender / group go forward to p ra forward. Do you attack from a distance? Find a place that gives you cover to attack. Melee fight? Take out your weapon and get close to the target or prepare for its approach.</p>
<p>Strategies</p>
<p>There are some standard strategies for fighting. They should be used whenever possible, as they do not give good results. They involve using the combat field to receive strategic benefits that are often even represented in the form of direct bonuses in tests. It is advised to read the part of the player’s book or the master’s kit in order to learn all combat positions that generate bonuses. Coverage, height, flank and various other ways to earn bonuses that pile up make a big difference in combat. No matter how small these bonuses are.</p>
<p>One I nimigo by V ez</p>
<p>D &amp; D is not anime. There is no such thing as each one takes their enemy and faces their duel. This is a cooperative and teamwork game. The group has to focus on eliminating a maximum of two enemies at a time.</p>
<p>Room Input</p>
<p>Whenever the group is outside a room facing enemies inside a corridor or something like that, the group must retreat at least one square to avoid being in the door. A character in front of a door can be attacked by the enemy in front of him and by the enemies next to the door. If you step back a step can only be attacked by whoever enters the hall, and faced only the enemies directly in front of you.</p>
<p>Break Line</p>
<p>When enemies make a very strong defensive line the ideal for the group is to break that line. Crossing it in the middle and separating the enemies. Just be careful not to be flanked in the process. The idea of ​​this strategy is to separate attackers from other types of enemies and not be between two groups of attackers.</p>
<p>To corner</p>
<p>Cornering is terrible when planning to run away, or when to run away is a possibility. However, if the group tactician, or using furniture and other environmental things, can corner an ally that can be a viable tactic. There are 8 directions that a character can be attacked, but each wall or blockage can ensure that the character will not be attacked by that side. This will decrease the amount of attacks you receive per round and avoid flanking. Especially useful against crowds.</p>
