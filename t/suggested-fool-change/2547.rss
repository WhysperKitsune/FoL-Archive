    <description>currently, the fool is just an anti-bd class really, as unseen and cult should love him with the &quot;no voting for 2 days.&quot;

This is how to fix it:

upon the execution of the fool, players who voted execute or abstain will be unable to accuse others of treason the next 2 days, and will be forced to abstain during trials.</description>

            <p>This would still be too powerful.  I agree that the fool should be less anti-BD, but not your changes.  Poor fellow should just be replaced with retribution(if you are found guilty of treason then you will kill your accuser) instead.</p>

            <p>It depends on who gets killed and when Fool gets lynched tho… especially if King is evil.<br>
A late Fool lynch is usually really bad for BD.<br>
An early Fool lynch followed by Prince and Sheriff kills is bad for BD.<br>
Too many killers+Fool is also bad for BD</p>

<p>I beg to differ, more different people they kill, the fewer lynch options that are not confirmed BD will become and it’s proven from FoL games that BD will find easier to discover scum that way since no one will be lynched for two days.</p>

            <p>Actually, BD have easier time to collect information and if Unseen have reached conversion limit, they cannot gain more members. Sure the Assassin can kill whoever they like but whatever BD has suspecting on earlier dies during these parts will shift suspicions on someone else who are not confirmed.</p>
<p>Sure the cult can sacrifice one of their converted members and then convert someone again, but it’s the same deal for BD.</p>

            <p>They’re the same thing basically =P, from a design perspective Fool is much  more “problematic” than Jester. Usually all that happens when a Jester is lynched is nothing at all, the opportunity cost of lynching a Jester is annoying enough for the most part.</p>
<p>EDIT: The Fool also has several abilities(edit 2: that can screw up the game) like Troll Boxing/Decieving. Not lynching a known Fool sucks as well because he can firework spam, so Prince/Knight almost has to murder a Fool themselves.</p>

            <p>The vig gift is really more of a FM thing, but like, <em>the <strong>top</strong> sources</em> on Mafia games don’t lie</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Jester" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Jester</a><br>
The MafiaScum wiki is the single most highly regarded database for all things Mafia-related. When they say to avoid Jesters, you should avoid Jesters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/database/mafia-roles/role/?mafiarole=Jester" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/database/mafia-roles/role/?mafiarole=Jester</a><br>
Want your Mafia more grassroots? Mafia Universe (host of the Mafia Championships) exists more as a way to connect various communities than to be their own, and even they say that avoiding Jester is for the best, having only two games in their entire history played with the role (one of which was ToS-themed).</p>
<p><a href="http://mafiawiki.notesmash.org/wiki/Jester" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mafiawiki.notesmash.org/wiki/Jester</a><br>
While neither as large nor as important as the previous two, the SA Mafia Wiki also concurs that Jester is easy and notes that moderators usually restrict it from games.</p>
<p>The only people that seem to enjoy this role trope are RTM game devs that feel the need to use it to cover up holes in game design. I honestly don’t know why ToL has such a role, but I can say that it would not be worse off for losing it. As long as ToL maintains its fun-first focus, it will be fine to stay, but to pretend that it’s a good or healthy role is just denying the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s what I was <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Jester" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">partially referring to</a> in the first paragraph of my comment. It’s also where I basically stole the idea given on that page. To add on to that idea, maybe if Prince gets the “one-shot kill at night”, his next execute doesn’t consume any of his three executes. Maybe if he exes a Blue Dragon with that free Fool execute, he gets to keep his remaining executes. On one hand, that’s good because it helps BD have effective alternate ways of dealing with BEING UNABLE TO LYNCH FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS!</p>
<p>Maybe if the Knight gets the one use kill at knight (see what I did there?), his next Cold Steel doesn’t kill anyone if he hits a BD, but that basically turns him into an invest that auto-kills scum. So perhaps if he was the last BD to guilty a Fool that got lynched, he could instead be able to both Cold Steel someone + Guard someone in the same night, but could only do that once.</p>
<p>I’m unsure whether the idea of BD getting a guaranteed guy with a one-use kill is even that great or not. As I mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, it has some problems regarding roles that already have killing power.</p>
<p>If Knights/Princes and so on are ineligible to receive the one use killing power, what if only the Knight/Prince voted to execute the Fool. Is that the exception to where a BD Killer Class gets the one-use kill? I guess Killer Roles were ineligible for this free BD Killling Power, that could make it so a harder-to-confirm role could confirm themselves as BD. They could do that by just claiming they got the killing ability (or they just kill a guy the night they got it from being last BD to vote guilty on a Fool), though someone could always CC that for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Lastly, if all BD Pardon and only Scum vote to exe a Fool but the Fool is still successfully lynched, how would the BD who gets the Killing Power be determined? Would it be just completely random or what?</p>
<p>I really got to vary my speech more, so many “maybes” and other redundant words were thrown around haphazardly in this response/suggestion thingamabob. Hurray for fragmented sentences!</p>

            <p>First off, I would like to kindly correct you by telling you it’s a “class” <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Second, I disagree. It didn’t <em>improve</em> by being put into a conversion game. It <em>stayed</em> awesome <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/d35129eb502268221693bd3cad9d471da89b67db.png?v=9" title=":prince:" class="emoji emoji-custom" alt=":prince:"></p>
<p>But for real though Orange, until you’ve actually seen in actively in play over more than just 8 Forum games, then you’ll understand it a lot better. I know you’re a lot smarter than this.</p>
