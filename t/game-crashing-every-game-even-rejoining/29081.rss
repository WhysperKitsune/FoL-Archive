    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-crashing-every-game-even-rejoining/29081</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I enter the game, log in, join a match, select a name and then it crashes, it says it creates a crash dump folder, but before that I restart the game and rejoin the match but it crashes again after 20 seconds or so. I&#39;ve uploaded my crash dumps of trying to join and rejoin a game here:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XAafHc1nK_9mG0XqnZ6_RR24fhiCcsx6

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Play the game normally, this is another laptop, first time i tried playing here.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Play the game, join a match
