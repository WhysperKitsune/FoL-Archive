    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Executioner (Neutral Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-executioner-neutral-social/64219</link>
    <description>**The Executioner - (:shield: Neutral Social)** The Executioner wants to end the game as quickly as possible through blood. Lots and lots of blood.

**Win Condition:** Have the game end before day 6 and survive.

**Passive:**
Schadenfreude - The Executioner has occupy, redirect and death immunity, provided it is night 1 or an execution has taken place during the day or the prince has decided to execute his prisoner.

**Day Ability 1:** 
Infectious Bloodlust - Force a player to accuse another player and prevent them from voting further, they will vote execute if it goes to trial. (3 uses)

**Day Ability 2:** 
Recalcitrance - Decide Fate Execute only variant. It will be indistinguishable between King and Executioner. (1 use)

**Night Ability 1:**
Spread Panic - Protect a player from all negative effects and conversion. Does not prevent kills. Frames targeted player. (infinite uses)

**Night Ability 2:**
Leverage - Threaten the king into executing someone during the following day. If no execution occurs the following day, the king will bleed and die that night if not healed. (2 uses)

**Lore:** Pending

**Comments:** The Executioner is a class whose main reason for existing is the encouragement of day execution. He remains neutral in the following ways, but is relatively scum-sided still. Spread Panic functions exactly like magic barrier and can prevent conversions plus evil occupations/redirections in that way. Leverage is still a way to kill an evil king and might spur a BD king into being more proactive. Encouraging day executions is pro-BD sided, but the way in which he does it might not be beneficial to BD. He has many functions that allow more claim flexibility. A king can now fake being Leveraged in order to be more aggressive and can blame his Decide Fate decision on a possible Executioner tampering with him. Spread Panic also allows more room for the Scorned target defense. He should not spawn with Fool in my opinion as a Fool execution will usually result in The Executioner&#39;s loss.

This is a rough draft of what I think is interesting. Other night abilities that could replace Spread Panic are empowering attackers in some way or occupying support classes. Let me know your thoughts. I have thought about losing the night immunity and changing his win condition to not having to survive.

Another thing I would like to mention is that this counters the Assassin/CL trapping strategy, where they can be occed/happy houred/debbed for a number of nights, as The Executioner can Spread Panic (Magic barrier) the occupations.</description>

            <p>Their interaction would certainly be interesting and I was inspired by your win condition actually. I only dislike that your class will try to make the day more passive, unless he actively has to try and get people to pardon other people. Depending on the game it can be harder to execute or pardon someone on trial, obviously, so their different playstyles will definitely be intriguing. I feel my variant is more scum-sided, whereas yours is BD-sided. It typically takes only a few days to deduce all the scum and this class is trying to get rid of that time, whereas yours lengthens that time. Conversely the former’s time will be done in a more active manner and the latter will be handled more passively.</p>
<p>The Executioner would want to get rid of supports and offensives and would want to keep alive investigatives and killers, whereas the Merchant would want the complete opposite thing. They are true counter classes I believe.</p>

            <p>The voting does not have to be random. You can basically play as a BD-aligned Executioner, by playing like an unconvertable, usually death immune Barriering Court Wizard (old version), similarly how an Alchemist can emulate an unconvertable, usually death immune Physician. Voting up whoever you suspect as scum to end the game quickly.</p>
<p>In practice, your allegiance will typically shift to the faction that currently has the most members or you suspect will win in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>I have thought a bit about the cult/unseen dilemma, as I suspect cult games might take longer, but I cannot really think of a proper solution without giving 2 different versions for the 2 differernt games. I don’t have any hard data on the duration of either anyways, so it might not be necessary.</p>
<p>Infectious Bloodlust is not meant as a proving tool, since you cannot or should not fakeclaim Noble anyways. They would either need to change the Noble’s/Apostle’s/Aristocrat’s ability to also vote execute and have the same message appear or have a different message altogether. I envision this ability being typically useful lategame to side with some faction and force out trials in your favour. In a 1 vs 1 + Executioner situation, the Executioner can ensure that he will not be voted out if his claim is not believed (Possessor games for instance). In a 3vs2 (MM/Assassin) situation + Executioner, the Executioner can force a BD being voted out, to win the game with an Assassin doublekill plus convert plus poison dead or so, whereas early game you can use Leverage to spur on trials.</p>
<p>It is also ambiguous how an Executioner should react to a Prince on trial, as he is also a killer class that can end the game more quickly, but also slow it down by jailing other killers. This really depends on playstyle and I honestly cannot really say how this class would play out in the real ToL and will probably be played very differently depending on the player akin to the Alchemist role. There you have n1 yolobombers, backstabbers lategame, fake phys claims, d1 claims and complete BD alch. A true neutral role, hopefully.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of the Executioner, it can force BD to put people on trial but is scum-sided as the voting is random and could out a Prince or maybe kill more BD than ever. But I feel as if it’s more dependent on trials and frames. Of course it would have an easier time in an Unseen game but Cult game can be different, so it really depends on how the Executioner plays. So it needs investigatives to function more properly.</p>
<p>I still like the idea though, and maybe should the infectious bloodlust ability appear as Noble, Aristocrat, Apostle or Executioner to the victim of it? Of course it’ll be revealed if they vote execute as Political/Cult Pressure makes the person abstain.</p>

            <p>What do you guys think about this Addendum to Leverage:</p>
<p>Will be healed if king uses Order Execution and bumping it up to 3 uses?</p>
<p>It will still encourage the King to take action, but he can spare some more time.</p>

            <p>He still has to survive to win though, so he cannot just randomly start voting people up and expect to win the game like that. Do you have any suggestions for improvement or do you think the core mechanic is fundamentally flawed?</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong> The Executioner is a class whose main reason for existing is the encouragement of day execution. He remains neutral in the following ways, but is relatively scum-sided still. Spread Panic functions exactly like magic barrier and can prevent conversions plus evil occupations/redirections in that way. Leverage is still a way to kill an evil king and might spur a BD king into being more proactive. Encouraging day executions is pro-BD sided, but the way in which he does it might not be beneficial to BD. He has many functions that allow more claim flexibility. A king can now fake being Leveraged in order to be more aggressive and can blame his Decide Fate decision on a possible Executioner tampering with him. Spread Panic also allows more room for the Scorned target defense. He should not spawn with Fool in my opinion as a Fool execution will usually result in The Executioner’s loss.</p>
<p>This is a rough draft of what I think is interesting. Other night abilities that could replace Spread Panic are empowering attackers in some way or occupying support classes. Let me know your thoughts. I have thought about losing the night immunity and changing his win condition to not having to survive.</p>
<p>Another thing I would like to mention is that this counters the Assassin/CL trapping strategy, where they can be occed/happy houred/debbed for a number of nights, as The Executioner can Spread Panic (Magic barrier) the occupations.</p>
