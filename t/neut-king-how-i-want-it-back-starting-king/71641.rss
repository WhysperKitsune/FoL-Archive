    <description>Neutral King faction: king
Night ability 1: guards: 3 charges (2 more for starting neutral/good king)
Night ability 2: Choosing sides: (1 charge) choosing sides makes the neutral king side with a specific faction and will share there goals. If unseen/cult he is now sided with them. If neutral killing the neutral killing will be informed of the king joining them in there cause. if a neutral class of any sort he will share there goals and the neutral will know of kings choosing side. if blue dragon he wins with bd but the bd will not know he has become a member of bd.
day abilities are the same as usual</description>

            <p>You bring up a very good point Qwert, no Neutral king would claim neutral king, here’s why:</p>
<p>Say you claim Neut king d1<br>
There is very little reason for BD not to lynch you immediately, no Good King in their right mind would claim Neutral King; therefore, BD can happily trial and execute the king and expect him to flip neutral king or on the rare occasion, evil king, and get up a confirmed BD as king</p>

            <p>I like this idea in principal, as it opens up new avenues for the king to go in regards to how both kings will play in the late game, as well as how Evil kings may choose to act.</p>
<p>My problem is with how this will work out in practice: Namely, on the starting kings faction roll, does it cut into how often Good king spawns?</p>
<p>Or how often Evil King spawns?</p>
<p>If neutral king spawns replacing some good king spawns, BD can simply execute the king and get one of their own up as king. If the chance of Good King spawning is less than 50%, this is the case.’’</p>
<p>However, if he spawns replacing Evil king spawns, then from the perspective of the evils, it is like having an alchemist as King, BD until late-game.\</p>
<p>Tl;dr I think this is a good idea, but I don’t think it would work replacing either some of the Good Kings spawn rate or the Evil Kings spawn rate</p>
