    <title>[Small Swear Fealty Rework Suggestion]</title>

    <description>What do people think of making it so Swear Fealty fails on unique classes but does not feedback to the king? 

My intention would be to nerf mystic meta and to an extent hunters as well which are fairly confirmable. 

One bad thing I can see from this change is people will have a lesser preference for these classes as it is generally easy to tell when they have been converted, and this will happen a reasonable amount of time especially if they are not outed.

In short, these classes will be at a disadvantage if they are convertible and become pocket princes.</description>

            <p>I see no reason why it should.<br>
It doesn’t matter if it’s unique they can always kill the mystic.</p>
