            <p>Technically the CL isn’t a Killer class. Plus, for killing classes that aren’t Killer there is also the Inquisitor, the Butler, the Paladin, the Starting King, and the Alchemist. A full list of killer roles that qualify for the Savior’s wincon would be appreciated. Plus, if it’s only the Killer type, 6 may be too much to the point that they don’t spawn at all.</p>
