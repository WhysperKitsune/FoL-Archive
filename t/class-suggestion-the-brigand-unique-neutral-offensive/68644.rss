    <description>**The Brigand** (Unique Neutral Offensive) - AKA Neutral Nuisance

**Goal: Steal from 5 different targets.**

Day Ability 1: **Mimic** (2 uses)
Utilise your stolen ability tonight.

* The limited-use ability you take from a targeted player using _Steal_ or _Mug_ will be banked in your Day ability, **Mimic**.
* You may choose to activate this ability in order to use one of your stolen abilities, which will be used that night alongside your standard Night abilities.
* These abilities do not count as visits.
* You set the parameters for these abilities during the day. For example, if you choose to _Mimic_ the **Invoker**&#39;s _Chains of Corax_, you would select which targets would be affected at that time.
* If you do not select your parameters by the time the day is over, the _Mimic_ is not used up and nothing happens.
* You will be notified if your _Mimic_ failed in any way at the end of the night, with the appropriate response given depending on how it failed.


Night Ability 1: **Steal**
Steal an ability from your chosen target.

* This will take a use of a limited-use ability away from your target, and give you the option to _Mimic_ it at a later date.
* For example, if you were to _Steal_ from a **Noble** or **Aristocrat**, you would remove one use of their _Maid Spy_ abilities, and add that to your collection of _Mimic_ abilities.

**The full list of abilities that would be stolen from the Thief:**

* **BLUE DRAGON:**
1. **Butler** - _Concentrated Wine_
2. **Court Wizard** - _Tornado_
3. **Drunk** - _Happy Hour_
4. **Hunter** - _Wolf Companion_ (Not Mimic-able)
5. **Knight** - N/A
6. **Mystic** - N/A
7. **Noble** - _Maid Spy_
8. **Observer** - _Window Peek_
9. **Paladin** - _Smite_ (Not Mimic-able)
10. **Physician** - _Self-Care_
11. **Prince** - NA
12. **Princess** - _Will-o-Wisp_
13. **Sheriff** - _Surveillance_

* **UNSEEN:**
1. **Alcoholic** - _Happy Hour_
2. **Assassin** - _2-For-1_ (Not Mimic-able)
3. **Aristocrat** - _Maid Spy_
4. **Duchess** - _Dark Wisp_ (_Mimic_ gives _Will-o-Wisp_)
5. **Enforcer** - _Protection_ (Use on self)
6. **Herbalist** - _Drug_
7. **Illusionist** - _Mental Blur_
8. **Marshal** - _Snoop_
9. **Mastermind** - N/A
10. **Nightwatch** - _Watch Carefully_
11. **Poacher** - _Spike Traps_
12. **Sage** - _Wall of Fire_ (_Mimic_ gives _Tornado_)
13. **Servant** - _Concentrated Wine_

* **CULT**
1. **Apostle** - _Mind Warp_
2. **Cult Leader** - _Eradicate_ (Not Mimic-able)
3. **Invoker** - _Chains of Corax_
4. **Ritualist** - _Teleportation_
5. **Seeker** - _Gaze_

* **NEUTRAL**
1. **Alchemist** - _Emerald Potion_ (Not Mimic-able)
2. **Fool** - _Hide_
3. **Inquisitor** - _Ruthless Efficiency_ (Not Mimic-able)
4. **Mercenary** - N/A
5. **Possessor** - _Possess_ (Not Mimic-able)
6. **Reaper** - N/A
7. **Scorned** - _Frame_
8. **Sellsword** - N/A
9. **Sorcerer** - _Circle of Death_ (Not Mimic-able)

* If you attempt to _Steal_ from the **Prince**, the **Mystic**, the **Mastermind**, a target who has no limited-use abilities, or a target which has run out of their limited-use ability, your steal will fail, and you will get a message saying that you could not steal from them.
* If you _Steal_ a target&#39;s use of a limited-use ability that would allow you to kill a target, the ability is taken, but is not added to your collection of _Mimic_ abilities.
* If the target that you _Steal_ from would use up their last use of their limited-use ability (e.g. if you attempt to steal a **Drunk** or **Alcoholic**&#39;s final _Happy Hour_ as they choose to use it that same night), they will use that ability and you will receive the aforementioned failed steal message.
* If you attempt to _Steal_ from a **Hunter** that uses their _Bear Companion_ that night, you will not die, but you will fail to steal from them.
* Your target will be notified that they have been stolen from.
* You can only _Steal_ from a target once, unless you have been redirected to target them again.
* If your target dies that night, you will still _Steal_ from them, however a message will appear the next day saying the dead have been desecrated, effectively announcing the existence of a **Brigand** to the court.
* You cannot target the King.


Night Ability 2 (Optional): **Mug** (2 uses)
Threaten the target you steal from into silence for a day.

Identical to _Steal_, but with the following changes:

* The target you _Mug_ will not only have their limited-use ability stolen, but also will not be able to talk, whisper, or vote the next day.
* If you attempt to _Mug_ the **Prince**, the **Mystic**, the **Mastermind**, a target who has no limited-use abilities, or a target which has run out of their limited-use ability, your mugging will fail, and your target will still be able to talk, whisper, and vote the next day.
* If the target that you _Mug_ would use up their last use of their limited-use ability (e.g. if you attempt to steal a **Drunk** or **Alcoholic**’s final _Happy Hour_ as they choose to use it that same night), you will steal that ability instead, and they will be prevented from using their ability.
* If you attempt to _Mug_ a **Hunter** that uses their _Bear Companion_ that night, you will fail to steal from them, and you will be killed as if you were attacking the Hunter.

Comments:
Once this class has achieved its goal, it loses its Day and Night abilities and becomes an extra vote for whichever faction can lure it over.</description>

            <p>This class should not be able to determine alignments so easily. It is not relevant to their objective and makes them able to play BD-aligned really easily. Stealing from an unseen/cult/neutral should not give the Brigand an unseen/cult/neutral skill.</p>
<p>Thief is also a way more appropriate name I think, but your call.</p>
<p>I think silent stealing is also a lot better than confirming to your target that there is a brigand, making it impossible to fakeclaim. It should just give a prevented message once the one who technically has no more skill uses (even though it shows there are still skill uses) uses the skill.</p>
<p>This version of Brigand is super confirmable and really BD-sided.</p>
<p>Also he should have some form of survivability like every other neutral has. He needs to survive at least 5 nights after all minimum. Should also be occupy immune in my opinion, he cannot afford to miss nights.</p>
