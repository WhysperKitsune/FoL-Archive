    <title>Being occupied should not make you lose charges</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/being-occupied-should-not-make-you-lose-charges/44910</link>
    <description>Right now, being occupied while using a limited charge ability uses up the charge. I find this frustrating since I lose a use of it for doing nothing. I would rather have the ability fail, and no charge expended.</description>

            <p>Shocked how little replies there are for this. I sparked a discussion on this exact thing last night on the Feedback Discussion channel on the Discord. Want to add Prevention as well as Occupied, but yeah, definitely support.</p>
<p>Using your ability on an immune target is fine to lose a charge; that gets you information, such as “oh they were immune to this”. Losing your ability charges due to occupation or prevention just feels like “oh great, so glad I wasted that charge” and you simply have no way of knowing. Occupation/Prevention already has you wasting a night; to add wasting the charge to it just makes it even worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Prevention should still consume the use as it prevents you from Targeting a SPACIFIC player which can be counterplayed by targeting people that others don’t expect you to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If anything, Prevention should definitely be the one to not lose charges since it’s almost always a Prince Jailed target, though could also less commonly be a Merc’s Contract being guarded or a Fool hiding, while Occupation is specifically targeting you.</p>
<p>That said, I’d still want the change to both.</p>

            <p>/Support 100%. The way it is now encourages passive play while you are under suspension.</p>
