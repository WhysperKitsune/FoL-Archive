    <description>## Disclaimer: This is not a full idea, just some partial ideas

Idea 1: Instructor (Blue Dragon Special/Support)
Night Ability 1 - Retrain - Choose 1 person and a blue dragon class, then visit this person, occupying them, and, if they are Blue Dragon, making them that class - 2/3 uses (Requires Sheriff to not make Knights)

Idea 2: Instructor (Black Rose Special)
Night Ability 1 - Retrain - Choose 1 Black Rose member and a Black Rose class, then visit this person, occupying them, and making them that class - infinite uses, 1 night cooldown (Requires [Tactical kills](http://forum.imperium42.com/t/tactical-mafia-kills/96) and would replace Mastermind in some modes)

Idea 3: Not a new class
New Night Ability for Cult Leader - Retrain - Choose 1 Cult member and a Cult class, then visit this person, occupying them, and making them that class - infinite uses, 1 night cooldown (Does not require anything additional)

            <p>Underpowered for Blue Dragon, hindering to the Black Rose, and rather pointless for the cult.<br>
If you replace the Mastermind, you can’t convert, so all you’ll have is the Instructor and the Assassin, and unless you can train the Assasssin to be a Mastermimd, you’re pretty much sitting duck. Also, the BR can have a max of 3 members, so if there’s a Mastermind, Assassin, and the Instructor…yeah.<br>
For the cult, it’s generally not a good idea if you keep “reforming” members, instead of killing them if they’re spent. This might not apply when you have an awesome player in the cult, but that’s besides the point.<br>
I’ll discuss the Blue Dragon later, when I have time.</p>
