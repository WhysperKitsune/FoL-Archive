This took me a couple days to make with rethinking some abilities and trying to make each class balanced. Still need some help with the names. If you haven&#39;t noticed, this faction can&#39;t convert like the rest. So I tried to make it balanced between all classes. Please comment and tell me what you think and if this would fit.</description>

            <p>Doesn’t matter. KPN is the most important part of a factions strength and deception is the second which is best achieved by conversion combined with suicide accusations. This faction is worse at both.</p>

            <p>That would be true too. Maybe CW shouldn’t spawn in these games. But what do you think of the classes? To underpowered or maybe overpowered?</p>

            <p>I worked on this for a couple of days trying to balance it out. Yes this would make classses like psychic confirmed and more powerful but the third eye members have abilities to hunt down classes like that</p>

            <p>More like a traditional Mafia game. Nothing wrong with that, but this game is built on conversion. Not sure this fits the game.</p>
