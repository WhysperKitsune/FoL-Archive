    <title>Possessor wins VS MM even when he is poisoned</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-wins-vs-mm-even-when-he-is-poisoned/24542</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
3 players remained: Possessor, Assasin and MM. Possessor had already used body jump. Assasin poisoned Possessor at day, then at night Possessor kills Assasin. Possessor immediately wins.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Since Possessor was poisoned, he would die after next night and Unseen would win since Possessor can&#39;t kill MM. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
Read above.

#### Comments:
I know that Possessor VS MM is considered as win for Possessor since he has low winrate, but when he is poisoned that should be clear win for Unseen.</description>
