    <description>I feel like it is kinda unfair for sorcerer to have it&#39;s hunter be unkillable.</description>

            <p>Neutral killers like Reaper and Possessor almost never win. It is similar with Sorcerer - he almost never wins, so Inquisitor is in good spot, because of it - he just needs survive long enough to see Sorcerer die. This class is bound to have high win ratio, because Sorcerer is bound to have low win ratio. Now, he has only one night of immunity, which seems reasonable, I don’t really see how Inquisitor should be nerfed (no protection at all at night seems too harsh…)</p>

<p>Yes, I really like this solution the best: Immune to death at night <strong>once</strong>.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess we can test it: As of last patch, it was changed to this!</p>

<p>Agreed there… all you really need to do, is inquire about who the magic users are… it’s basically like a sheriff explaining why he’s found no cult members on day 6… “I found nothing” only gets you so far.</p>

            <p>This is a bad strategy. All the other neutral killers leave telltale signs of what they are. People will start shouting about being possessed or noticing people got reaped by their logs.</p>
<p>If someone fake claims inquis they will be instantly killed once people realize that the NK isn’t a sorc. I’ve <em>never</em> seen an inquisitor get hanged. I’ve also <em>never</em> seen a sorc win.</p>
<p>As sorc, you can’t fake claim inquis or else the real inquis just kills you. The real inquis is death immune and essentially un-fakeclaimable and no one will ever vote to hang him because doing so would be viewed as supporting evil since he’s viewed (correctly) as a much much bigger boon to the BD than to the evil classes.</p>

            <p>Night immunity is too much. They can literally just say “I’m inquisitor” day 1 and everyone will leave them alone. Evils can’t kill them and their win condition is basically a certainty if they don’t bleed to death or get hung. Inquisitor claim is so good that I’ve seen reapers and possessors claim it and be left undoubted until day 6-7.</p>
<p>Neutrals cannot have 0 risk and be only beneficial for BD at the same time. Inquisitor would be balanced without the night immunity, they wouldn’t have a free ride to victory every game if they had to actually avoid being outed and potentially killed.</p>

            <p>What did I propose? Oh, right, a high-risk ability that allows Sorcerer to kill the Inquisitor.<br>
I am well aware that there IS a problem.<br>
And yes Inquisitor can kill sorcerer Night One but attempting that umm… has its own drawbacks for the Inquisitor: They can only attack thrice(maybe you could argue that it should be only twice if you think that Inquisitor is still too strong with that…).</p>

            <p>Fully correct, but the Prince is part of BD and BD can win with them dead. The Inquisitor cannot win when dead before sorc dies. The ability I was suggesting pierces Night Immunity, one time, and is designed to stop exactly that… at claim.<br>
Please do not forget that the Sorcerer is helping the bad ones, they don’t need them dead. This means that Inquisitor can be a bit more bd-sided.</p>

            <p>IMO the 2 tweaks I’d like to see, and I’m agreeing with most the feedback here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inq is not immune to sorc. (or perhaps has a one time use protection from sorc for 1 day), or maybe the sorc can get a 1 or 2 time, bypass inqs immunity ability.</li>
<li>After inq wins, he should not be able to continue to use his detection/killing abilities.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>Sure… if the Sorc happens to hit them, which is pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>You’re more likely to lose a Prince N1 than an Inq since there are probably 2-3 kills flying around that can hit them.  Being only able to be hit by ONE person in the game is a pretty good defense, especially since he can more or less do it himself.</p>
<p>The Dark Ritual idea could also work.  In the end the Sorc needs a way to fight back and there needs to be something to disincentivise just calling out “I’m Inq” immediately and loudly since you know it’s basically failsafe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be fine if inquisitor was not immune to sorcerer</p>

</aside>
<p>That could also work.</p>
<p>It would keep Inq from openly claiming and they’d try to lie a bit since they knew a Inq claim would likely mean they’re dead.</p>

            <p>No, that would be too easy. 1 kill per night can leave Inquisitor dead N1… that is not supposed to happen.<br>
I refined my idea and:<br>
<strong>Dark Ritual(1 use), Day:</strong> Your target will die tonight if they do not visit you. This pierces Night Immunity. You cannot attack tonight.</p>
<p>is a way better idea. Its usage has serious drawbacks but an obvious Inquisitor will die(unless you were also obvious, or Inquisitor guesses right)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the sorcerer is dead they won and shouldnt care if they die afterwords</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but the real issue is, BD knows  not to bother executing them, and they still have all their investigating and magic users/cult killing powers. They should at the very least lose all that, and become like a won scorned. IE a scorned loses his trollbox after he wins and can no longer frame his second target.</p>
