    <description>The Unseen have won. New Unseen members flooded into the castle, with a promise of power and money. Their former enemies, the Blue Dragon and the Hand of Byzantium, have been entirely wiped out. Or so they thought, until they found the Marauder dead, a knife in his back and a note attached.
&quot;*We will take back our lands and overthrow your reign of terror.*&quot;
# Welcome to SFoL 67: Last Stand of the Virtuous III !
## Hosted by @EliThePsycho and @Arctic

Phase Length:
Day Phase: 48 Hours
Night Phase: 24 Hours
Day 1: 24 hours but no execution
Game will start soon after it is filled.


**Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB**


[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color] = Scum Killer
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color] = Scum Converter

Game Setup: 18 players
King (60% [color = purple] **Corrupted**[/color], 40% [color = steblue] **Righteous** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Purified**[/color])
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color]
[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color]
[color = purple] **Duke** [/color]
[color = purple] **Marshal** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]

[color = grey] **Random Neutral Non-Killer** [/color]
[color = grey] **Neutral Killer** [/color]

18-er, King, 12-13 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 2 BD or HoB, 1 NK

**Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 4 players alive (with exceptions for specific Nks). If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.**
**The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert night 1, and all conversions have a 1-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to three members alive.**
**The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Grand Trial or Royal Pardon, and if the latter, on who.**
**&quot;No Execution&quot; is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer &quot;No Execution&quot; to end the day early without an execution. If &quot;No Execution&quot; is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.**
**No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.
Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.
If there is nothing that can stop one of the main factions or the neutral killers from winning, the game will end in a victory for whoever it applies to.**

&gt;# [color = darkred] The Ifrit [/color] :shield: :fire:
&gt; **[color = darkred] Neutral Killer [/color]**
&gt;**Djinn Form (Passive)** - Grants you immunity to occupation, redirection, bleeding, and death at night.
**Burning Transformation (Day)** - Upon killing a target, you will cause them to flip a class of your choice. If you successfully kills a player this night, you will be able to see their true class. - 2 uses
**Heat Wave (Day)** - Occupies all targets who try to visit you the coming night. Bypasses immunity to occupation. - 3 uses
**Incinerate (Night)** - Kills a player by burning them alive. Players that have been incinerated will have their logs erased. Only you will see the player&amp;rsquo;s original logs. - Infinite uses :crown:
**Fires of Jahannam (Night)** - Prevents all visits to the target player and attacks them, erasing their logs if they die. - 3 uses :crown:
_Your objective is to make it to at least (possibly fewer depending on the state of BD / HoB) the last four players alive while the Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium do not hold a majority over the court on their own._
---
&gt; # [color = slateblue] The Lich [/color] :shield: :fire:
&gt;**[color = slateblue] Neutral Killer [/color]**
**Phylactery (Passive)** - During Day One, you shall specify two players to be our Phylactery Holders. If you fail to do so before the end of the day, they are randomized. They can not choose The King to be their holder, nor can The King be a randomized Holder. You will know their starting classes, and will be night immune while at least one of them lives. If both of them die, you will die the following night. Investigations against the Phylactery Holders will also yield the additional message “You feel a chill surrounding the target player. They are a Phylactery Holder for The Lich.” If your Phylactery Holders die, this fact that they are one will be included with their class information.
**Undeath (Passive)** - As long as the Phylactery Holders are alive, at the start of every night you will automatically revive yourself if you are dead, regardless of how you died.
**Spectral Mist (Day)** - A target Phylactery Holder is healed tonight. - 3 uses
**Black Fog (Day)** - Attempts to investigate either of the Phylactery Holders will fail tonight. - 3 uses
**Finger of Decay (Night)** - Kill a player. If you were revived at the start of the night, then this attack bypasses night immunity and healing. - Infinite uses :crown:
**Death’s Curtains (Night)** - Kill one of your Phylactery holders (bypasses night immunity and healing), and two other targets. - Infinite uses, but only usable while you have two Phylactery Holders alive :crown:
_Your objective is to make it to at least (possibly fewer depending on the state of BD / HoB) the last four players alive while the Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium do not hold a majority over the court on their own._
---
&gt;# [color=orange]The Mind Flayer :shield: :fire:[/color]
&gt;
&gt;[color=orange]**Neutral Killer**[/color]
**Insanity (Passive)** - You are immune to death at night, occupation and redirection. You are immune to bleeding, and are informed of being bled.
**Mindstorm (Passive)** - Once per night you may guess a player’s class. If you are correct you will empower your attack **Brain Destruction** to bypass protections. This passive will be disabled if you guess incorrectly twice. Cannot Target the King, nor can target the same person after a successful guess.
**Mind Read (Day)** - Mimic one of the main night investigative abilities of an Unseen Investigative class, targeting a player of your choice. After using one once, cannot use abilities from different classes. Will return results at the end of the night. - 4 Uses
**Brain Destruction (Night)** - Kill a player. - Infinite Uses :crown:
**Shape Knowledge (Night)** - Use an ability belonging to a player you have killed with Brain Destruction on a player of your choice. You cannot use these abilities more than once, and certain abilities are denoted as not able to be used. For non-killing abilities, they may be done alongside Brain Destruction. Cannot use conversion. - Infinite Uses
_Your objective is to make it to at least (possibly fewer depending on the state of BD / HoB) the last four players alive while the Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium do not hold a majority over the court on their own._
---
&gt;# [color = orchid] The Succubus [/color] :shield: :fire:
&gt;**[color = orchid] Neutral Killer [/color]**
&gt;**Dependency (Passive)** - If you die during the night or you are executed, all drained players will also die with you the following night.
**Transfer Life (Day)** - Allows you to kill a drained player overnight, provided they are not healed or night immune, during the coming night and transfer their remaining life in turns to another drained player. This will also heal the latter player. If you transfers to yourself, then you will gain a charge of Love&amp;rsquo;s Malady instead. If the first player is healed then the ability will still function but without the first player dying. - Infinite uses :crown:
**Infatuation (Day)** - When this ability is activated, all drained playerfs will have their votes locked to a target for the remainder of the day. - 2 uses
**Vital Drain (Night)** - Learns the target player&amp;rsquo;s class type and will drain them to death over the next two nights. While there is at least one player being drained then you will heal yourself if you are attacked or bleeding. If a drained player is healed then their timer until they are drained to death will not lower for the night but neither the healer nor the player will be notified. Does not count as an attack. - Infinite uses :crown:
**Love&#39;s Malady (Night)** - Makes the user immune to occupation and redirection for the night and instantly kills a player while bypassing Night Immunity, healing, and does not count as visiting. - 0 uses :crown:
_Your objective is to make it to at least (possibly fewer depending on the state of BD / HoB) the last four players alive while the Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium do not hold a majority over the court on their own._
