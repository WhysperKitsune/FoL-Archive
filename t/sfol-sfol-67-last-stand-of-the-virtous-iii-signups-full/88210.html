<p>18-er, King, 12-13 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 2 BD or HoB, 1 NK</p>
<p><strong>Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 4 players alive (with exceptions for specific Nks). If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.</strong><br>
<strong>The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert night 1, and all conversions have a 1-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to three members alive.</strong><br>
<strong>The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Grand Trial or Royal Pardon, and if the latter, on who.</strong><br>
<strong>"No Execution" is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer “No Execution” to end the day early without an execution. If “No Execution” is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.</strong><br>
<strong>No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.<br>
Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.<br>
If there is nothing that can stop one of the main factions or the neutral killers from winning, the game will end in a victory for whoever it applies to.</strong></p>
