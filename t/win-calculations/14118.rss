    <description>A couple issues with some win calculations

When Reaper and King are left it gives win to the King. 
This happened today where MM was executed and the game ended there. I had enough souls to bypass night immunity and reap king before he would get a chance to accuse me.

When Hunter and Evil King are left it gives win to the King. In my opinion this should end in a draw because of the Retribution ability.

Old bug might be fixed in this version but if a scorned target gets executed that causes the game to end the scorned does not get credit</description>

            <p>I’ve never ended up in that scenario, but I’ll take your word for it.</p>
<p>And King can accuse Hunter… and then die from it.  In my experience Hunter would win instantly at that point, which I <em>have</em> seen before.<br>
So it has to be a draw since neither can deal with the other.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve seen this happen as well.  Reaper had 2 souls, just him and King going into night after an execution.  King got win even though there was no way on Earth Reaper could have lost other than falling asleep.</p>
<p>Hunter/Evil King is interesting.  It would end up a tie unless Hunter has a wolf, then he could win.  Unless the Hunter retribution goes first (and I’m fairly sure it does based on other scenarios where it ended a game).  I mean it’s still a draw since the Hunter can’t kill the King, I guess.</p>
