    <title>Cult is too weak</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cult-is-too-weak/9352</link>
    <description>Anyone else feel like the cult is too weak? At the moment, there are too many conversion immune targets. Priest, alchemist, fool, and other neutral killers, prince, etc. The cult leader needs to get really lucky with converts from day 1 or the game is already lost. If there is a court wizard, then it becomes even harder to get lucky with RNG.

IMO, the first cult leader needs to be immune to checks at the beginning of the game, just like the Mastermind. Or the other cult members need more useful things to do. Eradicate, for instance, could be given to one of the followers instead of forcing the cult leader to choose between adding new members and killing people.

Right now, the cult leader starts the game trying to convert people. That means he doesn&#39;t have the chance to kill anyone. Too many games have ended on Day 2 or 3 with the cult leader getting picked out, no new converts into the cult, and from there it&#39;s just a slow gg with the next cult leader desperately trying to convert a BD before dying the following turn.

Even if the cult manages to survive the early game, it&#39;s almost impossible to win late game. If the prince and priest are still alive with a good king (or heaven forbid, an alchemist), almost nothing can be done to get past that block. As the cult, you are relying on an evil king or a neutral killer to get things done for you.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a cult victory since the latest patch, even with terrible BD teams. They are just too slow to get rolling and too weak at the end.

Unseen also suffers from the &quot;too many unconvertable types&quot; right now, but at least they still have the assassin and mastermind performing different roles. And the mastermind won&#39;t get picked off on Day 2 like it happens so often with the cult leader.</description>

            <p>Also with the changes to alc being able to cure nightshade and bleeding. This made them weaker even with the cult leader being able to bleed. That on top of the patch a week or so ago making physician more likely to spawn (I’ve seen 2 in a game on top of 2 alcs) makes it near impossible to get a bleed kill.</p>
<p>Also the other classes lacking in kill power. Yea the ritualist can empower to lol lfolk but that’s the only ability. The rest are misleading and distraction abilities. Upos noticing this I thought about making a class I threw up in the class subsection called the BloodLetter. He sets people up and if thoes hung then Mithras (the Blood God the cult is formed around) come in and smite 1 person and the bloodletter is sacrificed in the process. The class idea can be found here</p>

            <p>Easier said then done.  There can be 2 Alchs <em>and</em> a Physician in a game.  By the time you find them and kill them (which isn’t easy) you’re probably out of convertible people anyway at which point the exposed/rezzed Paladin has killed everyone but the last CL.  Assuming the Neutral didn’t just random you all at some point.</p>

<p>Pretty much.  Which at the end of the day is the same thing really.</p>
<p>So many convert immunities makes a cult game nearly impossible.  They only time I see them win, or even come close, is with an evil king or a completely inept BD.  Usually with a Reaper killing all the key BD roles by chance.</p>

            <p>I feel like when the game used to be bugged and there was no NK, cult had a better chance.</p>
<p>You had more conversion targets and you were sure your guys wouldn’t get random killed at night.</p>
<p>But keep in a mind a lot of cult leaders are bit newb and tend to try to convert confirmed unconvertable targets, sometimes kill instead of converting, and sometimes random convert instead of a confirmed convertable target.</p>
<p>I remember i had a game as evil king where i managed to drag the game to like day 10, but my cult guys had converted a single person, it was insane. These people generally blame rng, but at this point, i blame their skills.</p>
