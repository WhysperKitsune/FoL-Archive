## Factions / Mechanics

[color=green]**Faces**[/color] - the good faction with the wincon of: *You’re here to take down all the heels who would dare tarnish OMNIPLEX 2020.*
[color=red]**Heels**[/color] - the evil faction with the wincon of: *You’re here to bring back wrestling to what it should be, starting by ruining the faces and OMNIPLEX 2020.*

- Phases are 48/24
- The factional kill is assigned (can be done alongside other actions, but can be tracked/watched/roleblocked) 
- Scumchat active at all times
- FLAVOR IS NAI, with all character flavor being wrestlers who have been in at least one hell in a cell match (character flavor will be announced at sog)
- 200 post per player per day phase maximum, lifted an hour before EoD.
- Lynch system is majority + plurality.
- Action resolution system prioritizes scum PRs in instances of direct conflict.
- Full flips, but no logs
- Feedback for roleblocks will be given for investigative roles when they normally would receive results on that night but were interrupted (ex Parity Cop will not be informed if roleblocked on n1)

&gt; [color=green]**Face Vanilla**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; [record of hell in a cell matches]
&gt;
&gt; [flavor]
&gt; You have no special abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; *You’re here to take down all the heels who would dare tarnish OMNIPLEX 2020.*

[color=green]**IC**[/color]: At any point during the day, you may choose to reveal your alignment by doing your signature move. This may only be done once.
[color=green]**Role Oracle**[/color]: At any time, you may choose a player to reveal the role of (not alignment) when you die.
[color=green]**Role**[/color] [color=red]**Cop**[/color]: Each night, you may look up a player’s browser history in order to determine their role (but not alignment).
[color=green]**Trac**[/color][color=red]**ker**[/color]: Each night, you may stalk a player to determine who they visit, if anyone.
[color=green]**Parity Cop**[/color]: Each night, you may choose a target. Their alignment will be compared with the last person you successfully chose (if anyone).
[color=green]**Cop with n0**[/color]: Each night, you may determine a player&#39;s alignment. You start out knowing [x] is town due to your connections.

[color=green]**Bodyguard**[/color]: Each night, you may choose a player to protect. If they would have died otherwise, you will die in their place.
[color=green]**Doctor**[/color]: Each night, you may choose a player to protect from night kills by tagging them out.

[details=&quot;The Setup: READ THIS&quot;]



Roll a die 6 times and mark down the numbers obtained. The value of the roll corresponds to the type of role used in the game, with more rolls in the same grouping increasing the power of that type of role.

As clarification, amount of rolls for a given role type impacts what role will be in game.
So rolling invest 6 times will result in cop with n0

1-3 rolled = Investigation role
4-5 rolled = Preventative role
6 rolled = Killing role

|Number|Role|
|---|---|
|1I|Innocent Child|
|2I|Role Oracle|
|3I|Role Cop|
|4I|Tracker|
|5I|Parity Cop|
|6I|Cop w/ N0|

|Number|Role|
|---|---|
|1P|Bodyguard|
|2P|Doctor|
|3P|Roleblocker|
|4P|Jailkeeper|
|5P|Jailkeeper + Bodyguard|
|6P|Roleblocker + Doctor|

|Number|Role|
|---|---|
|1K|1-shot Vig|
|2K|2-shot Vig|
|3K|Vigilante|
|4K|Vigilante|
|5K|Vigilante + 1-shot Vig| 
|6K|Vigilante + 2-shot Vig|

Then I will fill out the rest of the slots with VTs so we get up to 10 town at the start.

--

Then, roll for mafia roles.
Roll a die (n-1) times, where n is the number of town power roles. Whatever number it lands on, mafia get that role.

Mafia:

|Number|Role|
|---|---|
|1|Roleblocker
|2|Roleblocker
|3|Jailkeeper
|4|Role Cop
|5|Tracker
|6|Watcher

You can get multiple of the same role.
I will then fill out the rest of the mafia with goons until there are 3 mafia

Test Rand 1: 546414

Gives 4 P so Jailkeeper
Gives 1 I so Innocent Child
Gives 1 K so 1-Shot Vigilante

Mafia Rand: 25
Tracker
Roleblocker

            <p>Oh yeah! <a class="mention" href="/u/sulit">@sulit</a> You handled LyLo very well. I don’t envy your position, because I know that being the accepted villager in LyLo is beyond stressful, but in the end, it worked out. And even if it didn’t work out, I would still be proud of you for taking so much time to evaluate from multiple angles.</p>

            <p>Also, great flavor. Made the game so much more fun to watch.</p>
<p>And finally, let us not forget who ACTUALLY carried the game and should be town MVP. Wait for it…</p>

            <p>Good game! Town did a good job. Wolves tried until the end. Great showing from oB_Light especially. I know they were fairly obvious to people like Astand, but they had WiM and tried, and that’s important!</p>
<p>Astand obviously did a great job and led town correctly throughout the earlygame and midgame, making himself obvious town in the process. After he died, sulit sealed the deal.</p>
<p>Good Vig shots, good cooperation in general. Nice job, guys.</p>
<p>And once again Derps deepwolfs to LyLo. This guy should be shot by vigs more often.</p>
