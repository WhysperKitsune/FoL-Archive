    <title>Is being a knight a death sentence?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/is-being-a-knight-a-death-sentence/71257</link>
    <description>I was just in a game where, after telling a prince who jailed me night 2 that I&#39;m a knight, he immediately outs me day 3 and everyone basically hangs me then and there.

If this is the way knights are, then this is a useless class, for what is one supposed to do? No one&#39;s going to be waiting for the knight to prove himself via Cold Steel (especially since there might not be anyone suspicious to CS).

So, what, stay quiet and hope no one targets you? Doesn&#39;t sound like a fun idea for a game. Claim something else and lie as Blue Dragon? Doesn&#39;t seem very smart.

So what&#39;s the deal with this class?</description>

            <p>That works too, my point is whatever the case, making the hard to trust classes easier to trust puts things in the wrong direction. The last thing we want is to make get all claims open or to one person and solve the game by executing the 5 people with easy to fake claims a better strategy than it already is.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d say the exact oposite, if anything we need to re-work more classes to make them harder for BD to trust. Not enough good claims is certainly one of the game’s larger problems right now.</p>

            <p>3 reasons in my mind why my claim is true in most situations:</p>
<p>1: If you are scum fake claiming Knight successfully then you are not expected to get information or produce feedback later on (much like with King)<br>
2: If you are BD Knight confirmed then you have a sword to use as leverage against people to get them to listen and a shield to keep your main supporters alive<br>
3: Getting confirmed as Knight is easiest if you are a skilled player who can properly take advantage of the Knight’s power in the first place</p>
