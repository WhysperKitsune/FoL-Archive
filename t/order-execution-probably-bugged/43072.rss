    <title>Order Execution probably bugged</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/order-execution-probably-bugged/43072</link>
    <description>KIng ordered execution n1 but failed to kill me, and I was a physician. Nobody healed me and I didnt get any message of being attacked or healed. I guess this ability has to be more straightforward? 
They thought I was MM and kept jailing me which later led to a lot of chaos.
