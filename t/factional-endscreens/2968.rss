    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/factional-endscreens/2968</link>
    <description>Here is my suggestion
when a faction wins, show some ending art

Ideas:

Blue Dragon: Everyone is sitting around the table laughing, drinking and having a good time, the Priest is blessing the drink or something and the Knight is hanging up his sword and making his way toward the party

Unseen: Castle Adiart is seen from the exterior surrounded by black rose flowers and flying the banner of the Unseen, the Mastermind and Assassin are walking away from the entrance, signifying that they are going off to conquer the next castle

Cult: Once again Castle Adiart is seen from the exterior, this time drenched in the shadow cast by a giant-sized Corax, Mithras(also giant) has a handful of helpless Blue Dragon members and is pulling them towards his open mouth, the Cult Leader is seen laughing evilly atop the castle&#39;s battlements

Neutrals:

Possessor: The Good King is seen, surrounded by the Possessor&#39;s glow, grinning maniacally and drinking wine surrounded by dead Blue Dragon classes

Reaper: The Reaper sits on a throne of skulls, his hood down revealing his spoopy head wearing a crown

Alchemist(Solo): The Alchemist is seen brewing a cauldron of Crimson Potion in her night room

Fool(Solo): Rain falls over a gravestone that simply states &quot;rest in peace&quot;, we see a happy fool in the background, transparent because he&#39;s a ghost

Mercenary(Solo): A shadowy figure hands the Mercenary a large sack of coins

Scorned(Solo): A rough sketch of one of the BD classes is shown painted over with a big red X, the X should be blood for extra effect

Neutral King(Solo): The King is seen on his throne with his head in his hands as several classes are shown dead

Over each art it would say &quot;[Faction/s] Win&quot;, perhaps in a different font for each faction</description>

            <p>Look</p>
<p>They leave with 2 because they start with 2</p>
<p>If this idea is ever picked up and the artists want to draw more than 2, that’s fine</p>
<p>But I’m not changing my fucking suggestion so drop it</p>

<p>Unseen can be smarter than that.</p>

            <p>No, I think the idea is that if 3 people all turned up claiming to be friends it wouldn’t work.<br>
Plus, you can’t plan for which classes get converted. I like the Unseen winscreen.</p>

            <p>Norm, Jammy got it spot on. I agree with all the points she made.</p>
<p>First off “A Victory party is throne” - someone who likes to correct spelling, you should at least get it right yourself. Also, why would Cult throw a party?</p>
<p>Second, why would there be a noose at all? Nobody in this game is being hung.</p>

            <p>Mercenary can’t win solo though, right? Whoever their target’s faction is will win with them. Otherwise, really awesome suggestions.</p>

            <p>Here is my suggestion<br>
when a faction wins, show some ending art</p>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<p>Blue Dragon: Everyone is sitting around the table laughing, drinking and having a good time, the Priest is blessing the drink or something and the Knight is hanging up his sword and making his way toward the party</p>
<p>Unseen: Castle Adiart is seen from the exterior surrounded by black rose flowers and flying the banner of the Unseen, the Mastermind and Assassin are walking away from the entrance, signifying that they are going off to conquer the next castle</p>
<p>Cult: Once again Castle Adiart is seen from the exterior, this time drenched in the shadow cast by a giant-sized Corax, Mithras(also giant) has a handful of helpless Blue Dragon members and is pulling them towards his open mouth, the Cult Leader is seen laughing evilly atop the castle’s battlements</p>
<p>Neutrals:</p>
<p>Possessor: The Good King is seen, surrounded by the Possessor’s glow, grinning maniacally and drinking wine surrounded by dead Blue Dragon classes</p>
<p>Reaper: The Reaper sits on a throne of skulls, his hood down revealing his spoopy head wearing a crown</p>
<p>Alchemist(Solo): The Alchemist is seen brewing a cauldron of Crimson Potion in her night room</p>
<p>Fool(Solo): Rain falls over a gravestone that simply states “rest in peace”, we see a happy fool in the background, transparent because he’s a ghost</p>
<p>Mercenary(Solo): A shadowy figure hands the Mercenary a large sack of coins</p>
<p>Scorned(Solo): A rough sketch of one of the BD classes is shown painted over with a big red X, the X should be blood for extra effect</p>
<p>Neutral King(Solo): The King is seen on his throne with his head in his hands as several classes are shown dead</p>
<p>Over each art it would say “[Faction/s] Win”, perhaps in a different font for each faction</p>
