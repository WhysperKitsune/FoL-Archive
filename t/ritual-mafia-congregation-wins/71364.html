<ul>
<li>Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch Phase</li>
<li>Ritual Phase lasts 24 hours</li>
<li>During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.</li>
<li>Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.</li>
<li>“The Ritual was interrupted” message means that the player’s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.</li>
<li>People can vote for themselves during Ritual phase, but not during Lynch phase.</li>
<li>Lynch Phase lasts 48 hours or until majority is reached.</li>
<li>You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.</li>
<li>If a lynch happens within the first 12 hours of the lynch phase and ritual targets’ haven’t been chosen a grace period will be given to pick the targets.</li>
<li>If the sacrificed player hasn’t picked their targets on time their ritual ability will be skipped. If said player is a heretic, other heretics will be able to choose a target for them. Ritual of initiation cannot be skipped this way, and if no one picks a convert target for any reason it will be picked randomly.</li>
<li>During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched.</li>
<li>Nights will be 24 hours long</li>
<li>During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.</li>
<li>Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.</li>
<li>The Heretics will have a day/night chat.</li>
<li>The most recent version of your logs will be shown when you die.</li>
<li>You can submit deathnotes on kills. These can be text or pictures.</li>
<li>There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get “You slept peacefully.” or “You died” as feedback. The exceptions are the following:</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
List of night results</summary>
<p>If you use an investigative ability are you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.<br>
<em>If an investigative ability fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action.</em><br>
<em>If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target’s class type is [class type].</em><br>
<em>If you receive a private message because of the Confession day ability: Someone sent you an anonymous message [message].</em><br>
<em>If a Blood Mage successfully kills a member of the Congregation with Collect Blood: You gained 2 extra uses of Barrier of Blood.</em><br>
<em>If a Medium uses Seance on a dead player: You got the following message from your Seance: [message].</em><br>
<em>If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious.</em><br>
<em>If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!</em><br>
<em>If one or more of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner’s Change of Faith: “At least one of your targets is a member of the Heretics!”</em><br>
<em>If none of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner’s Change of Faith: “None of your targets are members of the Heretics”</em><br>
<em>If you successfully predict a death with Oracle’s Prediction: You gained 1 extra use of All-seeing Eye.</em><br>
<em>If you use Clairvoyance on a player that didn’t visit anyone: Your target didn’t visit anyone last night.</em><br>
<em>If you use Clairvoyance on a player that visited someone: Your target visited [Player(s)] last night.</em><br>
<em>If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that wasn’t visited by anyone: No one visited your target last night.</em><br>
<em>If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that was visited by someone: Your target was visited by [Player(s)] last night.</em><br>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>You cannot target yourself with abilities unless stated otherwise.</li>
<li>Conflicting abilities will be cancelled. For example, two Enchanters trying to redirect the same player to different targets would cause said player to not be redirected at all.</li>
<li>Enchanter can only redirect targeted abilities (for example, you cannot force a blood mage to use barrier of blood on someone else).</li>
<li>Self-killing or suicide abilities cannot be healed or prevented in any way except being occupied or by Voodoo Link.</li>
<li>Dying because of Voodoo Link counts as a suicide.</li>
<li>If you are prevented from visiting one of your “Change of Faith” targets you will not be notified and get a result based on the remaining players.</li>
<li>If you are redirected during “Change of Faith” you will know you were redirected, but not to which player and get a result based on the new target.</li>
<li>If an enchanter redirects an ability that targets more than 1 player, only the first target will be redirected.</li>
<li>If your limited use ability fails for any reason you will still spend an use.</li>
<li>If a medium’s target is changed their abilities will fail instead.</li>
<li>Communication abilities like Seance and Clergy are instant so you cannot be occupied while using them.</li>
<li>A target of Channel Spirit will not get notified when the effect ends due to conversion.</li>
<li>The medium will visit the targets of the channeled spirit.</li>
<li>Starting warlock appears not suspicious only to Diviner’s “Divination” ability. Any other class or faction revealing effect will check him as a Heretic.</li>
<li>If the last Heretic is sacrificed, Town will NOT win, since the conversion triggers immediately (unless their Ritual abilities are disabled somehow).</li>
<li>If two Witch Doctors use voodoo link on each other and one of them dies, then both will die.</li>
</ul>
