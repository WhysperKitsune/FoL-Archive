    <description>*We found a note in Planterror&#39;s room. He seemed to have took his valuables and ran out of the castle. Guards are still looking for his whereabouts. The note reads:*

&quot;Hey all.

I want to get something straight before I begin. I love the community here on discord, and on the forums. But I think it&#39;s time I left and here&#39;s why.

First reason: I can&#39;t take much more salt. I&#39;m sick of game after game of throwing or stupidity or even some harrassment once in a while. I understand that that&#39;s part of a community but anything salty happens to me just about every other game.

Second reason: I need a break. Everyone needs this once in a while, you play a game that&#39;s fun, and once you get bored of it, you move on. I have over 300 hours on this game and I love almost everything about it. But I think it&#39;s time to move on.

Third reason: Internal issues. Right as it stands, I&#39;m too much on the video games. Not to mention the other countless reasons I need to work out first before I come back.

Who knows, I might return soon. But as it stands right now I need to quit.

I&#39;m gonna miss you all. I might still be on the forums once in a while.

-Planterror&quot;

*After inspecting the room it has shown traces of unseen and spike traps everywhere. He was confirmed to be a poacher. The guards have decided wait for him to return and imprison him for treason.*</description>

<p>But yes, See ya around dude. Should play FOL, 50% less salt and 20% less toxicity.</p>
