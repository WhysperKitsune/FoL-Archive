            <p><em><strong>Secondary Character Information</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Name:</strong></em>  Mabel Winterhart<br>
<em><strong>Age:</strong></em>  23<br>
<em><strong>Character Alignment:</strong></em> Unknown but appears to be neutral.<br>
<strong><em>Backstory</em></strong>:  Oh, where to start.  She was in the original Godcard serving as sort of muscle for Raul Long himself.  Together they terrorized New York,  even going so far as killing a member of the Olympus Group and forcing the good guys to form the notorious Iron God project,  a military project meant to combat Godcard users.  During their many exploits,  the two partners in crime developed a budding romance and ended up falling for each other.   Alas, that was short-lived.  After a grueling battle in the graveyard involving a particular villain,  Mabel ended up “accidentally” killing the man against Raul’s orders.  Raul,  mad as he was with the power of the Godcards already in his possession,  blamed Mabel for his missed attempt at getting a godcard and a result, not only broke off their deal but attempted to kill Mabel.  Mabel escaped with the help of Fade,  another Godcard user,  and has went into hiding.  During her time hiding,  she discovered an actual God living in the woods and also discovered the dire consequences of letting magic run loose in the world.   Mainly,  the reawakening of the Gods themselves and the possible,  at least in her mind, end of the known world.<br>
<strong><em>Appearance:</em></strong> <a href="https://kechake-stock.deviantart.com/art/Winterhearted-8-143240937" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://kechake-stock.deviantart.com/art/Winterhearted-8-143240937</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Card Information:</em></strong> Set,  Neutral Evil.<br>
<strong><em>Card Backstory:</em></strong> Set is the Egyptian god of Sand and Discord.  Seth represented everything that threatened harmony in Egypt. He was the brother of Osiris and Isis, as well as the brother/husband of Nepthys. He murdered his brother Osiris, then battled with his nephew Horus to be the ruler of the living.<br>
<em><strong>Card Powers:</strong></em> Generation 1:  <em><strong>Intuition</strong></em> -   User is able to detect backstabs and deception.</p>

            <p><strong>CHARACTER INFORMATION</strong><br>
<strong>Name(s) and/or Alias:</strong> Kaden Smith, AKA Agent Viper<br>
<strong>Age</strong>: 45<br>
<strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
<strong>Character Alignment:</strong> Lawful Evil<br>
<strong>Backstory:</strong> From a plain and uninteresting chldhood a young man showed up at the army, saying that he was to be recruited. He barely passed the physical tests, but on the mental tests Kaden Smith showed his true colours, showing a razor-sharp mind and an unstoppable drive to reach the top. In 5 years, after an honourable discharge at the rank of Captain, he joined the FBI.</p>
<p>As it happened, he rose through the ranks quickly due to his superiors being involved with several minor scandals that seemed to do nothing for him, yet after just 2 years he was the senior foreign agent. He’s known throughout the agency for always playing by the rules, but only by the letter. The only reason he hasn’t been fired is because his bending of the rules to their very limits benefits the FBI greatly.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A tall man with black hair, wearing a black suit and black tie always. He gives off an air of imperious seriousness, but his most defining feature is his eye color. He is not blind, but a rare genetic defect means that his eyes appear to be completely white unless you are starting right into them. There, you can see the shape of his pupils and his iris, which are both a very light grey.</p>
<p><strong>BLACK CARD INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Card Name/Figure AND Alignment:</strong> Ouranos (Lawful Evil)</p>
<p><strong>Card Generation:</strong>  2</p>
<p><strong>Card Backstory:</strong> Ouranos (Uranus), the Greek god of the sky and the origin of all the gods. He disposed of all the children you deemed to be disfigured and impure and cast them in chains to the pits of Tartarus, and was eventually murdered by his son Chronos.</p>
<p><strong>Card Powers:</strong></p>
<p>Generation 1 - <strong>Sky Affinity</strong> - The user’s physical strenght increases the higher above sea level they are.<br>
Generation 2 - <strong>Levitate</strong> - The user can float about 5cm above the ground at will.</p>
<hr>
<p>may actually try this time, as I said on the interest check. Probably going to only show up in force later in the RP</p>

            <p>Put all characters here so we won’t need to scroll up every time we want to see who’s what. Fill this sheet to start. <em>A like from me or Damafaud means the character is accepted.</em></p>

<strong>Backstory</strong>: (At least a solid paragraph. Occupation, etc)<br>
<strong>Appearance</strong>: (Written or a picture, preferably a picture)</p>

<p><strong>Card Generation</strong>: (Start off at 1st. Increase with RP progression.)</p>
<p><strong>Card Backstory</strong>: (Some basic info on the figure it represents. Just a basic overview. Don’t go overboard writing several paragraphs on me. <a href="http://www.mjyoung.net/dungeon/char/deity041.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">You can use this for reference.</a> Any god is good, no need to take from that site.)</p>
<p><strong>Card Powers</strong>: (Only the ones that the card has unlocked on the generation so far. Remember; the more attuned the user is to the card and the more he uses it - the faster its generation will grow. Each generation means an increase in power.)</p>
