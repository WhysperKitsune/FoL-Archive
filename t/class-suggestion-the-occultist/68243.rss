    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;] The Occultist [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Investigative [/color]** 
**Deja Vu (Day)** - Choose a player. You will know at the start of the night if they are the player that attacked/killed one of the targets of your previously used night abilities. - 5 uses.
**Astral Projection (Day)** - Tonight, you will enter a coma and perform your night abilities astrally. This makes you immune to occupation and redirection. - 2 uses.
**Guided Seance (Night)** - You will perform a seance aimed at a target player. If they are attacked, you will know the class that attacked them. This is not a visit and cannot be prevented, but it can be occupied/redirected. - Infinite uses.
**Psychometry (Night)** - You will examine the remains of target dead player and discover the class that killed them. - 4 uses.
*Defeat the Unseen or Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;] The Witch [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Support [/color]** 
**Astral Projection (Day)** - Tonight, you will enter a coma and perform your night abilities astrally. This makes you immune to occupation and redirection. - 3 uses.
**Dark Seance (Night)** - You will make the assassin&#39;s visit undetectable and grant them a Dark Sense that will prevent them from visiting a dangerous target. - Infinite uses.
**Psychometric Imprint (Night)** - You will rewrite the Mastermind&#39;s psychic imprint, making their visits undetectable and making them appear as the class of your choosing to any investigative abilities. - 4 uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

_**Notes:**_

1) Both the Occultist and the Witch are magic users.
2) The Witch&#39;s Dark Sense that she imparts on the Assassin works similarly to the Sorcerer&#39;s, preventing the Assassin from walking into a Hunter Bear or someone guarded by a Knight, or attacking one of their own teammates due to Court Wizard/Drunk redirection shenanigans.
3) Deja Vu provides specific information. For example, after you use Deja Vu on a target, at the start of the night you would get the following message: *&quot;Your target was the Assassin that killed [playername]!&quot;*. This works even if the target has changed classes (for example, if the assassin became a mastermind) or if the Possessor has swapped bodies. In the case of Puppet Strings, the attacker is the person that is controlled by the Possessor, not the Possessor themselves.
4) Psychometric Imprint overwrites the Mastermind&#39;s passive that prevents them from being detected by investigative abilities. It is advised not to use this ability without proper coordination with the Mastermind.
5) Psychometric Imprint and Dark Seance both allow the Unseen to bypass Sheriff Scouts.
6) Converts into the Seeker for the Cult.

            <p>The Witch is on a bit of the weak side. Psychometric Imprint is pretty much useless as in order for any real effect to happen BD must have a second living Occultist and even then it’s pretty situational. Dark Seance is a bit better, but can be limited at times. I suggest putting Dark Seance as the Witch’s primary ability and creating another one for it’s secondary.</p>
<p>I’m a bit busy right now, so I’ll have to review the Occultist later today.</p>

</aside>
<p>These two are pretty much the same ability used in different ways. I don’t see anyone using Guided Seance over Psychometry except on Day 1. I suggest giving Psychometry limited uses.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a really situational ability, and way weaker than Dark Seance, which has unlimited uses while this one doesn’t. I suggest changing it for something else.</p>
<p>Also, as many suggested Im not sure this class needs conversion immunity.</p>

            <p>It’s not really unconvertable, it’s simply the first attempt. This and randomly trying to convert the prince/a neutral is the same setback for Unseen/Cult and can be recovered from. I deliberately tried to make the Witch an appealing conversion target to make up for its difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Cleansing Reliquary (Passive)</strong> - The first time someone attempts to convert you, it will be prevented. Until this passive is spent, you will appear to be immune to conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Giving any sort of protection to ordinary BD classes like death immunity or conversation it’s a recipe: “How to buff BD in situation when they don’t need it”.</p>
<p>Even if he would be unique, 2 non-convertable townies is too much.</p>
