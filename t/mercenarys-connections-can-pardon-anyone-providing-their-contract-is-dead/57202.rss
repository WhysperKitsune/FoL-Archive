    <title>Mercenary&#39;s Connections can pardon anyone providing their contract is dead</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mercenarys-connections-can-pardon-anyone-providing-their-contract-is-dead/57202</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
When I rolled Merc I could use my day ability to pardon a player who was not my contract. This happened the day after my target died.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
According to the tooltip for Connections, the Mercenary should only be able to pardon if the person on trial is their contract. Last time I rolled Mercenary I could still pardon anyone through connections, regardless of who is on trial after my contract died.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1) Roll a Mercenary.
2) Have your contract die.
3) Have a person put up on trial the following day.
