    <title>Court Wizard Rework Contest</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-rework-contest/54598</link>
    <description>I’ve thought about it a little more, so here’s my entry for the Court Wizard rework. 

Day ability 1: Twinned Spell - All of your night abilities can target 2 players tonight instead of just 1. (2 uses)

Day Ability 2: Empowered Spell - Your spells gain a healing effect tonight, healing your target in addition to their original effects. (2 uses)

Night Ability 1: Shield - the same as barrier, but additionally grants your target immunity to bleeding/poison during the following day as well. (Unlimited use)

Night Ability 2: Entangle - Everyone visiting your target tonight is ensnared by magical vines, occupying them. (2 uses)</description>

            <p>I think it shouldn’t have occupy immunity</p>
<p>But that’s just me</p>

            <p>I should make mention that I’m not completely sold on the occupy immunity for this take on the CW, just figured I would include it and see what the general consensus is.</p>
