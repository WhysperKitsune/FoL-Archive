    <title>Court Wizard Rework [Contest]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/court-wizard-rework-contest/55887</link>
    <description>This is a joint project by myself, @PokemonKidRyan and @Whammerist. We first of all had a look at the rework competition definition of support in which it is as follows:

[quote=&quot;Ellie, post:1, topic:54572&quot;]
Court Wizard is a support, so should have support abilities. This means their abilities either protect or empower other players.
[/quote]

There are 2 main support for Blue Dragon at this time being the Physician and the Court Wizard. If the Physician protects other players, then we can have the Court Wizard providing a passive empowerment to other members of the blue dragon. 

The ideas had been thrown back and forth for many days in order to make sure that we could make the best product we can. Enjoy!

---- 

&gt;## [color=steblue]The Court Wizard[/color]
&gt;[color=steblue]**Blue Dragon Support**[/color]
**Magical Runes (Day)** - Your night ability will target the class you choose today - 3 uses
**Tornado (Night)** - Swap the room of 2 players switching all targeting abilities which would happen against each of them - 3 uses
**Magical Boost (Night)** - Improve the reliability of the target&#39;s ability tonight. They will not be informed that this has happened - Infinite use

&gt;## [color=green]Improvements[/color] 
&gt;[color=green]Based off of Magical Boost[/color]
**Investigatives** - Investigation will not be able to be tampered with
**Support** - Occupy and target switch immune
**Order Execution** - Execution will not be healable tonight 
**Offensive** - Goes through immunities
**Special** - Conversions go through everything tonight except night immunity (Ignoring Imprisonment, Smite and Merc Guard)
**Killer** - Bypasses immunity
**Social** - Switches Occupy Immunity (Fool/Scorned lose it to make them seem good. Mystic and Noble given it to prevent their abilities being messed with via occupation)

----

To explain magical runes a bit better, it is a limited use ability because it can be extremely powerful if used at the right time. You can attempt to give a boost to something which is potentially in the game via the use of the day ability with the magical boost night ability too (As it will auto target the chosen class). 
It also encourages deduction skills since it gets the player using the ability to think of what is alive and what they want to boost to give BD the best chance at different points of the game.

Edits:
CW no longer with barrier
CW becomes a boosting ability class 
Tornado becomes 3 use as suggested together by @NuclearBurrito and @Sam17z (Thanks!)</description>

            <p>I would also like to add that it’s heavily suggested on the OP of the contest to have this class empower the abilities of others.</p>
<p>So while yes, both of our classes indeed empower abilities, seems pretty short-sighted to call multiple utilizations of that concept “copying” others, even if both of ours are indeed class based.</p>

            <p>First of all, I’d like to say that when me and Wei were making these ideas, we didn’t (Or at least I didn’t) look into other ideas for comparison.<br>
However after reading that previous idea though Luxx, it seems it was a bit OP.</p>
<p>Should CW be able to be saved once?<br>
To me, it doesn’t feel like it should<br>
Especially if it also buffs.</p>
<p>Secondly, for the previous idea, they had an ability which buffs CW itself whereas our idea focuses on the importance of the BD as a whole, not being able to focus on protecting the self instead.<br>
This makes our idea unique to that one and while there are similarities, the differences are what matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to be able to give buffs to evils for a specific reason…<br>
It would encourage the deduction side of this game.<br>
CW needs to be confident they’re buffing the right thing.<br>
If they buff incorrectly, then they have negative consequences.<br>
Also, with the other buffs being as good as they are, something needs to counterbalance them</p>
<p>Thanks for showing that there are similarities. But it just shows that some others agree even if we disagree with the buffs they had suggested as a whole</p>

            <p>Magical Boost is essentially just a copy of this idea, but with 2 changes that would only <em>benefit evil</em>.<br>
