    <title>What do you guys think of balance after all the changes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-do-you-guys-think-of-balance-after-all-the-changes/9345</link>
    <description>I feel like the changes make the game a bit too heavily favored for BD.

With alchs spawning more frequently and a guaranteed priest in every game, it can be very difficult to win as cult. The bleed thing helps, but there&#39;s so many convert immune people in game now.

I mean I&#39;m still having fun, but I feel like with only 1 NK per game, and tons of unconvertable alchs/priest/prince/etc, and a buffed Hunter (which was a good change imo) in each game, the balance is way too shifted in favor of BD. 

So many cult games I&#39;ve been in are hit a convert immune -&gt; jailed -&gt; paladin outs 1 -&gt; eradicate backfires, etc.

I think it&#39;d be really cool if the devs posted winrates for each. From my anecdotal evidence I&#39;d say BD &gt;&gt; Unseen &gt; Cult. And for neutrals, ignoring fool/scorned, I&#39;d say Alch is the easiest to win on, followed by merc, followed by Possessor, with reaper being the hardest class in the game to win on.</description>

            <p>I agree I find it very difficult to win as cult. It is almost better to just eradicate until you take out the priest then to convert.</p>

            <p>Well its much funner to win as cult/unseen now, before the changes they were OP as hell.<br>
Now its looks like BD are favorite</p>
<p>How to win:</p>
<ol>
<li>discover who is the priest</li>
<li>kill the priest</li>
<li>discover who is the prince</li>
<li>kill the prince</li>
<li>win</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course good claims are also important<br>
every bad guy claims just drunk or butler, try somthing else</p>

            <p>Evil King’s main objective imo, is to waste as much time as possible and try to get priest/prince on trial and use power on them. Your objective isn’t to stay alive all game.</p>

            <p>Your role as evil king is pretty heavily about being sacrificial , similar to knights for bd . Onbviously if you are evil king you already have a great advantage this game already</p>

            <p>Yeah, I definitely agree with you. Cult is terrible now and unseen needs to get lucky to win.</p>
<p>The priest/alch/prince combo at the end of the game is almost unstoppable. The priest is immune to conversion, and the guy he rezzes is also immune. It’s almost impossible to get past the conversion immune block late game, even if the cult gets super lucky and isn’t outed early game. But in my experience, the cult is pretty much eradicated by Day 3, and then they’re just depending on the neutral killer to carry or for BD to be dumb and throw.</p>
<p>With a decent BD team, I don’t think I’ve ever seen the cult win. In fact, I don’t think I’ve seen them win against incompetent BD lynch mobs either. Even if BD lynches butlers, drunks, court wizards etc, they’re just removing possible conversion targets. And you still hit the priest/prince/alch combo at the end.</p>

            <p>Yeah good call, Evil King is among the hardest, I’d concede that. I almost feel like Evil King should get the same allies power as neutral king. At least then you could say “neutral isn’t an ally!” and not risk it. As it stands now, you investigate people and if you see they aren’t an ally you can pray that they’re neutral when you call them out or try the whole, “oh scorned target. crap” thing, but yeah, it doesn’t feel that good.</p>
<p>To be fair though, Evil King’s strength is essentially just that BD don’t have a king who is actively trying to help them. If they’re that hard to win on, it points quite a bit to the weakness of the evil factions themselves.</p>

            <p>You also forgot to mention how difficult it is to win with Evil King. For literally the entire game you have to sit there and stay quiet and hope nobody says anything (which never happens) or you have to try and target neutrals, or falsely accuse BD roles, which usually gets you hung. Evil king win rate (staying alive throughout the whole game) is pretty much at MAX 10%. They should just rename evil king to “sacrificial pawn” since it seems his only purpose is to die after hanging an important BD to help the cult/unseen win.</p>
