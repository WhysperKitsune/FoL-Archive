            <p>I would make consume soul a day ability. It would be more useful and would avoid the 3 night ability problem. Otherwise he is good. I like the Executive change too btw.</p>

            <p>[a] is the first target, the one who’s dream is being haunted, and [b] is the second target, the one who is appearing in [a]'s haunted dreams<br>
instead of [a] being unable to visit [b] <em>and</em> [b] being unable to visit [a], i think that it should only be [a] is unable to visit [b], because it makes sense that [a] can visit [b], because they’re too scared, and I see no reason why [b] cant visit [a]</p>
<p>if you want to keep the effect, maybe change it to be “you haunt the dreams of [a] and [b], appearing as the other, making them unable to visit each other until you use this ability on another player”</p>

            <p>By the time he is converted he will probably have like 5. That would last the whole game plus the 2 from the reap ability. His abilitys also give the unseen a bs amount of voting power.</p>
<p>Also just making sure you realize that without Executes, jailing is a glorified roleblock</p>
