            <p>that’s in your case that’s why there are converts and classes that can counter or fake claim offensive classes are arguable always gonna be super conformable, that’s why there is converts and counter classes of course this isn’t a perfect solution but it allows more creative ideas instead of citizen vs citizen.</p>
<p>I could agree with something like Noble twin that announces to everyone but hypothetically you can get your scum team to help you fake something like backfire.</p>

            <p>I can see your issue with whirlwind, but a lot of killers can be from previous occupy immune classes like a occupy immune Cult leader or assassin</p>
<p>A fix for this could make reaper bypass occupys on empowering.</p>
<p>Possessor maybe when they redirect a occupy immune target into attacking there target will bypass occupy’s and redirects and sorcerer obviously has counter to this.</p>
<p>So with those changes I think it could work and maybe limiting it to three uses, court wizards swap would have the same problem just with a little rng of backfiring unlike this I guess.</p>
<p>I feel like it’s main ability is too weak but I could see your issue and maybe having a weaker ability with a limited stronger ability is kinda good.</p>
<p>also the day points have <em>some</em> merit but obviously the class can be converted and a lot of offensive classes are very easily conformable.</p>
<p>Maybe a counter of SS gaining that as a day ability would be good and considering stone wall tells you if a players visit could be a good way of getting that as a fake claim.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this ability is the difficulty of counterplaying a one way bus driver.</p>
<p>Simply put, this ability allows the Magician to protect a target from far too many things, and doesn’t have any restrictions like merc guard does.</p>
<p>Let’s propose a scenario for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prince outs d1</li>
<li>There is no Sellsword</li>
</ul>
<p>This ability in and of itself saves prince from almost everything that could kill them, alongside being confirmable unlike a knight’s guard.</p>
<p>Reaper can’t kill, Poss can’t kill, Sorc can ‘potentially’ kill (albeit difficult considering physicians). The concept of a one-way bus driver is incredibly strong, and in practice the confirmability of it makes it even stronger.</p>
<p>I can’t quite propose something that would fix it, as the concept itself is unfun to play against if it can target players other than themselves.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is a fine ability, but should be rephrased to occupying instead of preventing for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>In addition, I don’t think the additional clause of ‘or yourself’ is necessary as you could just make it possible to target yourself with the ability given the occupy immunity native to the class along with the prior point. What I’m saying is that the additional clause is significantly too strong.</p>
<p>Upon further thought I believe that the idea struggles fundamentally to work out without being too strong. The ‘yourself’ clause makes the class incredibly difficult to kill while also giving it mass clear potential in the case that they do die.</p>
<p>I’d propose a change to remove the ‘yourself’ clause, and then make that clause into a day ability that ‘empowers’ their night ability.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s pointlessly confirmable.</p>
<p>Considering cooperation is significantly easier during the day than night (see gossip vs PoF), an ability like the prince’s jail or sheriff’s scout can instantly confirm the Magician to be what they say they are.</p>
<p>It can even be used with abilities like Inoculate/Exhume/etc.</p>
<p>The point that I’m getting across is that this type of ability is unbalanced in its ease of confirmability.</p>
