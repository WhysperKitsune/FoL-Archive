            <p>Allies helped King a lot, finding evils and such (or finding allies). But he didn’t need it. That’s why he has Order Execution instead. I’d find some other power to give it.</p>

            <p>Because she needs to be powerful, her goal is pretty hard (Survive to see King winning or step up and do it yourself) so 2 uses of Allies can help her a lot.</p>

            <p>Okay. Makes more sense.</p>
<p>Why does Queen need Allies?</p>

            <p>I think you dont understand the passive.</p>
<p>You DO NOT GET King abilities, you keep the Queen ones.<br>
Yes, 2 uses of Allies is powerful, but Queen needs it.<br>
No guards, no extra uses. Queen keeps the abilities.</p>

            <p>Yeah, so does it go on the list as whatever King is?</p>
<p>Order Jail seems useless to BD, as it prevents someone from being lynched, even if valid evidence comes up.</p>
<p>Still, Allies is Allies, regardless of uses.</p>
<p>I will do it myself means you keep Queen Power, an extra use of decide fate (even if you merge decide fares, it becomes 3 with the Royal Finger). And Allies and Order Jail is in addition to Guards! Also that would give you Guards and Death Immunity, so it would be used to protect allies.</p>

            <p>Queen faction is the same as King faction at the start.</p>
<p>Order Jail is occupation at Day, a special ability. Queen can use It to avoid a vote, avoid execution to a target because he is not in Court, or just to avoid the Assassin/Cult Leader poisoning</p>
<p>Allies on Queen has only 2 uses.</p>
<p>Passives are not the same as the other abilities. Royal blood and Immunity to death at night <strong>IF YOU STEP UP</strong></p>

            <p>Where does this fit on the list? It’s not a neutral, BD, or evil, so it would need somewhere to go.</p>
<p>Order Jail would suck to have used on you since you can’t speak to anybody. If you can’t even hear them, it’s ten times worse. It’s just not fun to have used on you. Also it’s pretty useless if you are BD sided.</p>
<p>There’s a reason we removed allies from the King. Since the Queen is with the King, they would just feed him Allies! results.</p>
<p>Also with the Passive, that results you in having 3 night abilities, and the same with the day abilities.</p>
