    <title>New Day Ability for Physician - Monitor someone to learn cause of death</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-day-ability-for-physician-monitor-someone-to-learn-cause-of-death/52113</link>
    <description>It would be like Scout, except if the person dies you will learn how they died.  For example, killed by assassin.  Possessor facelift.  Alch bomb.  Inq stab.  Circle of death.  Poisoned.  Wolfed.  DK.  ETC.

I think it would make phys a whole lot funner!</description>

            <p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/support-reworks/48995/20?u=uncannyluck">Covered here</a>, but basically the information it gives you isn’t particularly useful in just about every scenario. You can usually tell what you’re up against by the pattern of kills, and BD usually claim their kills.</p>
<p>But at least as a day ability you’re not letting someone be killed by using it.</p>

            <p>Exhume is a bad ability and should remain in the grave. As a day ability, it’s still bad but at least it’s not a trap option since you literally have no other choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The big part about this is the fact that NK and Evil Factions can hide for a certain amount. If there’s a Death N1, All Phys has to do is exhume them to determine the NK or the Evil Faction</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this version of exhume sugested by shrimpy was</p>
<p>“it would be like a scout, except if the person dies you will learn how they died”. It wasn’t described as the old completely useless one’s “Pick a dead guy, guaranteed to learn something”.</p>
<p>TBH I don’t really get what’s really powerful in the knowledge to begin with. With the exception of making sure the possessor isn’t going to do the totally origional trick of leave a sorc corpse, claim inq. There isn’t much that isn’t to me blatantly obvious by day 3. or just useless. The only really unique info you’ll discover is you can tell whether it’s a sorc or possesor game. (As reapers are obvious unless they aren’t killing), unseen/cult will be pretty much confirmed by the existance of a sheriff/pali, and unless you happen to line up with an observer there’s no real reason to care which was an unseen/cult and which was an NK kill.</p>
<p>As a freebie day ability, it can add something to a class that is short on abilities. I think phys is almost OP right now though and thus if it were added, it should be a freebie added to a class that has too little going on right now.</p>
<p>While I also think this class is semi-OP… CW is a viable option (only because I think the ability is near worthless, and people complain about CW being too boring even though he is pretty darn strong). Give it a name like divination or something.</p>

            <p>I think discretion and finding out the COD is very important to the game and exhume also limits the phys fake claims which makes it more difficult for the evils which is not good.</p>

<p>Either way, there are some issues with exhume being something that the Physician can use to confirm itself that I’ve seen Boslof express concerns about in the past</p>
<p>Granted, the game straight-up tells you when you’re healed, and you could easily guess or lie about your exhume results, but still.</p>

            <p>It actually wouldn’t be a bad idea to have that as a day ability… exhume itself was too weak to really be justifiable as a night ability. That being said while phys is the most lore friendly class to get the ability, now that he is the maker of death knights he may already be too powerful to justify adding extra abilities. Trying to think of a class that seems more lacking to put it on instead.</p>
