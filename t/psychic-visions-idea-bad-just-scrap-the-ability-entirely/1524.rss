    <title>Psychic Visions Idea (Bad, just scrap the ability entirely)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/psychic-visions-idea-bad-just-scrap-the-ability-entirely/1524</link>
    <description>Ref: http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/The_Psychic

The thing I suggest changing is this ability:

**Visions**: (Night, 2 uses) - Reveals a player’s faction.

This seems way too powerful, especially if you happen to hit a Master Mind that failed to convert night 1 for whatever reason. BD freelo in that case. So, maybe change the ability to be more like TOS investigator. Also, in BR there are 3 investigative roles out to screw them (Sheriff, Psychic, Princess) and cult has 2 and a massive murderer (Paladin, psychic, Princess).  My idea is an overall weaken of the precision of the vision ability, with some increase in utility of it

**Visions**: (Night - 2/3 uses) - Have a vision of a players thoughts for a clue to their role.

My suggested list would be something like.

&quot;You see a vision of your target being in the Castle Nursery. They must be a **[color=blue]Prince, Princess[/color]** or **[color=purple]Duchess[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target looking for the company of others at night. They must be the **[color=blue]Sheriff[/color]** or **[color=purple]Mastermind[/color]**&quot; (1)
&quot;You see a vision of your target manipulating the souls of others. They must be a **[color=blue]Priest[/color]**, **[color=purple]Soulcatcher[/color]** or **[color=grey]Reaper[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target using mystical magic chants. They must be a **[color=blue]Court Wizard[/color]**, **[color=purple]Sage[/color]** or **[color=grey]Possessor[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target using powerful telepathic powers. They must be a **[color=blue]Psychic[/color]**, **[color=bronze]Apostle[/color]** or **[color=purple]Illusionist[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target engaging in powerful rituals. They must be a **[color=blue]Paladin[/color]** or **[color=bronze]Ritualist[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target sharpening their prized blade. They must be a **[color=blue]Knight,[/color]** **[color=grey]Mercenary,[/color]** **[color=purple]Sellsword[/color]** or **[color=purple]Enforcer[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You see a vision of your target hoping to stop the work of others. They must be a **[color=blue]Butler,[/color]** **[color=grey]Fool,[/color]** **[color=purple]Servant[/color]** or **[color=bronze]Invoker[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You have a vision of your target&#39;s great knowledge of poisons. They must be a **[color=blue]Physcian[/color]**, **[color=grey]Alchemist,[/color]** **[color=purple]Herbalist[/color]** or [color=purple]**Assassin**[/color]&quot;
&quot;You have a vision of your target watching others from the shadows. They must be a **[color=blue]Observer,[/color]** **[color=purple]Nightwatch[/color]** or **[color=bronze]Seeker[/color]**&quot;
&quot;You have a vision of your target seated in a privileged position. They must be a **[color=blue]Noble,[/color]** **[color=purple]Aristocrat[/color]** or the [color=bronze]**Cult Leader[/color]**&quot;  

1) This is a reference to the Mastermind&#39;s convert power, and the Sheriff&#39;s Posse Comitatus ability (Which translates to &#39;Be accompanied)

            <p>The Illusionist and the Cult version should be able to make public announcements as well. If they cannot, town will simply lynch them as they now know they have been converted.</p>
<p>This will lead a meta game of Psychics using their daytime announcements early just in case they are converted later, so an Illusionist/Cult can say “I’ve already used my announcements! Look at chat log. I cannot announce anymore.”</p>

            <p>Mastermind needs to be immune to alchemist for at least 3 days (like Sheriff). It is bullshit when Alch kills your MM N1 in a 16 player game and basically the game is just over immediately, which is boring for everyone. I’ve seen it happen 3 times now lol.</p>

            <p>Classes gotta be a little bit powerful since they can be converted. This is not really that OP. Also the “i don’t trust you” doesn’t exist here (yet), since there is no executioner kind of role.</p>

            <p>Totally agree with not implementing a investigation system that in any way homogenizes claim space for individual evil roles. I’m interested in this game because you are more easily able to claim roles outside of your “typical investigation results.”</p>
<p>I don’t have access to the game, but just theorycrafting with the Psychic is insane. As the game matures and players get better and better, the Psychic will have to be adjusted.</p>
<p>“I found Cult with visions, it’s number 4!”<br>
“i dont trust u”<br>
<em>psychic telepathically sends a message to everyone stating their name</em><br>
“lol well, you don’t have votes evil has majority gg”<br>
<em>forces confirmed evil to vote against their own</em></p>
<p>This is crazy stuff man. Psychic is much more investigative than social just because Visions is so powerful in conjunction with the ability to prove herself.</p>
<p>It is also such a bummer that the Cult version of Psychic is so terrible. No visions unlike the BR Psychic (who has some REALLY interesting abilities.) Every now and then the Cult psychic may steal an important whisper or two every few games, but the meta game may cause players to send a dummy whisper at first then continue the 2nd with real information to bait out the Eavesdrop.</p>

            <p>Please never add a ToS investigator power to this game.  The fun of this game is not having Investigator in the meta to confine evil claims, JUST IN CASE, an Investigator spawned in the game.</p>
<p>Personally, I agree with orangeandblack5 that Psychic’s visions should just be removed entirely, since it’s meant to be a social class.</p>

            <p>Okay look</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to remove Vision entirely</p>
<p>Not a BD Investigative, doesn’t need it.</p>

            <p>I personally think, Psycho needs the ability as it is. It may look OP now due to not having full games. I feel it’s a nice ability.</p>

            <p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>You should try again, it’s clear you’re capable of making an idea. Don’t give up.</p>

            <p>I agree, maybe my specific suggestion is not the best, but Visions is too powerful on a role that can self confirm</p>

            <p>yes but this suggestion nerfs the cult more than the actual ability. Sorry to say, but you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It nerfs the cult even if a psychic doesn’t appear in a specific game. And even more if it does.</p>

            <p>That’s true I guess, I tried giving their converted class the best shot of living, but yes - Cult is the hardest hit.</p>
<p>Still think Visions is OP though</p>

            <p>Yes, but it is possible to claim any role.</p>
<p>Also, this will make the cult just die.</p>
<p>Cultists are mergers of different roles, and they’re already the least balanced faction.</p>

            <p>True, but TBH I tried pairing them up as easily fake-claimable as possible - Especially if role specific feedback was removed</p>

            <p>I thought about having a more formal investigator in here.</p>
<p>I don’t like it, as it limits claims even if it isn’t there, given the off chance that it is.</p>
<p>Look at the old Spy in ToS. Mafia did not talk at night AT ALL because they feared the spy was there.</p>
