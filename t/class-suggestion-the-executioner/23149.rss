            <p>Read the ability carefully. “People that he finds to be Unseen/Cult”. Since when he doesn’t he frames them for 2 night that means that if you target the same person twice in a row you will always attack them.</p>

            <p>Giving him a huge kill potential against scum is just dooming them to a lost game, while ultimately not helping the Executioner either because then it’ll be just him and a bunch of BD.  Too many people don’t realize that NK and scum need to work together for at least the first couple nights in order to maximize BD losses, regardless if NK is poss or reaper.</p>
