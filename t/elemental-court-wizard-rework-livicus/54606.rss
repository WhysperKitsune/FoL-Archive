    <title>Elemental Court Wizard Rework - Livicus</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/elemental-court-wizard-rework-livicus/54606</link>
    <description>In response to https://forum.imperium42.com/t/court-wizard-contest/54572?u=livicus

I&#39;m going for a balanced, well structured Court Wizard and Sage around the theme of elemental magic.

Just a note: Ice Ward also blocks occupation along with everything else, in case you&#39;re really worried that it&#39;s not in Light Barrier.

Light Barrier only blocks abilities that are on scum classes, so that Court Wizard can&#39;t be confirmed by other BD members&#39; actions.

Blue Dragon Support

_Passives_

**Fragile Magic:**
If your Tornado targets at least one identical player as another Tornado or Teleport, all collided Tornados and Teleports will fail. You will not be notified that your Tornado failed.

_Abilities_

**Ice Ward:** (D) (2)
Encase another player in a shield of ice. All visits to them will be prevented tonight. (Cannot target self)

**Light Barrier:** (D) (oo)
Choose a player. They will be protected from all negative effects for the rest of today and tonight. (The Barrier will continue to stay on the player until this ability is used to move it to a different player.) (Cannot target self)

**Tornado:** (N) (3)
Summon a great wind around two players and swap their positions, causing all players who target one to target the other. Bypasses redirect immunity.

**Light Barrier Specifics**

Concerning Circle of Death: If a Court Wizard Light Barriers a target the Sorc uses CoD on, the CW&#39;s Barrier will stop the CoD, preventing it from taking effect.

Concerning Poss Control: You cannot prevent the person dying to a possessed player as a CW. But a CW&#39;s Barrier can prevent the Possessor from possessing a player into killing another player.

Negative Effects:
- Icy Touch
- Possessor Control
- Circle of Death Target
- Distract
- Troll Box
- Frame
- Mind Warp
- Mental Blur
- Forked Lightning
- Earthen Roots
- Bewilder
- Defile
- Drug
- Conversion

DOES NOT INCLUDE
- Attacks
- Heals
- Guards
- Imprison
- Social Effects
- Empowering
- **Occupation**
- **Redirection**
- Investigation
- Poison/Bleeding
- Brotherhood/Dark Wisp

Unseen Offensive

_Passives_

**Fragile Magic:**
If your Teleport targets at least one identical player as another Tornado or Teleport, all collided Tornados and Teleports will fail. You will not be notified that your Tornado failed.

_Abilities_

**Forked Lightning:** (D) (2)
Shock two players and cripple them. They will not be able to use any Day Abilities for the rest of the day. (Day Abilities means instant-effect abilities, not Prince&#39;s Jail or Sheriff&#39;s Scout, which have delayed effects)

**Wall of Fire:** (D) (2)
Create a wall of fire outside a player&#39;s door. All non-Unseen visits to them will be prevented tonight. 

**Tornado:** (N) (oo)
Summon a great wind around two players and swap their positions, causing all players who target one to target the other. Bypasses redirect immunity.

**Earthen Roots:** (N) (2)
Choose a player and cause the ground to wrap around their feet. If they visit tonight, they will be prevented from visiting.

(Shows as you were prevented from visiting target)

**Will of Mithras:**
If you are sacrificed, the Cult Leader gains 3 uses of Eradicate instead of 2.

_Abilities_

**Brotherhood:** (D) (2)
Select a member of the Cult and make them appear Blue Dragon tonight.

Cast a shadow over a member of the Cult. You will protect them and prevent any visits to them.

            <p>Jail, Scout, Dirty work and Sacrifice do not count as day Ability’s for the purpose of Ability’s like these.</p>
<p>However most other day Ability’s <strong>including Stoneskin and gather darkness for some reason</strong> do count. You can usually tell because the ability will still let you use other Ability’s along side it. (Either another Ability like with rapture or more communly: itself.)</p>
