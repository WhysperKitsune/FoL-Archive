          <p><strong>THE EARLY WAR</strong></p>
<p>A long time ago where history was a word that was not known to anyone,  there was a war so secret not even the Sheriff would know .  No one knows how long this war lasted, how many suffered , how many battles and some do not even know that the war occurred. The Order of the Blue Dragon and the Principality of the Black Rose were on each others throats, a knowledge only known to the very few . Furthermore, no records relating to the Principality of the Black Rose can be found and any who dare to find those records will mysteriously disappear, never to be seen or heard again. The war was forgotten… or was it?</p>
<p><strong>HUNDRED YEARS OF SILENCE</strong></p>
<p>" No, of course not.  The war will never be forgotten." - The Mastermind</p>
<p>The Black Rose will never forget what had happened to their people all those years ago. Many were killed, tortured, burned at the stake . They knew they could not win and they knew if they continued, the Reaper will have its belly be full for a thousand years. No, retreat is the only option and retreat to the shadows it shall be. They will never be seen for they shall now be known as the Unseen. For hundreds of years, the kingdom prospered under the rule of the King and the Blue Dragon. However, just like the saying " good times create weak men, "  the Blue Dragon has fallen to the trap of gold and the people began to suffer. Despite this, a few remained steadfast in the face of gold and broken friendships. These people believe there is still hope and will do their best to ensure that the light never fades through reformation and at worst case scenario,murder.  This only caused further divide, plunging the court into further chaos with the shadows eagerly watching.</p>
<p><strong>THE BLOOD MURDER</strong></p>
<p>" A sacrifice must be made to save this world from ending."- Cult Leader</p>
<p>One fine night,  the halls of the castle burst into yelling and screaming, clanking and smashing. The civil war had begun yet it only had one battle and lasted a few minutes  . By the time the guards arrived,  the halls were filled with beautiful paintings of gore and red.  Until today, no one knows what happened. However, the guards reported seeing a death note with the words, " the end is coming. The blood must be spilled to prevent it . You will hate us now but at least we will die knowing we had done our best to save the kingdom and the world." Even the shadows of the Unseen have question marks in their brains. No one knew who is behind it. No one but the perpetrators. This event soon became very infamous with the name “Blood Murder” awarded to it. and the perpetrators known as the Cult.</p>
<p><strong>CASTLE ADIART</strong></p>
<p>The incident opened what was left of the Blue Dragon’s eyes. With what few people they had left, they decided to stop their petty squabbles, learn and adapt. Just as what the Black Rose did ages ago, the Blue Dragon went into isolation. They built a new castle on the edges of the kingdom, ruling in secrecy and away of any potential threats .</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the people continued to live their lifes with mixed opinions. They no longer had the power to report their issues to the nobles of the kingdom, only the common knights, sheriffs, observers and physicians  are there to listen to the problems of the commons. However, the nobility lives in isolation and began to be isolated from the very people they are to serve.</p>
<p>With the Blue Dragon weakened after the infamous Blood Murder all the factions begin to make their move.  The Unseen began a campaign of infiltration  with  some wanting to make the kingdom a better place, some wanting gold and of course some wanting sweet cold revenge. The perpetrators of the Blood Murder began to make their move too,  with no one knowing if they are trying to save or destroy the world nor their true intentions.  Despite a common goal, " an enemy of my enemy is my friend" does not apply here. The Unseen sees the Cult as madmen attempting to kill for no purpose while the Cult sees the Unseen as no different from the Blue Dragon, a sacrifice for an unknown cause .Of course, not everyone needs to be affiliated with a faction, rumours of the dead, spirits , alchemists and even trolls found in the castle are quite common. However,  no evidence can be found of their presence.</p>
<p><strong>THE MURDER OF THE QUEEN</strong></p>
<p>" we thought we were safe, we were not." - The Prince</p>
<p>The loss of the Queen, a major blow to all of the kingdom.  It was the first time the nobility visited their kingdom so everyone can pay their respects to the fallen Queen.  The visit was met with jeers and fire. The people thought the nobility had abandoned them when they could not be further from the truth with the king secretly keeping track of the Kingdom through his trusty agents.  The presence of knights and physician are the only reason why the people had not risen up and started another major “problem” which " may"  potentially result in death .</p>
<p>The nobility emphatises, they understood why the people felt that way but they needed to do so to prevent another Blood Murder from happening.  However, no one knows how the Queen was murdered, only that she was murdered inside the walls of Castle Adiart itself!  Some speculate the King was responsible for it but alas, no hard evidence can be found once again.</p>
<p>This only served to alert the entire court, that they were not safe  in the very castle that was meant to make them safe. Both the Unseen and the Cult have not finished their preparations and movements and all of their dagger work could be exposed because of a single mistake or a reaper trying to be funny. In any case, they were still severely outnumbered but with the court in full distrust , they must act now before they are exposed.  They only have one chance at this , and only one faction will seize the throne and rule the entire kingdom.</p>
<p>Intentions are unknown.  No one  is good. Everyone is suspect . Welcome to the Throne of Lies.</p>
