            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a></p>
<p>The deal in which I agreed to lynch you for a confession from PKR was my idea, actually, not scums.</p>
<p><img src="/images/emoji/twitter/sweat.png?v=9" title=":sweat:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":sweat:"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I figured there was roughly a 35% chance dama was in you, a 20% chance he was in me, and a 45% chance he was<br>
in someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to get a confession out of PKR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the lolz, and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>because, assuming MM could be executed in jail and no bad votes the next day,(my bad) the ONLY way BD could have lost that was if ALL of these conditions were met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Orange was NK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dama was NOT in you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jammy had NOT stepped forward to be king, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange and dama had killed two different BD the following night.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in any case, these reasons weren’t sufficient to execute you, and again I’m sorry about that.</p>
<p>I’m going to take a time-out and think upon my sins (also am transitioning to a new city and job) so you guys have fun in FoL 5. I’ll probably be back later.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>so, I’m going to respond to a few remarks on here. Prepare for a text wall.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a>, we actually were better off with king!Jammy than king!PKR.</p>
<p>at that point,immediately after Moleland was lynched, there were still 7 players in the game, and we more or less knew what everyone was. There were 4 BD, 2 BR, and you, the neutral. Dama was also still in play. It’s worth noting that we didn’t know what you were and had no way of knowing, so we had to assume you were an NK at that point. After all, you had been roleblocked the first two nights, and the two deaths on n3 could have been any combination of you, dama, and PKR.</p>
<p>If king!PKR, BD would lose two players at most, one from you, one from dama, and still have two BD left. I assumed hippo would be dead, and that you would be dead. (quick note here: I’m still somewhat to blame for the poison and prison execution mishaps; I didn’t bother to check with the hosts about whether or not they worked. I just assumed they did)</p>
<p>That leaves three players, two BD and PKR, and PKR would have been able to use his finger since only two votes are needed at that point to vote someone up. Something tells me that PKR would have been hovering over the keyboard when the night timer ended.</p>
<p>if King!Jammy, on the other hand, BD has 3 players die in the night in worst case scenario (PKR still assasin), leaving Jammy, who would have guarded, and PKR. Jammy has the finger; game over for BR.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>of course</em> I deviated from the plan to execute hippolytus. The plan that was in place called for me jailing and probably executing PKR.</p>
<p>We all had good reason to suspect that PKR was psychic turned illusionist, and the mastermind/assasin was the higher priority target. I didn’t know when I selected to jail hippo whether frost would flip MM, assasin, or illusionist. That’s why I kept insisting that the court wizards guard me rather than target each other. I couldn’t let deadfrien know that hippo would be jailed on the chance she turned out to be BR. I also hadn’t sussed out that you couldn’t possibly be any of the known BR roles at the time, so I figured the BR could possibly be you, deadfrien, and frost.</p>

            <p>Experience in Forum Games and Poker itself has shown my bluffing and persuasion somewhat.<br>

I know who to play off on who and when.<br>
Every game is about strategy.<br>
Who do we go for, why do we go for them etc.<br>
You get what I’m saying?<br>
