    <title>[Suggestion] A possible way to bring back Hunter&#39;s Arrow</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-a-possible-way-to-bring-back-hunters-arrow/74608</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve brought this idea up in the devblog thread but to stop it clogging things up further I&#39;&#39;m reposting it here.

Essentially, a lot of people loved Hunter&#39;s Retribution but it was surprisingly hard to understand and had problems for balance.

My idea is for Hunter to choose who they arrow, giving a nice middle ground. Obviously, they&#39;ll have to be unique again.

&gt; # [color=steblue]The Hunter[/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color=grey]Blue Dragon Killer[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Retribution (Passive)** - If you are executed, you will shoot your current marked player. If you have not marked anybody you will not shoot anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf Companion (Day)** - Same as current. - 2 uses
&gt; 
&gt; **Hunter&#39;s Mark (Night)** - Mark a player for the following day. - Infinite uses.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bear Companon (Night)** - Same as current.- 3 uses
&gt; *You win when all threats to the Blue Dragon have been eliminated.*

My main problem is that while arrow was a lot of fun it&#39;s hard to jjustify punishing the wolves for pushing a mislynch directly. &lt;small&gt;And I definitely thought of this oriignally and wasn&#39;t told about it by marl&lt;/small&gt;

I&#39;ve made some tweaks from the original idea, basically forcing the Hunter to either protect themself during the night or make an impact if they are executed during the day. I feel this is the kind of interesting streamline decision that we&#39;ll be seeing more and more in the design as ToL goes forward.

Thoughts, anyone?</description>

            <p>I respect the attempt to revive retribution (and I do want it to make a return in some form) but I don’t support making Hunter unique again</p>
