    <title>Occupied 4 times without immunity</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/occupied-4-times-without-immunity/23141</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was occupied four times in a row, without getting immunity. I was converted the night of #3.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I should have received immunity after #3, and should have retained it after conversion(?)

#### Steps to reproduce:

n1 occed
n2 occed
n3 occed, converted # should receive immunity, didn&#39;t
n4 occed # should not have worked

#### Comments:

If the intention is for that clock to reset on conversion, that would be good to know as it would be potentially a major tell. However, I suspect that (like royal blood) it&#39;s supposed to be a personal attribute and not a class attribute at that point.</description>

            <p>It was yesterday, and I do wish I’d been able to save a game log to make sure, but I’m pretty sure it was a butler riding me.</p>
<p>I know there was a healthy debate as to whether he was sus for claiming 4th occ, and I was surprised enough to actually note it in my logs. I think a hh wouldn’t have surprised me. I also remember there was no “you are now occupy immune” message.</p>
