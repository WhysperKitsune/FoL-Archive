    <description>![scp|690x388](upload://sX03W1YbgMPShMtBzY2PaAPIXoe.png)


[SCP Database](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Containment has been breached. I repeat! Containment has been breached! All personnel report to the EZ for evac. Ref---GAHH--&lt;/div&gt;

## Welcome to SCP FM!

&lt;big&gt; **Containment Procedures:** &lt;/big&gt;

@Geyde and @MaximusPrime are the hosts.   

* Rolecards will be sent out within a day of the game filling. Confirmations will be done in the rolecards only. 
* The game will start once all players have confirmed their roles in their rolecards.
* Phases will be 48/24.
* Lynches will be Majority &amp; Plurality.
* Players must post at least 10 times per day phase. If this cannot be met for a particular reason, the mod should be informed in your role PM. Prods will be sent out in rolecards.

&lt;big&gt; **Description:** &lt;/big&gt;

* This game is not bastard.
* There are slight bastard elements.
* There is no conversion.
* This game is not multiball.
* There may be neutrals.
* There are vanilla roles.
* There may or may not be anti-claim mechanics.
* [**Natural Action Resolution**](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution) will be used. 
* The [color=green]**Chaos Insurgency**[/color] has a private chat active at all times. 
* All scum players will be notified which flavors are not present in the game to aid with fakeclaiming.
* The moderator will never lie to you. 
* Only investigative roles and abilities will have feedback (such as being roleblocked / redirected) unless explicitly stated otherwise. 


&lt;big&gt; **Rolelist:** &lt;/big&gt;

This is a closed setup game. 

[color=rainbow]**Foundation**[/color] - *You win when the Chaos Insurgency and any dangerous SCPs are defeated.*
[color=green]**Chaos Insurgency**[/color] - *You win when the Foundation and any dangerous SCPs are subdued.*
There may or may not be third parties or other groups. 

Below is the rolecard for the VT.

&gt;&lt;big&gt;User#: [color=rainbow]**Scientist**[/color] &lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=rainbow]Foundation Vanilla[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;*You are one of the prestigious, drawn from the best and brightest around the world to work at the Foundation. With specialists in every field imaginable, from chemistry and botany to more esoteric or specialized fields such as theoretical physics and xenobiology, the goal of the Foundation’s research projects is to gain a better understanding of unexplained anomalies and how they operate.*
&gt;
&gt;You have no abilities of your own. You can speak and vote though!
&gt;
&gt;*You win when the Chaos Insurgency and any dangerous SCPs are defeated.*

# [color=red][u]Rules and Punishments[/u][/color]

[details=&quot;Spoiler&quot;]
&gt;|Rule|Punishment|
&gt;|---|---|
&gt;|Don&#39;t Cheat|Don&#39;t discuss the game outside of the thread under ANY circumstances.|
&gt;|Intentional Angleshoots|Will be punished SEVERELY.|
&gt;|Unintentional Angleshoots|Will be punished. This applies to pinging a player in thread to be active when knowing they are online.|
&gt;|Announcing intention to sub out|The literal opposite of okay. Will be punished SEVERELY.|
&gt;|Talking to Game Host in Thread / Related Chats|Do not do it, as you will not get a response.|
&gt;|Talking to Game Host through PMs|Do this.|
&gt;|Quoting Private Communications|Even if it is fabricated, this is strictly against the rules. This includes copy pasting mod messages. Paraphrasing is allowed.|
&gt;|Reporting|Discussing substitutions is considered unintentional angleshooting. Don&#39;t discuss infractions of these rules, but you may report infractions in your role card.|
&gt;|On the Fence|Don&#39;t try to skate the line between bending the rules.|
