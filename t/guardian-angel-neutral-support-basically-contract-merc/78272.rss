    <description>***Guardian Angel | Neutral Support***

**Passives:**

**(Devoted):** If both of your bindings die, you will take your own life the next night. 
**(Soul Bind):** Occupy and Redirection immune. At the start of the game, you are bound with two random players. You will not learn their classes, but you will know their numbers.
 **can not bind with any other Neutral (excluding the NK), starting King, Knight or Prince*



**Day Abilities:**
**(Angelic Connections):** If someone you are soulbound with is voted to be executed today, they will be pardoned. (1 use) 
**(Private Matter):** Whispers between you and your soul bindings will be hidden from the public today. (2 uses)

**Night Abilities:**
**(Angelic Shield):** Redirects any non-conversion abilities directed to *one* of the players you’re soulbound with to yourself. You will be death immune tonight. Your target will not be notified you are protecting them. (3 uses) 
**(Angelic Wrath):** Redirects any attacks from one of your bindings back to the attacker. (1 use) 

Win condition: Ensure at least one of your bindings survives until the end of the game. **You will gain an extra 25gp if both of your bindings survive.**


Initially this class was going to be my proposed Merc rework, but somebody who&#39;s name rhymes with *Cape* convinced me that the two classes could co-exist. And I also totally used some of his suggestion in mine ;)

Apologies if some of the wording is confusing, this went through quite a few revisions before it reached this point. Might have missed something.</description>

<p>Is 25gp enough? Who knows. Of course the number is up for debate. I thought 50 (my original idea) was too much, though <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>You’re going against your wincon of keeping two people alive, by decreasing the odds of at least one of them surviving. NK is death immune, while BD is a part of the majority, while Cultseen are the informed minority.</p>

            <p>Yea, why not? You’re still a neutral, so you can take sides. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Sellsword is also not gamethrowing if they go with NK over Unseen/Cult or vice versa.</p>

            <p>Correct.</p>
<p>It’s working against your win condition to an extent, but keeping a BD alive with the NK dead is significantly easier than keeping a BD alive with the NK alive.</p>
<p>I feel like it’d be considered a “play”.</p>

            <p>I’d want to.</p>
<p>But your wincon is to ensure <em>one</em> survives, bussing an NK, theoretically, helps the other survive.</p>
<p>Very very grey area in my eyes.</p>

<p>Oh yeah it’s probably a bad idea, but it would be interesting. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> It could lead to links betraying their own faction, which would actually also probably cause bad blood.
