<p>This is good feedback. Since my initial plan was to make this a Merc rework as opposed to a new class, I wanted the guard to be like Stand Guard, where no visitors could get through. But since I changed this from a Merc rework to a new class entirely, I wasn’t too sure what to do with the equivalent of SG.</p>

</aside>
<p>Your targets can be converted and are likely to get converted, because one, they have a Merc and are more likely to live longer and two, if you get deduced, they are great conversion targets, because evil will also get a Mercenary on their side. Knowing this, it will also be beneficial to be wary about openclaiming Mercenaries and their targets, because it will make BD more suspicious about the targets being converted. This is kind of the mechanic in FoL that prevents a Merc openclaim to a degree.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree. That’s one of the things I couldn’t find much of a solution for. I thought of having one guaranteed non-BD target, but that just felt very open to telling the BD who your scum target was and defending the BD.</p>

<p>So far they don’t know the class, so an evil doesn’t need to out to whoever claims to be their Mercenary (which can also be faked by Mystic private matters, I actually remember this being done a lot back in the day).</p>

<p>Also don’t like the confirm to everyone mechanic in pardoning your target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s fair. This is pretty shamelessly copied from a very old version of ToL merc, and I can see why it got removed. I couldn’t think of any other way of having a day ability to help a scum target, though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m always a big fan of confirmability at a cost. That’s why FoL Merc, can prove themselves beyond reasonable doubt with… taking the lynch. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smile.png!v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> This “you would be pardoned” could be a great mechanic for evil “Mercenaries” or Mercenaries with evil targets to get mislynches on others, but now it can’t be, because Mercenary targets are informed they have a Mercenary through confirmable private matters links, so you now always have 3 players claiming the same thing, which is nigh impossible to fake for evils, so extremely confirmable through that day ability. Having it also be confirmable in that way negates the former to try and get a mislynch through it, because “targets” will never agree to the Mercenary being real. I would think about if it is necessary for the Mercenary and their targets to work together so explicitly and having them be able to confirm themselves to them.</p>
<p>The FoL version here is that the Mercenary sacrifices themselves to be the lynch, which would negate this dynamic and be helpful for both scum/town/the Mercenary itself. It’s confirmability at a cost, which is the missed lynch on an actual scum, but now a Mercenary for the town and the cost for the Mercenary is well death, so they can’t protect their targets anymore.</p>

<p>It seemed a bit strong. If you give the Hunter death immunity at the right times early game they could hit lategame with three bears. But I could see the argument that Hunter could be a valid target.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a similar story with Butler Party or Physician self heal or the confirmability of a Noble/Mystic helping the target throughout the day. Or also starting Assassin/Cults being worse targets than a Mastermind that cannot be checked and is naturally death immune. There is no way to win here, so best is to just allow it all and just have it be natural difficulty variance for the Mercenary. Things like Merc to Prince, I would definitely not allow either though.</p>

<p>This is because the former is against large variance for the Mercenary difficulty, which is a single neutral entity and the latter is against large variance for the Blue Dragon difficulty, which is the main town faction and way more players would be affected by it in that way.</p>

<p>Your targets can be converted and are likely to get converted, because one, they have a Merc and are more likely to live longer and two, if you get deduced, they are great conversion targets, because evil will also get a Mercenary on their side. Knowing this, it will also be beneficial to be wary about openclaiming Mercenaries and their targets, because it will make BD more suspicious about the targets being converted. This is kind of the mechanic in FoL that prevents a Merc openclaim to a degree.</p>

<p>This is something I want, personally. Open claiming neutrals aren’t very engaging. The concept of a contract merc isn’t explicitly siding towards one faction, but I’d love to convert someone who has a personal bodyguard <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png!v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>

<p>I’m always a big fan of confirmability at a cost. That’s why FoL Merc, can prove themselves beyond reasonable doubt with… taking the lynch. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smile.png!v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> This “you would be pardoned” could be a great mechanic for evil “Mercenaries” or Mercenaries with evil targets to get mislynches on others, but now it can’t be, because Mercenary targets are informed they have a Mercenary through confirmable private matters links, so you now always have 3 players claiming the same thing, which is nigh impossible to fake for evils, so extremely confirmable through that day ability. Having it also be confirmable in that way negates the former to try and get a mislynch through it, because “targets” will never agree to the Mercenary being real. I would think about if it is necessary for the Mercenary and their targets to work together so explicitly and having them be able to confirm themselves to them.</p>
<p>The FoL version here is that the Mercenary sacrifices themselves to be the lynch, which would negate this dynamic and be helpful for both scum/town/the Mercenary itself. It’s confirmability at a cost, which is the missed lynch on an actual scum, but now a Mercenary for the town and the cost for the Mercenary is well death, so they can’t protect their targets anymore.</p>

<p>I get the philosophy behind taking the targets place, but I didn’t think it’d translate as well into ToL. Games generally last long enough that buying your target one day in exchange for your life isn’t optimal (unless your other target has died, I guess) but FoL games seem to average a much shorter duration, to which one day could make the different much more frequently.</p>
<p>I suppose I could be wrong, but the average FoL game ends around day 4-5 right? From my (anecdotal) experience recording ToL games, only about ~20% of the time does it end by day 5. ~65% of the time it ends days 6 or 7.</p>

<p>Hmm… The only difference I can think of is that Hunters bear is their <em>main</em> ability, whereas Physician selfcare would mean they’re usually not healing a more important person (and as such is rarely used) and Butler party is generally suboptimal as well. However:</p>

<p>Well a ToL implementation of FoL Merc is still valuable, since it can’t transfer as it is with visit prevention not being a thing. I am actually quite outdated on the whole ToL interaction network, so I can’t comment much more on this except that this is probably better. Although I’ll maintain that the AoE occupy effect is less confirmable towards the Mercenary, so would be better however. It accomplishes the same things otherwise.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think 4 total is fine. Old Mercenary also had 4 uses of Stand Guard. You can only protect one target at a time with it anyways and it’s a bad experience to die at night as a neutral, so they should have a lot of uptime on death immunity. It should still remain a meaningful choice that you don’t just press a button every night. This is especially true for a class that is so restricted in targets and ability decision-making. Having too many uses would just result in achieving the same if it’d just be a passive that that ability would be used each night then. I would always stray on making neutrals weaker than stronger as well, since they hold alternate objectives that should not gain precedence over the main faction war going on. The Mercenary is an extra number for whatever faction their links are, so making it too strong isn’t going to be fun for the faction that is already at a disadvantage due to the Merc’s dice roll on who their links are.</p>

<p>Yeah, and in addition Invoker to Cult Leader or Servant/Alcoholic to Assassin can also bypass it, which I also think would be lame honestly, but there wouldn’t be a way to go around that if you want to keep it “streamlined”. I mostly referenced the fact that you’re more in the ToL metagame, whereas I’m very entrenched in FoL, so it’s hard for me to pick up on some things that are different. I was about to protest that NK’s can get past this, but forgot that that’s not the case in ToL.

<p>Yeah, and in addition Invoker to Cult Leader or Servant/Alcoholic to Assassin can also bypass it, which I also think would be lame honestly, but there wouldn’t be a way to go around that if you want to keep it “streamlined”.</p>

<p>I agree with this, but yeah. Necessary evil and all. Servant/Alco to Assa at least gives value to a lesser convert in my eyes.</p>

<p>Ah, that’s what you meant, very true in that case. I’m interested in trying out FoL so I’ve looked into it, but the metagame is definitely not something I know very well… soon, though <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink.png!v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Originally I wanted to allow NKs, but I thought it’d just encourage the GA to tell the BD who the NK was. Didn’t seem very fun or fair. Fools wincon involves them dying. Alchemists with a guardian would be too powerful imo (a combined 6 nights of DI in a game which usually ends D7?) and I generally just don’t think it’d be very well balanced. No Knights because, as Solic said, it’d be unfun to lose because your Knight suicides after two successful defends.</p>

</aside>
<p>Initially it was only attack abilities, but I felt it was too BD sided and Solic also had concerns about that. If conversions can go through, this class doesn’t have nearly as big of a BD bias and will pretty likely have at least one scum bound by the end of the game.</p>

<p>I’d assume that the Knight defend wouldn’t be redirected, since mechanically it seems to be a counter-attack of it’s own. So it’d probably do nothing to Knights.</p>

<p>Well, it doesn’t matter if you do know them or not, the fact is, if your goal is to protect them and you <em>willingly get them killed,</em> then there would be some issues with it.
