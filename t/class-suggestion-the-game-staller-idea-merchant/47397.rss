    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Game Staller Idea(Merchant?)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-game-staller-idea-merchant/47397</link>
    <description>Alright I&#39;m bad at this sort of stuff and I&#39;m on my phone right now so forgive me of any errors or bad formatting please. Im not that active on forums and such. Thanks!

This idea was not started by me. It was started by @Tormental I believe and continued/reworked by others like @Livicus and @NightX (I&#39;m only hopping on the bandwagon lul)

Name: Merchant(dunno could be renamed into something different) Neutral Offensive

Passive 1: Clever - Occupation and redirect immune. 

Passive 2(still thinking about this, might remove it): [Name Needed] - If you die by prince or king execution then there can be no voting tomorrow
Feedback/Reasoning: It seems slightly useless but could help if you are found early. Remember, you are like a mercenary, so you don&#39;t have to live in order to win.


Day Ability: Bribe(bad name?) - Today&#39;s trial will be force pardoned/executed(depends on what if choose) and there can be no more trials when this is used if you chose to pardon them and this is the first trial. Does not work if you are out up. Can be Vetoed by the King&#39;s Decide Fate. [1 Use]
Feedback/Reasoning: It&#39;s to cause more chaos and put some doubt onto the king (&quot;why&#39;d you exe/pardon them?) And if it&#39;s BD king, they won&#39;t be allowed to vote for 1 day. I can change to force pardon only if it seems too unbalanced.


Day Ability 2: Trollbox - Everyone knows what this is. 
Feedback/Reasoning: It&#39;s so you can make people say things that will hopefully hesitate/be confused for longer


Night Ability 1: Haggle - Redirect someone to you(bypasses occupation immunity if they are a killer class). You will be Immune to all attacks. Can only be used on each target twice. You will know if you prevented them from acting. (once per target if you feel this is too op against the mm/nk) [Infinite Uses]
Feedback/Reasoning: This is so you can kinda reliably claim drunk and protect yourself/stall the game cause pretty much everyone wants to kill this class as getting occupied/redirected is annoying af


Night Ability 2: [Name Needed](Vigor Elixer and Snake Oil is a name @Tormental came up with) - Make a person Death Immune tonight in exchange for Occupying them(bypasses occupation immunity). Can only be used on the same target twice. You shall know if you prevented them from acting or if you protected them [3 Uses]
Feedback/Reasoning: Maybe also occupies any killers visiting you or makes you death immune the night you use it so it can help you live longer. Also this is so evils/investigators can&#39;t convert/find evil which can help stall the game, depending on who cutrently has the upper hand.

Win Condition: Stall the game to D8(if game ends on D8, it still counts)</description>

            <p>Alright I can get rid of the second passive and make it so whoever forces pardon/exe first gets the action. If the prince or some other BD class is  voted up though, people might exe the king if you force exed(and you’ll get a day off no voting and a day wasted in the king) or if he’s a fool then you just get a day or two off no voting. Finally, alright I’ll just change it to occupy then.</p>

<p>You never want to force an execute, as that speeds the game up. I prefer it not being overridable by Decide Fate, as that wastes both abilities.</p>

<p>Just make it occupy. No need to direct attacks to you.</p>
