    <title>Duchess and Nightwatch Buffs</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/duchess-and-nightwatch-buffs/60668</link>
    <description>Everyone can agree that out of the Unseen Investigatives, Marshal is undoubtedly the most useful, powerful, and precise of the three.

Duchess has the consistent Bat Eyelashes that discovers class types, but is always out-done by Marshal&#39;s Probe and now Snoop. And Dark Wisp is rarely useful. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Marshal is in a good spot, as Unseen Investigatives should be powerful, as you can only have one at a time and are sacrificing the space that you could fill with Unseen Offensive Converts who can manipulate BD Night Actions or Social/Support Converts who can win you majority or kill the nasty Prince.

And while Nightwatch is in more of a niche position and has more confirmability as an Observer, you don&#39;t really need to know as the Unseen who visited who as much as BD does, unless you can know almost all of their actions before they reveal it in court.

So I propose these buffs for the Duchess and Nightwatch so that they can be brought up to a similar power level as the Marshal.


[color=purple]**Duchess:**[/color]

- Make Dark Wisp a Day Ability, so that in can be used in addition to the Night Abilities.
- Add this ability: Royal Bonds: (N) (2) - Choose two players. You will discover if at least one of those players has Royal Blood.


[color=purple]**Nightwatch:**[/color]

- Add a Day Ability: Dual Watchman: (N) (2) - Your abilities can target two players tonight.</description>

            <p>I don’t support this. Duchess has royal blood, Marshal does not. Nightwatch outdoes Probe with Watch Carefully. Marshal makes up for that with Expose. They are balanced as it is in my opinion. Dual Watchman feels really overpowered. Unseen investigatives are also powerful, because as outed investigatives, they can easily fake “peek 13, unseen!” to make a play for majority or get killed off and give MM room to convert. I would say they are the best kind of class for doing this kind of thing.</p>
