    <title>Confusing Exhume Results</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/confusing-exhume-results/77660</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Exhuming the starting Assassin&#39;s kill after he becomes Mastermind informs the Physician that they were killed by a &quot;Mastermind&quot; in white text.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Exhume should say they were killed by &quot;Assassin&quot; in purple text.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Exhume a dead player who was killed by the starting assassin, after that assassin turned into Mastermind.</description>
