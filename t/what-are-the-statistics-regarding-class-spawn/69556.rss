    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-are-the-statistics-regarding-class-spawn/69556</link>
    <description>I would like to know to make better-informed decisions.  Like what is the chance of Hunter spawning?  Is it 50%?</description>

<p>Since a Sheriff is guaranteed but a Knight isn’t, does that mean a second Sheriff is more likely than a second Knight?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Normally it ought to because there are more opportunities for a second sheriff to roll compared to a second knight.</p>

            <p>All I really want to know:</p>
<p>Is there actually a lower chance of 2 CW or other non-healer/non-investigative class than say, CW+Butler?</p>
<p>My understanding is that there are a handful of guaranteed slots (King, Prince, one healer, one factioned investigator, two evil, NK) and the rest of the slots would be a straight dice roll as long as the class hadn’t reached its limit.</p>
<p>If so, I think that’d imply a slightly higher chance of two factioned invs and two healers, and no special chance for or against double classes for everyone else, just like flipping two coins and getting HH or TT vs. HT/TH.</p>
<p>I don’t want to know all the sauce, but the validity of the whole “second knight that’s suspicious because probability” meta hinges on this, and that’s become a super-common exe reason. If it’s bullshit I’d consider it game-breaking to let it ride with no clarification.</p>

            <p>But Mercenary with roughly equal chance to have good or evil contract makes their contract more suspicious than everyone else.  That’s why it was easy to lynch contracts.</p>

            <p>The faction-aligned Mercenary was actually pretty balanced, the problem was that people had no idea how to play around it so they’d either mislynch a BD because they had one or they’d end up letting an evil with a Mercenary go unchecked until it was too late.</p>

            <p>It must be a pretty high probability (of GK if Merc contracted to Evil/NK and vice versa) because I never encountered a game where it didn’t happen. When a Merc contract is revealed to be of a good faction, BD instinctively went for King.</p>

            <p>Also the Merc thing was never even true. I don’t know the exact statistics bit the rule is that Merc contracted to evil is less likely if there is an evil king.</p>
<p>The opposite (more likely if good king) can be deduced from this. However in either case the Merc is more likely to be contracted to BD regardless of King.</p>
<p>In otherwords the information wasn’t public because it was false. King wasn’t even the only factor.</p>

            <p>Except that breathing room is already nonexistent, if there is any experienced player in the lobby that just happens to know that fact. Making things public just makes it fair for every player. Something like hunter not being able to be a scorned target should be public knowledge EVEN if it restricts possible defenses. That is just the nature of the game. Yes, you cannot fakeclaim inquisitor after a possessor was just murdered on the stand. Should we hide away the fact that inquisitor only spawns with sorcerer and let people figure it out themselves or just explicitly state it. Either you make these spawn rules public or you just do not make a particular spawn rule. That is my opinion on it. Note that I said to either decrease the spawn rules or at least make them public. I am not for a complete role list that says there must be 2 BD offensives or something to that sort.</p>
<p>My question would be, why should this information be hidden, but something like king spawn rate and what classes are unique should not be?</p>
<p>It also is not always BD favored and evils can play around these specific rules in place. Are you a Mercenary to an evil class? Then never claim you are mercenary to your target and vica versa or people will be able to deduce the king’s alignment and try to devise ways to kill the king, since you know now he is good. Do you want to kill yourself, so MM can convert again? Simply fakeclaim an unseen check on the hunter, you know he cannot claim scorned target, so he has almost no defense.</p>

            <p>Not always just flat spawn rates though.</p>
<p>For example if it’s set to a conditional spawn (I.E: If Merc contracted to x faction spawn y King), then you immediately restrict breathing room for fake claims by making that conditional spawn chance public.</p>
<p>It’s what made high level Town of Salem (lol) very boring. “Two Town Investigative slots taken, lynch that guy”. Knowledge benefits BD and BDs winrate is fine already.</p>

            <p>That just indicates a flaw in the system, not necessarily that publicizing it should be bad. Right now , experienced players have a higher chance to win over new players, specifically because they know such intricate things about the system that newer players do not. To keep a level playing field, everything should be publicized, like they do with the king spawn rate or the guaranteed sheriff/paladin for instance. If king spawn rate would not be public, players could just sample their games and get a rough estimation for its spawn rate. That gives a disadvantage to new players.</p>

            <p>Such knowledge is rightly not made known to ensure games don’t get too stale and so that the burden of required prerequisite knowledge for newer players is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Good example of what I’m talking about is prepatch Merc being contracted to BD confirming a King to be evil (if contracted to NK/OG Unseen/OG Cult, King would always be Good). Was never explicitly stated by devs but was figured out. This made games involving mercs all the same (find their contract and execute it to confirm King).</p>

            <p>I would like to know to make better-informed decisions.  Like what is the chance of Hunter spawning?  Is it 50%?</p>
