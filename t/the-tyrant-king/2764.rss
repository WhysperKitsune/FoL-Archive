    <title>The tyrant king</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-tyrant-king/2764</link>
    <description>The original king cannot be these.
---------------
The reaper and possessor would become the tyrant king:

&gt;The tyrant king
Neutral special
goal: _kill everyone who does not need to survive_
_passives:_ immune to death and being occupied, pass the torch
**Night ability one: guards!** same as current. -2 uses
**Night ability two: executioner** send your loyal executioner to kill your target. Physician will be occupied if they attempt to exhume them.
**Day ability: Royal finger** your next accusation will count double
**Day ability: Decide Fate** same as current

If you are wondering why he has guards even though he is death immune, it is so players cannot test of he is the tyrant by asking to send guards.

I don&#39;t like neutral killers having an easy out in becoming a neutral king. The tyrant king would be fairly simple to implement (I think i&#39;m not a techno wizard) and increase the tenseness of games.</description>

            <p>First of all.</p>
<p>This role has guards.  Which means that unlike the NK King, it can masquerade as a normal King.</p>
<p>The original NK King is pretty much fucked the moment someone asks for guards which is a pretty stupid and cheap flaw and pretty much almost guarantees the NK King will always lose.</p>

</aside>
<p>the point of the guards is to blend in, so they can’t ask for guards to out you.</p>

<p>100 times is an exaggeration. And why shouldn’t they be rewarded? It would give royals incentive to step up.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can’t agree with you here.<br>
1.Being immune to death and to occupy are not necessarily 2 passives. Scorned’s Resolve is only one passive, and it has both. Pass the Torch and Resolve are 2 passives in total.<br>
2. The guards allow the Neutral Killing King to fake being a real king AT ALL.<br>
3.NK should not be rewarded with an easy King claim upon stepping up? Look, with NK kings possible it should be the reverse: If the Blue Dragon or whoever has the majority falls for the NK’s fakeclaim and makes them King with NK Kings being a possibility then the Neutral Killer <em>does</em> deserve an easy King claim, as punishment for the dumb idiots who voted the killer up.</p>
