    <description>Still really boring, but now people can randomly say horrible crap to you and you can&#39;t report them because you never know who they were.

Maybe let them talk back to people at night at least?</description>

            <p>Yeah, PM and Maid was sort of boring, but at least useful sometimes.</p>
<p>Then again, no one ever whispers lately, so who knows.  It was the best version so far.</p>

            <p>Nay, the entire class should just be reworked. Hearsay is a completely useless ability and I’m not sure why they’re trying to add RNG-based abilities, completely goes against the flavor of the game.</p>
<p>Two patches ago was the best Noble was, with Maid Spy and Private Matter. Right now Nobles are nearly useless.</p>
