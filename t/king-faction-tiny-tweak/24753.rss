    <title>King Faction tiny tweak</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/king-faction-tiny-tweak/24753</link>
    <description>I realize this might sound sooooo silly in the eyes of veteran players, but I  wonder if newer/novice players actually realize their faction alignment as King. When I first started, I erroneously believed I was BD when I was Neut, and visa versa, etc. I wonder, could the King&#39;s Faction icon/description be made just a little bit more obvious for those of us a little slow on the uptake?

Sometimes I encounter BD kings who totally trash their own faction, and when they die everyone is shocked to discover they are BD. Veteran (seemingly advanced?) players don&#39;t seem to do this - so I wonder if it&#39;s a matter of understanding the class card information clearly, just like I goofed on when I first started playing.

Rolling King can be overwhelming if you&#39;re not yet a confident ToL player, and there&#39;s a lot of info to keep track of! It seems it would just make life easier on everyone :slight_smile: 

Please and thank you for your excellent works</description>

            <p>exactly this ^^^</p>
<p>*** as vets, we know better ***</p>
<p>But there’s no positive reason to make the learning curve on newbies even more steep, when their understanding can impact the outcome of a game for ALL players.</p>
<p>My point is, it would be an ultra simple fix, and really not offend or detriment anyone (except potentially the people who take the change personally, lol).</p>
<p>Elitist or not, I’d rather not spend days in game trying to amend a misunderstanding about a king’s faction or have to play catch-up for my team because King is <em>erroneously</em> playing for the wrong team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems to me it hypothetically would just minimize confusion and streamline the access to enjoyment of play for everyone</li>
</ul>

            <p>You don’t have to tell me that. I’m just pointing out an inconsistency in the game that new players can get tripped up on. King is special, but there is absolutely no reason why there can’t be 3 individual classes for Evil, Neutral, and Good King with individual class cards under each faction, in alignment with the state of literally every other class. Their win conditions are different, so they are distinctly different classes. A Drunk converted to Alcoholic doesn’t still say “Drunk” with a purple border, it changes the class card to that of the Unseen class despite Drunk and Alcoholic having the same abilities. The same should hold true for King. This way, clicking on the class card gives an instant indication of faction and avoids any possible confusion for new players that do not know of the particular quirks of the game.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but when I first started playing, I was busy trying to figure out what the rest of the 41 classes were all about when I spawned as King for my first ever game. This is a perfectly fine consistency suggestion, hard to see why you wouldn’t agree.</p>

            <p>I picked that quirk up quickly. But I was a new player 250 hours ago and I didn’t know every facet of the damn game as a first timer. There’s a lot of mechanics to think about in ToL, missing a system message isn’t the stupidest thing in the world for a first timer. King is confusing for a new player because it is the only class that isn’t classified by faction in the class cards, simple as that.</p>

            <p>I think the issue is, if it’s your first few times playing king, player does not know to look out for that system message, and the portraits aren’t clear. It’s the ONLY class that requires you to read that message. Even scorned and merc have icons on the player list that tell you what you need to know.</p>
<p>Can we get some obnoxiously obvious asterisks or something added to that initial text line? Or make a damn dragon/dagger symbol to paste on the portrait</p>
<p>I get that people should be smarter, but I cant force them to do that from my chair. All I can do is say dudes it’s an issue - pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease take 30 seconds to change the color to green and add some HEY LOOK AT ME symbols. Or whatever. Idc. Just… yea.</p>

            <p>I also was confused what faction I was as King when I first started playing ToL, it’s not entirely obvious since at that point just distinguishing BD/evils is tough enough knowing only a few of the classes. Also got King on my first game, which I read wasn’t supposed to happen. I remember looking up king portrait on the wiki to figure out my actual alignment, but that is still confusing for Neutral vs BD king.</p>

            <p>I don’t disagree with you; tbh from my own elitist perspective having a BD king who thinks he’s neut is such a fkng headache for their players lol.</p>
<p>Evil King is obvious to new players imo; I think the confusion stems from BD/Neut differentiation</p>

            <p>If people miss the system message, and the different illustration… then RIP. I guess it couldn’t hurt, but the ol’ ‘Get good’ elitist in me spawned out there for a second. I frankly feel you should be able to notice the message, but I guess having the class card when you click on it outline your alignment more clearly could work too.</p>

            <p>I think we can all agree that there’s a learning curve to ToL<br>
And remember the very first time you rolled King as a new player?<br>
“OH SHIT OH NO OH GOD WHAT DO!!!” was about my reaction.<br>
Lol, I think it’s fair to presume that at least a FEW other people have similar experiences <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Not sure why/how this could offend your sensibilities, but apologies, as it seems it has.</p>
<p>I personally still see no drawbacks to the suggestion!</p>

            <p>yep, it’s there – i just think it’s just not wholly obvious to new players, since they dont know to look for that supplemental system message. I mean - even if the message was just turned neon green instead of yellow to be a lil more ostentatious!</p>
<p>Unlike any other class, you have to read that system msg instead of just looking at class card.</p>
<p>as <a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@vandalay</a> said, increasing the clarity of the King Faction info really doesn’t have any negative drawbacks for anyone. It’s just helpful lol</p>

<p>Funfact: During Alpha, Boslof added new ways to denote which King you were, it wasn’t like it is now.</p>

            <p>I do agree… I mean it does send a system message at the bottom telling people their alignment, but I have seen people more confused. I don’t see any reason it would hurt to have the name plate at the top say “Good King” “Evil King” “Neutral king”</p>

            <p>I realize this might sound sooooo silly in the eyes of veteran players, but I  wonder if newer/novice players actually realize their faction alignment as King. When I first started, I erroneously believed I was BD when I was Neut, and visa versa, etc. I wonder, could the King’s Faction icon/description be made just a little bit more obvious for those of us a little slow on the uptake?</p>
<p>Sometimes I encounter BD kings who totally trash their own faction, and when they die everyone is shocked to discover they are BD. Veteran (seemingly advanced?) players don’t seem to do this - so I wonder if it’s a matter of understanding the class card information clearly, just like I goofed on when I first started playing.</p>
<p>Rolling King can be overwhelming if you’re not yet a confident ToL player, and there’s a lot of info to keep track of! It seems it would just make life easier on everyone <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Please and thank you for your excellent works</p>
