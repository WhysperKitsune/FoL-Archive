    <title>Give Possessors Royal Finger when possessing the king</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/give-possessors-royal-finger-when-possessing-the-king/34984</link>
    <description>Currently, possessing the king is extremely dangerous because you can be caught out by your inability to use Royal Finger.

Therefore, I suggest just giving Royal Finger to any Possessor who takes the king (until they switch bodies again.)  This is a buff for them, of course, but possessing the king is extremely risky anyway, since they&#39;re usually guarded and obviously are the center of attention, so I think it&#39;s fine to give them a benefit for doing so successfully.

And needless to say, it also makes thematic / lore sense.</description>

            <p>I’d have to fully disagree, in the sense that it makes possesing the king too powerful. The king is by definition untestable via almost all means. No investigative, can’t even be jailed for petes sake. If it weren’t for that huge flaw… possesing the king would be a no brainer freebie, especially if you leave the old husk as a reaper corpse.</p>
