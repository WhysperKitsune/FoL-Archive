    <title>Potential way to stop the whisper meta</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/potential-way-to-stop-the-whisper-meta/52458</link>
    <description>Now we all know the whisper meta  and I personally think that people just need to get good and just get known for being a complete fool which is why I have come to the greatest conclusion

# I am the counter to the whisper meta. 

No i&#39;m joking but if ya&#39;ll want to get rid of this whisper meta then you should do the following 


1 - Make it so that you don&#39;t see who whispers to you. 


Mass king claims and etc would be negated + evils can easily counter a counter to this. 


Example:

Someone whispered to you: I am the Knight {Logs} I am 3
Someone whispered to you: I am the Princess {Logs} I am 3

Wot u gonna fucking do?

Did the evil person whisper before or was it the good one? Instantly counters whisper meta + not everyone is going to fucking be confirmed.


2. No one will see who is whispering.


For everyone else it will say &quot;Someone whispered to {Number}&quot;

Ez counter to some other counter strat for the first point


3. All of this fits with the original purpose of whispers 

Whispers are supposed to be secret, if the person you are whispering to decides to out you then it ruins the point of whispering. Now they can&#39;t out you. + New Masterminds/Evils wouldn&#39;t need to be completely hated by the other evil who they whispered too and when the new evil dies then the evil that they whispered too wasn&#39;t outed.

4. It&#39;s a buff to noble 

Maid spy would be great with this + A Catch, you get to see who whispered to the person. Even though that this could cause problems if a prince outed himself and told everyone to mass claim to him, noble wouldn&#39;t be able to truly out anyone until he died, which at least would be 2 nights after the prince was outed (1 night if the noble random guessed the prince). But then again, in that amount of time alot of things can happen,

1. Noble converted
2. Noble dead night after prince is outed
3. Prince gets enforcered or firewalled
4. King is straight up evil and just kills the prince. 
5. King ups prince because someone already claimed prince to him (They don&#39;t get outed).
6. Fake claiming prince is now actually a viable strat. 
7. Etc



5. Make meta gaming warnable
No reason not to be</description>

            <p>meta gaming has never been a sanely enforcable rule… because when it comes down to it you won’t get agreements on it, and once you open that can of worms you get a huge mess.</p>
<p>That’s why even “everyone knows and hates it” cases they always solve it by fixing the mechanics that make it possible like in town of salem when jailors asked people to read their class card verbatim,</p>
<p>or in ToL where princes asked people to describe their room, it was solved by adding room pictures to the in game class info. When metagamers demanded people to copy/paste their “you occupied X” message, they made system messages unselectable etc…</p>
<p>A simple challange, if you made a topic called “what is meta gaming”. give say 10 examples. Things like “prince confirming what he is via something he said in jail”, “Psychic telepathically announcing he is psychic”, Demanding logs, asking to whisper classes etc…</p>
<p>You’ll really quickly find that almost nobody agrees with eachother on where the line is. Realizing that we can’t agree on a definition… is going to make it real obvious why they sure as heck aren’t going to want to try and enforce it… as the mod’s look over every report, there wouldn’t be a game going by where someone was reported for metagaming, and every punishment, there would be a 50/50 split of people saying “yes that’s deserved” “no this is nonsense moderation”.</p>
<p>If you want to talk a serious can of worms… metagaming moderation is absolutely the biggest nightmare imaginable.</p>

            <p>Adding in a mechanic that has a clear way to circumvent its purpose wouldn’t fix the problem, and doing blanket bans on something that has so little clear definition such as meta-gaming wouldn’t help that either.</p>

            <p>How would you like it if your favorite mechanic in a game became meta? Even though you know it was not ment for that specific purpose.</p>
<p>How would you like it if you got countered because someone whispered a letter to a King?</p>
<p>How would you like it if you got insta lynched as a new player because you didn’t know the current meta?</p>
<p>And how would you like it if you could never fake claim prince? (Probably just me)</p>

            <p>And NightX is calculating things wrong.</p>
<p>The metagamers aren’t the people who are the ones whispering, it is the ones who are trying to break the game.</p>
<p>Deliberately marking something via a note that was implemented because people wanted to draw or do some fun things with it and turning it into a metagaming tool is a sin.</p>

            <p>Now we all know the whisper meta  and I personally think that people just need to get good and just get known for being a complete fool which is why I have come to the greatest conclusion</p>
<h1>I am the counter to the whisper meta.</h1>
<p>No i’m joking but if ya’ll want to get rid of this whisper meta then you should do the following</p>
<p>1 - Make it so that you don’t see who whispers to you.</p>
<p>Mass king claims and etc would be negated + evils can easily counter a counter to this.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Someone whispered to you: I am the Knight {Logs} I am 3<br>
Someone whispered to you: I am the Princess {Logs} I am 3</p>
<p>Wot u gonna fucking do?</p>
<p>Did the evil person whisper before or was it the good one? Instantly counters whisper meta + not everyone is going to fucking be confirmed.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>No one will see who is whispering.</li>
</ol>
<p>For everyone else it will say “Someone whispered to {Number}”</p>
<p>Ez counter to some other counter strat for the first point</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>All of this fits with the original purpose of whispers</li>
</ol>
<p>Whispers are supposed to be secret, if the person you are whispering to decides to out you then it ruins the point of whispering. Now they can’t out you. + New Masterminds/Evils wouldn’t need to be completely hated by the other evil who they whispered too and when the new evil dies then the evil that they whispered too wasn’t outed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It’s a buff to noble</li>
</ol>
<p>Maid spy would be great with this + A Catch, you get to see who whispered to the person. Even though that this could cause problems if a prince outed himself and told everyone to mass claim to him, noble wouldn’t be able to truly out anyone until he died, which at least would be 2 nights after the prince was outed (1 night if the noble random guessed the prince). But then again, in that amount of time alot of things can happen,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Noble converted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noble dead night after prince is outed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prince gets enforcered or firewalled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>King is straight up evil and just kills the prince.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>King ups prince because someone already claimed prince to him (They don’t get outed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake claiming prince is now actually a viable strat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make meta gaming warnable<br>
No reason not to be</p>
</li>
</ol>
