    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Ghost</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-ghost/175</link>
    <description>The Ghost (Neutral/Dead) - 
  As soon as a player dies, they become a ghost. These players will have certain things they can do during the day and night phases. Say for example that they were killed by a Blue Dragon Killing role, they can haunt that person and this make it so that 3% of the time that they speak, it will come out as a Troll Box message that you choose.

Day Ability 1:
  [PASSIVE] Can speak among the dead players.

Day Ability 2 (Optional):
  [PASSIVE, If killed by own team, if Night Ability 1 was used] If killed by a Blue Dragon Killing role, they can choose whether or not to haunt that player the following day, 3% of the time that player speaks, it will come out as a Troll Box message that you choose...

Night Ability 1:
  [IF KILLED BY OWN TEAM] Choose if you want to haunt that player for the rest of the game. If so, the Day Ability 2 applies.

Night Ability 2 (Optional)
  Can Speak amongst the dead.

Lore:
  [No lore suggested, the lore I had there was trash]

Edits:
v1.21 Edited the criteria on Night Ability 1 and Day Ability 2  (25th April 2017)
v1.22 Edited the Possible Help Cries to be a Troll Box sorta thing (25th April 2017)
v1.23 Edited the edits thing so it is only the 3 previous, updated summary (25th April 2017)</description>
