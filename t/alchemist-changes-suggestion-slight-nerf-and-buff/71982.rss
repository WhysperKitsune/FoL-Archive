    <title>Alchemist Changes. (Suggestion) [Slight Nerf and buff?]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/alchemist-changes-suggestion-slight-nerf-and-buff/71982</link>
    <description>Reminder this is a suggestion made by me so It might not be perfect that&#39;s why you can comment on what you&#39;d change.

**Alchemist**
-Passive Coagulate, Immune to poisons/Bleeding.

**Day Ability**
-Stone Skin, makes you immune that night (3 uses)

**Night Ability(s)**
Crimson potion, now 3 uses.
Emerald potion, now 2 uses.
Truth potion, Not usable until N3, will only find faction even if bd, 2 uses.
Tar Potion, 2 uses, gain occupy immunity while using tar.

I feel like this changes alch enough to make it on the same level as old alch, 3 emerald potions is one too many reducing healing and occupy makes you use it wisely, truth potion getting a Nerf is needed, bringing back stone skin so Alch is a use to the bd instead of worrying about themselves.</description>
