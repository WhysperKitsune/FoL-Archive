    <description># Watch Your Mouth!: Sophomore Year

Hosted by DatBird and Chloe

## Inside Marlvard University are some of the most brilliant minded individuals in the forums. Thirteen individuals have passed their entrance exams and are ready to prove their worth to the world.  One with a perfect score, so the principal handed him a loaded gun. However, four others had failed as their vocabulary is too basic for their age. How can they improve, you may ask? Make a special bomb that detonates if someone says a certain word! ~~Then there is their teacher who hates life and found out about the bomb and wants nothing more than for it to explode on him.~~ If that isn&#39;t a great idea, I don&#39;t know what is.


## Welcome

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an idea that Squid formed while working last minute on a mini essay for her English class! Don&#39;t ask me why Squid made such a sadistic game, but hey, there&#39;s explosions, so there&#39;s that.

## Rules
I&#39;m sure you all know the typical rules by now, but I&#39;m going to make them clear so that there isn&#39;t anything like a frat party that had been stopped by the cops.
1. Be nice to one another
2. Do not throw the game
3. Do not post at night
4. Do not shoot angles, that&#39;s only for Hunters
5. If you&#39;re not active for 24 hours, I will send out a prod, if there is no response within twelve hours of the prod, then I will have to kick them out and find a replacement
6. 20 posts per phase required
7. Graduate with a smile :smiley:
8. Also some pamphlet with this stuff written on it

#### Follow the [Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules - Please Read First ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244), and the [Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926). Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.



## Gameplay
- ### The Bomb has been upgraded since last year at the cost of not picking the word vote or any players name it can pick up basic things like putting spaces between your words, or misspellings thus making the bomb way more deadly. It also has newly built-in technology to detect if someones reading a dictionary or snippets of it, thus any attempts to use that to your advantage or disadvantage to others will not activate the bomb. It will only detect normal human speech.
- There are three types of roles in this game, a Student, an Honor Student, and Planter. All three fall into two factions: Students and Planters
- Non-Honour-Students don&#39;t have any special abilities, they have classes to go to :/
- The Honour Student has a gun with a 1 bullet in it that they can use at night once.
- Planters will have a private PM thread to discuss what they please
- Every night (Including Night 0), the Planters pick a word that has at least four letters to be used as the trigger word
- If the trigger word is said, the first person that said it gets blown up and is out of the game
- If the latest trigger word has not been said, then it will come into play the next day until someone says it
- Along with selecting a trigger word, the Planters can choose who to kill that night
- Days will last for 48 hours while Nights last for 24 hours 
- Executions in this game are done by plurality and majority so that inactivity won&#39;t give the Planters the automatic win
- Upon tied votes, a random player (including no-elim) tied for the most votes will be expelled.
- Bombs are disabled in Lylo cause no insurgency 2.0
- Votes are locked in lylo
- Images with words still count towards bombs
**There are no journals or death notes, so don&#39;t ask for one**

## Roles

[details=&quot;Click it ya Nerd&quot;]
&gt; # [color=green]Student[/color]
&gt; You might be a typical college looking for loans to pay, but you have the drive to take out the scum that are trying to destroy the campus once more.
*You win when all the Planters are either expelled or killed.*

&gt; # [color=green]Honor Student[/color]
&gt; You&#39;re one of the top students that has attended Marlvard thanks to your countless hours of studying and support from your professors. That&#39;s why you received a gun as a consolation prize.... That&#39;s kind of weird, but you&#39;re sure it&#39;ll come in handy.
*You win when all the Planters are either expelled or killed.*

&gt; # [color=red] Planter[/color]
&gt; Your predecessors from before have managed to destroy Marlvard University last year and like them, you have failed your vocabulary test. It&#39;s always best to follow the experts. 
&gt;
&gt;You, along with the other planters, will discuss which word (It must contain four letters or more) you will use as a trigger on each night and Day 0. The first person to say the word will be killed in an explosion. You can also submit a night kill on each night.
*You win when you reach parity with the Students.*

            <p>Oh, thank you so much for the team player award. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I am so grateful to those who voted for me. I appreciate the recognition of my passion (though sometimes misdirected <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">) for the game.</p>
<p>Congrats to the wolf team for winning! Appel did an excellent job of establishing herself as town and maintaining that position to the end. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>While there were a number of other wonderful players, I did want to make a shout out for the town player I ended up choosing: Katze. Both Vulgard and Katze did a great job stepping into their slots and making the end game quite interesting. Katze additionally expanded my thinking enough to wonder about Appel and Vulgard. Unfortunately I was stuck in mostly thinking he was a wolf and trying to trick me. But if things had gone into the next day, who knows, he might have convinced me further. Still, not sure that would have been enough for us to win. Anyway, nice work, Katze. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>frankly the extent to which you continued posting and solving, even under pressure, is commendable <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/orange_heart.png?v=9" title=":orange_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":orange_heart:"></p>

</aside>
<p>this is honestly the main takeaway <a class="mention" href="/u/whysper">@whysper</a></p>
<p>even when i voted you i still thought you were somewhat towny</p>
<p>you were under the hotspot literally all game and you <em>knew it was wrong</em> but instead of getting mad or giving up you kept fighting, a <strong>lot</strong> of players struggle with that and i personally know i can shut down a bit</p>
<p>i think if we slept we might have gotten there in F3</p>
<p>i have a lot of respect for how much you tried and im sorry you still lost <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>

            <p>Oh God, I’m not sure how I feel about the 2 quotes of mine that were nominated. Though I still stand behind much of the sentiments, I’m feeling a bit ashamed with my wording.

            <p>Yeah, I think a short break will be good. I also want to get back to practicing reads and evaluate my games. I was suppose to continue that with Geyde but never did since I spent all my available time on the games. It’s too hard to do both at the same time, so I need to focus on the practice/improvement for now.</p>
<p>Haha, I’d love to adopt you. My two nieces, whom I treat like daughters, are only like a few years younger than you. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"> They would love you as a big sister.</p>

            <p>whysper shush now<br>
you did so well considering this was only your fourth game and i for one would have just frozen and let others do the decision making for me. but you kept putting in effort and didn’t give up. you’ve proven yourself to be a good player already but even i understand why you’d want to take a break for awhile now and i don’t blame you for it.<br>
long story short go whysper! <span class="bbcode-s">also please adopt me</span></p>

            <p>I haven’t had a chance to go through all the chat yet. I skimmed through but want to read again. Many of you have much kinder words than I was expecting. It truly makes me want to cry. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/cry.png?v=9" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt=":cry:"></p>
<p>I have apologies as well for my part in making things go off the rails for town. I kept wondering whether it would have been better in the long run for me to try to get ML’d so I didn’t draw so much attention away from the real wolves. From hindsight, perhaps it would have been since I was a constant wagon and the final ML. But as far as gameplay, I don’t think we want to encourage people to just give up when they are targeted.</p>
<p>I think I saw Apprentice or Geyde or perhaps both suggest something about how we need to better calibrate our reads based on player personalities. This is definitely something I am behind. I think this would make reads much better. I’m toying with the idea of developing a personality type list similar to Myer-Briggs or the Big Five.</p>
<p>I hope there are no hard feelings. I don’t hold any grudges. I completely understand how each player reacted based on their playstyle and view of how the game should be played even if I don’t entirely agree with their mindsets. And I honestly wasn’t trying to start deep wolf hunting nor going against the top tier players or whatever. I’m sorry it ended up that way.</p>
<p>Okay, stopping here since this is already bordering on becoming a wallpost. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>The quality of town’s play after you died doesn’t change the quality of your own play.</p>
<p>Even if jane was wolf I think it would be a bad play.</p>
<p>It’s like if my dad was like “Well son, I gambled your college savings and I doubled the money!”</p>
<p>I’m not gonna be pissed but that doesn’t change that gambling my college savings is a dumb idea</p>
<p>and if he went “Well son, I gambled your college savings and I lost all of it” even thought I specifically told him just to not touch it i’d be rightfully mad</p>
<p>you took a gamble you should not have and lost, even if I flunked out of college doesn’t change that you should not have gambled my savings</p>
<p>even if you doubled the money doesn’t change that you should not have done it</p>
<p>this isn’t comparative, it was not a good idea regardless of the eventual outcome, and this conversation is no longer productive so im just going to not</p>
