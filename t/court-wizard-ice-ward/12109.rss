    <title>Court Wizard Ice Ward</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-ice-ward/12109</link>
    <description>Last game I attempted to Ice Ward the Hunter. That night he used his Bear to guard. I got the message that I was unable to ward him. This could be due to Court Wizard, Fool, Mercenary, Poacher, Sellsword (There was another class I cant remember). When I asked 12 what happened last night he said &quot;I used bear to guard - thats why you couldnt visit me&quot;. I almost accused him because of the unable to block message.

Message needs updated to new classes please for us newbies.</description>
