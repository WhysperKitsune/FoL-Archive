    <title>(Neutral Social Class) Soothsayer / Doomsayer and Doombringer</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-social-class-soothsayer-doomsayer-and-doombringer/25756</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;ve given a bit of thought into this one - only because I think that sometimes it can be hard to get a conversation going in general if there is a distrusting or new crowd of BD, or a new or distrusting king, etc. Also, the Neuts could stand to have a class that joins in the fun a bit more than just the NKs do and all the others hiding. The idea of this class is to through your own methods attempt to protect the king or to out him and replace him with your man.


I&#39;d like to know any feedback or suggestions, just in general I&#39;d be interested to see how these play.

&gt; **Soothsayer:**
&gt; 
&gt; Type: Unique Social, Mutually Exclusive to the Court Wizard.
&gt; Win Conditions: Game ends with an Evil King alive.
&gt; Converted Class: Doombringer / The Apostle
&gt; Faction: Neutral
&gt; 
&gt; Passive Abilities:
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Ear&quot; Able to speak directly to the king in secret during the Night. King still cannot respond. (Disguised as &quot;...whispers...: msg&quot;)
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Favor&quot; Immune to being Jailed by the Prince.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Abilities:
&gt; &quot;Doubt&quot; (1x) Change the revealed class of a player if they are executed. Only usable while a player is on trial. 
&gt; Night Abilities:
&gt; &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; (Infinite) Shows the night result text of a random player (including the King). Does not reveal the player that was revealed. Sometimes *Fizzles* and provides no information.




&gt; **Doomsayer:**
&gt; Type: Unique Social, Mutually Exclusive to the Court Wizard.
&gt; Win Conditions: Game ends with Good King alive.
&gt; Converted Class: Doombringer / The Apostle
&gt; Faction: Neutral
&gt; 
&gt; Passive Abilities:
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Ear&quot; Able to speak directly to the king in secret during the Night. King still cannot respond. (Disguised as &quot;...whispers...: msg&quot;)
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Favor&quot; Immune to being Jailed by the Prince.
&gt; Day Abilities: 
&gt; &quot;Tongues&quot; (1x) All messages seem to come from different players. All votes for treason or execution are shown correctly to those who do them, but incorrectly to all others. 
&gt; Night Abilities:
&gt; &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; (Infinite) Shows the night result text of a random player (including the King). Does not reveal the player whos result was revealed. Sometimes *Fizzles* and provides no information.



&gt; **Doombringer:**
&gt; 
&gt; Type: Unique Social, converted Soothsayer or Doomsayer.
&gt; Win Conditions: Unseen Win
&gt; Faction: Unseen
&gt; 
&gt; Passive Abilities:
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Ear&quot; Able to speak directly to the king in secret during the Night. King still cannot respond. (Disguised as &quot;...whispers...: msg&quot;)
&gt; &quot;The King&#39;s Favor&quot; Immune to being Jailed by the Prince.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Abilities:
&gt; &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1x) All players lose the ability to speak with the exception of the King, and the Doombringer using his &quot;The King&#39;s Ear&quot; ability. Only 1 accusation of treason is required and only the king may accuse. All players may still vote to execute or pardon. Lasts 30 seconds or until the king accuses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Abilities:
&gt; &quot;Choke&quot; (2x) Targeted player loses the ability to speak the next day for the entire day.</description>

            <p>That’s a good suggestion, I had put their converted class as Apostle already, which would mean they were Social hah. Fixed, and thanks for the feedback sir!</p>

            <p>I’m just gonna say two things about the class type</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The abilities more fit in the social category, so make the class type social.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a Support class type would make the class become the ritualist in cult games, you can fix this by making the class type social.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make the class type Social, other than that. It’s cool.<br>
Still keep him as unique</p>
