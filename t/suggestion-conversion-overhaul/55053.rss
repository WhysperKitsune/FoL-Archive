    <title>[Suggestion] Conversion Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-conversion-overhaul/55053</link>
    <description>_Hello dear fellow, my name is Crowkowdile in game. I was recently banned for 1 day because i did a mistake losing myself because of this conversion system._

_So cause of that, i want to suggest a new conversion systeme complete overhaul. This wont ever happen and will never be accepted. Let&#39;s just be honest and just give our thumps up and down to this idea._

_ATTENTION : My native langage is French ! I never learned english other than talking with english guys and watching VOSTFR movies. So please be gentle._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**COMPLETE CONVERSION OVERHAUL**

Mastermind Convert Ability reworked:

&gt; Offer the selected player to choose between &quot;death&quot; or &quot;being converted&quot;. He will be able to choose during the day but will not be able to do anything else until he pick. If death, 2-for-1 gain 1 charge.
&gt; If death =&gt; He dies the next night without having the possibilty to do anything else. Will most likely appear like a reaped guy
&gt; If Conversion =&gt; He will be converted instantly choosing this path during the day.
&gt; No cooldown. Unlimited use.
&gt; Cannot fail. If the target is unconvertable, he will soon die the night he was converted.

Cult-Leader Brainwash Ability reworked: 

&gt; Offer the selected player to choose between &quot;death&quot; or &quot;being converted&quot;. He will be able to choose during the day but will not be able to do anything else until he pick. If death is choosen, you gain one charge of eradicate.
&gt; If death =&gt; He dies the next night without having the possibilty to do anything else. Will most likely appear like a reaped guy
&gt; If Conversion =&gt; He will be converted instantly choosing this path during the day.
&gt; No cooldown. Unlimited use.
&gt; Cannot fail. If the target is unconvertable, he will soon die the night he was converted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECOND IDEA 

Mastermind Convert Ability reworked:

&gt; Offer the selected player to be converted into the unseen during the day convert was used. The player can choose between &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;.
&gt; If the player pick &quot;pass&quot; he will still be alive and able to do his class-card abilities but all the targets he will visit will be offered to be converted too and so on... if pass keep being choosed
&gt; If the target pick &quot;yes&quot; they will be converted instantly during the actual day.
&gt; Max number of unseen up to 5. If the number is reached they will sacrifice themself to charge 2-for-1 up.
&gt; 1 day cooldown still. Unlimited use.
&gt; If unconvertable, the target will count as &quot;pass&quot; and then will transmit de conversion to the jailed, healed person.

Cult-Leader Brainwash Ability reworked: 

&gt; Offer the selected player to be converted into the cults during the day Brainwash was used. The player can choose between &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;.
&gt; If the player pick &quot;pass&quot; he will still be alive and able to do his class-card abilities but all the targets he will visit will be offered to be converted too and so on... if pass keep being choosed
&gt; If the target pick &quot;yes&quot; they will be converted instantly during the actual day.
&gt; Max number of Cult up to 6. If the number is reached they will sacrifice themself to charge eradicate up.
&gt; 1 day cooldown still. Unlimited use.
&gt; If unconvertable, the target will count as &quot;pass&quot; and then will transmit de conversion to the jailed, healed person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the ideas ? Any advices ? I want them to not be forced to be converted the night they are.... this is stupid because most of the time, cult/unseen convert people who are confirmed or convert people just before they will die.

This shit happened to me.
1 assassin dying, 1 Mastermind left and bleeding. He was about to die tonight and about to lose by my wolf and choosed to convert me, the hunter who just killed 2 unseen and winned.
They did that on purpose to make me lose with them. This is a RP and Calm game. I want it to be like this and not be able to rage on it.</description>

            <p>Infinite “Pass” or “Death” cycle, always 2 unseen/cult therefore BD will ALWAYS win no matter what.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Again though, what’s the motivation to ever accept a conversion. If you refuse, and you know 9/10 BD are going to refuse, than you can safely and accurately assume unseen/cult is pretty doomed. Meaning joining them is a bad idea.</p>
<p>plus you can’t really define gamethrowing with a system like that. It is gamethrowing to intentionally set yourself up to be converted. By offering a choice, you made the "intentionally getting converted’ something that doesn’t make sense, because all conversions would be intentional</p>

            <p>I realize where this is coming from. Last minute conversions into a loss suck. But realize they are part of the game and you’re only out like 40 gold. Yes the big screen says “Loss” but they aren’t tracked, and the game is still all for fun.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>why it’s bad goes to a game theory playing to win concept. BD has the maximum chance of winning if the unseen/cult can’t convert. By rejecting the conversion you both stay on BDs side, and maximize the odds that BD is pretty much guaranteed to win.</p>
