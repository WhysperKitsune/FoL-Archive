    <title>Please Add a Share Log Option to the Game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/please-add-a-share-log-option-to-the-game/19106</link>
    <description>Hi there.  I would like to suggest adding a Share Log option to the game. This will eliminate the need to copy and paste when logs are demanded.  Most of the time I am unable to get my complete log out if someone asks for it.  Someone suggested I make shorter log entries but my log entries are already pretty short.

Thanks for listening, thank you for your hard work, and thank you for creating such an enjoyable game.</description>

            <p>I think I’d like to see the Private Notes and Public Journal in a side by side format.</p>
<p>I’ve typed stuff in my Private Notes as well but you can only have one or the other up.  It’d be cool to see them side by side and if possible maybe have a button next to all information or each page or note that allows you to share it easily.</p>
<p>Maybe a “Share Entry” button.  And then when you type a new note in any of the journals (private and public) have a button that says “New Entry” that then produces another “Share Entry” button for that entry.  Of course you would have to have a “Share All Entries” button in that case too.  But I don’t know… might be too complicated.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, I think we need to have a way to get information that can prove our innocence in a situation out faster.  Eliminate as many steps as possible to do so.</p>
<p>Right now its:<br>
Open<br>
Highlight<br>
Copy<br>
Close (I can’t remember off the top of my head but the journal I think can be up when chat is so this is probably not needed but you get the point).<br>
Paste to Chat.</p>
<p>And there is a limited number of characters that can be typed at a time. So to post another bit of the log you have to repeat the process.  I understand why there is a character limit and don’t think that should change.  But I would like to see a button or link posted in chat that allows anyone that wants to see the log see it.  So the information flow would be:</p>
<p>Open<br>
Press “Share”</p>
<p>A lot faster and also allows for the accused to defend themselves longer if need be rather than using up the time to copy and paste logs.</p>

            <p>Another thing I was thinking is to add a little notes section to the Player List, similar to checking journals when they die, that way you could put private notes on players right there on the Player List.  But this might make the information to spread out and hard to follow.</p>
<p>It is easier to have all your information in one spot I think.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people posting the list on the right side of their journal and then placing notes here.  Maybe they should just incorporate a list into your journal somehow. And then allow you to easily type in private notes.  The Share Journal would just share your actual journal.  Not your Private Notes in your Private Notes tab or information you place in the Player List Log (or whatever they call it). Dossier?</p>

            <p>Yeah, because when I am seeker I need to fill out my teammates information into my journal, I have it in private notes because rare is the player who looks back at what you posted (in that terrible formatting) but common are the people who look at journals</p>

            <p>As I’ve played this game more, if there’s one reason I’m against this it’s that I often keep info in my private notes as evil rather than in my will. Then I can just copy and paste whichever claim I end up using.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be against this change, provided it’s the journal’s left page only, but it’s just something to think about.</p>
