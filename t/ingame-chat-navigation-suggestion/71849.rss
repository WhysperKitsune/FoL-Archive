    <title>Ingame Chat Navigation Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ingame-chat-navigation-suggestion/71849</link>
    <description>I kinda fell like you should add a new section for when looking at the logs. Currently there are some good ones but I feel like one that should be added is a player&#39;s chat history. IMO, this would help a bit because you don&#39;t have to spend extra time singling out messages and whispers, PLUS as poss, you might want to know how your possessed target acted like in chat to make you less suspicious. It could be sorted like abilities, where it brings up a box and you click the number of the player&#39;s who&#39;s chat you want to check. So this way you want have to spend an extra 15 seconds checking if prince whispered to the king when the king says he never outed to him.</description>

            <p>An ISO feature would be amazing</p>
<p>Sadly if I remember correctly Boslof has said that coding chat features is a pain in the ass, so it may be a while</p>
