    <title>Killed as king when i had guards by a merc</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/killed-as-king-when-i-had-guards-by-a-merc/23701</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I were killed by a merc as a king when I had guards on myself.
There were no enforcer/reaper/any natural killer in the game. only assasian and a merc.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The guards should have made me immune


If mercs can bypass death immunity, at least write it on the class description</description>
