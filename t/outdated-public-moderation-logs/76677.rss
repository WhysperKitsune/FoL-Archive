# FM and FoL Blacklist

This list is effective immediately. Additions to the blacklist will be handled by the Forum of Lies team. 

|Player Name|Blacklisted From|Duration|Reason|
|---|---|---|---|
|cupcakeaj2|All Types|Indefinite|Excessive Slanking|
|Margaret|All Types|Indefinite|Gamethrowing|

Indefinite Blacklists last until said player has proven they have changed and have appealed directly with any of the moderation team listed below.

This thread is not the place to handle such appeals, if you wish to appeal, private message @PoisonedSquid, @eevee, @anon97870008 or @Luxy 

This blacklist applies to all types of games that need to be approved before ran, so turbo&#39;s are excluded and are up to hosts&#39; discretion. Blacklisted players may only backup in the event that a game could not be ran without them.</description>

            <h1>It’s been reverberent throughout the community that the moderation team should take harsher stances on player behaviour and this will henceforth be the case. It’s with a definite heavy heart that it had to come to this, as we do not wish to be exclusionary, but unfortunately this is necessary and will hopefully lead to a more stable forum in the future.</h1>
<h1>Having said so, <a class="mention" href="/u/emilia">@Emilia</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/isaac_gonzalez">@Isaac_Gonzalez</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/margaret">@Margaret</a> have been indefinitely blacklisted for toxicity or playing against their win condition in several games.</h1>
<h1>
<a class="mention" href="/u/alice">@Alice</a> will not be able to join the next FoL for insulting a host in FoL 21.</h1>
<h1>This is not a public tribunal.</h1>
<h1>This blacklist does not affect any ongoing games and hosts may choose to handle that amongst themselves. It however will be in effect for all future games or games currently in signups. Any attempt to derail ongoing games by blacklisted players will be scrutinized and bans will follow. Any chance at an appeal will also be lost should this occur.</h1>
