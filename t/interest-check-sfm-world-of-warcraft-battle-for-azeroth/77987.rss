    <description>**Welcome to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth!**

Hosted by @KyoDaz and x.

This setup follows simple forum rules. I hope you are all aware of them by now.
1. Follow the Global Forum Rules (https://toli.es/rules for in-game rules)
2. If you haven’t posted content in 36 hours, you’ll be prodded for inactivity. If you don’t respond to that prod in 12 hours, you will be force replaced.
3. No private messaging others in the game about the game.
4. Do not quote private host messages.
5. Don’t throw the game. This includes any form of intent to make you or your faction lose.
6. Refrain from posting so many times in a row.
7. Players are not allowed to use large fonts. These are reserved for the host.
8. Lets all have fun and play together!
9. Do not edit or delete made posts.
10. Do not like posts in a thread if you are dead in that game.

The setup will start once 16 players have signed up. Backups, spectators and co-hosts are appreciated.

**Gameplay**

Days will be 48 hours long, or shorter if someone is lynched.
Nights will be 24 hours long or until everyone has submitted their actions.
Actions are done by messaging me.
Players receive both a class and race. The race determines their alignment.
All players on the outnumbered faction will be aware of their faction superpower&#39;s identity and role.
You will become permanently occupy immune after 3 occupation attempts. This is not affected by or affect redirection.
You may choose one specialization once you receive your class. This cannot be changed.
All of the outnumbered faction will have a chat at all times. The faction Superpower is excluded from the chat.
The outnumbered faction automatically win once their numbers become = the majority faction.
The outnumbered faction do not have a faction kill. They however do have KPN thanks to their superpower. If the faction superpower dies the outnumbered faction will be able to kill every odd night.
Your specialization will be revealed upon flip.
Positive effects are anything that are mostly beneficial to a player such as visit prevention or healing.
Negative effects are anything that are mostly harmful to a player such as occupation or redirection.
There will be a period of silence once all of the classcards have been dealt. This is to enable players to select pre-game things such as specializations.

**Executions**

To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
Executions end the day.
Executions will be absolute majority (1/2 of alive players + 1) + plurality.

**After The Night**

Only investigative abilities will return feedback. It will either be a result or &#39;You could not investigate your target.&#39;

            <p>One of the main problems balancing this is the fact that some classes have KP and that any alignment can roll them, which makes it so that it’s very swingy. As well, town has a disadvantage when it comes to kill due to the fact of obviously not knowing who scum is if they attack town they die themselves, while scum wouldn’t have that problem.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s very town sided, I think it’s slightly town sided and that’s why I wanted to test it. Now that you do mention it I think that there shouldn’t actually be a class reveal for everyone, it confirms a certain class as scum if two town dies but neither of them had killing abiltiess. The super power can be fixed by just allowing them to use both abilities at once.</p>
<p>Other then that I think you are wrong on it being super town sided</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Kirefitten</span> whu would superpowers have night kill and night abilities.<br>
They are never gonna use them most of the time.</p>
<p>No chat makes it also harder to plan.</p>

            <p>Feels like it could be pretty harsh for scum? Since they can classes/races that don’t benefit their team much (or at least they get kinda limited in their choice of useful specialization), their kp is tied to lost wolf and if lost wolf dies, they are kinda screwed with only a half of kp.</p>
<p>And really a lot of healing/immunity abilities from what I skimmed… Some that prevent protection but you can’t coordinate with LW.</p>
