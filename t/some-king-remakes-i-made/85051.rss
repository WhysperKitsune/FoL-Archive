            <p>I didn’t get past this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decide an accused player’s fate. If used to trigger Hunter’s <strong>Retribution</strong> , King will be targeted with the arrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the goal supposed to protect sheep who random vote?  Is the King supposed to be punished for using his only interesting ability (which is single-use!)?  What’s the intent here?</p>
