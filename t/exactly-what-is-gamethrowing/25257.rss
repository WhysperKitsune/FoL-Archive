    <title>Exactly what is Gamethrowing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/exactly-what-is-gamethrowing/25257</link>
    <description>In general there are some pretty easy ways to tell a gamethrower.They don&#39;t do anything,hurt their own faction,spam useless things in chat,etc.But there are 2 classes where that become muddy-Alch and mercs.
I have asked this constantly is it gamethrowing if you kill a **CONFIRMED** alch or merc?The answer is usually no.But say in a scenario there is a BD king,2 alchs,assassin,any converted unseen,scorned(who already won),and a BD.This makes it to be 2 BDs 2 unseen and 3 neutrals.This means each side needs 2 votes to get someone on stand.King gets unseen to vote me,the alch,up and chooses to execute therefore losing BD the game.I was also a confirmed alchemist as during the game I healed 3 poisoned people.BD&#39;s only chance of winning was to get the alch&#39;s help but they executed instead which is gamethrowing right?
But it&#39;s not people say as your neutral and you might have destroyed BD.In that situation however BD will lose anyway UNLESS you side with them.So why throw away your only chance?The other one,mercs,is a little more fluid as mercs can be converted so it may have more debate.Also mercs are usually executed more as they have to confirm themself which is very hard to do.But alchs have this huge controversy surrounding them.






Now off topic can we please stop having dicks like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/261525739617255424/388513542527254539/unknown.png
This isn&#39;t me but i understand why you would want to execute an alch that is unconfirmed while an NK is alive.But seriously possessor was dead.-_-.The alch was confirmed and there was a MM out there that the prince could have jailed and exed instead.</description>

            <p>I agree, most of the time the target staying alive means they win, just not always, like a scorned, where they can lose while alive, or a scum, where them dying now would lead to their win, and even if not dying now makes them die later, the correct move as merc is to keep them alive</p>

            <p>Also Orange. I disagree.<br>
There’s some situations where killing a confirmed Alche should still be considered gamethrowing.<br>
Like in a F3 with Prince, Unseen and Alche for just 1 example</p>
<p>As Alche might be needed for BD to have a chance still. Or vice versa, for Unseen.</p>

            <p>That’s true.<br>
But, in majority of cases target staying alive means following their wincon, doesn’t it Simon?</p>

            <p>That’s why it says the whole game.<br>
As I do understand that tactic.<br>
Despite it being pretty bad.<br>
It’s really risky for little payoff</p>

</aside>
<p>I dont agree with this to a certain extend… Claiming inquisitor and not attacking for the first days as a Possessor is an amazing strategy. Since if you attack they know its a possessor game and you’ll be hanged. Of course at a certain point you jump and thats the moment you start killing.</p>

            <p>That’s the Screenshot I posted on discord <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I was the alche in that game. I’m going to say him executing me, even though he had no doubts about me being alchemist, is not technically game throwing -&gt; you could argue he is worried I might turn on BD and start bombing them in the end. Since BD are winning, I wouldn’t have done that. It’s a bad move on his part for sure, but there is a thin line-between poor play and game-throwing.</p>
<p>What I was primarily asking here was the slur, which, on its own, might have passed as a one word thing. But when you couple it with the rest of his attitude (I’m a dick and I don’t want you to win because jews), and his actions, I decided to report him and let the mods check out rest of his actions. He might easily be a person who throws, insults people based on race, which adds a lot of toxicity to a game which is all about social interaction. If it’s how he acts in general, then I don’t want players like this with me in a game, and I think they should be suspended.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Gamethrowing is by definition going against your own wincon.</p>
<p>So if confirmed Alche was alive with no NK, but was killed by Prince nevertheless, to a certain extent this is indeed gamethrowing. But the Alche needs to be 100% confirmed Alche (Someone needs a Neutral check on them) otherwise it could just be an Assassin faking it.<br>
It’d be like Fool purposefully voting up the final Unseen in a game just because “they can’t win”.<br>
Until game ends, you follow your wincon, even if it changes part way through due to conversion.</p>
<p>In many ways neutrals are the hardest to tell if they’re gamethrowing.<br>
However, it’s  likely that these are gamethrowing:<br>
Fool: Purposefully doing something which would end the game for them (Letting Assassin kill in F3, voting up someone who’s the only member of their faction left, letting CL kill or convert)<br>
Alche: P-Much everything goes.<br>
Scorned: Trying to keep your targets alive when voted up, pleading their innocence. Getting them killed at night.<br>
Merc: Trying to get your original contract killed. Until they die, you share your <strong>first</strong> contract’s wincon 100% and need to keep them alive then then you share your second<br>
Inquisitor: Don’t lie. Only Sorcerer (and others if they’re swapped around) knows if you have lied, but if you get caught it’s still throwing.<br>
Sorcerer/Reaper/Possessor: Being active but refusing to kill all game. They know there is a NK, you cannot hide that easily.<br>
(I might make a list later of other gamethrowing scenarios)</p>
