    <title>The New Noble Changes Remove a Key Niche From The Game, But There&#39;s a Brilliant Solution</title>

    <description>For the uninformed I will paste the Noble changes below:

[quote=&quot;Ellie, post:1, topic:9677&quot;]
Noble &amp; Aristocrat:

Removed Spy Maid.
Removed Private Matter.
Added new day ability Political Pressure - Force a player to accuse another player of treason and block further voting from them. 2 uses.
Added new day ability Noble Twin - Your vote for execution or pardon will count twice. 2 uses.
Added new night ability Royal Decree - Make a player immune to treason accusations the next day. Infinite uses.
[/quote]

Pre-change Noble was an incredibly high skill ceiling class that could really shape the direction of the game and, with a bit of luck and skill, build a reliable Blue Dragon network, particularly with the introduction of Private Matter a few patches back.

I&#39;m not totally against the changes presented but I would like the niche filled by the old Noble to be introduced back into the game in some way. Given Priest&#39;s departure from the game, a new class would fit rather nicely to the roster.

**Informant** (_Blue Dragon_ - Social)/**Turncoat** (_Unseen_ - Social)

Day Abilities:
Spy Maid (same as before)

Night Abilities: 
Blackmail - Prevent a player from voting tomorrow. (Basically Order, but more thematically named to suit a non royal class)
Leave note - Send an anonymous message to another player. They will see it in the morning. (essentially a single target version of a crier)

This class not only brings the OG Noble niche back into the game, but also helps limit the overabundance of Invokers in Cult games by adding another potential social conversion to the mix. Apostle is already an exceedingly rare appearance, which does little to help cult given how strong it is.</description>

            <p>I just had my first game as Noble after the Prince rework and i agree completely wit OP. I felt so useless the first 4 nights and then what do you know… I died night ,5. Only thing I was able to really do was prove there was a noble in game to help back up my claim with the order ability.</p>
<p>I think both night abilities are extremely situational and underpowered, even if they are infinite. I’d take a 1-3 charge ability - with IMPACT prior to day 5 - over those 2 infinites which have no practical use early game.</p>
<p>I think the main issue is that people get informed when the noble uses all of his abilities and it kind of makes them hard to use.</p>

            <p>Still doesn’t affirm my point that his beginning game is extremely weak and his end game is extremely situational. All the games abilities can be powerful when intended. Noble gets that big play every now and then but nothing like the other BD classes have.</p>

            <p>Again though, we’re talking about the first 5 turns or so. Vote manipulation is useless then because if you know someone is bad, so do all the BD and there are 3x as many BD as evil people.</p>
<p>The noble might as well AFK for the first 5 turns and hope he doesn’t get executed and come back on d6 or so where his abilities might have some impact. I mean honestly what buttons are even worth pressing when there’s 10+ people alive still?</p>

            <p>Is it though? If you know someone is bad as a noble, likely everyone else does too so unless it’s super late game and there’s only 4-5 people left, it’s pointless.</p>
<p>Noble is strong when the game is almost over but entirely useless before then, which makes it pretty unfun.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to chime in and say that I really miss maid spy. I’ve hard carried games before on Noble with maid spy by figuring out who the MM is. I’ve been able to relay information to the prince that was given to the king without the prince having to reveal himself, etc.</p>
<p>The new noble just feels so low impact, like way lower than even CW at its weakest ever was. None of your abilities are particularly useful until very late in the game, but by then no ability is as important as solid deduction. The only thing fun I can think of as noble is trolling a game by making some night immune class immune to being hanged.</p>
<p>I think current noble has the problem of “your abilities are useless on the first 4-5 turns and then you die,” whereas Maid Spy was useful d2.</p>

            <p>Noble is at an even worse state when it was already an extremely niche class. His abilities are practicially useless beginning of game and marginally effective end game (if he can even survive to that point). I remember a noble keeping a bad guy from voting at the end of the game for 3 turns in a row and it did nothing.</p>

<p>yes it was changed partially to fit the theme but it was also changed because Maid Spy and Private Message weren’t very good abilities</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No offense, but to me, new abilities of the noble are much worse than old ones. Old ones essentially rapidly allowed you to have as much info as the king (or more). This allowed you to literally take over if he was bad or evil. As a good player, i actually did extremely good as noble. I also sometimes used private matters to suck info from everyone pretending i’m a merc. It also prevented bad guys from whispering together.</p>
<p>New noble abilities doesn’t seem very usefull to me.</p>
<p>That being said, i think removing maid from the game is interesting because now the bad guys will be able to more freely whisper together.</p>

            <p>Oh you mean <em>Secret Message</em>? I think that ability didn’t work well with OG Noble because of the twins mechanic they had at the time. Attaching an essentially renamed version of the ability to a new class wouldn’t be a huge detriment to the game in my view.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s interesting that you should suggest that. Private Matter, for instance, this supposed ‘not good’ ability, was granted to the Psychic on the very same patch. What drove the devs to keep this ability in the game if it was ‘not good’?</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear your criticisms of the abilities in question, because in my personal experience with the game (sitting at about 130 hours now) Noble easily became one of my favorite classes to pilot. The changes made to the class have made him far less able to make a clear impact in the early stages of the game. What makes his old abilities bad in your view?</p>

</aside>
<p>I got the idea that the Noble was changed to fit the theme of a noble as opposed to bad game mechanics, which I never got the impression of from playing Noble. What makes you think differently?</p>

            <p>For the uninformed I will paste the Noble changes below:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Ellie" data-post="1" data-topic="9677">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/user_avatar/forum.throneoflies.com/ellie/40/8749_2.png" class="avatar"><a href="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/1-0-8-patch-notes/9677/1">1.0.8 Patch Notes</a>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble &amp; Aristocrat:</p>
<p>Removed Spy Maid.<br>
Removed Private Matter.<br>
Added new day ability Political Pressure - Force a player to accuse another player of treason and block further voting from them. 2 uses.<br>
Added new day ability Noble Twin - Your vote for execution or pardon will count twice. 2 uses.<br>
Added new night ability Royal Decree - Make a player immune to treason accusations the next day. Infinite uses.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pre-change Noble was an incredibly high skill ceiling class that could really shape the direction of the game and, with a bit of luck and skill, build a reliable Blue Dragon network, particularly with the introduction of Private Matter a few patches back.</p>
<p>I’m not totally against the changes presented but I would like the niche filled by the old Noble to be introduced back into the game in some way. Given Priest’s departure from the game, a new class would fit rather nicely to the roster.</p>
<p><strong>Informant</strong> (<em>Blue Dragon</em> - Social)/<strong>Turncoat</strong> (<em>Unseen</em> - Social)</p>
<p>Day Abilities:<br>
Spy Maid (same as before)</p>
<p>Night Abilities:<br>
Blackmail - Prevent a player from voting tomorrow. (Basically Order, but more thematically named to suit a non royal class)<br>
Leave note - Send an anonymous message to another player. They will see it in the morning. (essentially a single target version of a crier)</p>
<p>This class not only brings the OG Noble niche back into the game, but also helps limit the overabundance of Invokers in Cult games by adding another potential social conversion to the mix. Apostle is already an exceedingly rare appearance, which does little to help cult given how strong it is.</p>
