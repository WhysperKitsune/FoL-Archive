    <title>Vampire faction Idea</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/vampire-faction-idea/65895</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure there are plenty of vampire suggestion. or New Faction suggestion, but when we think about a new faction, what we need a faction that fonction in a different way then the existing factions
So I came with Idea, this faction Ressemble the unseen, more then cult in the fact that it got a classes that can convert and classes that kill. hoverer it has unique traits
1 - All Vampires converts can kill at nights, which limit them in their ability to prove themselves. Hoverer, only 1 Vampire can kill at night, If the Vampire Mystic kill, the Vampire Servant cannot kill during this night
2 - Multiple vampires conversion will change their class type, making princess a much better tools in finding evils. 
3 - this faction has mutliple members who possess the ability to frame others as vampires.
This allow the prince to be converted, as the if the Vampire prince kill, no other vampire can kill this night
Another particularity is all classes have a powerfull abilities can be used by consuming blood units, hoverer, blood units are very limited and are obtained by using killer abilities, except for the Court Wizard convert.

each game should at least have 1 healer, 1 vampire hunter, the Prince, the Vampire Master, 1 random vampire convert except (Vampire prince) and the King, also there cannot be a vampire Stalker and a Hunter at the same time or a Vampire Mystic and a Mystic at the same time. but the game can start with a Vampire stalker or a vampire mystic

So here are my classes, Feel free to give some feed back or some idea. for no, I would say the maximum for vampires should be 3 or 4. if we keep the limited kill in place, the maximum should be 4, but if the kill were n ot limited, like the unseen, it should be 3, including the vampire masters.

How the classes work
Vampire Hunter 
Unlike paladin and Sheriff, this class as no tool to fight conversion, they can only prevent their own conversion into a vampire, they are immune to occupation, but not to redirection. 
Holy cross will protect you from conversion, but not if the vampire choose to bipass your immunity. 
Holy Water will prevent you from seeing a framed player as a vampire or attacking a framed player, but it will not allow you to find the Vampire master, Vampire Mystic or a Vampire 
Enforcer. 
Using Stake on a blue dragon framed as vampire will result in the death of the blue dragon. 

Vampire Master
The mastermind of the vampires, with the ability to pass as a phys for some times,
the player should gain 1 blood unit when they use refreshing bite and 1 each time they are able to convert someone. 

Vampire Servant
The Vampire Servant frame will stay on the player for the entire game. So if a mystic is framed and converted, She&#39;Ll be seen as vampires despite her having the ability to appears as non-suspicious

vampire wizard
This is a powerfull class. trueits Magic Explosion will kill everyone who visit a single during the day, its like a circle of death, hoverer, it is very expensive in term of blood units.

Vampire drunk
If you use blood drink, you will not able to redirect&#39;s a player&#39;s target with Debauchery, 

vampire Stalker
Mind read allow you to learn a player&#39;s exact, while Stalk only allow you to learn their class type. 

Vampire Guard
this is exactly like enforcer. 

Vampire mystic
Blood confusion will make a vampire appears as non-suspicious and a blue dragon appear as vampires, but will be stopped by holy water, as it an ability that frame
the Mystic abilities do not target people, so they can&#39;t be redirected. 
The vampire Mystic cannot use private matters. 

Vampire noble
Hole Water will stop Blood Intrigue from framing a players. 
the vampire noble can use all abilities of a noble except noble twin&lt;

Vampire watcher
A converted observer will not be seen by an other observer to visit the target he attack. 

Vampire Doctor
Surgery cannot be healed, but it can be stopped by a Mercenary&#39;s shield, King&#39;s Guard or a Knight&#39;s defend.

Vampire prince
the prince actually lose royal blood, but this is not needed since he never step up,

Vampire Lady
Holy water will have no effect on Blood Shield, for it is a frame. 

vampire enforcer
This class work like a Scorned,</description>

            <p>Alright,<br>
I made some modification to Vampire hunter, Vampire Stalker, Vampire master and vampire Enforcer…</p>
<p>but I still think I am a long to say before completing any faction of any kind<br>
but just saying, I reworked the idea. and I’ll develop it</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, I’Ll try to think on answer later, I got all roles saved on a note pad document</p>
<p>ON Vampires Hunter, its truth that it ressemble the Inquisitor with additional powers,<br>
Might be a good idea to remove Stake, as investigative don’t kill and its can be tricked, for exemple, a stake will never kill the Vampire Master, converted mystic or converted vampire hunter (except if framed by a scorned)<br>
Immunity to occupy is mean to compensate the fact that it cannot fight agaisnt conversion, unlike the Sheriff or the Paladin, no scout, no smite.</p>
<p>Vampire Master, I may change Blood Injection, but only the Inq and the possessor are threatened by this abilities, Reaper will survive and you have no business killing the Sorc<br>
Phys claim are already suspicious</p>
<p>Yeah Vampire Enforcer, right now just screw poss,</p>
<p>Yeah Vampire Wizard has a strong ability to kill all visitors, does not gain death immunity from this and it need at least 3 nights to prepare it. As to gain extra blood, your target are minimal.</p>
<p>Vampire Stalker is the hunter, I though such a power was needed to the hunter to keep his claim alive. can’t wolf anymore,</p>
<p>Vampire Guard was intented to be similar to enforcer. it protected its vampire friends</p>
<p>Well Vampire mystic was intented since She need Link mind to confirm herself, because she cannot use private whispers anymore. so Link minds is needed.</p>

            <p><strong>I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TOO SERIOUS HERE AND REMEMBER THAT THIS IS MY OPINION AKA I MIGHT BE WRONG ON SOME OF THESE</strong></p>
<p>also wall of text and what’s the cap on members?</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood Points idea pretty good but the abilities are kinda op seeing how easy it is to get blood points imo</li>

</aside>
<p><s>As soon as I saw the ability Stake I knew that this was copying Vampire/Vampire Hunter from Town of Salem. (Also the fact that any vampire can kill but only one can per night)</s></p>
<p>If you are going to keep stake, make it one use, not three. (I’d remove it though) Investigatives don’t kill.</p>
<p>Just remove Holy Water entirely. It’s unbalanced in the fact that you can just use it to survive a vampire attack in the endgame and then stake that night. Besides, you don’t need to survive to win.</p>
<p>Immune to occupation? I mean, it’s fine, I guess?</p>
<p>Reduce Holy Cross to 1 or 2 uses, 3 is too much since you can just use them all on convert nights and never get converted.</p>
<p>I would review the other converts but that’d take too long and it’d make the post too big so I’ll just review the Vampire Master.</p>

</aside>
<p>-Passives are fine<br>
-Blood Injection is way too overpowered since you can use it to kill NK.<br>
-Flu + Night Abilities are fine, but Phys claims would obviously become more suspiscious.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to say that the conversions are way too overpowered and that Prince shouldn’t be convertable.</strong></p>
<p>-Prince convert itself is just way too overpowered for the Vampires<br>
-Vampire Enforcer’s Dark Stake and Dark Void are also overpowered, since they can survive and kill the Neutral Killer.<br>
-Vampire Servant is Fine<br>
-Vampire Wizard kinda taken from CW Rework thing, kinda op?<br>
-Vampire Drunk should not combine Drunk and Princess into one class. Other than that, it’s fine.<br>
-Vampire Stalker shouldn’t be able to bypass death immunity, Mind Read is eh, Stalk is Duchess and Observer combined<br>
-Vampire Guard is kinda op since Protection gives death immunity<br>
-Vampire Mystic is MM and Mystic and Illusionist Combined, minus the death immunity and conversion ability (op)<br>
-Vampire Noble is fine<br>
-Vampire Doctor and Watcher are fine<br>
-Vampire Lady is fine</p>
<p>[endreviewthing]</p>
<p>I took this way too seriously.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but its not that simple to convert the prince, you need to pay Blood Units and considering length of the game, no way the Vampire master will be use his strong bite more then 2, Also if you happen to miss your chance because of Merc / Drunk hh, Bye bye your blood units, because of this, the prince can only be converted night 4.</p>
<p>The vampire hunter can be converted, Yes they have the advantage of Death immunity, but there are some vampires class they cannot kill / detect, and if they get mind warped, framed, they may endup killing innocent Blue dragons. Some Bd might want to execute any Vampire Hunter claims</p>
<p>And actually here the vampires Could want to use some claims to their advantages,<br>
the vampire prince is the best exemple, he will want to execute any royal claims so strenghen himself, after a normal execution he can frame 1 person, but if its royal, he’ll be able to use twice.</p>
<p>Also, if you guys check, you will see that the vampires killer abilities are limited with no way to remplish them. at least they can all kill.</p>

            <p>I think I like it just because atm there’s a huge “Prince claim D2” meta.<br>
Getting it since Prince under certain circumstances can be converted…<br>
It’s a good thing as it’d discourage mass claims</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m pretty sure there are plenty of vampire suggestion. or New Faction suggestion, but when we think about a new faction, what we need a faction that fonction in a different way then the existing factions<br>
So I came with Idea, this faction Ressemble the unseen, more then cult in the fact that it got a classes that can convert and classes that kill. hoverer it has unique traits<br>
1 - All Vampires converts can kill at nights, which limit them in their ability to prove themselves. Hoverer, only 1 Vampire can kill at night, If the Vampire Mystic kill, the Vampire Servant cannot kill during this night<br>
2 - Multiple vampires conversion will change their class type, making princess a much better tools in finding evils.<br>
3 - this faction has mutliple members who possess the ability to frame others as vampires.<br>
This allow the prince to be converted, as the if the Vampire prince kill, no other vampire can kill this night<br>
Another particularity is all classes have a powerfull abilities can be used by consuming blood units, hoverer, blood units are very limited and are obtained by using killer abilities, except for the Court Wizard convert.</p>
<p>each game should at least have 1 healer, 1 vampire hunter, the Prince, the Vampire Master, 1 random vampire convert except (Vampire prince) and the King, also there cannot be a vampire Stalker and a Hunter at the same time or a Vampire Mystic and a Mystic at the same time. but the game can start with a Vampire stalker or a vampire mystic</p>
<p>So here are my classes, Feel free to give some feed back or some idea. for no, I would say the maximum for vampires should be 3 or 4. if we keep the limited kill in place, the maximum should be 4, but if the kill were n ot limited, like the unseen, it should be 3, including the vampire masters.</p>

<p>How the classes work<br>
Vampire Hunter<br>
Unlike paladin and Sheriff, this class as no tool to fight conversion, they can only prevent their own conversion into a vampire, they are immune to occupation, but not to redirection.<br>
Holy cross will protect you from conversion, but not if the vampire choose to bipass your immunity.<br>
Holy Water will prevent you from seeing a framed player as a vampire or attacking a framed player, but it will not allow you to find the Vampire master, Vampire Mystic or a Vampire<br>
Enforcer.<br>
Using Stake on a blue dragon framed as vampire will result in the death of the blue dragon.</p>
<p>Vampire Master<br>
The mastermind of the vampires, with the ability to pass as a phys for some times,<br>
the player should gain 1 blood unit when they use refreshing bite and 1 each time they are able to convert someone.</p>
<p>Vampire Servant<br>
The Vampire Servant frame will stay on the player for the entire game. So if a mystic is framed and converted, She’Ll be seen as vampires despite her having the ability to appears as non-suspicious</p>
<p>vampire wizard<br>
This is a powerfull class. trueits Magic Explosion will kill everyone who visit a single during the day, its like a circle of death, hoverer, it is very expensive in term of blood units.</p>
<p>Vampire drunk<br>
If you use blood drink, you will not able to redirect’s a player’s target with Debauchery,</p>
<p>vampire Stalker<br>
Mind read allow you to learn a player’s exact, while Stalk only allow you to learn their class type.</p>
<p>Vampire Guard<br>
this is exactly like enforcer.</p>
<p>Vampire mystic<br>
Blood confusion will make a vampire appears as non-suspicious and a blue dragon appear as vampires, but will be stopped by holy water, as it an ability that frame<br>
the Mystic abilities do not target people, so they can’t be redirected.<br>
The vampire Mystic cannot use private matters.</p>
<p>Vampire noble<br>
Hole Water will stop Blood Intrigue from framing a players.<br>
the vampire noble can use all abilities of a noble except noble twin&lt;</p>
<p>Vampire watcher<br>
A converted observer will not be seen by an other observer to visit the target he attack.</p>
<p>Vampire Doctor<br>
Surgery cannot be healed, but it can be stopped by a Mercenary’s shield, King’s Guard or a Knight’s defend.</p>
<p>Vampire prince<br>
the prince actually lose royal blood, but this is not needed since he never step up,</p>
<p>Vampire Lady<br>
Holy water will have no effect on Blood Shield, for it is a frame.</p>
<p>vampire enforcer<br>
This class work like a Scorned,</p>
