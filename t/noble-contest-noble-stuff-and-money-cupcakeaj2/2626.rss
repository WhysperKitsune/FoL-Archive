            <p>Why tf does a BD have a 3 use vote controller</p>
<p>In fact why does anything have a 3 use vote controller and a role that can restore uses of that.</p>
<p>And plus the Briber is semi-useless because they need to convert both a noble AND an Aristocrat to be useful<br>
Do you have any idea how broken that is?</p>
