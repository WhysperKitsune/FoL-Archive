    <title>[Class Suggestion] - The Baron - Neutral Offensive with Royal Blood</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-baron-neutral-offensive-with-royal-blood/70894</link>
    <description>**Goal:** Ascend to the throne
Unique - Occupy Immune - Conversion Immune
______________
**Passive:** Tainted Royal Blood: _Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. You will keep your class if successfully elected and your abilities will be locked; you will also gain immunity to Nightshade/Bleeding and Death._
**Passive:** Unwavering Ambition: _Immune to occupation and redirection._

**Day Ability 1:** Bewilder - (2 Uses): _Prevent the King from using their day abilities._
**Day Ability 2:** Hire Guards - (4 Uses): _You will be guarded tonight, making players unable to visit you._

**Night Ability 1:** Informants (Infinite Uses): _Check two players at once for Royal Blood._
**Night Ability 2:** Forged Writ (3 Uses): _Remove Royal Blood from a player. They will not be informed._
________________________

The Baron is a Unique &quot;Offensive&quot; Neutral class. They must see themselves ascend to the throne in order to win.

The ability to remove Royal Blood from players allows the Baron to put pressure otherwise safe Blue Dragon (or converted Royal) claims, as well as provide a reasonable defence for fake Royal claims made by others. The Baron can also cause doubts about the King&#39;s allegiance by having access to Bewilder even in games where Cult may not be present.

Power is the Baron&#39;s only ambition, so he will not assume Kingly duties should he ascend to the throne.
_____________________________
**Additional notes:** 

- Barons have the opportunity to leave if they achieve their win condition similar to Fool/Scorned/Inquisitor. Dying after becoming King will not affect his win as he does not become Neutral King.

- When elected, players will see him as (King) and not (Baron) like any other elected King. This gives converted evils the opportunity to feign Baron (like some do with Scorned/Inq/etc).

            <p>The difficulty comes in because you have a win condition that is a detriment to both the Unseen/Cult and BD. BD need a King for important swing votes and Evils would prefer to put a convert on the throne to get majority faster.</p>
<p>Even if you offer to be a vote for whichever faction is in control, you’d just be a King with no abilities and you’d stop any Kings being elected later on.</p>

            <p>You have no way to fake any abilities, if people are voting someone for king who has obvious fake logs, then they deserve the win. Baron can’t reliably fake any class.</p>

<p>I think Baron should suicide upon getting the throne and no more king can be elected for the rest of the game. Having a kingmaking king is not fun for anyone else and this class is literally designed to become king.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This aspect of the class took the most consideration when putting this together. It’s why I specified that his abilities are locked out when he ascends to the throne (note the the goal is to ascend to the throne and not to ‘become king’). No class that has already won should be getting access to Finger/etc.</p>
<p>Having it suicide wouldn’t really represent the flavor of the class (in the sense that his goal is to attain power). Having the Baron prevent future King elections after being elected himself is a solid idea though.</p>

<p>The overall design apart from that is awesome though and is very healthy for the game with removing confirmability for royals.</p>
