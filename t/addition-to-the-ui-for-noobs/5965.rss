Id love to see a tool that would let you import your class ability log into a diary (Mostly for those too lazy to keep a diary, or the new people who dont know how). Something new people or lazy people can click to just import what info they got off whatever they did the last night. Dunno how useful it would be, but the biggest complaint I see around is &quot;Why dont you use a diary damnit?!&quot;.</description>

            <p>in defence of this I use a power point that I downloaded from this site called 'things that you might want to copy ’ and it is very basic but could work as a framework .</p>
<p>I could get behind a journal that for instance filled in<br>
to look like this</p>
<p>class : classname</p>
<p>day 1 :<br>
night 1 :<br>
day 2 :<br>
night 2 :<br>
etc .</p>
<p>this would give a framework but not a complete entering of info .</p>
<p>Each class could have an appropriate empty framework and also the ability for people to choose to open a base journal for class x</p>

            <p>No reason to get so aggressive.</p>
<p>I understand your idea, but it won’t work. You can’t have a social deduction game that hand guides you with auto journal, auto death note auto everything.</p>

            <p>Really? Because the form I just laid out didnt have any information on WHO the obs visited or WHO visited HIM. All it told was that he watched them, and they visited and were visited once. That gives a basic amount of information while still making written logs a must, and still making the quick log useful to people who DONT write diaries.</p>
<p>Why is this such a big deal? You and I BOTH know some people are too lazy to write diaries. You and I also both probably get very upset over people who wont write one. This is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Or you can maybe try to improve my idea instead of just saying it wont work? Or come up with your own?</p>
<p>And hell if its just the matter of the quick log becoming standard, Why not allow for unseen classes to have access to a format quick log to make whatever will they want then?</p>

            <p>that format you have just highlighted would be expected in every single lot report .<br>
only fakers would write out long hand  ànd everyone would be suspicious of anything that didn’t look like the auto format</p>

            <p>If you have a quick log button it’d be so much easier to determine if you’re scum or not.<br>
Cause now there’s no reason to keep own logs except for if you’re scum</p>

            <p>For example, If I was Observer and I watched <span class="hashtag">#7</span> last night - Who then visited <span class="hashtag">#9</span>. And he was also visited by <span class="hashtag">#11</span></p>
<p>The quick log could say</p>
<p>I watched <span class="hashtag">#7</span> (Generic Name) last night. <span class="hashtag">#7</span> visited 1 person and was visited by 1 person.</p>
<p>The written log by the player could say</p>
<p>n1 - <span class="hashtag">#7</span> - Visited <span class="hashtag">#9</span>, Was visited by <span class="hashtag">#11</span></p>
<p>Which one has more info? The written log. But the other log is still useful for council if someone doesnt write a diary</p>

            <p>Im not saying that this should be a REQUIREMENT for people, just a quick post option for lazy people. Make it have less info than normal, but a basic log of what happens last night. That way the ones who write a REAL diary have an advantage, yet theres still info for the ones who dont write it.</p>
<p>It would also make it easier to fake a log for the MM and unseen if they can pretend to use a basic “quick” log.</p>

            <p>I think an auto diary would be pretty awful really . trying to create a fake journal would be so difficult if every spelling mistake or typo would glare of the screen as not part of a copy paste.</p>
<p>post full log or die …</p>
