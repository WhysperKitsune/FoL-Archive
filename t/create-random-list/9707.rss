    <title>Create Random List</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/create-random-list/9707</link>
    <description>When it comes to the armors and weapons I want to randomize for variety. However, I don&#39;t want to see or wear all the items in my collections. I also feel deterred from getting everything because of this. Would it be possible to implement a feature that allows me to select a list of weapons and armor I want to randomize?</description>
