    <description>1.**The king&#39;s royal finger should be a passive, not an ability.** When I had originally bought the game, I thought king was an important part to the game, who would have lots of power. In actuality, he doesn&#39;t. I can understand deciding fate once, but currently the king will have to decide between getting someone on trial easier or deciding their fate. The royal finger passive would just make the king&#39;s accusation count twice ALWAYS.

2.**Make servant immune to being occupied** don&#39;t know why this was changed....

3.**Change pants on fire** Instead, you target a player; if another player attempts to use a day ability on them that day, they will instead target themselves.

4.**A conversion for the alchemist** currently, you just need to claim alchemist and blur someone for sweet sailing, supposing there is no kill-happy knight. The converted form would not have any uses of blur, but the alchemist would only have 1. I am pretty bad at making classes so someone else make it, I suggest calling it the &quot;apothecary.&quot; Note: If a conversion into unseen/cult for alchemist is made, it should be made so the sheriff can convert them into a knight as well.</description>

            <p>I was recommending a buff.</p>
<p>This buff means you target a player, and if any one uses day abilities on them, the player that used the day ability on them instead uses it on themselves.</p>

            <p>I think he mains that it reduces the number of situations where Pants on Fire would be applicable, making it only practical or useful in very specific situations.</p>
<p>Pants On Fire does not need a nerf.</p>

<p>Pants on Fire being specific is very weak. Currently, it is strong, as you can defend one person from an ability. If you happen to know who Prince is, you can protect them from anybody using an ability.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Alright, you want me to go into detail about this. Fine.</p>
<p>If Pants on Fire relied on you picking two people. Person A protected from Person B’s ability, then you’re essentially nerfing the Court Wizard. You’re basically forced to guess which person the assassin is in Target B.</p>
<p>Pants on Fire being used on 1 target from 1 ability from anybody that uses on, is fine as it is. It means you’re not guessing who the Assassin is on the 2nd target.</p>

            <p>Honestly I really do not like Alchemist, I think it is a pretty boring role which is not that fun to play as or with due to it’s easy confirmability and likelihood to be killed. I want to see Alchemist replaced with Plex’s Virtuoso, they have the same aim but the Virtuoso has far better lore and is just a more interesting role to play.</p>

<p>I read your thing. you kept saying that making the ability less specific was bad, but you never explain what “being less specific” means as it makes no sense in the context.</p>
