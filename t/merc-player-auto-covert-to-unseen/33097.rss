    <description>#### What happened?

Merc in the day and becomes assassin automatically without being converted, after the last unseen player was voted dead

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I am supposed to remain as Merc and commit suicide that night 

#### Steps to reproduce:


-I am the only merc player. 

-First target voted up, but pardoned

-I used my revenge ability when my first target was hanged 

-offer my contract to 2nd target, an alchemist

-2nd target got killed by prince in the night 

-In the daytime, the last unseen player (MM) was voted up and exed. 

-my identity becomes assassin, without being converted (or at least not shown on my end)
