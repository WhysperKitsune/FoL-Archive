    <title>Sorc/Inq would be better as Unseen/Cult and BD</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorc-inq-would-be-better-as-unseen-cult-and-bd/22207</link>
    <description>If Sorcerer started as a replacement for the Cult/Unseen&#39;s 2nd player, and Inq started as BD that could help to balance the classes out better. Sorc would be easier to find, but Inq could potentially get converted (so he can&#39;t just openly claim).

Another suggestion would be to simply buff sorc but having Inq be a convertible BD with her still being Neut. 

Lastly, another potential Sorc buff would be to allow her to see or possibly chat with the unseen/cult so she doesn&#39;t kill them and they don&#39;t vote her up.</description>

            <p>True. I was just thinking something that is instant d1 type thing. I mean sorc is basically unseen anyways…he just has to be living for the win condition.</p>

            <p>The unseen has more ability’s anyway. If the unseen knows who the sorc is then they can use signaling techniques to respond back. Especially through votes and if the sorc thinks to tell them a key to use.</p>

            <p>Im sure they are avoiding absorbing them into the factions as hard as they can. They just need to allow the sorc to see evil players but not allow evil to see sorc.</p>
