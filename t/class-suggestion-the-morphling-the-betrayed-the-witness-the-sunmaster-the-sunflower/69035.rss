*Help The SunMaster to fulfill his win condition.*

Notes : 1) The Betrayed is an ally of the Neutral Killer , The Cult or The Unseen. His Passive &quot;Enemy of The Enemy&quot; makes it easier for killer classes to identify who he is. His Day Ability makes him be able to identify his allies. His night ability &quot;Confusion&quot; bypasses occupy immunity and it gets you their target&#39;s ability&#39;s feedback. (Example : &quot;A MM converts X&quot; If you confuse the MM , they will not convert X BUT you will see their feedback , successfully identifying an ally but wasting a conversion night.)
2) The Morphling is basically a &quot;Wild Card&quot;. If he isn&#39;t jailed and Prince dies , his identity remains unknown BUT once he remembers someone&#39;s class , a crier will send the following message to The Court next day : &quot;A Morphling remembered they were like X.&quot; Evils can take that opportunity and say they were the Morphling.
3) The Witness is basically a combination of An Observer &amp; A Princess. The only drawback is that this class is not confirmable and thus making the win condition fairly hard to achieve because you need to successfully see a killer attack someone. If that killer is executed , you win.
4) And Last of all , The Sunmaster &amp; His Sunflowers are basically a much weaker &quot;faction on their own&quot;. The Sunmaster is a hybrid between a converter and a killer. His Sunflowers are his &quot;conversions&quot; that will help The Sunmaster to achieve their goal. This means 2 factions will be present in the game. Despite acting like a converter , when The SunMaster dies , no new SunMaster will be made. All Sunflowers will commit suicide BUT will appear as their old role. There isn&#39;t any Starting Sunflower. Also the conversion has a limit of 2 sunflowers so be mindful who to convert.
5) The End. I want to point out that this Topic focuses more on The Betrayed than any other class since most of the effort was put into the making of The Betrayed class.</description>

<p>Remove the announcement and conversion immunity. This basically dis-encourages remembering scum, auto-confirms the user for the rest of the game, and gives too much advantage to BD in general.</p>

<p>Sounds kind of self-defeating for a class that wants to see BD lose. You’re more likely to just preventing an Assassin/CL/NK’s kill than anything.</p>

            <p>You are not immune at night.

<p>Notes : 1) The Betrayed is an ally of the Neutral Killer , The Cult or The Unseen. His Passive “Enemy of The Enemy” makes it easier for killer classes to identify who he is. His Day Ability makes him be able to identify his allies. His night ability “Confusion” bypasses occupy immunity and it gets you their target’s ability’s feedback. (Example : “A MM converts X” If you confuse the MM , they will not convert X BUT you will see their feedback , successfully identifying an ally but wasting a conversion night.)<br>
2) The Morphling is basically a “Wild Card”. If he isn’t jailed and Prince dies , his identity remains unknown BUT once he remembers someone’s class , a crier will send the following message to The Court next day : “A Morphling remembered they were like X.” Evils can take that opportunity and say they were the Morphling.<br>
3) The Witness is basically a combination of An Observer &amp; A Princess. The only drawback is that this class is not confirmable and thus making the win condition fairly hard to achieve because you need to successfully see a killer attack someone. If that killer is executed , you win.<br>
4) And Last of all , The Sunmaster &amp; His Sunflowers are basically a much weaker “faction on their own”. The Sunmaster is a hybrid between a converter and a killer. His Sunflowers are his “conversions” that will help The Sunmaster to achieve their goal. This means 2 factions will be present in the game. Despite acting like a converter , when The SunMaster dies , no new SunMaster will be made. All Sunflowers will commit suicide BUT will appear as their old role. There isn’t any Starting Sunflower. Also the conversion has a limit of 2 sunflowers so be mindful who to convert.<br>
5) The End. I want to point out that this Topic focuses more on The Betrayed than any other class since most of the effort was put into the making of The Betrayed class.</p>
