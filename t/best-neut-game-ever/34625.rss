    <title>Best Neut game ever</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/best-neut-game-ever/34625</link>
    <description>This was my best game as Neutral King and probably the best game of ToL I&#39;ve ever had. There was a point in the game where the reaper was on trial and I force pardoned him, the alchemist had a merc and that&#39;s when we realized that the neutrals had numbers. Alch proceeded to bomb the remaining BD/Cult while reaper got the other ones and the merc guarded the alchemist, neither BD or cult had enough numbers to execute us. It felt as if neutrals were part of a single true faction, it was amazing.
