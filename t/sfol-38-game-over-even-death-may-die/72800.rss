    <title>SFoL 38 - Game Over - Even death may die</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-38-game-over-even-death-may-die/72800</link>
    <description>## [color=cerulean]Welcome to SFoL 38 - Abyss[/color]
*Hosted by Marluxion!*

## [color=cerulean]Abyss?[/color]
The main addition to this Special Forum of Lies is a new scum faction. The Abyss.

   These twisted mind flayers have risen from the shadowy depths and seek to claim Adiart for their own vile purposes. Our scouts have displayed an abnormal fear upon witnessing such creatures... 

Bending the minds of mortal men and slaying our kind without remorse... Some even whisper that they are trying to awaken some kind of Dark God that sleeps beneath the tides... 

Their leader was dubbed &#39;The Dreamer&#39; by one particularly... eccentric... scout. We have reports that he can steal the faces of the men he tortures... So... for all we know, any one of us could be one of these twisted creatures.

* Royal Blood isn&#39;t on any of the Abyss class cards. Why? Because Royal Blood will now pass on directly if you had it before you were converted! 

* Members of the Abyss CAN inflict other Abyssians with fear. 

* The Faction cap for the Abyss is 3

* You aren&#39;t notified if you are afraid. Only certain special investigative abilities can find that out.

<p>…are you really all suggesting to pardon and listen to Luxy because of a neutral survivor? Even despite that he’s essentially slipped that he healed n2 and admitted to wanting to create chaos? And that Luxy’s been on Icibalus’, another conf!town’s radar for a while? This is why GKs have DFE, guys. Seriously.</p>
<p>Either way, we still have a convert and the NK to deal with. Squid, Ici, Baz, and me are clear and the only ones remaining are Luxy, Insanity, Frost, and potentially Poke. I’ll DFE Luxy and Squid will jail and execute Insanity. Tomorrow Frost should be lynched and if he somehow flips Knight we’ll move onto Poke. That’ll be game and it’s impossible for us to lose after that.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/maximusprime">@MaximusPrime</a> Mind healing me tonight? I’ve been the only reason why Baz has yet to quicklynch you and if the NK ends up winning because town, or more specifically Sam, decides to POE from the top of their townlist due to a chainsaw instead of going through the bottom then I’ll be so damn pissed. Sam’s already flipping tonight so if he ends up being a VI Butler instead of a convert there’s no need to bring another BD down with him.</p>
