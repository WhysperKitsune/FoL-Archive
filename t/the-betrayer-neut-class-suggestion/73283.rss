&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Impression)** - Choose 1 person and a message, then choose another person. The message will be disguised as a whisper from the 1st person, that person will not be notified. The court will be showed the usual whisper notification. _Infinite Uses, one a day_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Showing Myself)** - For 2 days including the day this was used, all neutrals may only speak during the day to you, you will not be shown their number.
