    <description>in my personal opinion, Cult classes should work like a combination of all the classes that can be converted from them.

## Apostle
After new Apostle just became a reskin of the Noble/Aristocrat. I think that Apostle needs to have some features from the other class that it can be converted from, the Psychic.
Dark Words would be the ideal change here, as the ability was never overpowered and it was fun.

## Invoker
Invoker is cool, despite not having anything in common with the Knight. (I guess Strings of Mithras is the closest we get to it if you use it on a cold steeling Knight.)

## Seeker
Seeker is extremely weak in the game right now
even though it is probably the most common it gets with the classes it is converted from.
Expose = Paladin. Paladin is Cult&#39;s counterpart to Sheriff and Marshal has this exact ability.
Gaze = Princess Flirt
Identify =   Observer Peek or Paladin Test
I think seeker&#39;s Identify ability should return the class of the player that it is checking, determining a player&#39;s faction really is not very useful when you know all your faction members and you are not actively out to kill them.
at the best you can just get closer to finding out who the NK is with this ability
Considering Nightwatch has this specific ability, I think it should be a thing.

## Ritualist
Ritualist seems too much like the Court Wizard. There is nothing that is really from the Mercenary or Physician, (I guess Brotherhood is sort of like the Sellsword&#39;s guard ability except it just makes them appear as BD, not blocking visits).
Blocking visits might be a better change to Brotherhood considering how underpowered Brotherhood is in the game at this point in time.
[quote=&quot;Shrimpy, post:1, topic:50807&quot;]
Cult needs an ability like Herbalist’s Defile.  I would like to give Ritualist a day ability to choose the class they will appear as if Sacrificed by the Cult Leader.  This will make the class and their passive so much funner to play, and encourage the dead Ritualist to stick around to see the confusion their ability causes.  The current Will of Mithras passive by itself is almost never useful.

An alternative idea is to give them a day ability that defiles themselves if they are executed that day on trial.  This would be an interesting and unique addition to the game.

This is what I&#39;m talking about with the Ritualist being more in common with the Physician.
As said above. Unseen converted classes are the original class so if you grab something from their Unseen counterpart. It would still work well.

The passive could also be considered a Physician thing though only if you really really try think of it that way. It&#39;s more of a Mercenary thing to me as Merc can rebound allowing for extra kills. Healing saves a life allowing it to give more abilities from the life, while Will of Mithras gives more from the life.</description>

            <p>Dark Words won’t help Apostle mimic Psychic. What it really needs is Telepathy.</p>
<p>I hope they add some kind of Acolyte for Hunter/Knight.</p>
<p>You could turn Gaze and Identify into one rolecop power.</p>
<p>Ritualist change is small, but good.</p>

            <p>the rit already has 2 night abils.</p>
<p>so maybe it could be a fake bleed day ability to confirm that he can heal bleeds.</p>
<p>Bleed immunity would be a bad nerf for hunter</p>

            <p>Maybe if ritualistic has like a drug ability from the herbalist and or a passive that makes them immune to bleeding so when the hunter Wolf’s them they can prove that they are phys or immune to bleeding or maybe both, but personally maybe the drug ability would be the best to confirm physicians.</p>
