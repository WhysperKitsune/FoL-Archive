    <title>Vortex amulet and vulkan</title>

    <description>Okay, I feel like I have to create a topic about this. 
Before patch 2.0.0 there was one execution that caused vulkan game to crash - vortex amulet. It was claimed that bug was fixed in 2.0.0, but the result is the opposite - not only wasnt it fixed, but also there is now ANOTHER execution with the same bug - voidstone of corax. Whenever these animations happen, vulkan game crashes ans you have to relog, which is very annoying. I do realise vulkan is unstable, but this is not entirely our fault - after one of the last windows patch we currently have 6 fps in directX version, which is unplayable. Please, fix vortex amulet and voidstone of corax. We, vulkan users, want to play too!</description>
