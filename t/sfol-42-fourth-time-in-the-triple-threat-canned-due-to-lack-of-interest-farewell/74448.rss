    <description>*Adiart, ruled by an illegitimate King, has fallen upon hard times again! Can it survive?*

## Rules

7. Players are not allowed to use big letters. These are reserved for the host.
8. Please add links in the main post to every notable event (FoL Events)
9. You are allowed to leave the game but doing it will net you a temporary blacklist meaning you can’t join a forum of lies for a while. Further leaving may net with a permanent blacklist
10. Lets all have fun and play together!
11. Do not like posts in a thread if you are dead in that game.

## Gameplay

* Days last 48 hours, or until a majority is reached for execution. Nights last 24 hours.
* All actions must be sent to the mod.
* Unseen and Cult will talk through a special PM chain
* The priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server.
* All classes will be used and will be used as they are found in the Class Cards Thread. (Exceptions specified)

## Executions

* To accuse someone say “/accuse [player]” or “/vote [player]”
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed, pending the King&#39;s decision to not use a Decide Fate Pardon.

## Picking a New King

* If there are less than 4 players a new king will not be selected.
* After a king’s execution the day does not end, an election shall be held right after.
* When the king dies 24 hours is given for any player to step up and take the throne in their Class Card.
* If only 1 person steps up when the day ends that person becomes the king
* If 2 or more people step forward everyone votes on who should be the next king in their Class Card. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the day becomes the king. If the votes are tied whoever stepped up 1st becomes the king

The following Rule changes are in effect

* The King Odds will be set to 60% BD, 20% Evil, 20% Devout
* BD Kings will have the following passive: -
“Death of a dynasty: If executed by the court, there will be no more kings this game. Also, there will be no vote the following day”
* Starting Evil King gains the following ability - &quot; **Allies (Night)** - Check and see if target player is a member of the Unseen (4 uses)
* There are no trials in this game! The Lynch is hammered immediately upon a majority being reached
* Decide Fate is changed to the following: &quot;Immediately execute and the end the day of a target player, providing they have more than 50% of the votes required for majority excluding your vote. Alternatively, pardon and overturn a vote that reached majority (1 use)
* Sheriff’s scouts can detect if their target is converted by both Unseen or Cult
* Paladin’s Blessing of Light prevents conversions from Unseen or Cult
* Cult gains an additional ability.
“Eradicate: Kill target player (2 uses) Any cult member may use this ability instead of their normal action, unless being sacrificed”
* The first use of ‘Blood of Mithras’ will kill the cultist it targets
* There is a max spawn cap of 3 of any one type of BD class
* Hidden Blade and Rupture are reduced to 3 uses each
* If both factions try to convert the same player, the team with the least members succeed. In the event that it is equal, Unseen do the conversion if both teams have the same amount of members.
* There will be limited Feedback. Only Classes performing a killing action, Special and Investigative will know they were occupied or redirected. Also, any action that bypasses an immunity of a class will result in feedback to that affect.
* Each class will gain the Passive ‘Determined’ if occupied/jailed/redirected 3 times in total. Classes with this passive will gain occupy and redirect immunity.
* Classes with ‘Determined’ that are jailed will gain the passive ‘Escapology’. The Prince is informed if their prisoned gains this passive. Players with Escapology passive can not be jailed again.
* Any Neutral can spawn in the ‘any’ slot (except Fool) - Including Neutral Killing
* Neutral Benign can roll as either Alchemist or Mercenary
* Neutral Chaos can roll as either Pretender or Inquisitor
* Neutral Evil can roll as either Sellsword, Devil or Scorned.
* I will be looking to enforce the rules strictly. Penalty for rule violations include, but are not limited to:- Warnings (Unofficial and Official)
Mod Blocking
Force Replacement
Modkills
* The Game specific Class Cards are here:

<blockquote>
<p>Is actually told that Alch can selftarget with Crimson Potion.</p>
<p><em>Improves survivability within the class if the class knows exactly that you can self target other than the “If you heal a player that is not you.” description softing that you can.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Extract Essence’s 1 day cooldown is now removed.</p>
<p><em>Primarily due to complaints but also because alch is unable to stall a game for that long.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Misty Potion replaced with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tainted Potion</strong> - Frame target player to all Investigations tonight. - 1 use</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Is more beneficial to the scumteams and the alch’s survival than Misty Potion ever was. Also added in due to being less demanding on the host.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>while a day abil could be added which tells if a target has ever been attacked in the game. I dont want it being a pseudo invest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your objective is to use 4 potions throughout the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is a survive 4 nights + guess one person that dies that night one time with guesses only on odd days win condition. It’s just a dressed up survival goal with one really odd limitation and then almost no abilities that make it easier to achieve that goal. No abilities make guessing who dies that night easier. Something like a Sellsword stonewall would be needed there. Nothing gives it surviveability except arguably an occupation and a single use vest. The goal and abilities are super disjointed. Misty potion should always be a frame here, so that Alchemist would survive another day as someone else would get lynched.</p>
