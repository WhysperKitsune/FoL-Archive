    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/no-info-feature-wipe-out-bug/1084</link>
    <description>####What happened?
Before Day8 everything from my chat box, role list to almost everything was wiped.

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?
**The working screen:**

####Steps to reproduce:
1. Perhaps, i would need to give an output_log to Boslof. 
2. Try to update again.

####Comments:
Not sure what happened here but hopefully i can get some advice or assistance on how to fix it.
It may very be my pc. The more players, the worse? 
Most of my games run at 2 -4 FPS, on a good day 6-8 FPs. But the game is playable. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</description>
