    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/important-things-to-keep-track-of-in-logs-right-hand-page/80427</link>
    <description>If you&#39;re a brand new noob and this is your first game, just keeping track of the following info will take you to Challenger Tier

In the right-hand side of your log-book:

Someone claims a class?  Write that down: `2 - Prince`

It&#39;s unclear? `2 - Prince?`

They&#39;re confirmed? `2 - Prince!` 

They claimed only vaguely? `2 - Important?`

They are outed by Princess? `2 - KO`

The Princess is confirmed? `2 - KO!`

By Drunk? `2 - REDIR IMM`

By Butler? `2 - OCC IMM`

It&#39;s important to distinguish between redirect immune and occupy immune because in some cases it matters.  For instance Hunter N1 is redirect immune but not occupy immune.

Aided by CW? `2 - AIDED`

They claimed they were bleeding D2? `2 - bleeds n3`

Writing the night they are supposed to die is more useful since whether they survive that night gives you clues regarding the existence of healers or whether their bleed claim was fake, etc.

Keep track of all this even as evil.  You will be able to deduce Prince and kill him long before anyone else has a clue thanks to this VFR meta

Also for the Princess who called 2 KO: `14 - Princess | 2ko`</description>

            <p>For me ToL is a game, not a competition. I try to win. I’m not mad tho if I lose. It happens. We are here to have fun with each other. And I absolutely love the mechanics indepth!</p>
