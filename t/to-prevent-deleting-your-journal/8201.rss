    <title>To prevent deleting your Journal</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/to-prevent-deleting-your-journal/8201</link>
    <description>I was watching this streamer &quot;KyleStreamsStuff&quot;, and this happened, so he got an idea for some suggestions..
https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyHedonisticDumplingsDoubleRainbow

**First suggestion would be** - when you click &quot;Journal&quot; it would open it and if you click it once more it would close it instead of opening it &quot;again&quot;

**Second suggestion would be** - Like in that clip what you saw, he tried to CTRL+C but instead did CTRL+V so he deleted his logs and got executed (RIP) - So to prevent stuff like this happening, would be great to have a **button on each side of journal &quot;Copy page&quot;**

These ideas was made by KyleStreamsStuff, not by me, I&#39;m just here to share them with you.</description>

            <p>I was unaware you couldn’t undo things. Never thought about testing it. I’ll add it in next patch.</p>

            <p>I agree. I think it is known that the Journal could need some Quality of Life feature updates.</p>
<p>This whole clip just perfectly shows in a hilarious way what is wrong with the current Journal.</p>
