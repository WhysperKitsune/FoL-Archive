          <p>So I was looking at all the current roles in FoL’s and I was thinking of some roles that I feel this game needs.</p>
<p>I believe this game needs a neutral role that can convert, that way people have a better chance of being converted so no one feels left out.<br>
I also added a Neutral role that can increase the win rate of the Neutral Killer.<br>
I also think there needs to be a new Investigative, Social, and Support Roles so stronger roles like Offence and Killing have a less chance of rolling.<br>
I also added a new Special role that can be very beneficial towards the impact of the game.<br>

          <p>Parasite</p>
<p>First things first<br>
Converting NK creates a whole host of problems regarding implementation</p>
<p>Now onto balance matters<br>
This NK has insane kp. It has conversion (evaluated at higher end of 2kp), an uninformed loverizer effect which the condition of is not hard at all to meet, and extremely easy endgaming potential<br>
It takes all the aspects that make Sorc extremely annoying to play against and turns it up substantially</p>
<p>You can try not going for a n1 convert and just try to use side effect twice alongside poisonous venom on a “stronger town player”<br>
The conversion is fine theoretically but it’s absurdly strong</p>
<p>So as for the balance side it’s stronger than the strongest nk currently (sorc) by a long shot since instead of bypassing endgame and having a relatively unstable early / midgame, you have a precarious early game and extremely strong everything else</p>
<p>additionally it’s neutral<br>
cop doesn’t peek for neutrals<br>
it peeks for scum</p>
<p>literally only a faction check would work on this<br>
conversion nk seems fine in concept<br>
but it’s extremely annoying to play against because lolmultiball taken to the extremes</p>
<hr>
<p>Mortician</p>
<p>No<br>
I get that you find fakeclaim prince to be interesting<br>
And yes, it’s theoretically cool<br>
but no</p>
<p>it’s also obscenely confirmable so ehhhhh</p>
<p>also dead silent interaction with scumchat is extremely stupid.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mimic</p>
<p>Works only if you have feedback<br>
If it does have feedback, it’s suddenly ridiculously strong as an investigative because it’s both almost entirely confirmable and other such ridiculous things</p>
<p>also can swap with abilities it shouldn’t be able to use, ie the scum kill, convert, nk kill, prince, etc<br>
tons of bullshit</p>
<hr>
<p>Mathematician</p>
<p>This isn’t ToS<br>
Being able to determine the converted player extremely easily is extremely frustrating to play against<br>
This also works on n1 for some ungodly reason</p>
<p>FD operates as a rolecop in a semi-open setup<br>
And rolecops are really fucking good when there are no false positives / negatives</p>
<hr>
<p>Time Keeper</p>
<p>Semi open setup<br>
Refocus time is also kind of wack but not super wack<br>
bad</p>
<p>Time Disrupter</p>
<p>Scum role<br>
That can effectively decide<br>
the lynch<br>
twice</p>
<p> &gt;be prince<br>
 &gt;time keeper got converted<br>
 &gt;die immediately<br>
 &gt;be nk<br>
 &gt;time keeper still converted<br>
 &gt;die immediately</p>
<p>unseen win</p>
<hr>
<p>Predator</p>
<p>Neutral<br>
Day<br>
Cop</p>
<p>There are obvious other problems<br>
If BD kills NK<br>
That’s a mislynch<br>
Because now you’re NK and they wasted a day</p>
