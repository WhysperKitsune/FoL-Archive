    <description>Literally a neutral physician. It&#39;s bad, few people like being it, they king make too much, and more.


Time to say goodbye to alch and get a better neutral survivor</description>

<p>king is a core class, alchemist is not. Alchemist is a physician who can kill instead of ress and can sometimes give themselves death immunity.</p>

            <p>Alch is convertible, you just don’t convert them by pressing a button, you convert them by talking to them.  Mercs have to be convertible by mechanics because they are bound to a specific person.  If they are bound to BD you can’t talk them out of helping BD as that would be literally gamethrowing.</p>
<p>So, Mercs have to be convertible by the mechanics, but Alchs don’t have to be.  You have to persuade/beg/threaten/taunt them into doing what you want, it’s part of the game.</p>

            <p>I have some minor concerns about Alch and it mostly has to do with how they have every reason to align with BD</p>
<p>this makes their social play pretty flat and uninteresting. work with BD, hope you dont die… the end</p>
<p>there needs to be a reason for people to keep Alch alive, and random spray healing is not the ticket</p>

<p>Well yeah the yolo kill just makes sense to a degree. Alcs goal is to survive to the end… less people alive means earlier end. Whether he kills the prince and hands the game to the unseen on a silver platter, or takes out the assasain handing it to the BD on a silver platter, is inconsequential to the alc. Either way he winds up slightly closer to the goal of being alive at the end of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well although that’s technically true you will most likely get caught by someone like a observer then you will die, its sometimes better to just work with BD and stay hidden for most of the game and then tactically use your death pots at the end.</p>

<p>Well, Lets take on the neuts:</p>
<p>alch- can be very important, but half of them just yolo kill and side with unseen whenever they can. They tend to be good for BD only if the king is also good. If they claim alch after the king investigation there is no reason not to kill them im my opinion.</p>
<p>Merc- should always be voted out unless if he is a merc for prince/sheriff/paladin as mercs can be converted and can be a merc for evil, even MM. Also, i’ve seen MM who claims to be merc of assasians.</p>
<p>scorned- always have to frame BD. Can be kept around after they have already won.</p>
<p>fool- well…</p>
<p>5 reaper, posessor- they are good, you should keep them.</p>

<li>
<p>More recently ive been seeing alchs yolo kill for some reason all classes that can kill seem to be doing this more now, its like a meme at this point but they more likely will side with whoever the king is as they tend to survive longer that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that you can just test whoever they say they are contracted to then if its unseen let them make a new contract and if they cant just kill them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they don’t always have to frame BD i played as an honest scorned that did nothing wrong and it took a lot of convincing but a scorned on BD side is pretty valuable as they cant be converted or die at night. When both my targets naturally died i luckily stepped up as king and then we won.</p>

<p>as soon as there are equal unseen and BD, the alchemist is essentially converted.</p>

</aside>
<p>that is what BD sign up for working with an alch, i personally help BD all the way and some other people do that but its up to them and that’s the whole point of them being neutral.</p>

<p>what’s the point of mastermind is they just get killed as soon as they are revealed?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>MM is hard to get revealed and is a key unseen class so obviously you would kill them, do you not understand the entire objective of the game? how is that comparable to a neutral class?</p>
