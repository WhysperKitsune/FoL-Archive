    <title>Pretender revamp</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/pretender-revamp/76659</link>
    <description>Pretender should _pretend_ to be a royal person, not be claiming pretender n1. Imagine if you were in the middle ages and said to a king &quot;Hi, I want to take your place, so I&#39;m going to kill you&quot;, that would not end well.
I think that the pretender acts too much like a real princess so there&#39;s little reason to not claim pretender d1. Instead I propose a little change: since pretenders are usually not good at ruling, once they become king they will make questionable laws. Basically the pretender king should have a passive ability called &quot;Bad at ruling&quot;, where each bad faction would receive a small buff and would be notified of that by a message saying `The pretender king approved your questionable laws`.

* Unseen: The mastermind is permanently not suspicious (unless the king dies)
* Cult: The cult leader will have infinite eradicates (?)
* Possessor: He&#39;ll gain another jump
* Reaper: if he&#39;s attacked he will not lose souls (?)
* Sorcerer: she can both attack and detonate OR she can both swap and move bombs

Why this change would be beneficial for the game:
* The pretender will be able to side with evil more easily
* She cannot claim pretender night one, but she will actually pretend to be a royal

Why this change would be bad for the game:
* It&#39;s still unbalanced
* Princess claims would never become king

Any suggestions are appreciated</description>
