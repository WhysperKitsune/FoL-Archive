            <p>I don’t have any better ideas. Even the goal for my own NI idea was “survive AND finish your research paper”, but that still doesn’t stop it from being an overpowered BD class.</p>

            <p>I can’t think of anything better to put in its place so I just had it as survive, but I’m open to any ideas. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I’m not sure the goal of “surviving” and a Neutral Investigative role are compatible.</p>

            <p>You are valuable to other factions, providing information that currently no other class can through Visions, and the ability to over several nights be able to confirm who is of what faction if they match class type, or confirm that someone isn’t the class type they claim to be by checking them against someone confirmed. This is enough to have others allow you to assist them, working towards your goal of survival by being useful.</p>
