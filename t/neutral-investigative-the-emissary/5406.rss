Name is WIP.

The idea of this class is that they can take sides without revealing their identity by using insane whispers. They have excellent investigative capabilities, which can be used to reveal the unseen/cult to the BD or to side with he evils and feed them information in exchange for not dying. Lastly, they can extort the prince or an evil class anonymously, threatening to either reveal their identity or kill them.

Lore (basic outline)

from a near by kingdom, the emissary seeks to end the political instability in adiart quick enough so they can finally start negotiating some territorial rearrangement of near by nations.</description>

            <p>Scout<br>
Spy<br>
Espionage<br>
Infiltrator<br>
Emissary<br>
Spook<br>
Informer</p>
<p>A few name suggestions - Not sure if any are better.</p>
<p>I love the idea of this class - It would work perfectly in my opinion for both BD and Unseen/Cult - The power would rest almost entirely with this person unless they get axed (a bit like Alch) on which way they want to play the game. 10/10</p>

            <p>I love everything about this class except for the name, “Intelligenceer” (i saw you stated name is WIP).</p>
<p>I dont even think the name is bad, It just sounds more “mafia” esque than medieval to me. All of the abilities sound really good. Beneficial (or detrimental) to both scum and bd is needed on (nonkilling) neutrals I feel and yours is spot on! Could really go either way</p>

            <p>I see a lot of Neutral Investigative attempts of this forum as one doesn’t exist and it’s an interesting premise. In my opinion this is one of the best ones as the ability to listen to Prince and discover his identity makes him valuable to Scum aswell.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
