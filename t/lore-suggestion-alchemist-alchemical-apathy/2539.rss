    <title>[Lore Suggestion] (Alchemist) Alchemical Apathy</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-alchemist-alchemical-apathy/2539</link>
    <description>I have a passion that is not shared by many. I love the smell of a freshly brewed healing potion just as much as I love to watch a poison take effect. I once aspired to be a doctor, but I could never focus on just one type of potion to make. I loved to see the eyes go blind just as much as I liked to see the writhing of a creature as its organs shut down. There is merit in healing though, as seeing a creature go from being at the Reaper&#39;s door to full health is just as amazing a feat. People say I&#39;m a monster for watching a man suffer, but then praise me as if I was a god for saving another. I do not see the difference, both are just subjecting a body to different alchemical substances and seeing what happens. I don&#39;t pretend to use my substances to support one group or another, I just watch to see what I can do with simple ingredients, and gain more knowledge of what one human is able to do to another.</description>
