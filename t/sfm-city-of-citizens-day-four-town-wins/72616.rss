    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfm-city-of-citizens-day-four-town-wins/72616</link>
    <description>

## [color=Green] Introduction: [/color]

- Hello and welcome in another Special Forum Mafia game!

- Today we are going to the home of the best role ever created: The City Of Citizens!
- As you can guess, this is Citizen Theme game so don’t expect they won’t be ANY Citizens involved with it.

###### Hosted by Twil1ght and Marcus_Doodale

## [color=Green] Rules: [/color]

1. No gamethrowing.
2. No editing messages.
3. No private messaging with others in the game about the game.
4. Don&#39;t show your role card to anyone without permission from the Host.
5. Be active! After 24 hours you will be prodded and if you don&#39;t answer in 12 hours, you would be replaced/modkilled.
6. Don&#39;t spread toxicity. If you&#39;re upset or frustrated about something, please just hold it in yourself instead of expressing negative emotions by typing it in chat.
7. Most importantly have fun! After all this is why you&#39;re here.
8. Breaking any of those rules will be effective in a warming and next attempts would be follow up replacing out or by potential modkill.

## [color=Green] Gameplay: [/color]

- Days will be 2 IRL days long or shorter if someone would be lynched.
- Nights will be 1 IRL day long.
- Evils have a day and night chat.
- Mafia has factional kill but it will consume your other actions.
- Each player would got 2 Cards, Aligment Card and Role Card.
- After somebody would die they **won’t** be shown their Aligment Card. However, there **is** a way to find out the Aligment.
- As usual there gonna be balanced number of Town roles and Non-Town roles.
## [color=Green] Executions: [/color]

- To accuse someone say “/lynch [player]” or “/vote [player]”.
- If a player gets enough votes they would be lynched immediately and end the day.

## [color=Green] Deathnotes and Journals: [/color]
- There are allowed. The latest sended Journal would appear after you die.

## [color=Green] How to Join: [/color]

- Just say something like &quot;/join&quot;, &quot;in&quot; or whatever you want to express your interest in joining.

## [color=Green] Role Cards: [/color]

Well, they are Citizens...and that’s it. Surprising right?
But what can I say is all role names are 100% Non Aligment Indicative.


## [color=Green] Playerlist: [/color]
1. &lt;S&gt; Marluzion &lt;/S&gt;
2. &lt;S&gt; htm &lt;/S&gt;
3. &lt;S&gt; Luxy &lt;/S&gt;
4. &lt;S&gt; Margaret &lt;/S&gt;
5. &lt;S&gt; hjisak &lt;/s&gt;
