<p>Welcome to my very first Forum Match. Poker Mafia!<br>
This is a mafia game heavily based on gambling and RNG, but there won’t be any bastard mechanics or unfair advantages! If you don’t like RNG you are not forced to gamble, everyone gets free tokens each day!</p>
<p>The game works mostly like a normal forum mafia game, with a town faction, an evil faction and a few neutrals. However, instead of having different roles for each player, most players (except the neutrals and the Godfather) will have classes that start with no abilities.</p>
<p>To get an ability, you need tokens. Players start the game with 5 tokens. At the beginning of each day except day 1 every player gains 3 tokens and can gain more with daytime events related to gambling. You can also “sell” your abilities for tokens.<br>
You don’t buy the abilities directly with tokens, instead you have to bet. Every day there will be a pool of abilities. During the day, you can place any number of tokens on one or multiple abilities, and at the beginning of the night whoever placed the most tokens will get the ability permanently. There is not a maximum number of abilities a single player can have at the same time.</p>

<p><big><font color="Purple"><span class="hashtag">#Gameplay</span></font></big></p>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Days will be 3 IRL days long, or shorter if someone dies</li>
<li>Nights will be 1 IRL day long</li>
<li>Actions are done by messaging me</li>
<li>Mafia will talk through a special Discord server. They have both day and night chat.</li>
<li>When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ability pool and betting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pool will have abilities equal to the number of players minus 3. There will always be a minimum of 3 abilities in the pool.</li>
<li>The ability pool changes every day.</li>
<li>You can place your bets by messaging a host with the number of the ability and the ammount of tokens, for example: “I want to bet 10 tokens on ability <span class="hashtag">#4</span>”.</li>
<li>Bets are private and will not be revealed to anyone, except for some specific abilities or events.</li>
<li>You can place or change your bets at any point during the daytime.</li>
<li>Even though I call it betting, getting abilities is more like an auction. The player with the highest amount of tokens in each ability will get said ability.</li>
<li>If there is a tie, the person with the less number of non-starting abilities will get it. If that is also a tie, it will be solved by rng.</li>
<li>Each night, a player will get <strong>ALL</strong> the abilities in which they had the most tokens.</li>
<li>The abilities are given to the player at the beginning of the night, which means they can use them that same night.</li>
<li>You can have more than 2 day and night abilities. There is no limit.</li>
<li>Players can only use one day ability per day and one night ability per night. The only exception is The Cheater, who can pay tokens to use more than one ability.</li>
<li>You are not forced to bet every day. You can save your tokens for a later day.</li>
<li>To sell an ability send a message to the host telling him which ability you want to sell.</li>
<li>You cannot have duplicate abilities. If you get an ability you already have you will get increased uses instead.</li>
<li>You will get 5 tokens back for selling unused abilities, and 1-4 tokens if you have used some of its charges. You will get no tokens for selling abilities with 0 uses.</li>
<li>Passives are sold for 5 tokens, unless its a one shoot passive that has already triggered (such as death immunity once).</li>
<li>Abilities that you sell will go back into the pool for anyone to buy. They will have the same remaining uses.</li>
<li>You will know whether you got an ability or not at the beginning of the night. If you lose a bet, you will not know who got the ability.</li>
<li>If The Gambler gives a special token to a Leprechaun, they will give them 10 normal tokens instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There will be one event every day.</li>
<li>Some events require you to vote for someone or pay a certain amount of tokens. This is done through messaging the host.</li>
<li>The event will end in 24 hours or earlier if everyone has performed the required actions.</li>
<li>You can discuss about the game and lynch people while an event is running. Lynching someone will immediately end the event.</li>
<li>The results of the event will be public unless stated otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Executions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To accuse someone say “<strong>/lynch [player]</strong>” or “<strong>/vote [player]</strong>”</li>
<li>If a player gets enough votes they will be lynched.</li>
<li>Executions end the Day, so be sure to bet before someone is lynched!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Journals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mafia/NK/Neutral specific interactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Godfather can make himself attack someone, but it would still use up 3 tokens.</li>
<li>If the GF makes a mafioso kill someone, he uses the 3 tokens. The mafioso DOESN’T get them.</li>
<li>If a member of the mafia attacks a gambler or leprechaun, the attacker will know their class.</li>
<li>Gambler wins with mafia but is a neutral class, which means he is allowed to out the cheater or members of the mafia.</li>
<li>If Godfather sends someone to attack a leprechaun, the mafioso that attacked him will get the bribe.</li>
<li>If you attack a leprechaun with less than 7 tokens, you will get the bribe AND kill them.</li>
<li>If you try to attack a gambler you will be prevented from doing it. Which means it wouldn’t count as an attack for abilities purposes.</li>
<li>If a leprechaun loses their tokens on the day time for any reason, they will die immediately.</li>
<li>Leprechaun’s passive works like a heal, so he can survive any attacks, poison or bleeding as long as he has enough tokens. Abilities that go through immunity will not kill him, but abilities that go through healing will.</li>
</ul>
<p><big><font color="Purple"><span class="hashtag">#To</span> Join</font></big></p>
<ul>
<li>To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like “I want to join” or “/join” or “/in” or “sign me up, coach” or whatever you want</li>
</ul>

          <p>I have like 100 abilities in the ability pool won’t be a problem to delete 3 or 4 trial related ones if people want otherwise.</p>
<p>BTW abilities dont have the same powerlevel, some might be weak and others might be really OP. This should make the gambling more interesting.</p>

          <p>Trials imo just slow down the game  and are mostly unnecessary<br>
But if you have abilities that actually interact with them, it’s different<br>
Just keep what you have for now and we can suggest changes after playing once</p>
