            <p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>I may add another ability to make this more interesting.</p>
<p>To make it more supportive, maybe i could change a bit more what could be filtered. and make it less confirmable. Most likely , the cw will pick up merc guards and  occupations , so ill try and make sure that doesnt happen<br>
Thanks once again</p>

            <p>While this idea is unique, I feel it is not going to be fun. You have to take at least two days to actually perform an action, and if no one visits, you get occupied, or only killer/special visit the target, you still get to do nothing.</p>
<p>Along with that, I feel this isn’t a supportive Court Wizard. Yes it’s possible for him to get supportive abilities, but it’s equally possible for him to get investigative, offensive, or social abilities. And even then he could get something boring like Frame, and just know that person is a fool/scorned target.</p>
<p>Finally, the the ability allows him to confirm visits. While you don’t get everyone who visits a player, you get one of the abilities and you can now deduce “Oh I got Smite, this is a Cult game and our paladin is unconverted.”</p>
