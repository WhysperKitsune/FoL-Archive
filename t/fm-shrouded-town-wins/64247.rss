### Executions

The role list is hidden. There will be no neutrals. Bastard roles and mechanics CAN exist. I have made sure the setup is balanced taking into account the special rules. Besides that make no assumptions.

<p>Passive 1: Vulnerable - You appear to be mafia in alignment checks. You cannot be saved from the mafia’s night kill. If you are killed by the mafia they will get 2 kills the next night<br>
Passive 2: Back up - You must send a player name in your class card to be your backup. If that player dies, or is mafia (you will be told) you must send another name. If you die they will become this class. If you fail to chose someone then a random player will be chosen</p>
<p>Night Ability: Modified  Compulsive Vigilante - Kill target player. If you fail for any reason then you cannot be stopped in the same way the next night. You will die if you fail to chose a target. (Unlimited)</p>

            <p>The worst part is I am never going to get another shot at it on these forums because you would be expecting it now unless I do it in a non-bastard game. And that’s just evil.</p>
