    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Paladin</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-paladin/654</link>
    <description>**Lore Link:** http://tol.wikia.com/wiki/The_Paladin

**Lore Subject:** The Paladin&#39;s Crusade

**Lore:**
Sworn to protect all that is good and just in this world, the Paladin has made it her lifelong crusade to end the influence of the blood god Mithras.  Though she does her best to protect her allies from succumbing to his corrupt power, she knows the only way to end the terror Mithras spreads is by striking down every Cultist who would heed the god’s insidious call.  She arrived at Castle Adiart yesterday, and her coming can mean only one thing: there are Cultists hiding among us. If we do not root them out, our kingdom may be the next to fall to the blood god.

**Comments:**
Since the Paladin only appears when the Cult does, I wanted to give the impression that she was a wandering crusader, who only recently came to Castle Adiart under suspicion that the cult may have infiltrated it.  I also tried to reference her limited use Blessing of Light ability (granting immunity to conversion) and her unlimited Cleanse (which kills a target if they are a Cultist).  This is my first attempt at writing lore, just curious to see what people thought.</description>

            <p>Uh… good question. I could go either way based on picture, though I was leaning female. Although I did find one line in the Cult page that suggests the Paladin is male. I dunno, the class list could use another female or two. At this point I think it’s just the Princess, Invoker, and maybe Seeker.</p>
