            <p>The Prince shouldn’t be able to get an execution “backfired”, especially since the Prince is a unique role, and that the Gambler is neutral.<br>
What does jinx affect? Day abilities? Night abilities? Killing abilities? Clarity is important.<br>
<strong>Roll thy Roll</strong> shouldn’t be a 2-in-1, and how does the illusion card fit with the Gambler? Same with False Death Note, why would a gambler steal a death note?</p>
<p>An interesting concept here, but the abilities just don’t match to what a gambler would do.</p>
<p>Also, what is his win condition?</p>
