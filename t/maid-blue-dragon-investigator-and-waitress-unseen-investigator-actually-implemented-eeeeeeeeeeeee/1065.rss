            <p>suggested rules for compatibility:</p>
<p>members of opposing factions are not compatible<br>
members of the same faction (even neutral) are compatible with each other<br>
the mercenary is compatible with their target<br>
scorned is compatible with everyone but their targets<br>
fool is compatible with scorned only</p>

            <p>Maid is by far my favourite added role, Squire a close second. After that in order it goes, eating shit, being castrated, being buried alive, all the other added roles, Moonspirit.</p>
<p>Seriously though Maid is beautiful. We never had a Waitress but looking at it now Waitress is actually pretty underpowered tbh. I would giver her extra uses of Poke Around imo.</p>
<p>I don’t think Maid herself should be changed at all though she cool af.</p>

            <p>The only suggestion I have is to allow Royals to be matched together just because I do kinda feel like all of the special rules with compatibility makes this class extremely difficult and frustrating for newer or weaker players. I would try scrapping one of these specific rules and that would be the royal one as matching two Nobles makes complete sense.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the flavor of matching is here…is Jammy implying the Maid is encouraging her targets to<br>
uh<br>
you know</p>

“Probably a fluke” isn’t an argument it’s what you say when you can’t think of any actual ways to help your case so you resort to “pssh you got lucky”</p>
