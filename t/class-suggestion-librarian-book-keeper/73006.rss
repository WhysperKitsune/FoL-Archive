Comments: This class would be great for helping with giving logs out to important BD classes. The writing review could also let you socially deduce if someone does not update their logs at night they might seem more suspicious. The snoop ability was nice to have for noble but not totally sure if its needed but I felt they needed a second night ability. The unseen converted class is nice too it will help them find the prince and possibly get all the claims he has. I&#39;ve also noticed when someone dies and their logs and class don&#39;t match BD goes on an exe spree on all the physician claims thinking theres a herbalist, but the book swap could help with that or you can edit that pesky sheriff&#39;s logs that found an unseen to make his logs different when he dies.</description>

<p>Again, too easily confirmable. Also forcing claims out of evils early is not fair to play against.</p>

<hr>
<p>Just to the note of the person that wrote this, reading / checking logs has been proven in the past to be fundamentally OP for a BD class.</p>
