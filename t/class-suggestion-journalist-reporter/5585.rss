            <p>First of all you can check to see if some classes are even in the game at all (Fools can screw you up but you can just check if there is a fool first). This lets you confirm the existence of an alchemist. It also means that if for whatever reason the NK has found an Unseen or the Unseen has found the NK that they have someone to tell. The other ability means that they can be a traditional invest for a specific class.</p>
<p>The Reporter on the other hand is more for negotiating with an enemy than questioning them.</p>

            <p>I dont really see a problem with it, but does it add anything, seems like mostly a midlly untrustworthy information source that might take the place of a more useful investigator in a match.</p>
