    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Frosted Blade</title>

    <description># [color=cyan]The Frosted Blade[/color]

Once upon a twilight, there was a huge Kingdom made entirely of frost. But it was not cold for those who dwell. Among this Kingdom were thousands of knight who wield a blade of ice called, rightfully by their Great General, The Frosted Blade. The sword is self was no ordinary weapon, as it didn&#39;t just cut into their opponents flesh, it made it untreatable. 

Those who had been struck by The Frosted Blade were left permanently wounded. Cuts were not able to be sealed and people died soon after. If the wound didn&#39;t kill you, the frost bite did.

            <p>For some reason the opening strikes me as a beautiful poem. I tried my hand at it:</p>
<p>Once upon a silent twilight<br>
There sat a kingdom made of frost.<br>
Too hard for those who did not dwell<br>
Too cold for those who birthed from hell</p>
<p>Protect this land from darkest might<br>
A thousand knights with blades of ice<br>
A name the Great General gave<br>
Rightfully called The Frosted Blade</p>
<p>T’was no ordinary weapon<br>
It did not just cut into flesh<br>
The wound was left untreatable<br>
Knights known wide as Unbeatable</p>
<p>A lasting mark for all to see<br>
A cut that would forever bleed<br>
No chance if you escape its Might<br>
You’ll soon succumb to the Frost bite</p>
