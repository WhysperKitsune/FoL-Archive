    <description>Hi. I don&#39;t mind the Sellsword how they are. But, a few days ago I had a game where everybody in the Unseen died EXCEPT for me. And I was Sellsword. So, it was just little old me against the world with no killing power. My suggestion is that when every other Unseen member dies, make it so the Sellsword gets promoted to Assassin plox!</description>

            <p>When the Assassin dies any non-Mastermind role should become an Assassin, so it sounds like a bug</p>
