    <description>How to win as Possessor/Reaper


Possessor and Reaper are both very, very hard classes to win as. But what if you were to change that you were possessor or reaper? Here is how you will win: You are going to become Neutral King.

D1 write onto your deathnote &quot;No Royals step up. I will step up as possessor/reaper (whatever one you are)&quot;

Possessor:
N1: Possess someone to kill the King.
D2: If King is killed and no royals step up, claim Possessor and 90% of the time they will vote you to become King. BD will vote you to get rid of a Killer, Unseen/Cult will vote you to become a potential ally and Neutrals will vote you as you are also a fellow neutral and chances are you won&#39;t kill them.

Although it isn&#39;t all that easy. Somethings can prevent the King dying n1.

If the Knight Protects the King: Knight and whoever you possessed will die. That is the glory of the possessor. Proceed to kill the King n2.
If a Healer Protects the King: Start killing normally until someone claims Bleeding/Poisoned. All healers will go onto them. Proceed to kill the King.

Reaper:
This one is a gamble. It is much riskier as Possessor but it can still be done safely.

Very Risky Route: 

D1: Consume Darkness
N1: Reap the King

Only 1 thing can go wrong:

If Knight protects king: Knight will kill you due to no souls left.

Non-Risky route

D1: Do nothing
N1: Reap someone random
D2: Do nothing
N2: Reap someone
D3: Consume darkness as you should have 4 souls and kill the King. If this fails, Knight will not kill you.
N3: Reap the King

Once neutral King try and create a healing/guard bond with an Alchemist. Side with whoever has Majority.

I&#39;m quite new at this game with only 59 hours so I&#39;m sure there will be some error like the Knight kills the Reaper no matter if he has souls or not.</description>
