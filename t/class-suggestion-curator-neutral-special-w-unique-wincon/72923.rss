    <title>[Class Suggestion] Curator (Neutral Special w/ Unique Wincon)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-curator-neutral-special-w-unique-wincon/72923</link>
    <description>&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=white]The Curator[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; **[color=grey]Neutral Special[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Ancient Curse (Passive)** - Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Your abilities CANNOT target the starting king.
&gt; **Knowledge (Passive)** - At the start of each night, you will know how many members each of the main factions have. (does NOT include starting king)
&gt;
&gt; **Arcane Armor (Day)** - Target player will be immune to death tonight. If it prevents their death, gain an additional use of Assault. *(2 Uses)*
&gt; **Runic Ward (Day)** - If you would have died tonight, the targeted player will die instead. Bypasses death immunity. *(2 Uses)*
&gt;
&gt; **Assault (Night)** - Attack a player. *(Single Use)*
&gt; **Mortify (Night)** - The chosen player will be forced to target you with their abilities tonight. *(Infinite Uses)*
&gt;
&gt;***Objective: winning factions MUST have at most one player alive at the end of the game. Does NOT include the starting king.***

The entire focus of the class is designed around the win condition for the class, which relies upon having games that are very close. 

It is also important to note that the wincon excludes winning with just the starting king, but this may be subject to change

This is probably my best worst idea.

Changelog:

Rephrased objective to make more sense.</description>

</aside>
<p>I suppose this is a problem with phrasing. The idea is that ALL factions who win must have at most one player alive.</p>
