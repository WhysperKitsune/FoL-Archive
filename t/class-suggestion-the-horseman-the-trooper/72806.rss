            <p>Flavor. wut. I was leg surprised that this was not a support/support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Passive (Mounted)</strong> - You are guaranteed to visit your target. However , if you are occupied , this passive will be lost. <em>This passive does not carry over if you change classes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A tad too unfun. If removed early, one of the main strong points of the class is rendered moot.</p>
<p>I would suggest just making the class occ./red. immune, with a day ability to make its next visit guaranteed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Passive (Horsepower)</strong> - If you are empowered by a <strong>Court Wizard</strong> , you will become <strong>Immune to Conversion</strong> and your next use of <strong>Criminal Records</strong> will get your target’s exact class.(Only works once)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The problem with this passive is threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents fakeclaiming CW if there is a horseman in game. It also confirms the CW if there is one, which shouldn’t be based on having two classes that can potentially not spawn in game.</li>
<li>Extremely strong. Specified class detection is something that should not belong to BD, as seen with every other investigative class.</li>
<li>Anti-synergy with Hay prevents that ability from being useful, as the potential upside of this one is far greater. While mitigated with whisper meta, the whisper meta is not something to strive to support in design.</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR - Too restrictive, out of line with other invests, and gives more reasons to whisper meta.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Night Ability (Criminal Records)</strong> - See if your target is a member of <strong>The Blue Dragon</strong> .(Infinite Uses - [1 Day Cooldown])</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If this spawns, encourages neuts out. As seen with the OG princess flirt, it was changed to something more reasonable for neuts.</p>
<p>I have no idea how you would change this to make it unique from other invest classes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, trooper is actually interesting.</p>
<p>I do think horseman could just be a support class with reworked abilities. The mounted concept is interesting, especially if it could be a little less luck dependent. Changing personal guard to preventing visits and telling you their ‘intent,’ it could be really cool.</p>
