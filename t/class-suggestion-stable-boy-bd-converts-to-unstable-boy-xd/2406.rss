    <description>**Stable Boy** (Blue Dragon) - A faithful caretaker of the royal horses.

Passive 1:
Simple Squire - You cannot be attacked by a Knight. (Knight can select you, but the attack will not go through.)

Day Ability:
Shovel It - Fling &quot;something disgusting&quot; in front of a player, making their next words come out as a retch instead of words if they have royal blood. Limited use. (Use: Confirm or discredit someone&#39;s claim of a royal blood role, use randomly to find royals and non-royals. However, since everyone will see the retch, you might be putting a Blue Dragon in harm&#39;s way! So use it carefully...)

Night Ability 1:
Saddle Bagged - Weigh down a player&#39;s horse, making them &quot;late&quot; for the next day&#39;s events. They won&#39;t be able to speak for the first half of the next day. Infinite use.

Night Ability 2:
Swiftest Steed - Lend a player the fastest horse, allowing them to outrun death if they are Blue Dragon and use their night action. (No effect if not BD, no effect if they don&#39;t use an action on the same night). Limited use.

Lore:
The most faithful and true stable boy in all the land, it is rumored you were born with an ability to communicate with horses - and without a sense of smell.

Comments:
Simple stuff. I know people will likely have issues with some of these abilities, but let&#39;s talk it out and see if there&#39;s a happy medium if you&#39;re not down with it.


_When you are converted, you become..._


**Unstable Boy** (Unseen) - A wicked little boy who doesn&#39;t mind animal cruelty.

Passive 1:
All the King&#39;s Horses - If you are executed by vote, you will release the guards&#39; horses, preventing the King from using guards for multiple nights. (Number of nights up for debate... why write it in stone here?)

Night Ability 1:
Gift Horse - Forage for more Nightshade on the Assassin&#39;s behalf. Can only be used when Assassin has no Nightshade. Limited use.

Night Ability 2:
Trample - Lead a group of wild horses to charge a target player. If they were visiting a non-BD, they will be battered and &quot;late&quot; to the next day&#39;s events. They won&#39;t be able to speak for first half of the next day. Infinite use.

Lore:
Turns out you could smell, after all... drove you a bit mad.

Comments:
Yes, the name is a joke - but the class isn&#39;t! XD

The &quot;late for the next day&quot; thing wouldn&#39;t tell the target HOW they were made late, so they&#39;d know there&#39;s a Stable OR Unstable Boy, but won&#39;t know which one.</description>

<p>Day Ability:<br>
Shovel It - Fling “something disgusting” in front of a player, making their next words come out as a wretch instead of words if they have royal blood. Limited use. (Use: Confirm or discredit someone’s claim of a royal blood role, use randomly to find royals and non-royals. However, since everyone will see the wretch, you might be putting a Blue Dragon in harm’s way! So use it carefully…)</p>

            <p><strong>Stable Boy</strong> (Blue Dragon) - A faithful caretaker of the royal horses.</p>
<p>Passive 1:<br>
Simple Squire - You cannot be attacked by a Knight. (Knight can select you, but the attack will not go through.)</p>
<p>Day Ability:<br>
Shovel It - Fling “something disgusting” in front of a player, making their next words come out as a retch instead of words if they have royal blood. Limited use. (Use: Confirm or discredit someone’s claim of a royal blood role, use randomly to find royals and non-royals. However, since everyone will see the retch, you might be putting a Blue Dragon in harm’s way! So use it carefully…)</p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
Saddle Bagged - Weigh down a player’s horse, making them “late” for the next day’s events. They won’t be able to speak for the first half of the next day. Infinite use.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
Swiftest Steed - Lend a player the fastest horse, allowing them to outrun death if they are Blue Dragon and use their night action. (No effect if not BD, no effect if they don’t use an action on the same night). Limited use.</p>
<p>Lore:<br>
The most faithful and true stable boy in all the land, it is rumored you were born with an ability to communicate with horses - and without a sense of smell.</p>
<p>Comments:<br>
Simple stuff. I know people will likely have issues with some of these abilities, but let’s talk it out and see if there’s a happy medium if you’re not down with it.</p>
<p><em>When you are converted, you become…</em></p>
<p><strong>Unstable Boy</strong> (Unseen) - A wicked little boy who doesn’t mind animal cruelty.</p>
<p>Passive 1:<br>
All the King’s Horses - If you are executed by vote, you will release the guards’ horses, preventing the King from using guards for multiple nights. (Number of nights up for debate… why write it in stone here?)</p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
Gift Horse - Forage for more Nightshade on the Assassin’s behalf. Can only be used when Assassin has no Nightshade. Limited use.</p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
Trample - Lead a group of wild horses to charge a target player. If they were visiting a non-BD, they will be battered and “late” to the next day’s events. They won’t be able to speak for first half of the next day. Infinite use.</p>
<p>Lore:<br>
Turns out you could smell, after all… drove you a bit mad.</p>
<p>Comments:<br>
Yes, the name is a joke - but the class isn’t! XD</p>
<p>The “late for the next day” thing wouldn’t tell the target HOW they were made late, so they’d know there’s a Stable OR Unstable Boy, but won’t know which one.</p>
