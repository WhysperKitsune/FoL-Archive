    <title>[Rework Suggestion] Court Wizard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rework-suggestion-court-wizard/54662</link>
    <description>I have three different suggestions for CW:

**_Suggestion 1_**
&gt; [color=blue]**The Court Wizard**[/color]
&gt; **Magic Barrier (Night)** - Select a player. Prevents anyone from visiting them, unless they are trying to heal or attack them. Unlimited uses.
&gt; **Tornado (Night)** - Select two players. Everyone trying to visit one of them will instead visit the other. Bypasses redirection immunity. 2 uses.

This should make Magic Barrier feel more meaningful while serving a similar purpose of protecting a player from negative effects and not attacks, since that is the job of the physician.
Used correctly, this ability could protect someone from ANY scum ability: if Mastermind wants to convert them, if invoker wants to swap them with someone else, if a marshal wants to find out their class type, etc..
It could also hinder BD if CW uses it poorly, since it also prevents most BD roles.

Sage should stay the same as on live.


**_Suggestion 2_**


&gt; **[color=blue]The Court Wizard[/color]**
&gt; **Magic Barrier (Day)** - Select a player. Said player will be immune to negative effects and conversion as long as you are alive. Cannot target yourself. 1 use.
&gt; 
&gt; **Magic Portal (Night)** - Select a player. Guarantees that everyone trying to visit said player will succeed no matter what. Investigative roles visiting said player will not get fake results. Unlimited uses.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tornado (Night)** - Swap two player’s positions, forcing players visiting one of them to visit the other. 3 uses.

**_Suggestion 3_**

[color=blue]The Court Wizard[/color]
**Mirror Spell (Night)** - Select two players. The first player will also use their night action with the second player, in addition to whoever they targeted. (This makes people able to use their night abilities on two people rather than one. The person won&#39;t know they used their ability on someone else).
**Recharge (Night)** - Grants a player 1 extra use of all their limited use abilities. 1 use.</description>
