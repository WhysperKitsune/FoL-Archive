    <description>Enable empower reap to reap a drunk who debs you.  This way reaper can bait drunks to get them out of the way.  At the moment his only counter is to do nothing, but the cost of not killing that night is too much, and it takes a lot of skill to predict debs, which should be better rewarded.  I once predicted 2 debs and did nothing both nights, but still lost because missing out on 2 kills is too hard on Reaper.  Such plays should be better rewarded ...</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>How about buffing reaper in this sense and making chill and empower darkness the same ability? You chill your target and can empower reap that target on that night. If this is too much of a buff, make it require 3 souls possibly, but impossible to be occupied. This also gives room for a new day ability, possibly costing 1 soul, to edit logs of a person that you have reaped the previous night.</p>

            <p>If Reaper chills a Drunk who debauched him, the Drunk will still out him in his logs.  This is another reason Reaper should be able to edit victim’s logs.  If I get debauched, then chill the Drunk, then empower reap him, I should be able to erase the “i debd him and he attacked me” part, because it cost me 4 souls just to kill the Drunk (plus he wasted one of my nights when he debauched me the first time).</p>

<p>Getting deb’d by a drunk = death sentence as reaper unless you happened to have empowered that night. The best you can do is trade via claiming you deb’d the drunk.</p>
