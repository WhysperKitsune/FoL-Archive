    <title>Cuztomize for Summer 2018</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cuztomize-for-summer-2018/71419</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,
I&#39;ve seen many actual games launching some updates about summer 2018 as we&#39;re early august. I would like to suggest some &quot;crazy&quot; ideas to add more customization to the game.

New armors : 
- a guy with straw hat &amp; black hair, wearing a shirt summer opened, a tropical short blue/green colored with palm trees, and some colored flipflops.
- a girl wearing bikini (in 2 pieces) with black sunglasses, a flowery necklace (flowers are white and red like if we were in hawaii) and some colored flipflops.
- an other guy with blond hair, half-naked in top and red swimsuit + white flipflops (like if he were coming from Malibu).
- an other girl with this time a bodysuit (in 1 piece) wearing a bath towel around her waist like a long skirt and some colored flipflops.

New weapons : 
- a beach ball that the player will smash on the exe player&#39;s head to break his head/neck.
- a water gun to drown the exe player&#39;s face.
- a super jump/high kick with both feets like if the player is gonna jump over the exe player&#39;s body &amp; slide with it as what he will do with a surfboard on a wave.
- a beach umbrella that a player will open and swirl in the exe player direction and makes him fly with it.
- a summer fan that the player will use to cut the neck of the exe player like a ninja.

New emotes : 
- it&#39;s so hot, so the player is sweating and trying to make some hands movements to refresh his face/body.
- the player grab a beach ball from the back and hit it on the top to make it disappear on the screen.

If you had other ideas i&#39;ll take it but i find myself that it would be fun at least to have some of them in real.</description>
