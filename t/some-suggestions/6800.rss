    <title>Some suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/some-suggestions/6800</link>
    <description>I saw several suggestions around here, so I thought I&#39;d make some of my own.

**Social**
1. Make it so that when you mouse over a dead person&#39;s name, you can see the night (or day) they died. 
It is useful in many cases to discredit some bad fake logs. Right now, you can, indeed, scroll up in sustem chat and see when someone dies. I just think it would be easier this way.

2. In the endgame chat, when someone speaks, the game should show his number (just like the in-game chat).
This might seem silly or unimportant to you, but I like talking in the endgame chat. However, it&#39;s somewhat inconvenient to have to check the list to see who&#39;s actually talking. Especially since I just spent the whole game getting used to referring to people using their numbers (or even their in-game names). I&#39;m guessing this can be easily implemented.

**Abilities**

3. Change assassin&#39;s distraction to not notify the target.
In my opinion, assassin&#39;s distract is not really useful at this moment. I mean the target can just wait 10 seconds and then just announce he was distracted. Its only real use is if it&#39;s used in the last 10 seconds of the day phase. 
Instead, I would like it to be pretty much the opposite of a trollbox. The target should not be notified he was distracted. In addition, if he says something in that 10-sec window, he would see it like he properly said it, but noone else would be able to see it. I think that keeps up with the spirit of the ability, but makes it better.

4. Similarly to my previous point, change duchess slap, noble order, and psychic&#39;s and illusionist&#39;s misdirect.
Make it so the target thinks he votes freely, while in fact he isn&#39;t.

5. Maybe marshal&#39;s snoop could rewrite journals.
Alright, this might be too strong and/or confusing in some cases. It would be really useful since it could write fake logs on a good guy or even erase someone&#39;s journal completely. This could be amazing if you coordinate with the assassin to kill the target on the same night and give bad info to the rest of the players or even write something minor, but wrong, in his logs, so they appear fake if he has to defend himself. 
Perhaps, in order to weaken it a bit, the target should receive a notification next day that his journal has been rewritten, so if he survives the night, he could reveal there&#39;s a marshal (or tell the priest if he doesn&#39;t survive). Also, maybe reduce the snoop&#39;s charges from 3 to 2 if that&#39;s the case.

Thank you for reading.</description>

            <p>I like the how the game doesn’t hold your hand and makes you work as if you were actually around the table investigating. If you can hover over a player’s name and see when they died, that takes away from the beauty of the game. Each time a player dies, wrote down the night they died in your private notes for reference, as a detective would. I agree with you about the distraction somewhat. It doesn’t feel like you were actually distracted. If you were distracted in real life you would not be talking and honestly not even listening to what’s going on. I think that it should be longer, yes. Like 20 seconds. And I think when you’re distracted it shouldn’t say you were distracted, instead for that time you should not be able to click in your chat box to even start typing, and also you never get to see what was said in chat for that time. Like people stop talking for the 10 seconds. If you don’t speak and don’t hear anything for the time you’re distracted, that’s realistic. And then if you realize you can’t speak or hear anything, you can deduce that you were distracted. Getting notified is really dumb I’m with you on that.</p>
