    <title>Hunter Passive: Retribution</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hunter-passive-retribution/9559</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was brought up to trial twice on the same day. The first time the prince accused first, but was pardoned, the second time the possessor was first to accuse. When executed, the prince was targeted by Retribution and killed.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
From the description it says &quot;Kills your accuser&quot; So I&#39;m under the impression that means the first to bring forth the accusation, yet the prince died instead of the possessor who was the one who started that particular trial.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Be Hunter, be brought to trial twice in one day by separate accusers.
#### Comments:
Just curious if this is actually how it&#39;s supposed to work, or if it&#39;s some random thing where it just targets by RNG which is kinda awful, especially for the late game situation this happened in.</description>

            <p>I think it should have gone to the Reaper.</p>
<p>I’m not to certain myself. We once did the same thing and we voted up a member of the BD, pardoned them and then another person accussed them, and they were member of the Unseen. Unseen member was killed.</p>
<p>Maybe a bug?</p>
