            <p>Reaper or it draws.</p>
<p>That one is a bit of a mind game, but not by much.  MM has to go assassin to be able to kill, but Reaper can safely just hit MM for a few nights and try to bait the attack and then kill the now-assassin while surviving.  If MM waits till last second he can force a draw, but if tries that he risks getting empower-reaped on one of those nights and losing.</p>
<p>That auto-resolve would probably having given it to Reaper, not sure never ran into that scenario, usually the Reaper has 3+ souls going into that last night and doesn’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>I disagree. Both can still win. MM can turn into assassin and he can poison possessor and possessor can then kill him. Advantage should go to possessor in this way and the harsher win rate for NK makes this even more of an obvious outcome.</p>

</aside>
<p>No.  MM can literally never win.  If he poisons then Possessor knows he can kill him and does so.</p>
<p>The only way MM wins by turning into an assassin is if the Possessor goes afk.</p>
<p>It ends in a draw, like it always has.</p>

            <p>Why would you give a pity win to the possessor?  Poss had more ways to get the MM killed by throwing him against a hunter or guard.</p>
<p>At some point along the way, each failed to take the steps necessary to get the rival death immune character killed.  It should be a draw.</p>

            <p>I’d say less focus should go on “what action would they take”. as IMO when it comes down to a no one can kill unless the other does something to let them situation, a tie breaker based on your starting resources is reasonable. In this example the MM had 4 people trying to help him over the course of the game, and the possesor was always against the world.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes a draw is everyone loses in this game. If a winner can be picked, I would say the possesor did far better towards earning a win than the MM.</p>

            <p>If he’s dumb enough to become an assassin that can’t possibly kill the Possessor… sure.</p>
<p>I mean he could also lose by declaring he’s the MM on day 4 to the court, but I’m going to assume the MM isn’t throwing.</p>
