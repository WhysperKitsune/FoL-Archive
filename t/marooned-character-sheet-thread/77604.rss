<p>Name: Crawford West<br>
Age: 56<br>
Job before becoming a sailor: Butcher<br>
Backstory; Growing up the oldest of his four brothers, he was the one that had to do the most work around the house, especially downstairs in the families Butchery.  When he was sixteen his father died of a lung disease that wasnt caught fast enough. That left him and family to struggle to keep the local business and the house for a couple of years until Clawford got really used to it. Later down the line his brothers would move out one by one leaving him to not only deal with the butchery but his aging mother all by himself. He had no time to himself and had to either be cutting meat or helping his mother out. Two monthes prior to him becoming a sailor not only did his mother pass, but also did he lose the passion for butchery. He sold it to the bank, and put away his money to find a new passion, and he saw the sea as that next step.<br>
Appearance: Crawford is an overweight 5’11" man, He has a full grey beard, and soft blue eyes. He is mostly bald except for the sides and back of his head, and usually wears a cap to hide the baldness. He has many of scars on his hands from accidents throughout the years. Prefers blue and white type clothing</p>

Luckily his uncle had an in to this sailing group (will be more detailed as more is known about the group of sailors) and so he decided to go with them. Onboard the ship, he likes to make simple objects with the excess lumber in his free time as a way of relieving stress<br>
