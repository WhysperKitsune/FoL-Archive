    <title>Seeker (Rework)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/seeker-rework/62407</link>
    <description>This is my first suggestion here so don&#39;t kill me plz.

I&#39;ve realised just how Under-powered Seeker is &quot;Gaze&quot; is fine quite Under-powered, but it&#39;s pretty acceptable because Duchess also has it but I&#39;d like to see it buffed or something if it stays.
 I get cult are meant to be quite a bit weaker but classes like Apostle, Invoker and Ritualist are so much more useful then seeker right now.

Anyway here is my suggestion:

Seeker (Cult Investigative)
Passives
-None.

Day Ability
 Blood Line - Find out if someone has royal Blood. (2 uses) -Suggested by htm-

Night Ability 
Identify - Learn target players faction and class type. (3 uses) -Suggested by NuclearBurrito-
Stalk - Discover who a player targets, and who targets them. (2 uses)

I feel like Seeker Should be made pretty useful but have limited abilities, it&#39;s a shame how useless it is right now.

What do you think Please tell me why it&#39;s a good or bad idea I would love to hear feed back.
Also do you feel like &quot;Search&quot; Should have 2 or 3 uses? (Still debatable)

Edit:
1. Removed Expose for Blood Line
2. Removed Search for Identify (Seekers abilities in one.)</description>

            <p>Well as Princess you can easily get all of the info you need with Gaze.</p>
<p>As obs you can keep it up for a bit too but I guess it’s kinda like a converted Drunk in a cult game in that sense.</p>

            <p>[quote=“NuclearBurrito, post:11, topic:62407”]<br>
**Cult Investigative<br>
Observer would still be harder to fake due to it only having two uses but Observer is already powerful enough, it needs more classes for it to fake claim<br>
Sheriff/Pally are super easy to fake, but more risky because of having a high chance of two in game<br>
Princess, Using day claims, can be somewhat difficult but not as hard as Observer</p>

            <p>I also believe that it can work out really well with blood line</p>
<p>Is your target a bd killer? Blood line him and if he has royal blood he is prince confirmed.</p>

<p>Yup I agree</p>
<p>after thinking about it though having 3 seeker’s with probe might be a little OP so maybe it should be 2 uses for balance</p>

<p>Thanks, Just that seeker is pretty Useless compared to the other cult, Not sure what to replace “Expose” with it can be good while prince is alive, it could go without a day ability if this makes seeker “too over powered” or something better but a lot of Investigative’s lack day Abilities.</p>
<p>Probe was added to make it harder to find Nks. (Edit: in comparison to “Watch carefully”)</p>
<p>Duchess needs somewhat of a rework to be more useful but It’s got royal blood and Dark wisp to make it somewhat good (Seeker only would have royal from converting Princess)</p>
<p>The observer ability would make it so any Observer converts would be questioned, faking observer without having terrible Logs is extremely hard to pull off well, this somewhat solves it but you can’t get a easy ride because that ability is good to fake claim because it’s two uses only.</p>

            <p>This is my first suggestion here so don’t kill me plz.</p>
<p>I’ve realised just how Under-powered Seeker is “Gaze” is fine quite Under-powered, but it’s pretty acceptable because Duchess also has it but I’d like to see it buffed or something if it stays.<br>
I get cult are meant to be quite a bit weaker but classes like Apostle, Invoker and Ritualist are so much more useful then seeker right now.</p>
<p>Anyway here is my suggestion:</p>
<p>Seeker (Cult Investigative)<br>
Passives<br>
-None.</p>
<p>Day Ability<br>
Blood Line - Find out if someone has royal Blood. (2 uses) -Suggested by htm-</p>
<p>Night Ability<br>
Identify - Learn target players faction and class type. (3 uses) -Suggested by NuclearBurrito-<br>
Stalk - Discover who a player targets, and who targets them. (2 uses)</p>
<p>I feel like Seeker Should be made pretty useful but have limited abilities, it’s a shame how useless it is right now.</p>
<p>What do you think Please tell me why it’s a good or bad idea I would love to hear feed back.<br>
Also do you feel like “Search” Should have 2 or 3 uses? (Still debatable)</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removed Expose for Blood Line</li>
<li>Removed Search for Identify (Seekers abilities in one.)</li>
</ol>
