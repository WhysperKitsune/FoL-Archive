    <title>Please Rethink the King</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/please-rethink-the-king/40666</link>
    <description>Last time they neutered King&#39;s check abilities it turned games into horrible snoozefests. This time is no different and I&#39;ve lost all interest in the game. The game NEEDS a central information/investigative role like the one the old King had. It gave games a sense of direction that is sorely missing right now. Playing as something like Butler/Phys is even more boring than before since there&#39;s even less ways to gather information indirectly. 

Old King actually felt like a KING and it was fun getting control of the court. You actually had POWER and therefore people were dependent on you for information to some degree. Nobody really gives a shit about the new king.

I&#39;m really disappointed that the devs would try this failed implementation again and I wish they would STOP messing with things that are already working and listening to players who get butthurt when they get lynched as a neut because of a King check. At this point I&#39;m just praying more perfectly fine mechanics/classes don&#39;t get dumpstered.

Just my 2 cents. Will probably not view replies.</description>

            <p>Yeah</p>
<p>I just see the anti-Smart Pistol thing a lot, and although I can see where the idea comes from, my own experience facing Gen 10 pilots with the Smart Pistol has made it clear that they can still have plenty of skill lol</p>
<p>No clue about Titanfall 2 though. Lost interest in that one kinda quickly.</p>

            <p>Hey</p>
<p>Some of the most skilled Titanfall players I ever faced used that thing</p>
<p>Sure, they aren’t required to aim - except for using their secondary at range (usually the Wingman), which happens decently often, and the half of the game they spend in their titan.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s just a way to move your focus from aiming to positioning. Getting close enough to to lock on is a skillset of its own that gets very hard when facing skilled players. Mastering Titanfall’s movement system is way harder then mastering the ability to aim, to be quite honest.</p>

            <p>It’s already been stated that Allies isn’t coming back. And for the record, back in beta King didn’t have Allies and we were fine, so I’m sure everything will be fine now too.</p>
