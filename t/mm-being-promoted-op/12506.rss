    <title>MM being promoted OP</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mm-being-promoted-op/12506</link>
    <description>Was princess, assassin dies N1, I find someone as spec/invest. I claim sheriff and ask for class, he claims hunter, i get him killed, he is MM

now, A NEW MM HAS ARISEN.

Making it worthwhile for BD to NOT kill an evil is stupid. There should only be a promotion if MM dies at night.

To balance the removal of promotions from day executes of MM, MM would get some new day ability like distract but it also cancels vote.</description>

            <p>I had the exact same occurance as you just I was a bit more sensible.</p>
<p>I was princess, found a Special/Invest and asked for their role as Sheriff. They claimed Butler. I screamed:</p>
<p>“(Number) IS MASTERMIND, I AM PRINCESS AND THEY CLAIMED BUTLER WHEN THEY WERE SPECIAL/INVEST. KEEP THEM JAILED UNTIL N4 PRINCE THEN EXECUTE THEM.”</p>

            <p>I’m fine with mm promotions and with killing unseen as soon as you find them. Simply because of all the conversion immune classes and abilities that block visits/conversions. And when someone is promoted to mm that’s one less assassin until a successful conversion.</p>

            <p>“You should never be in a situation where it is better to NOT kill a confirmed evil”</p>
<p>I don’t think this is true, i feel like it adds depth and unseen literally have zero chance without mm that early, none at all.</p>
<p>Its sometimes worth it for mm to just try and get killed in the first few days if they are under the spotlight so that they have a higher chance of winning instead of dragging it out defending yourself.</p>
<p>In the situation stated above, for starters idk why a MM would pretend to be a unique class that is impossible to prove but i think the only way a MM would be outed in the first few days is by a princess and if it comes back as spec/invest then just wait til day 4 and if its any other type then it isn’t MM and you can kill them.</p>
<p>Vandalay, erm i don’t see how it applies to cult</p>

            <p>In a conversion game, it’s litterally almost never beneficial to kill a confirmed unseen/cult in the first 3 days. It litterally just raises how many people they can convert unless you are betting on them having either a bunch of failed conversions, or the BD consistantly getting 1 catch a day.</p>
