    <title>Ritualist Display Glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ritualist-display-glitch/51538</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
When you play as ritualist, N1 you always start with 3 teleportation and 3 Brotherhoods, but if you use teleportation that night it will be 1 teleportation and 3 brotherhoods for N2.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Its supposed to display 2 Teleportation and 3 Brotherhoods for N1
#### Steps to reproduce:
- Play as Ritualist
- Look at N1, night results
#### Comments:
This is just a display glitch that happens N1 for ritualist. Although I know N1 that ritualist has 2 teleportation and 3 brotherhoods I would not think new players would know the difference.</description>
