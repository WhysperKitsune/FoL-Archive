            <p>If it’s a ToL giveaway, might as well have it a ToL love story.<br>
Or that was my thought at least.</p>

            <p>Well, might as well enter for a friend.<br>
My school friend Cael is without a doubt a fool.<br>
Not quite as crazy, but still, he’s such a nice person who loves to joke around.</p>
<p>If I had to make a love story, it of course couldn’t be of him.<br>
But, I’d be happy to make a mini one.<br>
(The tiniest bit linking to Cael too as he loves his dogs and the wolf is a dog <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"> )</p>
<p><strong>The Hunter’s one love</strong><br>
In the surrounding forest of the castle Aidart, an ex-observer went on a stroll after having defeated the Unseen in their most recent attempt to take over, the assassin followed in pursuit, gathering information for their mastermind.</p>
<p>As the observer heard a twig breaking a fair distance behind him, he sped up, knowing that someone must’ve been following him, but this didn’t deter the assassin. The Assassin, a master of stealth, carried on, however a wolf jumped out to the observer. The observer had seen how the Hunters in the castle had their pets, so calmly the observer reached up his hand and petted the wolf.</p>
<p>After calming the beast down and playing with him, the assassin ran to attack the Wolf, trying to stop more hunters from foiling their plans. The observer stepped in his way, glaring at the assassin. The assassin stopped in his tracks, dragging the observer with him to his mastermind ‘Boss, this man just protected a wolf, what should I do with him’. The mastermind walked slowly out of the shadows ‘A hunter is always useful for us. I think we should have a deal for this man in the court when we arrive’</p>
<p>Two days later, the next attempt had been sprung by the Unseen. In the observer’s room, his friend the wolf had came back to visit him. The 2 days of training had taught him a lot with his new companion, he had learned to love nature and decided to look after his new allies as well as help Blue Dragon. This was the birth of a new hunter. A fanatic of nature who cared more than before~ The mastermind had not forgotten about this man and decided to quickly recruit him for their cause. Quickly promoted to the Poacher, the once observer had only one request ‘Don’t kill my companions, especially my wolf. They’re the loves of my life. Learn to love nature and nature will love you’</p>
<p>The conquest had ended with the unseen having just taken over the throne. The Unseen now adapted a new attitude that the love of nature is just as important as power. The Poacher’s ex companions met up with him when he stayed away from the Mastermind and original assassin, hugging and protect them with his life. ‘I love you both for being there for me. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to see you as often, stay safe, you’ll be fine’.</p>
<p>This is the end of the Hunter’s one love~</p>
