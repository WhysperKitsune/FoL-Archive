    <title>The First Game of 2018 (WePick)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-first-game-of-2018-wepick/31631</link>
    <description># DISCLAIMER: This game is only guaranteed to be the first of the year by start time in UTC-5.

**Role List:**
- [color=green]**Town**[/color]
- [color=green]**Town**[/color]
- [color=green]**Town**[/color]
- [color=green]**Town**[/color]
- [color=green]**Town**[/color]
- [color=red]**Mafia**[/color]
- [color=red]**Mafia**[/color]

**Fine Print:** &lt;small&gt;
- No gamethrowing/inactivity/harassment. I will not define these terms, and if I deem you are breaking them you will be removed from the game. Just be smart.
- There will be a N0. Some roles may act during this time.
- Scum will be given fakeclaims.
- Lynches are compulsive and plurality-based. Majority is in effect as well.
- There will be no night kills of any kind.
- You may send in night actions during the day.
- Days will be 36 hours.
- Nights will last as long as they need for each player to submit an action and me to process it, but no longer than 24 hours.
- Mafia will have a daychat.
- The difference between UPick and WePick is that your role name influences ability flavor, not what abilities you have. &lt;/small&gt;

**Players:**
- @NuclearBurrito 
- @Hippolytus 
- @Wolfy  
- @Simon 
- @Ami 
- @Marluxion 
- @DinoMask</description>

            <p>True. I had thought for sure you were the paranoid cop and Noz was insane, but that would definately change things if you checked wolfie town.</p>

            <p>And I feel like with the frames/tailors this could go either way. You could make the sane cop think they are insane with one good frame + lynch. Got lucky sniping hippo on a night he didn’t tailor.</p>

            <p>You “role” a dice and if you get a 4 you get a TOWN result as it has 4 letters and if you get a 5 you get a MAFIA result as it has 5 letters. If you “role” a 6 you are told your previous result again, and if you get a one you receive a free VHS copy of 101 Dalmations. If you “role” a 3 you are immediately “freed” from the forums which is essentially banned, and you can not return for a number of days which is dependent upon the number of people currently alive * days since the last Chinese New year + number of good DC films. I can’t remember exactly what happens if you “role” a 2 but I think it rhymes with Seppuku at one point.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer to have a parity cop but many people including orange prefer role cops as they add a more random element.</p>
