    <title>Assa -&gt; MM can be redirected</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assa-mm-can-be-redirected/63605</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
A Court Wizard managed to redirect me from a convertable to an unconvertable target.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Mastermind should be immune to redirection.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Have Mastermind die before Day4 while being Assassin. Become Mastermind. Try to convert a target that is being swapped by a Court Wizard. Get redirected even though you should be immune to it.

#### Comments: None.</description>
