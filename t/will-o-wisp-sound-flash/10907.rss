    <title>Will-o-Wisp Sound/flash</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/will-o-wisp-sound-flash/10907</link>
    <description>Can we make Will-o-Wisps more noticeable , had a few game recently where princess have claimed will-o wisp to someone and that person has denied it . ( edit : both people turned out to be same faction etc )

Either the wisp is broken or people are not seeing it . 

I am thinking maybe a bright white/yellow flash at end of turn maybe ( similar to heal green or red dead )  to show you have been wisped  and maybe also a sound effect .</description>
