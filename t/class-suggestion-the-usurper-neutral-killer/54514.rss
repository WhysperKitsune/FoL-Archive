    <title>(Class Suggestion) The Usurper (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-usurper-neutral-killer/54514</link>
    <description>Because we all love a Neutral Killer with Royal Blood to shake things up.

**The Usurper (Neutral/Killer)**

**Passives:** *The core idea*

**Royal Blood:** Exactly what it says on the tin.

**Regicidal Rage:** Detects all classes with Royal Blood. Does not identify them.
*You&#39;ll see a marker similar to Scorned&#39;s or Mercenary&#39;s marker indicating all the Royal Blood members.*

**Day abilities:** *Choose 0-2 toppings of your choice.*

**Royal Twin:** Exactly the same as Noble Twin. 2 uses. *Helps voting King out.*

**Dungeon spies:** Hear the conversation between the Prince and his jailed target tonight. 2 uses. Does not prevent from using night abilities. *Suggested by yms, but I feel like this is an odd one out. It helps to find legitimate logs that you can use to craft your own logs when stepping up for the vote.

**Lock up:** Jail selected person. They will think the Prince jailed them. Can not jail the Prince or his target. 1 use. *I&#39;ve always wanted to have a &quot;fake prince&quot; class. I&#39;m not sure if this ability is too strong, but I feel with the current Prince meta, you need a slight deterrent on their legitimacy.*

**Night abilities:** *Pretty much set in stone.*

**Royal killer:** Kill a player.

**Public execution:** Kill a player. This will be announced as if the King ordered their execution. 1 use. Not usable until Night 2. The announcement will override Order Execution&#39;s announcement, but Order Execution will still kill the target.

Comments:
What I had in mind when creating this was that I wanted a neutral killer with Royal Blood in hopes of becoming a Psycho King. While becoming Psycho King is strong, it needs to be balanced with a weak early game. This creates a &quot;minigame&quot;, where your first goal is to become the King, and then you need to kill everyone. While they have no good killing abilities and are as counterable as an Assassin, their strength relies on social manipulation of the royal family. The goal is to make the King more unreliable, to the point of them getting executed or killed.

What I wanted to create is an unique environment, where the Usurper aims to kill the royal family and become the new king by default. I theorized multiple things, including knowing all classes, but I eventually settled for a Royal Blood detection. One joke idea was to make him a vampire and earn his royal blood by drinking it from the royal blood targets (totally how that works). I feel like this is the best choice: while they lack in killing abilities, the passive makes them a smart killer.</description>

            <p>Yeah, my point was to have one or two of those abilities, depending on which is deemed the most balanced set.</p>
