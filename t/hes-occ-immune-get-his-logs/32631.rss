    <description>Ok seriously this needs to stop. Here is a list of people that will appear OCC immune

Hunter
Butler
Drunk
Prince

Servant
Alchaholic
Poacher

Possessor
Fool
Scorned
Sorcerer

Anyone occed 3 times
Anyone CW uses magic barrier on.

Of those 7 evils: 3 of them are converts of the BD equivalents which generally don&#39;t last very long. NONE of them are cult. 2 of them are neuts that have easier ways to spot. 1 of them is an NK that has a goddam hard-counter already. And 1 of them is the Possessor who will just jump immediately most likely.

Of the BD 1 of them is the FUCKING PRINCE and the other 3 are super easy to prove.

The assassin is almost never occ immune
The Mastermind will never appear occ immune
The cult members will almost never appear occ immune
The fool shouldn&#39;t be lynched anyway

the moral of the story is:

# Occ Immunity is not suspicious and is not grounds for accusation unless they claimed a role that isn&#39;t occ immune!</description>

            <p>I agree whole with this post. I don’t want to spam threads so I will post a similar topic here: Whispering is not susp</p>
<p>-Evils have night chat, good don’t except through psychic (which doesn’t necessarily allow you to talk with he one you want) and prince (who must occ you and again might not be the person you want to talk to)<br>
-The main culprits of whisper are:</p>
<p>Mercs to/from target<br>
alchs to/from the person they are agreeing to heal<br>
Princess to/from the person they investigated<br>
Butler to/from the person they occ’d who was immune<br>
King</p>
<p>Merc is usually on BD due to sheer quantity, alchs usually side BD, princess is good and MM (princess most prevalent fake claimer) doesn’t want to put themself out there (though they might want to get exact class because examine is fallible with class type changes), butler is good and most occ immune players are good, and king… well it is susp only if he initiated it, and even then remember good king sometimes whispers people he finds BD</p>

            <p>But that’s like the entire point of the Psychic! It would backfire too. The Psychic will just push you in the day and then you are DEFINITELY revealing to Unseen. Plus you are also making it easier on Unseen who don’t have a good claim yet.</p>
<p>Just tell the Psychic not to out you in their will if you are Prince. Otherwise you aren’t that important 9 times out of 10.</p>
<p>Basically the fact that psychics can act like Princes is what makes them good early game. Late game they have other uses.</p>
<p>And sure they may be convertable but there is 2 thing’s that make that not a problem.</p>
<p>1: If there is a second Psychic you can use the dead chat to share names. If you do then if one of you is converted the other will out them.</p>
<p>2: If there is a DK then they can check to see if the Psychic is still BD and kill him if he isn’t.</p>

<p>Very much agree.  Butler/drunks: stop outting the prince.  That is the psychic’s job.</p>

<p>God, this is so true.</p>
<p>Psychics think they’re Princes these days.  Then they out everyone in their logs or get converted.</p>
<p>I rarely tell them anything any more.</p>
