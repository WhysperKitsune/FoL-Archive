<p>As Priscilla entered the kitchen the nearly deafening noise only bothered her a smidge. Today, she had some really juicy gossip!<br>
‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúNo! She <em>didn‚Äôt</em>!‚Äù<br>
The snippets of conversation reached Priscilla‚Äôs ears but today she had to remain focused. Quickly spotting Emily Priscilla made a beeline for her.<br>
‚ÄúAs I was saying, Elizabeth, the royal prince is clearly the best choice, not that good for nothing drunk that the King calls‚Ä¶‚Äù Emily had seen Priscilla and her dazzling sea blue eyes shone with excitement.<br>
‚ÄúWell Prissy? Did you get it?‚Äù Emily whispered so audibly that she might as well have talked out loud.<br>
‚Äú<em>Be Quiet</em>!‚Äù Priscilla admonished. ‚ÄúThe last thing we need is for some little bird to warn someone.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúAnd what do I care?‚Äù Emily stated indignantly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid! Those assassination stories are only to scare the young children.‚Äù<br>
Priscilla sighed deeply but held her tongue. She had something much more important to discuss.<br>
‚ÄúJust come with me will you?‚Äù<br>
Priscilla dragged Emily away from the work rooms and down numerous flights of stairs. She stopped, leaving Emily gulping for air and knocked softly a door. Priscilla pushed the door open and rushed to a small box sitting on a dusty table. Emily nearly lost her breath again.<br>
‚ÄúYou did get it!‚Äù she exclaimed running over beside Prisilla. Her face was shocked when Priscilla held out the nine inch long, bloody knife.<br>
‚ÄúWhat is that thing?‚Äù Emily, clearly startled questioned.‚ÄúI thought you were only going to get proof that Lady Alice and the Prince are in love.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I was going to do, until I found the knife in Lady Alice‚Äôs wardrobe.‚Äù Priscilla was talking so high she was almost squealing.<br>
‚ÄúBut why grab, this?‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see Emily?‚Äù Priscilla grabbed Emily by the shoulders and shook her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see? We have the proof that Lady Alice murdered Sir Derek!‚Äù<br>
Emily was still hesitant. "How is that Proof? What if the killer put the knife there to frame her.<br>
Priscilla only looked more pleased. ‚ÄúI was also talking to her. She visited Sir Derek the night he died!‚Äù<br>
Emily, who up until this point had barely believed in the assassination rumors, began to feel afraid. "We have to get this information to the King right away. I don‚Äôt fancy sticking around here much longer.<br>
Ignoring her friends panicked state Priscilla grinned. "You know what Em? We just might be promoted to Head Housekeeper for this. Emily smiled back but still felt uneasy. She just prayed that nobody had overheard them.</p>
<p>Elizabeth the Handmaiden had heard it all. After their abrupt and rude departure, she had made a point of following them. Indeed she was glad she did. The only thing left was to report the foolish girls to her superiors and wait.</p>
