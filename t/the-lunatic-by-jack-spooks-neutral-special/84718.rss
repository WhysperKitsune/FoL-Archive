    <description>**The Lunatic** | Neutral Special (Unique)

Originally a normal and sane member of the court, you began sensing dark remnants of Adiart’s tragic past, reliving all the most terrible events that have occurred here. In the beginning, you were able to control the visions, resist the intrusions and tempting whispers of those shadows that lurk the grounds, but eventually, you succumbed to their presence.

**Madness (Passive) –** You can not speak a coherent sentence, only able to mutter a single word at a time before your mind slips away.

**Clarity (Day) –** You gain temporary control over your madness and become able to speak for (the rest of the day/x seconds maybe), additionally causes you to become death immune for the night – 2 uses, usable day 1

**Descent (Day)** – Cause every member of the court who is afflicted with madness (applied by **Torment** ) to fall into true madness for the rest of the day, being unable to speak even a single word – 1 use, unusable for the first (10/x seconds) of the day

**Torment (Night)** – Visit target, harassing them with your ramblings, and inflicting them with minor madness for the rest of the game, reducing their words/message to three – inf uses, visit is preventable by knight defends, merc and king SG, etc… able to target the king

**Depravity (Night) –** Cause all members of the court afflicted with madness to visit a random unafflicted member of the court – 1 use, bypasses occupy immune, grants Lunatic Occupy/Redirect immunity and Death Immunity for the night

*You win if all current surviving members of the court are inflicted with madness.*</description>

            <p>Doing it instantly would not be hard especially if you have a message copied like you said, and no if you’re inflicting madness you would not be caught by day 3 at the latest. There is no real point other than to just disrupt players like a fool would, just more gameplay than I got exed gg. Also I didn’t make the class as an entirely serious suggestion just an idea.</p>
