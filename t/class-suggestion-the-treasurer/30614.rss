    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Treasurer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-treasurer/30614</link>
    <description>[Introduction] This is just a class I thought of when I was about to go to sleep. All ideas are changable since lets be honest, this class will probably either help BD or out some potential neutrals/unseen.

[Faction] Blue Dragon
[Class Type] Investigative
[Passive 1] Dutiful: Immune to occupation at night.

[Day Ability 1] Usurp(1 Use): Put **Four** votes on the current King instantly. The court will see “The Treasurer has accused the King of invalid usage of funds.” Does not work when King is immune to voting.

[Day Ability 2] Invite(4 Uses): Send a Player an invite to the treasury. They can accept or deny the invite. If accepted, all visits to the player and the Treasurer will be prevented and they can communicate privately. The player invited will be occupied, bypassing any immunities to occuptation they may have.  (The person who was invited can see who the Treasurer is). The Prince will automatically decline any invites to the treasury. 

[Night Ability 1] Record-Keeping(Infinite Uses): Not usable when in treasury. The Treasurer will check a person and see if they have any accounts or records with the kingdom. If they are Neutral/Cult/Unseen at the start of game and have not been invited to the treasury, the notification will show up as “You looked for records concerning (#) but was unable to find any.” If they are a member of the Blue Dragon, Cult/Unseen convert or the Mastermind(Even after n3) then the notification will show up as “You found records concerning (#).” If the member has the passive “Royal Blood” no matter the class the notification would be “You found a significant amount of records concerning (#). They must be a royal!” 

[Night Ability 2] Self Reflection (2 Usages)
The Treasurer lock themselves into the treasury alone to recollect their thoughts. While inside, all visits to them will be prevented. If the Treasurer uses this ability twice, they will start to recieve incorrect data when using Night Ability 1 and will also lose their “Dutiful” passive. 

[Win Condition] Same as BD</description>

<p>Maybe like put 3 anonymous votes on the king along with you can vote on them. Insta trial doesn’t seem fair</p>

            <p>Yeah, I might just add a new ability that may or may not be powerful since I nerfed it pretty badly. But personally, at this point I think NKs would definitely be fine with this in the court. I realized how stupid this class is because it legitimately checks records and can only find neutrals and starter evils. The Treasurer can help BD with some suspicious characters but it definitely needs a buff. The buff would most likely be something related to the King since the Treasurer was originally ANTI-King.</p>

            <p>Alright, thanks man. Personally, I dont even like my own classes but people say that I should just release them. To me, all my classes have so many holes in them and this class in particular seems like a MM-Killer. Its basically instantly able to out them as MM if they claim Alch or Princess. I might have to make it so they dont detect converts or something to nerf it.</p>

            <p>But I do feel like some neutrals do need to be immune to the record keeping because with princess this can easily get some NK’s hanged instantly.</p>

            <p>Well this one is debatable. If you want to buff the Treasurer, yes. If you want to make it feel weaker then no. I would lean more to a no though.</p>

            <p>Oh thanks for the catch. Personally, I would believe Mastermind would just be categorized as a normal BD even after they are suspicious since they technically look like a normal BD to a Sheriff which would mean the Mastermind probably acted as a BD for a while.</p>

            <p>Blue Dragon Investigative. Sorry forgot to put it on there and its win condition is same as most other BD.</p>
<p>If people like it more as a Neutral, thats fine too. It really doesnt even matter to me. I can also see people saying this should be support <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/woman_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":woman_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":woman_shrugging:"></p>
<p>Theoretically if I was to remove Passive 2, the Treasurer would become the Insider and could permanently trap people in the treasury. Players who are trapped appear dead two mornings later but no log nor class is provided to the court. The class type would change to Offensive which would be able to out them as converted later.</p>

            <p>[Introduction] This is just a class I thought of when I was about to go to sleep. All ideas are changable since lets be honest, this class will probably either help BD or out some potential neutrals/unseen.</p>
<p>[Faction] Blue Dragon<br>
[Class Type] Investigative<br>
[Passive 1] Dutiful: Immune to occupation at night.</p>
<p>[Day Ability 1] Usurp(1 Use): Put <strong>Four</strong> votes on the current King instantly. The court will see “The Treasurer has accused the King of invalid usage of funds.” Does not work when King is immune to voting.</p>
<p>[Day Ability 2] Invite(4 Uses): Send a Player an invite to the treasury. They can accept or deny the invite. If accepted, all visits to the player and the Treasurer will be prevented and they can communicate privately. The player invited will be occupied, bypassing any immunities to occuptation they may have.  (The person who was invited can see who the Treasurer is). The Prince will automatically decline any invites to the treasury.</p>
<p>[Night Ability 1] Record-Keeping(Infinite Uses): Not usable when in treasury. The Treasurer will check a person and see if they have any accounts or records with the kingdom. If they are Neutral/Cult/Unseen at the start of game and have not been invited to the treasury, the notification will show up as “You looked for records concerning (#) but was unable to find any.” If they are a member of the Blue Dragon, Cult/Unseen convert or the Mastermind(Even after n3) then the notification will show up as “You found records concerning (#).” If the member has the passive “Royal Blood” no matter the class the notification would be “You found a significant amount of records concerning (#). They must be a royal!”</p>
<p>[Night Ability 2] Self Reflection (2 Usages)<br>
The Treasurer lock themselves into the treasury alone to recollect their thoughts. While inside, all visits to them will be prevented. If the Treasurer uses this ability twice, they will start to recieve incorrect data when using Night Ability 1 and will also lose their “Dutiful” passive.</p>
<p>[Win Condition] Same as BD</p>
