    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-destroyer-of-noobs/72851</link>
    <description>Neutral killer class

Will of a thousand dragons (Passive) - Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities. Immune to bleeding, poison, and death at night.

Greasy Body (Passive) - Your body is so damn greasy that when you are accused of treason you just do a slip n slide maneuver, crushing the king under you. By asserting your male dominance, you become the new king.

Intimidate (Day) - Gaze with the fury of 2000 anime waifu pillows into your target&#39;s soul, killing them instantly.

*Teleports behind you* (Night) - Kill a player and anybody visiting them. Bypasses death immunity and cannot be healed.

Waifu pillow (Night) - Kill anybody visiting you and anybody visiting them in defense of your Waifu.

Lore

Donning his fingerless gloves, fedora, and leather jacket, he rides into battle. Unrivaled in combat ability, this katana wielding swordsman hails from the land of Aspergeus. Endlessly devoted to his loving Waifu, he seeks to kill all that would oppose him in his quest to marry a [REDACTED] - soaked anime girl pillow case. (Which happens to be pretty much everybody with atleast an ounce of self-respect.)</description>
