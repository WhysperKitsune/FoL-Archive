            <p>The thing is, I did ask around before posting this class. It appears everyone thought that if it gave the night result of the person targeted, it would be way too strong. So, I limited it to “unexpected notifications”.</p>

            <p>I feel that this class is boring and would not really contribute any known information to the BD. Most people usually do not get a notification unless it’s from their own abilities and receiving that this person had nothing happen to them just seems boring. Although this is a class to create claim space it just seems like a rushed in class or a class just to add to the amount of classes.  I mean watchful eyes is a good counterto poison and bleed but that counter just seems unnecessary it just weakens the cult/Unseen which is not really needed. It may confirm a sheriff, alch, or butler. A,so I feel that the Unseen class needs a buff because usually the Unseen converts are much stronger. Maybe if you include their night ability notification it would be better for the Unseen convert.</p>

            <p>This could work out! Say both the Noble and Spy have snoop then it leaves more claiming space for the Apostle. But snoop should go back the 2 or else it’s not that useful. Say someone has bad logs or no logs…</p>

            <p>Actually, I don’t think that would be the case. With the sheer amount of day abilities in the game, abilities you usually use at different points of the day, it shouldn’t be <strong>that</strong> easy to detect poison or bleed <strong>and</strong> point it out without being suspected. Because Spy can be converted, it’s not like you’ll always be trusted. You could be Scorned faking Spy to get a target exed; or you could be converted Spy trying to get a BD exed.</p>
<p>So in the end, no matter the “meta”, I don’t think Spy would cause the Unseen to stop poisoning and the Cult to stop bleeding.</p>

<p>Even Stoneskin Potion triggers Watchful Eyes.</p>

</aside>
<p>oh I didn’t say that there were no abilities that don’t trigger Watchful eyes. I was saying poison/bleeding is suicide if there’s a reasonable chance that watchful eyes are up, as the victim is going to announce it, and the spy is really quick going to put the 2 together if he’s watching.</p>
<p>Most likely being combined with a quick alert meta. (IE the second you are poisoned, type p and enter) so that a spy can be closer on timing and not be confused if the stoneskin 10 seconds ago was the poison but took 10 seconds to type poisoned, or if it was the ability used half a second ago.</p>

            <p>I know that’s kind of the main point… but I’d say an exception would need to be made for poison/bleed in watchful eyes. I don’t like the idea of a solid insta hard counter to a major evil faction ability.</p>

            <p>I assume you want Snoop to be removed from noble?</p>
<p>I’d make Snoop 1 use on spy so he can’t use it to confirm and accuse in the same game. Having it be 1 use on informant is optional.</p>
