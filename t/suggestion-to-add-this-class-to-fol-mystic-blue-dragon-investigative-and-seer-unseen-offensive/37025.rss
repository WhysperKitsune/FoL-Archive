It&#39;s complexity won&#39;t be a problem for people on the forums, but if there is any new faction I might need to make a new class for it. Just point it out if anything needs adding. Would love for this to be tested into the next FOL game or something. Please post feedback on things that would affect FOL here instead of the actual thread, as that was suggested to be apart in the actual game.</description>
