    <title>Logbook glitch (why does title need 15 characters making it unnecessarily long)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/logbook-glitch-why-does-title-need-15-characters-making-it-unnecessarily-long/76059</link>
    <description>#### What happened? Opened logbook, got something interesting. Had to leave and reconnect since it wouldn&#39;t go away

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? Just should show my logbook like normal

#### Steps to reproduce: If i recall correctly, someone was getting upped and I got bled that day or was bleeding (can&#39;t remember which)

#### Comments:
