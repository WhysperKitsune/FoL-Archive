<p>This has been my pet project for a while now and I’m looking for feedback + new ideas for more classes that can be added. I’ve adjusted some BD classes (mainly buffs) to allow for more interesting (but complicated) gameplay. Classes are designed to be more fun to play overall. I’ve aimed for a little confirmability as possible.<br>
I definitely need more ideas for Neutrals and Neutral Killers I think.</p>
<p>The Idea is for about 24 people, but I guess this game could have more players depending on interest. Infected Class Cap for 24 people is 5.</p>
<p>The ‘Main’ Ability of a class is the first night ability listed.</p>
<p>Big Shoutout to <a class="mention" href="../../../u/alice.html">@Alice</a> for all the ideas.</p>
