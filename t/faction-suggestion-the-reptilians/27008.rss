    <title>[Faction suggestion] The Reptilians</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-reptilians/27008</link>
    <description>&quot;The Reptilians&quot; is a faction that can become very powerful but has a slow start. Reptilians are rewarded for being patient, but being too greedy could cost them the game. The converted reptilian classes are weak at first, but they can evolve to become more powerful, at the cost of skipping their night action.
&quot;The Reptilians&quot; is a set of 12 classes and 1 BD investigative that only appears in reptilian games.

&gt;_Note: Reptilian games will only start with a matriarch and one random reptilian. If a reptilian successfully evolves, all their limited use abilities will be recharged._
&gt;_Note 2: Reptilian&#39;s poison is called &quot;Venom&quot; and has a different notification than Nightshade&quot;. The Biologist can only heal venom or eggs._

**SPECIAL**
&gt;[color=green]**The Matriarch**[/color]
&gt;Reptilian, Unique, Special
&gt;**Passive: Maternal Love**
&gt;The matriarch cannot be occupied while attempting to hatch her eggs. If the starting matriarch dies within the first 3 nights, all eggs will hatch automatically.
&gt;**Night Ability 1: Lay Egg**
&gt;Lay an egg inside someone.They will not be notified about it. Can only have a maximum of 3 eggs at the same time. Unlimited uses. 
_(Players with eggs inside will appear as reptilians when faction checked. The egg will be destroyed if the target is healed. Laying an egg counts as an attack for Knight&#39;s sacrifice and Hunter&#39;s bear)._
&gt;**Night Ability 2: Hatch**
&gt;Hatch all eggs, turning the players into Reptilians. If a player is conversion immune they will die instead. There can only be a maximum of 2 more reptilians at a time (3 reptilians total with the matriarch), if a player would be converted while having the maximum number of reptilians, said player dies instead.

            <p>Changed some of the class and ability names, I’d like to thank discord user “Alchemist Chocolate” for name suggestions.</p>
<p>Also I have a question: Should I change the name to “Reptillians” or leave it as Lizards?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok, I changed some of the classes again. Tier 2 classes now combine the night abilities of both Tier 1 classes into a single one instead of replacing one with the other. Also, since lizards have the potential to poison more than other factions the biologist can now also heal their venom at the cost of his limited use ability. I also changed the Serpent’s night ability since the old one was more of a support ability instead of a killer one.</p>

            <p>Ok, after reading your suggestions I decided to add two extra classes “The Serpent” and “The Frog” so social and killer classes convert to something different. Both “The Snake” and “The Serpent” evolve to “The Viper”, and both “The Frog” and “The Gecko” evolve to “The Chameleon”.</p>
<p>Please give me your feedback! (Also if anyone could tell me how to change text color/size that would be great).</p>

            <p>Alternatively you could also have only one “evolved” form and still add social/killer sets. Social really needs its own conversion, because it is super easy to tell when a social has been converted. Both Noble and Psychic can instantly prove themselves during the day. Kudos for the whole idea though. It’s a very unique and interesting mechanic.</p>

            <p>Cobra is a combination of both offensive and killer classes, as well as Basilisk is a combination of both social and investigative. I think it would be better this way because if there was one class for each type that would be around 16 lizard classes if you take the evolved classes into account, which could be overwhelming.</p>

            <p>“The Reptilians” is a faction that can become very powerful but has a slow start. Reptilians are rewarded for being patient, but being too greedy could cost them the game. The converted reptilian classes are weak at first, but they can evolve to become more powerful, at the cost of skipping their night action.<br>
“The Reptilians” is a set of 12 classes and 1 BD investigative that only appears in reptilian games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: Reptilian games will only start with a matriarch and one random reptilian. If a reptilian successfully evolves, all their limited use abilities will be recharged.</em><br>
<em>Note 2: Reptilian’s poison is called “Venom” and has a different notification than Nightshade". The Biologist can only heal venom or eggs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SPECIAL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="green"><strong>The Matriarch</strong></font><br>

<strong>Night Ability 1: Lay Egg</strong><br>
Lay an egg inside someone.They will not be notified about it. Can only have a maximum of 3 eggs at the same time. Unlimited uses.<br>
<em>(Players with eggs inside will appear as reptilians when faction checked. The egg will be destroyed if the target is healed. Laying an egg counts as an attack for Knight’s sacrifice and Hunter’s bear).</em><br>
<strong>Night Ability 2: Hatch</strong><br>
Hatch all eggs, turning the players into Reptilians. If a player is conversion immune they will die instead. There can only be a maximum of 2 more reptilians at a time (3 reptilians total with the matriarch), if a player would be converted while having the maximum number of reptilians, said player dies instead. Unlimited uses. (This ability doesn’t count as a visit).</p>
