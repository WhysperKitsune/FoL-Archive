###  &quot;Expect the worst out of everything.&quot;
#### Hosted by @Zone_Q11, reviewed by @eevee and @DatBird
---
# Rules:

1. Follow the [Global Forum Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926).
2. Post a minimum of 10 smart and game related posts per Day Phase.
3. Do not forget to leave a vote at the end of the day. (Unless Majority was activated.)
4. Ignore either of the former two rules, and you will be given a warning.
5. Gather three warnings, and you will be subbed out or modkilled immediately.
6. I can and might have to add and/or remove rules in the future. Except GFR.
Let&#39;s just hope that I won&#39;t have to use this rule.


# Sample role PMs:
[details=&quot;Red Herring Role Samples&quot;]
&gt; # You are Tilgarial, a [color=pink]Neutral Jester[/color]
&gt; ![](https://forum.novelupdates.com/data/avatars/l/108/108113.jpg?1587126240)
&gt;
&gt; You are a Jester without a BPV.
&gt; After you get lynched, you can kill a living player and nobody can do anything about it.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get lynched. It&#39;s that easy. Don&#39;t overthink stuff.*

&gt; # You are NZPIEFACE, a [color=000099]Serial Killer[/color]
&gt; ![](https://forum.novelupdates.com/data/avatars/l/16/16663.jpg?1508633681)
&gt;
&gt; You are a Serial Killer who can kill a player each Night Phase.
&gt; You probably hate randing as the role who needs to kill everyone, without anything else to help you.
&gt; So I&#39;ll throw you a bone and make your work easier.
&gt;
&gt; *Kill exactly one Mafia without revealing your role, and survive one night after you killed them. If you live past that night, you get to leave the game victoriously.*

&gt; # You are seriouslynope, a [color=lightyellow]`[REDACTED]`[/color]
&gt; ![](https://forum.novelupdates.com/data/avatars/l/25/25027.jpg?1514615626)
&gt;
&gt; ****Special Mechanic 1:****
&gt; Each night each player may decide to guess your identity.
&gt; If they are incorrect, they die bypassing all protections.
&gt; If they are correct, you die bypassing all protections and the guesser will get 1-Shot Day Vigilante Shot OR 1-Shot Strongman Cop Check for immediate use. (Their choice.)
&gt; In case of multiple correct guesses, the first winner will be picked.
&gt;
&gt; ****Special Mechanic 2:****
&gt; You know all members of the Mafia.
&gt;
&gt; ****Special Mechanic 3:****
&gt; Every Night, you will obtain the choice to be peeked as any role and alignment of your choice to all investigative roles. If you don&#39;t choose one, then it&#39;ll default to your last choice.
&gt;
&gt; ****Ability: `[REDACTED]`****
&gt; `[REDACTED]`
&gt;
&gt; *`[REDACTED]` By achieving victory, everyone will die and you will be the sole winner of the game.*
[/details]


# General Gameplay
* Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.
* There are no logs / last will mechanics.
* Self-votes are considered valid votes.
* Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios.
* All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.
* All actions must be submitted in your classcards.
* Flips will be shown after a player dies.
* The Mafia factional kill is NOT mandatory.
* The Mafia factional kill IS assigned. That is, a specific member of the Mafia must be chosen to perform the factional kill. If no member is selected, the last member who submitted a kill will be assumed to perform it.
* The Mafia will communicate through a private message.
* The game starts when the player list is fully filled.

# Gameplay
* The setup is closed with the exception of one role.
* [u]This is a bastard game.[/u]
* There is only 1 or 2 &quot;bastard elements&quot;, and everything else is a red herring.
* Lynches are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the lynch will be determined randomly among the players [u]outside the tie[/u].
* No Lynch is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In case No Lynch and a player are tied at the end of the day, No Lynch takes priority.
* There is at least one Neutral, and one Neutral&#39;s card is partially shown at the Red Herring Role Samples; it&#39;s the one with `[REDACTED]` on it.

# Limited Feedback™ Summary:
* Doctor healing: No
* Getting healed: No
* Roleblocked: No
* Redirected: No
* Transported: No
* Getting attacked: No
* Getting killed: Yes
* Investigative results: Yes
* Anything else: Probably No

            <p>Also if any of you wanted to know my intention wasn’t to kill the entire mafia team off.<br>
I decided that my first bus target would be PKR or Italy, and I settled on whichever one would look to be the best opportunity. I went after PKR, realised that he was getting cleared off of lolmeta so I went for Italy instead.</p>
<p>People then suddenly D2 decided to listen to my PKR ‘read’ and hung him. That’s two mafia down. Then D3 people lynched Ginger whom I didn’t really care about because my plan at that time was to have TrustworthyLiberal live. I then realised that TrustworthyLiberal wasn’t really doing anything so I gave them a perfectly viable claim of Town ‘Vengeful’ Bomb but ‘I’m gambler’ came into play</p>
<p>I had then to bullshit my way out of that one, which I did. However I knew at the time TrustworthyLiberal knew I was neutral. Unfortunately that came before I realised that they could use GreenCatKid’s ability for an extra vig and win the game. I was hoping that TrustworthyLiberal let me live because if they didn’t end the game and I died then TL would be obvious mafia (and therefore couldn’t afford to let me die)</p>
<p>So my plan was basically perfect except for the fact TrustworthyLiberal had an unfortunate dead-backup vig.</p>
