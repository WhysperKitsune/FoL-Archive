    <description>Hi there. Im Alan#7191

I think its time to make a thread about that &quot;Little things&quot; we need in the game to improve the experience.

**1- Premade logs and Death Notes**

We need an option to use our own Logs and Death notes with a simple click during the game. That would sabe a lot of time and would be a nice option.

**2- Spectator mode**

We need this for tournaments! not that much to say, we need a option to see our friends play!

**3- More Death Note colors**

Not that much to say about this one. We need colors.

**4- The King should have a different color in chat**

Maybe if the king has a yellow name instead of a blue one, it would be easy to know the King is talking and get leads from him.

**5- Using the Keyboard instead of Mouse option**

It would be amazing for me if abilities, logs, class card, private notes, psychic can be attached to a keyboard command. Could save some seconds :D

**6- Remove friends from friend list/chat with friends/etc**

Nothing to say here, we need this.

**7- More things in the shop (PLEASE)**

Boslof said they will add emotes, but I think is not enough. We need colors, Icons for the username, More armors and weapons, and Really expensive/rare items. 3000 gold is really cheap.</description>

<p>No different than people joining a game and then afking. They’d get reported for gamethrowing. 90% of this game is making decisions based on human speach. of which unless ibm engineers think it’s worth spending a year converting watson to. isn’t really likely to happen (and if someone could do something that advanced clicking squares with a mouse is trivial)</p>

</aside>
<p>death notes I’m in favor of, logs I’m not so sure. The big issue with logs is they have to be easy to fake. If real logs are instantanious and there’s any kind of reason for any delays or imperfections in fake notes, it adds a huge problem for evils</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>fully agree, I think there should be 2 forms of spectator modes</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>referee/recorder - for private games only, one person is designated as that position. This person can see all night chats, actual classes etc…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public spectators - this can join any games that are going on, but they do not see anything that isn’t publicly seen by all players. There cannot be any kind of advantage to spectating your own game.</p>
</li>

<p>Not sure how the game can differentiate from these keyboard commands and typing in normal chat. Maybe these can be bound to F1, F2, etc</p>

            <p>Would love if dead players are informed when they can no longer participate in any way (no death knights, physicians with reanimate, psychics, or reapers)</p>
<p>I like to stay on the off-chance I can help out even when it’s unlikely. If there’s literally zero I can do, id like to leave. But there’s no way to know.</p>
