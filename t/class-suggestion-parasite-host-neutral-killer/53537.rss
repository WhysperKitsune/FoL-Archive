    <title>[Class Suggestion] Parasite/Host (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-parasite-host-neutral-killer/53537</link>
    <description>Goal: Kill major factions
You exist in two forms: parasite and host. You start the game as the host. 

Host form:
Passive: Survive death once. (same as the inquisitor&#39;s one)
Day ability(Spread): Choose a target to infect with your parasite. You now exist as the Parasite and your original body will die tonight. (Twice)
Night ability: Attack someone(Twice)

Parasite form:
Passive: While inside a target, you can read his/her whispers, night chats and obtain night feedback. You can not affect your target&#39;s actions/abilities.
Passive: You and your target will survive death once but you die in two days in this form.
Night ability: Take control of your target and become the host.</description>
