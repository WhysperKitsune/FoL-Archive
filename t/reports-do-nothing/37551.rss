    <description># Hey Throners,

Lately a lot of people have been getting disheartened by the amount of Toxicity in games, this leads to a lot of people saying &quot;reports don&#39;t work&quot; or &quot;lol you won&#39;t get banned&quot; and yeah, it&#39;s not fun, and we understand that. So we&#39;re cracking down on Toxicity. Everyday, we sieve through a good amount of reports, and we&#39;ve rooted out a good amount of Toxic players. We don&#39;t usually ban on the first instance, however, but we do keep track of them. 

Just the other day, I personally saw to it to ban one of many Toxic players, and just to show you what can get you banned, I&#39;ll show you exactly what got them banned:

There is an old appeal you can view, to get an idea of what we see as Moderators:

# So the next time you see someone say the words: &quot;Reports do nothing&quot; you can redirect them here!</description>

            <p>Gonna get it over the weekend. (4 day weekend, I have plenty of time to get it.) I was torn between getting ToL or Hollow Knight 2 weeks ago ,and I got Hollow Knight(I feel kind of guilty over ignoring you guys and getting it, but it’s fun.) I don’t need a key, Marlux, but thanks for the offer. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/no_entry_sign.png?v=9" title=":no_entry_sign:" class="emoji" alt=":no_entry_sign:"><img src="/images/emoji/twitter/key.png?v=9" title=":key:" class="emoji" alt=":key:"></p>

            <p>I’m glad to hear this. I’m an avid player of this game (got it like 7 people to buy it) and a lady-person. For the most part I adore this amazingly weird and  witty community.  AAlthough I don’t enjoy all the frequent sexism,  I just roll most of it off.</p>
<p>However, I just got out of a 40 minute game of players who were constantly role-playing beating women /women being whores, the whole shebag and I just couldn’t have fun, I just wanted to leave from day one.</p>
<p>Am I obligated to stay in games that have untenable amounts of toxicity? Is there a way to report people without having to stay to the very bitter end?</p>

            <p>I personally have never experienced this toxicity of the community,Now of course I understand that some people are gamethrowers,trolls,or just all around toxic I mean the logs show it all.But if your really having a hard time playing this game then stop.I’ve stopped playing ToL a lot because of burnout.I would just play 1-3 games and maybe keep going if I was having a fun time.Another thing you can do if you run into a toxic player is wait a few seconds for them to join a lobby and then join a new one without the toxic player.I myself have been toxic before because we should all admit that we get frustrated at times.That said I don’t think this community is <em><strong>that</strong></em>  toxic.I could be wrong on this.</p>

            <p>Hey - I have found this community, on the whole, to be one of the most outstanding dev-to-players relationship in multiplayer games I’ve ever played. As far as toxicity goes, in my experience, <strong>most</strong> of the time, the worst toxicity is mild flaming or one person d1 saying “kill me please, hate this class.” Which sucks and is annoying, but that’s <strong>peanuts</strong> compared to something like LoL or Town of Salem. You do get the out-and-out racists or gamethrowers occasionally, but you just report and move on - it’s not as systemic as other multiplayer games due to the moderation and enforcement of punishments.</p>
<p>Get the game and friend me! My username is TinyDeer. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’m going back and forth from wanting to get the game to not getting it.<br>
I played other deception games though, and I see Bbiaglla’s point. Hardly anyone uses common sense while playing them, and journals are just there to put funny stuff in, not anything useful according to the communities. And if there is something useful, no one even acknowledges it.<br>
Also, when I said the community was good, I meant the forum’s.<br>

            <p>Agreed. All of my friends have stopped playing too. Rather play civ 6 and not worry about the idiots. No-one reads journals. That’s the biggest show of lazyness and not caring.</p>

            <p>Yeh its the biggest issue with these sort of games, you have to play with the stupids, the trolls, and the lazy.<br>
Yet you can not heavily moderate the game or else it will destroy it.</p>
<p>Hence why the forums are better to live on %% <em>waves</em></p>

            <p>This community is seriously bad and toxic. I had to stop playing  because it was actually affecting my attitude. Between the stupidity, non paying attention, and down right verbal assault, I snapped.  I would report the same person for the same thing every day I played with them and they were still playing before.i stopped. I still enjoy the forums, however.</p>

            <p>Awh neat, a report system! Gotta love em ^^<br>
Completely understand the difficulty that ToL have with their in-game moderation. We’ve had many years of doing the same thing, and you will constantly get some people saying you dont do enough, and another bunch of people saying you’re too harsh and abusive.<br>
You will also get people who will constantly push and test that boundary, searching for loopholes and causing trouble just at the boarder line.</p>
<p>We have near identical rules, with the addition of Fake Cheater treated as real. We had issues with particular people pretending they are cheating, to get what they want.</p>

            <p>I’ve been busy the past few months, but I’ll try to at some point.<br>
And I know those people were wrong. I was on the forum for a year, after all.</p>

            <p>I don’t actually have the game because of two reasons.<br>
A: I was too lazy to get it.<br>
B: I heard from many people that the community was more toxic than a nuclear fallout, and that the devs were doing nothing about it.<br>
I can see those people were wrong, and I will probably pick up the game sometime later. Keep up the good work!</p>

            <h1>Hey Throners,</h1>
<p>Lately a lot of people have been getting disheartened by the amount of Toxicity in games, this leads to a lot of people saying “reports don’t work” or “lol you won’t get banned” and yeah, it’s not fun, and we understand that. So we’re cracking down on Toxicity. Everyday, we sieve through a good amount of reports, and we’ve rooted out a good amount of Toxic players. We don’t usually ban on the first instance, however, but we do keep track of them.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I personally saw to it to ban one of many Toxic players, and just to show you what can get you banned, I’ll show you exactly what got them banned:</p>

<p>There is an old appeal you can view, to get an idea of what we see as Moderators:</p>

<h1>So the next time you see someone say the words: “Reports do nothing” you can redirect them here!</h1>
