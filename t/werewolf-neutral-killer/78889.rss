            <p>You could just allow multi target abilities. Since you select the class before any targets are chosen it would work just fine.</p>

            <p>The only killer class that isn’t unique is knight and knights guard isn’t that great of an ability, for offensive classes… It’s kind of confusing since debuach is multiple targets, but I guess if you use a drunk they can use hh instead, I’ll add that.</p>
