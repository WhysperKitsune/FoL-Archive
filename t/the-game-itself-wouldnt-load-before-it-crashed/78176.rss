    <title>The game itself wouldn&#39;t load before it crashed</title>

    <description>&gt; [color=red]*For better/faster support, try Discord: https://discord.gg/tol[/color]

What happened:
The game crashed on the little option box, before I even got to the main game, or click on anything.

What was SUPPOSED to happen:
It was supposed to run flawlessly without crashing

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Start the game.
2. Click either option on Steam&#39;s box.
3. Crash the game on the next box for no reason.</description>
