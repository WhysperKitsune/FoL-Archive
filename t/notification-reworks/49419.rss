    <description>Occupation:

* If you have no immunity: Same as now.
* If an occupation fails because you have immunity: Same as now.
* If you are immune, but the occupation bypasses it: &quot;You were occupied and it bypassed your immunity!&quot;
* Butler/Servant receives no feedback if they fail.

Redirection:

* If you are redirected, you will be told: &quot;Someone changed your target.&quot;
* If you are immune to the redirection, the notification will be the same.
* Drunk/Alcoholic receives no feedback if they fail (Drunk is still notified of attackers).

Being Killed:

* No need to know you were Reaped and Killed, or Possessed and Killed. If you get Reaped or Possessed, have it override the normal attack notification.

Mercenary:
* Remove Guard notification
* Contract should always succeed, and not show tell you that you were contracted.

Poison:
* Make all poison notifications: &quot;You were poisoned. You will die in one or two nights.

If anyone has any other notification that should be changed, just post them and I&#39;ll add them.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>You can stop a SPECIFIC person from killing them, but you cannot stop them from getting killed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is what Support is for. I never said they were the same.</p>
<p>If you are a Phys and you know a leader, you can prevent their death. If you are a Butler and somehow know the Assassin/CL, you can stop any kill they would perform.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is simply not the Butler’s job to get information on ANYBODY.</p>
<p>Tbh I find Smite a really weird ability that doesn’t fit. It would be better to put that on a Killer class I think. As for Hunter and Prince, killer is really just an overlay on any class.</p>
<p>This is what the types do:</p>
<p>Investigative: Discover Information<br>
Support: Protect allies.<br>
Offensive: Stop/screw up enemy actions.<br>
Social: Use Social mechanics to gain information<br>
Killer: Any of the above, but can also kill (Prince’s Imprison is a social, offensive, and support power, but he can kill which makes him a killer)<br>
Special: Other classes</p>
<p>The purpose of Offensive is why I think there should be very few occupy immune classes. It prevents them from taking action. I think Butler/Drunk would be a lot more effective if they could use their power on the MM.</p>
<p>Offensive=/=Support, but they’re not completely unalike. In general we should avoid too many cross type powers, as it makes them harder to categorize.</p>

            <p>However that still isn’t enough to justify it. After all If you wan’t to make sure your invest or leader survives (the definition of a support) then you can’t do that as butler. You can stop a SPECIFIC person from killing them, but you cannot stop them from getting killed. Since whats important is your high priority targets and not people in general that means that if the leader or invest dies it doesn’t matter how meany kills you stopped. However a phys or knight stops ALL kills to the target, this means you are supporting the person that actually needs it. Since Butler cannot do this he cannot support properly.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if he TECHNICALLY can support.</p>
<p>Paladin, can support, Hunter can support (Themselves), Prince can support, These classes are not support and supporting isn’t their job.</p>
<p>The point being that just because it is possible to do something doesn’t mean that the class works. It needs to be reliable too. And more importantly you need to actually know when you do it, otherwise you feel useless no matter how much you actually accomplished.</p>

            <p>Yeah, they get it in the way and stop kills and converts the target would perform.</p>
<p>While Phys stops attacks to a target.</p>
<p>The way they go about it is in reverse, but has the same end result. This is the difference between Support and Offensive. Other than that, they both stop kills.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There are 3 ways to have an impact early game (discounting stretch cases).</p>
<p>1: Leading - Hunter</p>
<p>2: Investigating - Butler, Drunk</p>
<p>3: Supporting - Phys, CW, Knight</p>
<p>While a class can be boring in spite of doing these they are required to be impactful early on. It is the reason why pure vote manipulation is bad and it is the reason why Butler and Drunk NEED the feedback.</p>

            <p>Knight is fine as is. The one thing I’d like to do with it is to steal Retribution from the Hunter.</p>
<p>Physician, CW, and Hunter still know little.</p>
<p>However, if someone is occupy immune, that is a HUGE hint.</p>

<p>As much as I sympathize with streamlining the game, I completely agree with this. Although it is a lot of information, it’s much more useful for a wider audience than a format in which you really have to understand the classes well.</p>

Maybe in a long time, where we have a ranked mode, this could be ok, but for now I am completely against it. I feel as if you guys only care about how to let evils have an easier time winning but aren’t paying much attention to anything else ATM(sorry, but it’s true :p).</p>

            <p>There’s a difference between “is capable of being misleading or false” and “usually cannot be trusted” - your suggestion is pushing investigation abilities into the latter category. Any positive could be a mind warp, fool frame, scorned frame or actually suspicious. Any negative could be brotherhood/dark wisp, drunk/invoker, tornado, prince jail, fool hide, merc guard or actually NS (which still could be NK).</p>
<p>You have no way of knowing any of these nor do you have any way of verifying any of these.After all, you think you checked 3 different people but actually two drunks deb’d you and then you checked one of them again. And this is assuming you keep the message that something occupied you - if you don’t then whoops a bulter occ’d you 3 times in a row and you think you checked 3 different people! And having to ask every morning “Hey did anyone redirect/occupy me” is tedious as heck.</p>
<p>Actually this problem extends to Princess too (though not as badly). Observer is fine though unless you change the message to be “x visited your target. Your target visited x” rather than the explicit numbering it has now.</p>
<p>That being said, actual suggestion in this thread is informing you of when your target was changed which makes it not quite as bad.</p>
