    <title>The Shaman (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-shaman-neutral-offensive/59949</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt;[color=gray]The Shaman[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
Unique, Neutral, Offensive.
**Goal: Survive.**
**Meditation (Passive)** - Immune to death and occupation.
**Pact (Passive)** - You will commit suicide on Night 6.
**Soul Link (Day)** - Select two players. If one of them dies tonight, the other will die as well. 3 uses.
**The Evil Eye (Day)** - Can only be used during a trial. If the person on trial is pardoned, they will die tonight. 2 uses.
**Seance (Night)** - Discover if a player is able to kill at night. Unlimited uses. 
**Voodoo Ritual (Night)** - Force a player to target another. Bypasses occupy immunity. 3 uses.

**Note:** Even though The Shaman&#39;s goal is Survive, his second passive forces him to make sure the game ends before Night 6. 
The shaman is harmful to the BD. He should use his seance to find people that are able to kill at night and force them to kill his targets. He can then use Soul Link to make sure two people die at night instead of one.</description>

            <p>I agree with N6, this is a very aggressive neutral that increases the kill count. He can also fake princess or scorned that has won with seance, which is a very nice bonus. There should be some limiters on him spawning with other scum-sided neutrals, because he can kill uniquely up to 5 times.</p>

            <p>I can always make him suicide a bit later if he is underpowered (maybe night 7?). I thought Night 6 was a nice number, since usually games are between 5 and 10 nights long.</p>
