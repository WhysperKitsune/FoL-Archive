    <title>Idea for the Mastermind Buff</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/idea-for-the-mastermind-buff/59096</link>
    <description>As you know, Mastemind is one of the most impacrful roles in game since depends on various factors that can matter in the mid/late game.
 
I would like to make a Mastermind as role who have a variery skillset and a little more fun to play.

You would start as MM with only &quot;Dirty Work&quot; and &quot;Convert&quot; but if you convert one of the players you will get another abillity depends on which class did you converted. They can be changed by converting someone else.

Abillity gained after converting The Butler:
&gt;**Disruptive Sabotage (Night)** - Occupy a player and all visitors. - 2 uses

Ability gained after coverting The Court Wizard:
&gt;**Dark Trickery (Day)** - Give the Unseen hidden occupy/redirection immunity tonight. - 2 uses

Abillity gained after converting The Drunk:
&gt;**Puppet Master (Night)** - Force player to visit your target, redirecting an action toward him. - 4 uses

Abillity gained after converting The Hunter:
&gt;**Dog Companion (Night)** - Send the Companion to protect the Unseen Member from any attacks, killing the attacker. - 3 uses

Abillity gained after converting The Knight:
&gt;**Stealthy Stab (Night)** - Watch over a player, kill the first visitor.(Cannot target King) - 2 uses

Abillity gained after converting The Noble:
&gt;**Snoop (Night)** - Examine players logs, make a copy for yourself. - 2 uses

Abillity gained after converting The Observer:
&gt;**Black Crow (Day)** - Send bird to watch over the player tonight. You will know who did he visit and which type of abillity they used on their target. - 3 uses

Abillity gained after converting the Physician:
&gt;**Elixir Of Life (Day)** - Give The Unseen death immunity and heal them tonight. - 2 uses

Abillity gained after converting the Princess:
&gt;**Foresight (Night)** - Determine a player’s converted class type or if they cannot be converted. - 4 uses

Abillity gained after converting the Mystic:
&gt;**Mind Network (Night)** - Add an separate Unseen Day Chat for next day. - 2 uses

Abillity gained after converting the Sheriff:
&gt;**Census (Day)** - Show a list of the remaining roles that are still in game. - Infinite uses

Example of the Rolelist:

[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]

            <p>I understand your concern,  i will try to explain the best i could. Right now Blue Dragon have incredibly high winrate especially when “Whisp Prince” Meta come to power, so obviously Evils especially Unseen need a buff.<br>
There was some ideas to buff several Unseen classes but the main problem with them that only helps in situation when <strong>particular</strong> role got converted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a team game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is correct but here is a thing, even if you successfully convert someone it doesn’t mean nothing wrong for can happen with your teammates like Assassin dying to NK or get nailed by Knight other thing that can happen is when Sheriff say something like: “Hey guys, X got converted, get him!”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would MM need to get the ability reminiscent of whoever you have successfully converted.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because he’s after all “Special” class, so there is no actual reason why he wouldn’t be able to use more types of abillities? Also it makes for casual player a little more enjoyable expierence  while playing as MM.</p>
<p>The idea is to give for whole Unseen faction a little more chance to win a game if luck would be against them.</p>

            <p>This is a team game. Why would MM need to get the ability reminiscent of whoever you have successfully converted. That is precisely what those conversions are supposed to be doing. Some ideas are creative I must admit and the abilities themselves are fairly balanced.</p>
