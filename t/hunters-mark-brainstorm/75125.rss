    <title>Hunter&#39;s Mark brainstorm</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/hunters-mark-brainstorm/75125</link>
    <description>Hunter&#39;s mark is nearly useless. It has the effect of a butler combined with cold steel which is great, however the actual odds of it going off are so low as to be a pointless ability. Here are a list of idea&#39;s I have on how to rework or change it to make it better, please post your own ideas and discuss them below. I am trying to maintain at least a part of the idea for the ability, so if you want it to be a retri-targeter then this isn&#39;t the thread for that. 

These suggestions are independent of each other btw:

&gt; HM can target self and has unlimited uses

&gt; HM makes it so that if the first target EVER visits the second target they are attacked and occupied (not retroactive)

&gt; HM always occupies and attacks the target if they visit ANYONE

&gt; HM triggers if they visit anyone BESIDES the second target (no visit still doesn&#39;t attack)

&gt; HM sticks on target player unless they are selected again much like sorc bomb. If you die at night you will kill all marked targets</description>

<p>Compared to the original hunter, in which any form of suicide to do an arrow on trial was a lot more straightforward and did some form of warning when it was going to happen. The only time a hunter was dead silent was when it was pointless or had a major asset in sight that was worth trading his life for their’s.<br>
I personally remember an occasion where the king executed a prince claim and immediately took an arrow to the face.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>it’s purely to eliminate the factor I mentioned earlier<br>
…<br>
used for when  <strong>they managed to narrow down an evil like an assassin</strong>  but can’t tell who between like 2 people it is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Once I narrowed down the Possessor to 2 of about 10 people based purely on how he voted.  Prince was outed so I marked one of those 2 people to Prince, hit the Possessor, then got him executed.</p>
<p>Another time I just marked a random unknown person to the publicly confirmed Alchemist, since it was extremely unlikely for anyone to have a legitimate reason to visit him.  I managed to occupy and kill a Marshal (I guess he was trying to double check if the Alch wasn’t Phys?).</p>
<p>Most recently, it was me as Good King, a Phys, a Hunter, an Assassin, a Possessor, and someone else.  I was out of guards so I asked the Phys to heal me while letting him know that it would probably mean he gets killed.  That Phys survived and we won the game because the Hunter marked the Assassin to him.</p>
<p>Yet another story, my first time with new Hunter.  This Observer called out someone else as a killer but we didn’t manage to get him on trial that day.  So I marked the guy to the Observer (seemed obvious he would try to shut him up) and occupied and attacked him, who turned out to be the Reaper.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but I am trying to illustrate with real examples how great Hunter’s Mark can be when used intelligently.</p>
<p>Oh!  I remember another.  Hunter killed Assassin with Mark, killed me with Bear the next night, then killed Reaper with another mark to end the game.</p>
<p>Hunter’s Mark is a fantastic ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hunter’s mark should be renamed to Stalk. It’s uncreative</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stalk sounds creepy and too modern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And change retribution to this:<br>
If you are found guilty of treason, then you will kill your current marked target upon execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noooooo … That will encourage Hunters to troll themselves into getting executed just so they can kill their mark.  The current Retribution is perfect because it discourages sheep voting and vote-for-role.</p>

            <p>Also, just a few more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hunter’s mark should be renamed to Stalk.  It’s uncreative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another rework possibility:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Stalk(Uses: Unlimited) - Mark target player.  Select yourself to cancel.<br>
Mark keyword - Prepare target player for another ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And change retribution to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are found guilty of treason, then you will kill your current marked target upon execution.  If you do not have a player marked then you will kill the last player who accused you.<br>
Note: This idea was Orange’s(I think), not mine</p>

            <p>It’s situational at best.<br>
Most people just burn all the uses because they can’t be bothered, some never use it, and the time it is used, it’s purely to eliminate the factor I mentioned earlier<br>
(One of these two is evil and prince can only jail one)<br>
You are essentially acting as the buffer or 2nd chance</p>

<p>You just haven’t seen any good hunters then, my experience screams the exact opposite.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a Hunter mark Assassin, bear assassin, then mark Reaper to end the game.  I’ve also seen a Hunter mark Assassin then Possessor to end the game when we executed the Poss next day.  These weren’t yolo hunters or trolls, they are Hunters who know what they’re doing</p>
<p>I also got marked as Possessed Prince in a 1v3, Hunter knew it was a safe mark since Prince can’t get killed by it unless he’s possessed, and that Hunter won with that mark</p>

            <p>Hunters mark has the niche of being a…arguably shittier alternative for the lategame. and is more or less used for when <strong>they managed to narrow down an evil like an assassin</strong> but can’t tell who between like 2 people it is. In a scenario like this the real evil if he isnt jailed will normally immediately go for the prince. you simply eliminate that equation, <strong>though smart people will notice the lack of a dead hunter</strong> and consider the chances the hunter is around or it they know there is a hunter <strong>they might just go kill them instead</strong></p>

<p>I always bear first three nights then mark the next 4, by then I’ve got plenty info to make good guesses</p>

            <p>No. They can only select one target at a time and a death immune target would eventually get occupy immunity so he would still lose to Reaper and Sorc (possessor he can use wolf)</p>

            <p>Sure. I never even put that down as an idea for that exact reason. It’s literally an omniscient kill</p>

            <p>Hunter’s mark is nearly useless. It has the effect of a butler combined with cold steel which is great, however the actual odds of it going off are so low as to be a pointless ability. Here are a list of idea’s I have on how to rework or change it to make it better, please post your own ideas and discuss them below. I am trying to maintain at least a part of the idea for the ability, so if you want it to be a retri-targeter then this isn’t the thread for that.</p>
<p>These suggestions are independent of each other btw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HM can target self and has unlimited uses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HM makes it so that if the first target EVER visits the second target they are attacked and occupied (not retroactive)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HM always occupies and attacks the target if they visit ANYONE</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HM triggers if they visit anyone BESIDES the second target (no visit still doesn’t attack)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HM sticks on target player unless they are selected again much like sorc bomb. If you die at night you will kill all marked targets</p>
</blockquote>
