    <title>Is this considered throwing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/is-this-considered-throwing/71201</link>
    <description>I was an observer. N1 I was converted into Unseen.

On n3 I checked #3s class and found Sorcerer.
On d4 I tell the King 3 is bd.
On d5 they up 3 and I defend him again saying I window peeked. Sorc doesnt respond (afk) and doesnt defend himself. They hang him. Which gets me upped.

In Sorcerers will he has 4 days of logs (totally made up) and on d1 of that he has afk.

My feeling is he went afk after posting a bunch of false logs. He never attacked anyone, nor did he speak.

Does this count as throwing?</description>

            <p>Basically being bad isn’t intending to lose. When bad players get punished for making bad plays except by losing matches, you run the risk of driving them out of the game and hurting the game in future.</p>

            <p>because you can’t be sure of if he attacked anyone or not<br>
him having faked logs is a sign that he <em>WAS</em> active and not AFK.<br>
Not providing a defense also isn’t throwing - you can try and feign reaped or act like a fool. Occasionally the best thing you can say to get you off the stand… is nothing</p>

            <p>Sorry Internet was down or Id have posted sooner than 4 days <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Can you explain WHY its not throwing? It seems like an afk report to me, and possibly a gamethrow as well since hes not defending himself from getting upped.</p>

            <p>This is a hard one. I mean, he is allowed to no action each night if he wants. It’s really dumb, but is allowed.</p>

            <p>Not trying to accomplish the objective is generally throwing + he was afk.<br>
He deserve a big report.</p>

            <p>It comes under intentionally leaving, which is a throw in all respects.</p>
<p>So yes, a report against said player is justifiable</p>
