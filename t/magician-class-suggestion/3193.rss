    <description>Name: Magician
Faction: Blue Dragon
Class type: Social
Converted Class: Unable to be converted

Passives

Disappearing Act: Occupy and Convert immune.

Day Ability

Magican’s Secret: You will hear the first 5 whispers after you activated said ability (3 Uses)

Rouge Rabbit: Rouge Rabbit will distract the entire court, allowing two people to whisper to each other (Could be you too) to whisper four times to a person silently. You will be able to read said whispers (Starts with 2)

Night Ability

Stocking up: Get more charges for Rouge Rabbit (2 per use with 2 uses)

Behind the Scenes: Ask an assistant to notify you and 1 random blue dragon member of whoever visited you this night. (4 uses)

Lore: No one knows his real name, all we know is that grew up in a small village beside the Royal Castle a while back, to a poor family. Their only entertainment in that village were the local magicians who came every Sunday. This young man was fascinated with the art of magic, so he worked long and hard cleaning floors to get enough money to go study in the Academy of Gifted Magicians, in which the Court Wizard we know and love today has graduated from as well. The Magician excelled in all if the subjects and was invited by the King to live in the Royal Palace. He has dedicated his life to the Blue Dragon and now that the Unseen has arrived, he will use all of his Ancient Magic to help the Blue Dragon.

Comments: This role helps create stability in chat and encourages making bonds with other Bd members by confirming them. If there’s a priest and the Magician used his Behind the Scenes ability he will be able to tell the priest who killed him. This role also improves over time, because the less people there are the easier it is to get a result for Behind The Scenes and the chance of using Magician’s Secret on a bad role creating chaos is better. Behind the Scenes also proves a blue dragon member because only blue dragon members can get the alert.</description>

            <p>There’s Magician’s Secret for viewing whispers. What do you think of the new Rouge Rabbit?. (Note: Doesn’t really distract the court)</p>

            <p>Maybe giving 1 or 2 people an extra vote, or allowing two people to whisper to each other without notifications and letting you read the conversation.</p>

<p>This so much. I keep seeing BD class suggestions that involve silencing people or preventing their votes.</p>
<p>Talking and voting is a tool for BD. Any BD class that suppresses these two concepts hurt BD most of the time.</p>

            <p>Behind the Scenes is essentially Wisp but only notifies one other person, which is a fairly significant nerf, but it still stands the infinite-wisping was removed for a reason: there is no reason to not use it every night. Having an nonconvertible BD other than Prince is fairly powerful, especially for a class with wisps. Additionally, the Blue Dragon doesn’t really stand to benefit from distracting people in any way. They <em>want</em> to hear what people have to say to determine who is scum.</p>
