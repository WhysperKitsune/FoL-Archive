            <p>Did not have this opportunity this game as I was double ritual’d and heir’d.</p>
<p>Also even if you found each other without outing you’d have to our both to actually use the strongman. Still doesn’t seem that great imo.</p>

            <p>They get unlimited strongman kills once they find each other. Also, the purpose of the investigative abilities they have is to help find the other twin without outing directly.</p>

            <p>Well there doesn’t seem to be a way to find each other without outing and then they become instant targets (and still the power of knowing each other isn’t that great compared to some other classes).</p>

            <p>I had to constantly supervise this thread and jump immediatly whenever someone mentioned bounty or you to scream that, although it broke my heart to announce, the bounty effect has already passed as you can know by asking the moderator no-one asked.<br>
You didn’t plan anything on the evidence I gave you at all and basically only did something when I asked.<br>
When I got desesperate I just cried at someone who could be the collector for they to kill the targets I wanted as long I gave out their roles, specially those who could harm you or anything. However that snowballed to something greater luckly because I was mainly seeking to do that so the Collector has someone always more important to kill than you.<br>
Overall having to carry an afk on the back was very unpleasant.</p>
