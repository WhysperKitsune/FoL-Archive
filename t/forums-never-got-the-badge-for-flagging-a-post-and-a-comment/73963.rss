    <title>(FORUMS) Never got the badge for flagging a post and a comment?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/forums-never-got-the-badge-for-flagging-a-post-and-a-comment/73963</link>
    <description>What happened:
I flagged a comment and later a post, both have been removed by a mod, but never got the badge for flagging.

What was SUPPOSED to happen:
After the mod accepted the removal the forums should’ve given me the first flag badge

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Flag a post
2. Mods remove the post or change the post
3. ~~wait for a month cause you’re not getting it~~</description>

            <p>Your previous flag may have been resolved as an ignore and then handled manually after, it’s not uncommon for me to do that when i’m looking at flags</p>
<p>didn’t realize there was a badge around it lul</p>
