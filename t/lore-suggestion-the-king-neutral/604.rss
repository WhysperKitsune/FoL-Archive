Lore Subject: The Neutral King

Lore:

&quot;What did I do to deserve this&quot; The cry of the Neutral King. Never did he wish for the burden of the crown of the sweet cries of his many children. Often does we lament the passing of his wife to forces outside of his control. Never does he wish for more power. For he knows that his life grows ever shorter. His Son in his shame shuns him and his Daughter weeps for her pathetic father never giving thought to any but himself. But he knows they are after him and that to take a step beside anyone will earn the blade of those who took his dear wife. Perhaps a mercenary will offer comfort he thinks but never does he truly believe. No the only way out is to manipulate his own court into his shields. For he knows that the war between his children and their enemies will one day reach it&#39;s end. One side will break and that will be the side that he wishes upon the world. For even with a kingdom and all it&#39;s riches the Neutral king wishes only for peace either for the kingdom or himself it does not matter which.


Comments: Another little introduction into a facet the king can undertake. As a neutral I decided this king would be cowardly and self serving. Of course I had to also show why his daughter and son would be capable of removing him for their own ascension. This king is powerless to do anything that would endanger his own life and lives a life of solitude. I also wanted to introduce the idea of the queens absence being the catalyst for his seclusion. May provide a nice little hint for that :)</description>
