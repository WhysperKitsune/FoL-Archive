    <description>Inquisitor seems too Blue Dragon friendly. He may as well be one, since Sorcerer sides with Unseen/Cult. Blue Dragon wins most games anyways, and Inquisitor doesn&#39;t even need them to win. Just the NK to lose.

So what if the Inquisitor&#39;s goal was to kill all starting magic users (not non magic converted cult). It would make the class more hostile to the Blue Dragon, while still working as a counter the Sorcerer. I think this would make it a class you&#39;d have to work to win as, instead of being nearly guaranteed the victory.</description>

            <p>yeah i finished it.</p>
<p>when you mean kill all starting magic users , do you mean by the Inquisitors hand or in general?</p>
<p>even so , this is a bit hard. at max , he needs seven people killed independently.</p>
