    <description>**Dead bodies in physician room**
after a physician exhumes someone, that body should show up on one of the cots in their room the rest of the game (replaced when they exhume someone else, of course).

**Fool laugh maniacally as they are executed**
Just like a back-and-forth head movement upwards and down, accompanied by the gripping of the chest. Doesn&#39;t actually need laughter noises.

**Scorned laugh maniacally as they win**
same thing, but they are pointing to them while gripping their chest and mostly doing a forward movement.
It would show it right before they are executed, or after, similar to hunter&#39;s retribution.

**Soul container for reaper**
In the reaper&#39;s room, there will be a scythe hanging on the wall. AT the end where the blade meets the stitch will be a large glass sphere, filled with slightly moving lights. Number of light would range from 1, 2, 3, and just being full of light.

Notice: I know that he scorned one might limit a person from claiming scorned, but most scorned claims get killed anyway.

The other ones don&#39;t hinder gameplay at all.</description>

            <p>I have been in BD games where people allowed a scorned who had his targets die to stay alive, so they could become neutral king.</p>
<p>However, unless they <em>really</em> need the votes (and I mean late game as in they know who the unseen are), they will just kill the scorned, or the prince will.</p>

            <p>I like all of these except for the Scorned one.</p>
<p>Confirmation in this game is something to stay away from. That would confirm a scorned claim (or out a fake claim).<br>
BUT all this goes out the window if it is after death of a character (since they get confirmed as they die anyway). So the fool laughing is PERFECT, they die, nothing can be done after this so its fine to add some flair. I imagine this as something from the Joker in Batman… laughing maniacally right before he dies!</p>
<p>My thoughts for the Scorned is that after the real scorned is dead, some type of graphic/ sound can be done to signify that they WON as scorned… since some people might not know if they did, or see the end screen.</p>

            <p>i think scorned should be kept available as a fakeclaim, even if it’s not a great one, so I can’t support that one, the others however would be great additions</p>

            <p>how about, for scorned, a laughing sound effect plays, so that players are notified anonymously</p>

            <p>I don’t like the Scorned one because it’s fun to meddle in the game afterwards if people still don’t know you’re Scorned, but I do like the other ones.</p>
