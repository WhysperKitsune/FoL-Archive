    <title>Possessor-Psychic Dynamic is contrary to the spirit of the game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-psychic-dynamic-is-contrary-to-the-spirit-of-the-game/52551</link>
    <description>The dynamic between the Poss and Psy is contrary to social deduction.  &quot;I&#39;m not X anymore, therefore X is Possessor&quot; is not social deduction.  If possessed people were &#39;converted&#39; to the Possessor&#39;s team, there would be more social deduction involved in finding the possessor since those he possessed would not out him in dead chat and also the dead would be less trustworthy.

Possessor used to be wrecked with codewords but he was given the ability to read whispers to avoid this.  I hope this can be solved too.</description>

            <p>There’s a lot int his thread!  Like moving the victim to the Possessor’s team, or silencing them entirely (coupled with removing dead-leaving messages, of course, which is an obvious thing for a bunch of reasons.)</p>

            <p>Soooo…  the upcoming patch is apparently removing the psychic ability to speak to the dead <span class="bbcode-i">entirely</span>.</p>
<p>What do people think of that?</p>

            <blockquote>

<p>Technically true.  However the possessed person will probably be a BD who will correctly identify poss 100% of the time, and even if the possessed person is evil, he’s very likely to correctly identify poss too.  So the chance the dead are lying is negligible.</p>

            <p>I disagree with the sentiment that there is no social deduction left. Why, you might ask? Because scum also stays in death chat. I have convinced psychics that a prince was now possessor even when it wasn’t a possessor game. If you are assassin and being possessed into, you can now attempt to frame any person alive hoping that they weren’t guarded/jailed or so and even then you apply pressure that psychic has been converted. In turn possessor can use this as a last ditch defense.</p>
<p>I think the idea of converting dead persons to your team, should be left for a new faction or a new NK (necromancer?). Possessor is unique enough as it is.</p>

            <p>This is a great idea!  It would let the possessed people feed information from the dead BD to the Possessor.  The one-shot ability thing might be OP though, although I’ll support ANYTHING to get rid of the current situation.</p>

            <p>What if we gave the dead possessed some way to influence the game, in addition to converting them to the possessor’s side?  This would both buff the Possessor (helping with their low winrate) and generally make it more fun for the dead he possessed.</p>
<p>For example:  The Possessor can talk to the dead he possessed, even during the day.  Maybe add a separate “possessed” tab for their conversations.</p>
<p>They could also each be given a one-shot ability that could be used to help the Possessor, based on their previous class type.</p>

            <p>While that would work for the possessor, I doubt it will be fun for his victims. Not only are you killing them, but also “converting” them right after they die. Since they are dead, there is nothing they can do to help you achieve your goal so they are stuck there hoping that you somehow win. Not to mention NK has a low winrate compared to the two main factions so a lot of people would be mad that they were converted into a loss.<br>
I think a better solution would be to make the possessed target unable to talk in dead chat, although that could also lead to problems for the victims.</p>
