        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Davos woke up, wondering where he was. He saw the King Weizen sighing, disappointed at him. “I expected much more from you.”</p>
<p>“Sir! I had the low ground, it was impossible for me to win! Darn Icibalus and his nation!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Davos, I know you partially couldn’t control this disaster. However, Icibalus and his goons are utilizing a new, horrible threat: Living British food.”</p>
<p>“Dastardly.” Davos looks at the ground and shakes his head.</p>
<p>“Anyway, here’s your banhammer.” said King Weizen. Davos is handed his banhammer. It’s been covered in a slimy green emerald potion, and the words MARL DIED OF THE PLAGUE are written in rubbish handwriting.</p>
<p>“Oh cool. The Monkey died…”</p>
<p>“Nope, right here.”<br>
Davos mutters “You have got to be fucking kidding me…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m willing to help you on your quest as you see. I also have banhammer powers.”<br>
“Also I cured myself of the plague before it could kill me so congrats for getting the hammer wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>Suddenly, a necrobumper appears. “YOU ARE NOW BUMPED!” It cries in an annoying screeching voice.</strong></p>

            <p>Larry the Living Taco appeared to Davos!</p>
<p>“Yum!” Davos ate Larry the Living Taco.<br>
…</p>
<p>“You made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Hahahah, no I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well yes you did biatch because now I’m gonna haunt you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in those mythical stuff, duh.”</p>
<p>Barry the Bouncing Burrito lunges at Davos’ face.</p>
<p>“Wow ez…” eats Barry whole.<br>
“Huh… that tasted a bit Nuclear.”</p>
<p>Davos can now breathe Nuclear Fire from his mouth."</p>
<p>“You made ANOTHER mistake.”<br>
Davos turned around… to see Marluxion the Magical Monkey , advancing towards him.</p>
<p>Marluxion trampled on Davos. Davos has died. His class was Knight.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL. Rezid the Priest decides to Rezid (not revive, Rezid). Davos. Davos is now alive again hooray.</p>
<p>“Why thank you Rezid Rezid.” Davos says.<br>
“Anytime.” Rezid replies<br>
“Why do i say things and it automatically finishes it with Rezid , Rezid , Rezid?”<br>
“It just takes less magical power to Rezid someone then revive them…”<br>
They hear mariachi. More are coming…</p>
<p>From somewhere else, Hiakic pop out of thin air, she say: “What the freak is happening here?”</p>
<p>but then, Damafaud the Dancing Cat Paladin jumps out and starts screaming. “NO WEEB SHIT IN MY STORY.” and smites Hiakic from the story, this smite makes sure resurrections will not work on the target no matter what.</p>
<p>Then Insanity proceeded to scream “No u” in 500% volume to Pug’s ear, killing him immediately.<br>
A body has been discovered! Please head to the location of Davos.</p>
<p>Garry the Grumbling Guacamole appears! Where the fuck are these things coming from, anyway?</p>
<p>But then, Pug the Paladin resurrects himself and smites all the Mexican Food Cultists. Killing them all, making them never appear in the story again.</p>
<p>Marluxion the Monkey comes back and starts singing the Donkey Kong Rap to Davos</p>
<p>But, in her castle up on high, the Dragon Queen Alfa and her husband the Dark Lord SoulShard are watching… They are working a spell of great evil upon this land that will cause the end of Davos’s quest… and the world.</p>
<p>Davos’'s body reawakens to fight this evil.</p>
<p>But then someone yelled at Davos with dialogue under below:</p>
<p>“What in four color button on the controller are you doing, acting like someone who is braindead like my freaking League of Legend Janna, I am not disappointed in you but your observer claim better be one with legit log or even my copycat sentence won’t be able to describe how much braindead I expected from you.”</p>
<p>It cause him to suffer a bleeding in the ears.</p>
<p>But the earbleeding didn’t stop there. As Damafaud the Dancing Cat Paladin turns into a sheriff and starts yelling at Davos.</p>
<p>“Davos what in tree different coloured pencil sharpeners are you doing acting like someone with a brain like my effing toaster I am not disappointed in you but your fever better be one with following delirium or even my made up swear words won’t be able to describe how much more I expected from you.”</p>
<p>Davos drew out his banhammer and used it to summon a wave of muting, muting the horrifying people for 365 days. But everything changed when the Icibalus Nation Attacked</p>
<p><strong>But oh wait, a moderror happened. the Icibalus Nation wasn’t supposed to come yet and Davos died. The End</strong></p>

<p>But, in her castle up on high, the Dragon Queen Alfa and her husband the Dark Lord SoulShard are watching… They are working a spell of great evil upon this land that will cause the end of Davos’s quest… and the world.</p>
<p>Davos’'s body reawakens to fight this evil.</p>
<p>But then someone yelled at Davos with dialogue under below:</p>
<p>“What in four color button on the controller are you doing, acting like someone who is braindead like my freaking League of Legend Janna, I am not disappointed in you but your observer claim better be one with legit log or even my copycat sentence won’t be able to describe how much braindead I expected from you.”</p>
<p>It cause him to suffer a bleeding in the ears.</p>
<p><strong>But the earbleeding didn’t stop there. As Damafaud the Dancing Cat Paladin turns into a sheriff and starts yelling at Davos.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Davos what in tree different coloured pencil sharpeners are you doing acting like someone with a brain like my effing toaster I am not disappointed in you but your fever better be one with following delirium or even my made up swear words won’t be able to describe how much more I expected from you."</strong></p>

            <p>Larry the Living Taco appeared to Davos!</p>
<p>“Yum!” Davos ate Larry the Living Taco.<br>
…</p>
<p>“You made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Hahahah, no I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well yes you did biatch because now I’m gonna haunt you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in those mythical stuff, duh.”</p>
<p>Barry the Bouncing Burrito lunges at Davos’ face.</p>
<p>“Wow ez…” eats Barry whole.<br>
“Huh… that tasted a bit Nuclear.”</p>
<p>Davos can now breathe Nuclear Fire from his mouth."</p>
<p>“You made ANOTHER mistake.”<br>
Davos turned around… to see Marluxion the Magical Monkey , advancing towards him.</p>
<p>Marluxion trampled on Davos. Davos has died. His class was Knight.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL. Rezid the Priest decides to Rezid (not revive, Rezid). Davos. Davos is now alive again hooray.</p>
<p>“Why thank you Rezid Rezid.” Davos says.<br>
“Anytime.” Rezid replies<br>
“Why do i say things and it automatically finishes it with Rezid , Rezid , Rezid?”<br>
“It just takes less magical power to Rezid someone then revive them…”<br>
They hear mariachi. More are coming…</p>
<p>From somewhere else, Hiakic pop out of thin air, she say: “What the freak is happening here?”</p>
<p>but then, Damafaud the Dancing Cat Paladin jumps out and starts screaming. “NO WEEB SHIT IN MY STORY.” and smites Hiakic from the story, this smite makes sure resurrections will not work on the target no matter what.</p>
<p>Then Insanity proceeded to scream “No u” in 500% volume to Pug’s ear, killing him immediately.<br>
A body has been discovered! Please head to the location of Davos.</p>
<p>Garry the Grumbling Guacamole appears! Where the fuck are these things coming from, anyway?</p>

            <p>Larry the Living Taco appeared to Davos!</p>
<p>“Yum!” Davos ate Larry the Living Taco.<br>
…</p>
<p>“You made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Hahahah, no I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well yes you did biatch because now I’m gonna haunt you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in those mythical stuff, duh.”</p>
<p>Barry the Bouncing Burrito lunges at Davos’ face.</p>
<p>“Wow ez…” eats Barry whole.<br>
“Huh… that tasted a bit Nuclear.”</p>
<p>Davos can now breathe Nuclear Fire from his mouth."</p>
<p>“You made ANOTHER mistake.”<br>
Davos turned around… to see Marluxion the Magical Monkey , advancing towards him.</p>
<p>Marluxion trampled on Davos. Davos has died. His class was Knight.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL. Rezid the Priest decides to Rezid (not revive, Rezid). Davos. Davos is now alive again hooray.</p>
<p>“Why thank you Rezid Rezid.” Davos says.<br>
“Anytime.” Rezid replies<br>
“Why do i say things and it automatically finishes it with Rezid , Rezid , Rezid?”<br>
“It just takes less magical power to Rezid someone then revive them…”<br>
They hear mariachi. More are coming…</p>
<p>From somewhere else, Hiakic pop out of thin air, she say: “What the freak is happening here?”</p>
<p><strong>but then, Damafaud the Dancing Cat Paladin jumps out and starts screaming. “NO WEEB SHIT IN MY STORY.” and smites Hiakic from the story, this smite makes sure resurrections will not work on the target no matter what</strong></p>
