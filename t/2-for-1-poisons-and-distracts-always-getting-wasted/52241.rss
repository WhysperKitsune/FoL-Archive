    <title>2-for-1, poisons and distracts always getting wasted</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/2-for-1-poisons-and-distracts-always-getting-wasted/52241</link>
    <description>You often see starting Assassin using 2-for-1 early game or randomly for no apparent reason.  There really is no logic behind this except apparentlythe thrill of a possible double-kill.  In my experience it&#39;s best saved for late game whenever you have a better idea of what classes people are and which ones you can actually kill.  Wasting the ability early often results in Unseen losing the game when they would have otherwise won.  

Also random poisonings and distracts, especially when there are healers alive, usually accomplish nothing except confirm the targets as non-Unseen and give healers opportunities to prove themselves.  

I have tried using distract to shut people up at critical moments, but it has NEVER, not even once been successful.  Once Princess wisped that I killed her.  So I silenced King and got somebody else accused of being Unseen.  King just force-pardoned the guy and put me up instead.  When shutting up somebody&#39;s defense, it just makes them look more innocent whenever they claim &quot;I was distracted&quot;.

Claiming that I, myself, have been poisoned or distracted however works VERY well at putting me beyond suspicion =)  Works best if I claimed immune to poison, obviously</description>

            <p>Yes but there’s far too much info in the game for balance rn. Knight is also fun as hell what are you talking about</p>

            <p>Nighshade should just be reduced to 3 uses and changed so it kills the target in 1 night instead of 2.  This would make butler less confirmable and make the cult and unseen more different.</p>

</aside>
<p>No.  All classes need some info, they would be boring otherwise.  It’s the main reason why players dislike playing as knight and court wizard.</p>

            <p>My favourite play is to poison and then immediately claim bleeding. Confuses the fuck out of everyone. Then act like you’ve been TB’d</p>
<p>Haven’t tried it yet but it sounds fun</p>

<p>Poison early can be effective to draw physicians and alchs off other important classes. If sheriff was outted for example, it could be worth poisoning the King so you could more reliably kill the sheriff.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed, I also sometimes poison early to cause chaos and help figure out who is Physician so I can kill/convert them.</p>

<p>But my point wasn’t that we should do that, just that there would be less incentive to waste poisons</p>

            <p>Using poison early has (nearly no) use and should be discouraged.<br>
2 for 1 Night 1 makes sense because you have one more chance to kill the Prince before the King sends the protectives towards them.<br>
I have not used distracts for a long time.</p>
