    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Disruptor (Neutral Offensive)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-disruptor-neutral-offensive/53384</link>
    <description>This is a test take, so it&#39;s a WIP 

&gt;## [color=grey]The Disruptor[/color]
&gt; [color=grey]Neutral Offensive[/color]
_Win Condition: Win with the Neutral Killer. Cannot spawn with the Inquisitor and Sorcerer._
Traitorous (Passive): Immune to target changing and death at night. 
Deranged (Passive): You will know if the Neutral Killer visited you. If the Neutral Killer dies, you will end your life.
Silence (Day): Silence a player for 30 seconds. They will not be able to hear anyone or vote in a trial while silenced. (2 uses)
Disrupt (Night): Disrupt a player, forcing them to target you. You will appear to be a **[color=blue]Drunk[/color]** to investigators that you force to target. (Infinite Uses)
Disorder (Night): Force 2 players to target each other. If one of the players is the Neutral Killer, their ability will bypass everything. (3 Uses.) 

&gt; **Conversion Immune**

Tell me what you think! This hopefully addresses the current problem of NK being too hard to win as, as NKs require more effort to win as than any other class in the game. 

(I could make some classes for FoL as well, tell me if you guys want some FoL Classes :3)</description>

<p>This is what I was thinking. However, if the NK was somehow prevented from attacking the person (Wasting a night on this little class), it’s kinda bad for NK.</p>

            <p>There’s a problem with this that’s not a huge issue. Your basically a drunk who is immune to all attacks. So when you find the assassin you call him out… It’s not really that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Then they ask you to step up… you have no royal blood. Rip you.</p>
<p>Don’t give it royal blood</p>
<p>Are you immune to being occupy it only says redirect</p>
