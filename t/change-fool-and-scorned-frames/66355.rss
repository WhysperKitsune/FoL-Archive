    <title>Change Fool and Scorned Frames</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/change-fool-and-scorned-frames/66355</link>
    <description>I think it would raise the skill ceiling and potential of Fool and Scorned if we change Frame so that instead of automatically making you Unseen and Killer/Offensive, it brings up a popup box (like Defile and Facelift does) allowing you to mimic the faction and class type of the selected class.

Also I have some questions.  Does Seeker&#39;s class check tell you that a framed Fool is Killer?  Or social?  Also if a Scorned frames a Physician will a Sheriff&#39;s surveille say they are Herbalist or just Assassin?</description>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback!  My opinion is that the increased skill ceiling and potential depth of strategy would be worth this small added difficulty because how often do scorned targets get hung for being spec/inv anyway?  Personally I have never seen it, I didn’t even know k/o classes were framed as s/i until someone told me yesterday.</p>

            <p><strong>Hey Shrimpy!</strong></p>
<p>I find your idea quite creative to be honest with you!<br>
Notwithstanding your creative thinking, I think your idea is kind of incomplete.<br>
Sure, having that implementation would open more ways to frame your target / yourself.<br>
However, as a Scorned you don’t know what your target’s role actually is. So, how would you know if your target is a Social/Investigative class, for example, and then you frame them as Social/Investigative. There would be a mix in the case (mostly when your target hasn’t claimed or you want to frame on the first night), so something to prevent this would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>Well, that’s what I had to say, hope it gets implemented though!</strong></p>

            <p>Well that depends on how it would work, Sheriffs probably would see “cult” fools as NS since they currently only tell you whether they are unseen or not</p>

            <p>D1 pally/sheriff claims are rare.  And d2 poisons/bleeds don’t change the fact that framing as the wrong faction N1 will prove you are framed.  And number of kills is not a foolproof method of determining the faction.</p>
<p>My point being this change does not make fool or scorned easier, it only increases the potential for strategy.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see how it’s too easy.  It adds the difficulty, first of all, of having to choose the right faction, a difficulty which is currently not present.  If you frame as Unseen in a Cult game, a Paladin who checks you will know you were framed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>act sus - use unseen/cult faction and use any class type you want to appear as - get investigated - get lynched</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposed change would not alter this strategy for Fool as regards Sheriff/Paladin/Observer checks, only Princess flirts (except for the getting the faction correctly-- cult or unseen-- as already mentioned).</p>
