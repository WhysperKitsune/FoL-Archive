    <title>Prince changed to Cult Leader</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/prince-changed-to-cult-leader/5178</link>
    <description>http://prntscr.com/h0f0lm

Circumstances leading to this... host started game early... so 11 people total. Alot of people wanted to leave or quit but we stuck it out. Prince announced himself rather quickly. Worked our way through and got down to 3 people; priest, rezzed knight (me) and Prince, and through process of elimination killed priest (as he didnt announce to me who he was and figured maybe cult anyways.) Killed priest and game still continued... I was knight and and since it had been such a clusterfuck game anyway decided to kill prince in the night to see what happens when everyone dies. Turned out that Prince had been converted night 1 to cult leader (game ends in a draw btw kinda cool if you have the chance to see it.)

So is this a bug? What are the circumstances that would lead to this?</description>

<p>Don’t you mean Prince as Priest is convertable</p>
<p>And can confirm, that should not happen</p>
