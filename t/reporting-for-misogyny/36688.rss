    <title>Reporting for misogyny?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reporting-for-misogyny/36688</link>
    <description>We have reporting for racism and homophobia but not for misogyny? The implication is that it&#39;s okay. Today I played with someone using the name Josef Fritzl. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case I played another game with someone using a name like BtchsGetStchs. The reporting system makes it seems as if this is acceptable? When it&#39;s really, really not.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>…anyway, putting the pointless quibbling above aside, yeah, it should probably be edited into the racism / homophobic entry; or that could just be changed to “hate speech”, although I tend to interpret that as more extreme than some things that would still fall under racism / homophobic.</p>
<p>The wording of the report options matters because people sometimes won’t report things that they don’t think will be enforced (especially since invalid reports can backfire).  So the “it makes it seem like this is acceptable” problem is real and serious, even though I think it’s clear that that wasn’t the intent.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the full TOS makes it clear that it’s not acceptable - but few people are going to read this, so you’re gonna get people clicking “report”, reading the options, and saying “oops, I guess it isn’t reportable.”</p>
<p>(Also, perhaps “sexually explicit” needs to be an option, since I’m pretty sure that’s against the ToS, too.  Again, an ‘other’ option would be ok, but I think it’s best to have the report system itself make it clear what is and isn’t reportible to discourage invalid reports and encourage good ones.)</p>
<p>EDIT:  Going over the rules, they say:</p>
<ol>
<li>Swearing is permitted. However, keep it classy – don’t overdo it and no targeting people.</li>
<li>No hating, bullying, harassing, stalking, or being overly creepy (esp. sexualizing).</li>
<li>No hate speech.</li>
<li>No spamming.</li>
<li>No spoilers.</li>
</ol>
<p>…I cut out some that aren’t relevant to the reporting system.  Comparing them, “Targeted Harassment” covers 1 and parts of 2, while the “Racism / Homophobic” option seems to cover 3.  So perhaps Hate Speech is the correct term, since that’s what the rules actually forbid.  Maybe something like “Hate Speech (Racism, Homophobia, Misogyny, etc.)” to make it clear that it’s not all-inclusive and only lists the most common report reasons.</p>
<p>Also there’s no option to report spoilers, although I don’t know how frequently that’s needed.  Clearly the intent is that going all “SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE” for a recent movie is reportable, though, and IMHO the list of report options should reflect what’s reportable so even people who haven’t read the ToS know that.</p>

            <p>This is either a troll, or you probably just aren’t aware of that you can still report someone for inappropriate names/comments even when it’s not one of the specific categories.</p>
<p>But maybe the report category could be reworded a bit</p>

            <p>How did I throw shade on the developers? I think they do great. In general the game community is one of the best I’ve seen in large part from their efforts. For all I know the devs have been taking action against people doing this garbage already. But if so the game should make that explicit. Both to encourage people to report and to discourage people from doing it.</p>

            <p>That’s probably true, but like, if you have an issue, bring it forward like a rational person.</p>
<p>If you had merely said “I think there should be a button to report people for being sexist” or similar, I’d be like, “Hey! That’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>But when you start throwing shade on the developers, you have already destroyed your credibility.</p>

            <p>Oh wow, you’re so right! These developers are truly misogynistic themselves? How <strong>dare</strong> they leave out the option to report for “misogyny”? It’s such a household term that there is no possible way that they never thought of it, so clearly they are proliferating the patriarchy! Absolutely disgusting behavior.</p>
