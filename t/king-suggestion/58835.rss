    <description>I think that new kings should inherit night executions. So if the first king never used either of them, the new king would get both of them, or if the first king used one of them then the new king would get one that they could use.</description>

            <p>I disagree because then there is no harm in lynching the king and putting up a confirmed Bd king with the same abilites besides the chance of a 1 day no vote and the loss of 2 guards. This is a risk myself and most players would take to put up a confirmed BD king. Then you do the whisper king meta.</p>
