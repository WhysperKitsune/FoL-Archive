    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/auto-resolve-should-be-removed/23831</link>
    <description>There are so many times where the game auto gives a win to someone, but that person could have lost. For example, if there is a DK still alive, it can still swing in BD favor. And King 1v1 is also very inconsistent.</description>

            <p>Auto-resolve also gets in the way of newbies being able to learn how endgame works and why you would or wouldn’t keep certain players in the game. The game just cuts out with no explanation as to why. That cutting out with no explanation also makes it awfully hard to trust the auto-resolve, which is why threads like this exist.</p>
<p>After playing quite a bit, my conclusion is that it does more harm than good vs just allowing a vote to concede or something like that. But if it’s going to be there it should <em>at least</em> tell you on the scoreboard screen why it cut out.</p>
<p>Among other things, that practically limits the reasons to auto-resolve to things the dev can actually explain, which would work to minimize the number of WTF edge cases in and of itself.</p>

            <p>Personally I would prefer to not have auto resolve to keep the uncertainty. Because if you always know if the game isn’t winnable by the other team then you can’t make them think that it is. Take the Hunter vs Assassin/NK for example. If the auto resolve normally comes into play with killer vs non killer (ex: bulter vs reaper) then if the game doesn’t end then you know he is probably a hunter. If it isn’t certain that he is a hunter then he has an advantage in the resulting mind game. I’m sure that this isn’t the only situation and I am sure a few exist even if the MM/CL is still in play. Either way the auto resolve should only be used for stalemates. Examples: CW vs Sorc with no CoD, Evil King vs Hunter. I’m sure there are others and if they don’t exist now then they might exist later.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t need to be removed, some algorithms just need to be fixed. Which is more of a bug than a suggestion.</p>

            <p>Just had a game</p>
<p>Reaper and allied Alch vs lone Evil King and reaped Merc.</p>
<p>King and Cult win. (along with Alch obv)</p>
<p>Even though there is no way on Earth that could happen.  2 votes against lone king along with Empowered Reap?<br>
WTF?</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a huge issue, fix it or turn it off already.</p>

<p>It’s a time-saver in which there’s no point for it to NOT be there, if there was a Death Knight alive, the game would autoresolve to BD winning. Algorithms my friend, algorithms.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but my time is precious, and not refundable. I’d like to save as much as I can.</p>

</aside>
<p>Except that the game gives wins to people who literally can’t win</p>
<p>Reaper with 2 souls going into night vs lone king is the prime example.  The only way the Reaper loses is if he falls asleep or has a stroke before clicking his empower and then clicking on the King.  But the game instantly gives the win to the King <em>who can’t possibly win.</em></p>
<p>Hell, I had a scenario with the old DK (where they were alive and could talk) when I was Possessor.  It was just me and him.  He couldn’t hurt me and I couldn’t hurt him.  I just waited for him to rot and it took forever, but at least I wasn’t robbed of my win.</p>
<p>It almost exclusively screws over NKs, which is already the hardest win in the game.  I don’t really want it to go away, but I DO want it to not see King vs someone going into night automatically give the win to the King.  There are plenty of scenarios where the King doesn’t win that, yet 1v1 King <strong>always</strong> wins.</p>
<p>If we’re talking 3 Unseen vs Neut King and a Physician going into night?  Fine, just give them the win.  But far too often it gives wins in situations where the win isn’t remotely locked down, usually giving the shaft to someone who was playing well.</p>

            <p>Let’s all be honest here. If your time was precious you would leave well before it decides who wins. Actually nvm, you wouldn’t play the game.</p>

            <p>But that’s the problem. Sometimes the algorithms seem to mess up and make conclusions that don’t seem right. And Even so, purple make mistakes. There are situations with auto resolve, yet, if someone in that scenario makes a mistake, the other team still has a chance.</p>
