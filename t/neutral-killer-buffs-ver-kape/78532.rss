*to be changed
This suggestion is made with the assumption that this rework also gets in: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/starting-king-changes/78177

---

Shoddy TL:DR
Reaper: 
multi day ability bug made feature
gather and circle swapped places

Poss:
force vote reduced 1 use
possess consumes charge if you hit immune

Sorc:
walking bomb made into a passive
distract as a day ability

Psycho King:
you keep your defining abilities with Bag of Matryoshka Bags (asked for a name and we got this) and Memento Mori
removed occ/red immunity, but has it when using Fatal Guards
keeps souls if reaper, otherwise keeps death immunity</description>

            <p>Said this in Discord, part of the reason why I can’t really respond here is because I was (mostly) participating in the original discussion for the ideas.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I keep forgetting about this being a bug at the moment and never use it. Though it’s kind of cool. I’ve won plenty of times without it, so while it’s is useful, it’s also not 100% necessary, so I am kind of neutral on it. Perhaps start with removing it and seeing how stats are before considering re-adding it.</p>
<p>Again though, I’m neutral on this, not really bothered if it stays or goes.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I kind of prefer this. At the moment, Circle can be very useless. You can take a chance and hope you Circle the right person (such as the prince) and get a ton of kills…or you can get only one, or worse, zero, completely wasting the souls. At least this way you are still guaranteed your Reap on the target. I agree with Defend stopping it completely too, prevents it being overpowered.</p>

</aside>
<p>I like this. I think the only real reason it’s now a night ability is to allow Circle to be a day ability, however this does allow those last second decisions to empower Reap someone (like you figure you’re about to hit the MM).</p>

<p>Much more useful than having a separate ability to move bombs and allows you to 1vs1 a king. Thumbs up.</p>

            <p>I edited the Sorc one but forgot about the PK one, gah.<br>
Well, the PK change stemmed from my King change, so if that one gets vetoed then this one goes poof.</p>
<p>I’m mostly suggesting this for the NK changes, while having the PK buff be a bonus. Those can work very well standalone.<br>
I think going for King should be a boon rather than a hindrance.<br>
In most cases going for King is just plainly bad. As Reaper you lose Chill and Reap, as Sorc you lose Bombs, as Poss you lose Force Vote and Jumps.<br>
So I’m making it be a good thing instead.</p>

<p>But you are king… <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
<p>Looking at the NK changes, I like them all a lot. Maybe poss losing jump on a DI is a bit much, but we’ll see. That’s something you can play around pretty easily if you’re careful, after all.</p>
<p>I still don’t think that as NK, stepping for PK should ever be <em>optimal</em>. We’ve had our small debates and we’ve agreed to disagree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, changes like this would really make BD careful about electing a PK, because a PK Reaper/Sorc/0jumpPoss is suddenly incredibly powerful. Which <em>makes sense</em>, NK stepping for king is inherently an incredible risk because you are the spotlight.</p>
<p>So thinking about it from a devils advocate standpoint, I can see why this belongs in the game. Even if my personal opinion may conflict with that.</p>
<p>If only we had a test server to see this kind of thing in action <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>NK winrates are currently around 10-15 percent, though those stats aren’t recent. It’s possible to improve on that significantly by employing strategies such as ‘actually trying to win,’ though.</p>

<p>This should be ‘Cannot move a bomb to the King,’ in my opinion; if you really want to move a bomb away from the King (say, if they’re a neut king siding with you) that should be an option.</p>

            <p>We haven’t had any winrates posted for quite a while.<br>
The last one was in January.<br>
Going by those NKs had 10-15% win rates.</p>
<p>The goal of this was to make all of the NKs equal to Poss, which is considered the strongest.<br>
And to make going for PK a more valid strategy.</p>

<p>Shoddy TL:DR<br>
Reaper:<br>
multi day ability bug made feature<br>
gather and circle swapped places</p>
<p>Poss:<br>
force vote reduced 1 use<br>
possess consumes charge if you hit immune</p>
<p>Sorc:<br>
walking bomb made into a passive<br>
distract as a day ability</p>
<p>Psycho King:<br>
you keep your defining abilities with Bag of Matryoshka Bags (asked for a name and we got this) and Memento Mori<br>
removed occ/red immunity, but has it when using Fatal Guards<br>
keeps souls if reaper, otherwise keeps death immunity</p>
