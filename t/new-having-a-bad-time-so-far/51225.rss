    <title>New &amp; having a bad time so far</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-having-a-bad-time-so-far/51225</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve played 5 games total.

3 of them I had an evil class
1 I had a neutral class (not fool, that would&#39;ve been too easy -_-)
1 I had a good class

I was told on the discord that there is a bug, and new players are supposed to not get evil classes their first few games. Is that true? Cause I gotta say, it&#39;s been nothing but stress for me and makes me not want to queue again. Apparently I&#39;m the most unlucky person :(</description>

</aside>
<p>The evil king doesn’t know who the evils are, so he can’t whisper instructions to them.</p>
<p>And the evils don’t know he’s evil, so they don’t know to identify themselves to him.</p>
<p>In my experience, evil kings often end up acting like BD kings until very late in the game (when they reveal by executing the Prince.)</p>

            <p>In the discord there is an “ask a guide” tab and a “newbie games” tab where you will be able to ask a guide either me personally or someone else. Also there is newbie games for people who are new to Throne of Lies like you.</p>

            <p>Thanks <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Well one thing I can say so far, is I’m really not a fan of the whole “whisper the king your roles on d2” thing. Makes it way harder for evils imo. But then again I’m from Town of Salem which favors good evils a lot, since town generally takes 4 days just to get it together, and by then they’re all dead.</p>

            <p>That’s unfortunate, I know that being evil can be really stressful for newer players.</p>
<p>I think there are games hosted specifically for new players by one of the Community Guides, might wanna ask around and see if one of those is anytime soon.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is a game where you definitely have to learn from experience. Keep going at it, and you’ll start to pick up what’s going on. It’s very worth it, as the game is fun and the feeling of improving as a player is great too.</p>
<p>Welcome to the game, and may RNG favor you more from here on out. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
