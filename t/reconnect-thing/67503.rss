    <title>Reconnect thing</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reconnect-thing/67503</link>
    <description>I have sometimes problem with my connection to the internet, and when it go off lets say my game freezes. The thing is, its not a bug or anything that will exit my game naturally. So, after force exit while in game, i cant reconnect. I dont want to ,gamethrow&#39; by it. So maybe a good thing would be to add one time recconect button (available for 2 min) after exiting while in game?</description>
