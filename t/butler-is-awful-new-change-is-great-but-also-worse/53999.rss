    <title>Butler is awful, new change is great but also worse</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/butler-is-awful-new-change-is-great-but-also-worse/53999</link>
    <description>Butler has always been the least fun and useful BD class. Without exception it ranks at or near the bottom of every ToL survey I&#39;ve seen. At best, it&#39;s a worse drunk. Most of what you do in the game is inconvenience random BD, and the only productive feedback you get from your actions is one of two things:

1) You occupy your target successfully, and no one dies.
This can be useful, but you could just as easily have occupied a sheriff while the assassin was in jail or happened to target a scorned or something. This is frequently too unreliable to execute on, and your best bet is just to cry for an adult and let a real investigator check them.

2) You confirm whether a claim is occupy immune or not.
This is probably the best you can do with the ability, but will also often lead to occupying real BD roles. It&#39;s not that useful to test people who claim occupy-immune classes, as anyone lying about this is probably naturally occupy-immune. Is disabling someone on your own team worth testing - not even proving - their claim? Probably not frequently.

Enter the butler&#39;s signature ability: poisoning the king. With the new patch, the butler is a tremendous threat to the king, having a killing ability that slips past guards. Very powerful, very flavorful.

With one charge and suicide on misuse, I believe the goal was to incentivize the butler to think deeply on whether or not to kill the king. You only get one shot, and nobody wants to die, right?

Wrong. Butlers want to die.

I suspect a large portion of early king kills are butlers who see the action as having one of two outcomes:
1) Evil king dies. GOT EM.
2) You die and get to play another game, probably as a different class that&#39;s actually interesting and fun.
You could argue that this is throwing, but how do you prove that? The butler can just claim he thought king was suspicious. There&#39;s no penalty for being bad.

I believe the solution isn&#39;t to nerf the butler&#39;s poison or to remove the suicide effect. As someone who enjoys playing knight more than most BD classes, I am very cautious with my cold steel. I suggest that the solution is to make the butler fun and interesting, while keeping his devastating check on the king in place.

EDIT: I had included a rework suggestion and have deleted it. It wasn&#39;t a good idea, and it&#39;s detracting from the important conversation: butlers are pseudo-throwing out of boredom and taking the king with them.</description>

<p>Still think, that current concetrated wine skill is very dull, as you dont even know if you have occupied anyone.<br>
At least make it say say “you occupied someone visiting you”, so that I have some feel of pride making a good choice this night.</p>

            <p>Hah, I had no idea that drunk could lock down the prince. That’s hilarious.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m fine with adding whatever restrictions. It was just a thought anyway. Something besides a situational, one-time king assassination to help give butler a more unique role.</p>

<p>But not like this but that’s why he can’t use execute until night 3</p>

<p>So he loses royal blood and occupy immunity? With no true night abilities, does occupying him even do anything? Like if a drunk happy hours him, can he not execute?</p>

<p>Who the heck can find the NK or MM before day 3? I say if you’re that good, you deserve to get 'em. I guess it could keep bad butlers from yoloing, so it’s fine.</p>

            <p>Soric made a good point that butler is an offensive class and should feel offensive. To me, that means the scum should worry about what happens if the butler finds out they’re scum, but the butler should not himself be able to detect if they are.</p>
<p>Butler can already tie up cult, assassin, and reaper with occupation (at least for a while), but what could he do against possessor, sorcerer, and mastermind?</p>
<p>What if, instead of concentrated wine, the butler gained a night ability with just one charge. Thematically, name it something to reflect a weakening poison slipped into a glass of wine. It permanently removes all of the target’s passive abilities.</p>
<p>Now the butler’s main ability is still weaker than the drunk, but you are a hard counter to the king AND the scariest enemies. You still can’t occupy an enemy into oblivion because the three-times-occupied immunity isn’t a passive, but at least you can open them up for the cold steel or just future occupy visits from yourself. Plus, you have to use it carefully, or you could cost a BD player their own occupy/bleed immunity, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, it opens up fake claims a bit because if you claim an occupy immune class and get occupied, you could try to argue that a butler drugged you. Will that save you? Probably not, but it opens up the social deduction gamespace.</p>
