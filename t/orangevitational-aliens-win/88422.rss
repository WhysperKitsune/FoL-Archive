&lt;/big&gt;

![Crew|690x223, 100%](upload://njEfEojdEqAozBBTrGlzRL7JsnE.jpeg)

&lt;/div&gt;

*You&#39;re travelling through space. You wake up one morning to discover your ship has been sabotaged, the weapons stolen, the captain murdered. Your ship is quickly losing power. You come to the only logical conclusion — aliens have possessed members of your crew and are hiding among you, planning to murder you in your sleep. You need to figure out who among you is really an alien, and kill them before they can kill you.*

&lt;/div&gt;

### **Crewmate Requirements**

1. **Code of Conduct** - All crew members are required to follow the [Global Forum Rules](http://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-rules-please-read-first/244) and the [Forum Game Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-game-rules/78926), lest they be ejected into space through the airlock.

2. **Loyalty to The Cause** - Any attempt to intentionally make your faction lose the game will result in punitive action. All crew members must operate with the goal of winning as your faction. 
3. **Inactivity** - If a crew member hasn&#39;t said anything in 24 hours, they will be prodded for inactivity. If they do not respond to the prod within 12 hours of it being sent, they will be removed and replaced with someone else. Receiving two prods will result in an automatic replacement.
4. **Non-Disclosure Agreement** - All questions and requests to the ship&#39;s computer must be done in private. Any messages delivered to you by the computer are to stay strictly between you and the computer, per your NDA.
5. **Communications Log** - Any attempts to erase or change the backup log the ship&#39;s automated systems keep are strictly forbidden without express permission from said systems, in case of an emergency. (Don&#39;t edit or delete posts.)
6. **Coherency** - Crew members are encouraged to speak in coherent and understandable language, and to avoid rambling on. As such, &quot;spam&quot; will not be tolerated. Excessive posting may result in warnings or disciplinary action.
7. **No Outside Communication** - Crew members are not allowed to communicate with anyone through unauthorized channels.
8. **No Doxxing** - Crew members are not allowed to publicly or privately discuss their own identities or the identities of other crew members at any time. (This is an *anonymous* game - do not do or say anything that may reveal your identity, even if you are not a player.)
9. **Restricted Color** - [color=cornflowerblue]**This**[/color] is the Starship Epiphron Onboard Computer Official Announcement Color. Do not use this color or ones that could be easily mistaken for it.

### **Starship Status**

1. **Small Ship** - After three months of space flight, everyone on the ship has gotten to know each other pretty well. Therefore, you all know each other&#39;s roles (see the Crew Analysis Report below), but not each other&#39;s alignments.

2. **Power Shortage** - In the event of power being cut, the ship will have only 200 hours of power in its battery. Switching off the lights and going to sleep will not drain from its power bank. If the battery runs out, the ship will go permanently dark, which allows aliens to overrun the ship.
3. **Quiet Hours** - Talking in the common areas at night is strictly prohibited. These quiet hours will be 24 hours unless stated otherwise mainly due to host availability
4. **Crew Member Deaths** - Only careful study of deceased crew members can determine whether or not they were host to the alien parasite. As such, only the Coroner will be aware of whether or not deceased crew members were possessed, and he will be unable to determine whether a deceased crew member was a non-infected sympathizer to the aliens.

### **Crew Analysis Report**

*All crew members underwent rigorous background screenings prior to boarding the Starship Epiphron, and the ship&#39;s computer has run a set of tests on each crew member to determine their current status. You may view the details of these checks below.*

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Officer**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Officer|216x500, 50%](upload://dag197VivfIhOHswaSOzeuPzfpo.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; There&#39;s one thing that stands between this ship and absolute chaos, and it&#39;s you. The captain is dead. He was your leader and your friend, and you have to ask yourself: what would he do? The answer is simple. He would lead. And your first task is to make sure these aliens don&#39;t kill anyone else. You&#39;ll see your captain avenged. Despite the apparent breakdown of the chain of command, you are still respected among the crew. When you demand someone is executed, your vote counts as two. You take this responsibility very seriously -- if someone&#39;s going to die, you&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s one of the filthy aliens.
&gt; 
&gt; **As the next in command, your vote counts for double that of any other player during the day.**

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Cryogenics**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Cryogenics|307x500, 50%](upload://qBTX5gLOQI91JIYg5RHOAA6OYSt.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Your role in the mission was to preserve samples in stasis so they&#39;d be unaffected by the oxygen on your ship when you carted them back. You were preserving a handful of plants, but with the right tweaking, you feel you can preserve something... bigger. Say, the room of one of your compatriots. You dare not walk inside, and potentially endanger yourself, but you feel you can freeze a whole room for a night.
&gt; 
&gt; **Each night you may freeze a player, protecting them from attacks but also preventing them from acting.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Scientist**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Scientist|345x500, 50%](upload://3JJuDHSEmcu6bSKFEqWVxKByimj.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; This was supposed to be an easy mission. Collect some plant samples, analyze them, return home. Now, all of a sudden your life is at risk. You&#39;re a botanist, not a xenobiologist. You have no idea what influence alien infestation might have on a host&#39;s DNA -- or even, what a regular human&#39;s DNA is going to look like. But in extraordinary circumstances, people like you rise to do extraordinary things.
&gt; 
&gt; **Each night you may check a player, comparing their alignment to the last player you checked. You may not test yourself.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Security**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Security|252x500, 50%](upload://gxH6CWb1MUrKHIwstBLTNsStpff.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Yeah, the guns have been taken. Fortunately you kept your own. It&#39;s only got one shot left in it — you&#39;ve got to make it count.
&gt; 
&gt; **You have a single bullet left in your gun, and you can use this to kill any one player of your choice at night.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Coroner**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Coroner|235x500, 50%](upload://sKGF4U9qkZm96IQKt3Ov8JymlmN.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Your years of medical training seem wasted in this crisis. You&#39;re prepared to treat wounds and injuries sustained in the regular course of a peaceful mission, but unfortunately, medical science has not been able to keep pace with advanced modern weaponry — if someone shoots you, they&#39;ll kill you. As such, you&#39;re a little out of place in this situation. But there&#39;s more ways to save lives than just healing the sick. You&#39;re the only one on the ship who knows enough about anatomy to perform an autopsy and determine whether a crew member was host to an alien parasite before their death. Your crew members need you to help them determine if a threat has been neutralized, or if the aliens claimed another victim.
&gt; 
&gt; **By performing a basic autopsy on all dead crew members, you are passively informed whether or not any dead players were host to the alien parasite.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Be aware that you can only tell whether or not they had an alien inside them, meaning that you cannot identify the traitor.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Teleporter**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Teleporter|270x500, 50%](upload://xxJozT11FFO183jPnvxiEG6MFYl.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Transporters don&#39;t work like they do in Star Trek. It&#39;s not about destroying and recreating matter. That&#39;s sort of a ridiculous (and destructive) solution to a really basic problem. Really what you do is more about reassigning space via a series of minor wormholes. It&#39;s incredibly confusing to the layperson, so you try not to spend much time explaining it.
&gt; 
&gt; **You may switch the two doors of anyone&#39;s room by teleporting them, causing any action performed on one player to be done instead on the other and vice-versa.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Due to this process requiring a large amount of energy, and with the ships power being rationed, you may only do this twice.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Surveillance**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Surveillance|285x500, 50%](upload://kI0CS0JjF1lODUkwoIk1rZOfAbH.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Your intricate security system has been compromised. Where once you could see every move your crew made, your screens are now completely dark. What was once a comprehensive network of cameras and sensors is now just a mess of frayed wires and shattered consoles. You can still get some of it to work, though you have to allocate your time carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; **Using whatever hasn&#39;t been damaged, you may watch over one player&#39;s room and learn the identity of all who visit that room.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Eavesdropper**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Eavesdropper|350x500, 50%](upload://gYdl0yaQ4ax0WCtxCwwmlThb7WO.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; With the ship&#39;s sensors and scanners out of commission, there&#39;s no reliable way to monitor everyone. Fortunately, you&#39;re a genius. Co-opting some of the equipment from the sensor grid, you&#39;ve been able to construct a crude monitoring device you keep in your room. You&#39;ll register any burst of power, whether from a rifle, stasis unit or teleporter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Each night you will be informed about everyone who was shot, put in stasis, had their room trapped, was drugged, or was teleported.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Communications**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Communications|305x500, 50%](upload://mrx6nmGzQeXi1eRZAlA51kbWUpq.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; We&#39;ve already agreed: we can&#39;t trust each other. So why are we discussing everything out in the open, in front of our enemies? That doesn&#39;t make any sense to you. Fortunately, you&#39;re not really a &quot;rule follower.&quot; Every night, you use your equipment to contact someone in secret. You know the best way to survive is to figure this out yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **During the day you may select a player. The next night you and that player may talk freely with each other.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Student**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Student|239x500, 50%](upload://2edZyOSbChH3BAPzvkK4k5x38vX.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; You were originally here for a semester of job shadowing, so in the current crisis you find yourself way out of your league. However, your time aboard the ship has left you confident you can carry on the work of any crew members that die.
&gt; 
&gt; **Once per game, you may spend a night studying to take on the abilities of a deceased crew member.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Trapsetter**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Trapsetter|279x500, 50%](upload://am1IuK4aTErah4dwGo4LkfsXX0I.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; You acted as the survival guide down in the field, watching over the frightened lab coats and city people on the mission. Ensuring that the wildlife didn&#39;t get to them and that they didn&#39;t end up poisoning themselves or worse. It seems like you&#39;ve somewhat failed at your job in hindsight, but you&#39;re sure you can rectify you&#39;re mistakes. The shame is that you were never one of those catch and release kind of guys.
&gt; 
&gt; **During the night you may set traps at a player&#39;s room, causing all players who visit your target&#39;s room after you to be killed by your traps.**
&gt; 
&gt; **You only have enough traps to accomplish this twice.**

---

&gt; &lt;div align=center&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big&gt;**Facilitator**&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; ![Facilitator|282x500, 50%](upload://wAwWUCLj3ywPpa8N8QtBniGR5wD.png)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt; Drugs are bad. Let&#39;s get that out of the way — there&#39;s no way you would ever endorse the use of drugs, except maybe in the scenario when using the drugs prevents aliens from killing you. It&#39;s okay only in this exact scenario and maybe the movie the Faculty. You&#39;ve used some advanced amphetamines mixed with an adrenaline substitute and come out with something that protects a person from death itself. They also seem overly active and surprisingly tenacious. You hope the drug doesn&#39;t have addictive properties, because you only have two doses. But it probably does have addictive properties. Oh well — problem for another day.
&gt; 
&gt; **During the night you may inject someone with a dose of your drugs, making that player use their night action before any others and making them immune to being killed.**
&gt; 
&gt; **You only have enough doses to administer the drugs to two people.**

[/details]


### **Alignments**
*By intercepting encrypted communications, the computer has determined that there are likely two aliens on board the Starship Epiphron. There are also signs of a third crew member attempting to communicate with the aliens. However, due to the encryption, their identities remain unknown.*

            <p>This all makes sense.</p>
<p>I’ve played in invitational games in the past and they’ve tended to be town-sided in my experience because the players all generally knew each other pretty well and could work well together fairly easily. It makes wolfing in one of those invitational games difficult because not only do you have to break apart a towncore of people who know each other well, but also have to post well enough to infiltrate that towncore yourself.</p>
<p>I agree that worst posters tend to be villagers but I think that’s mostly because of the fact that there are more villagers than wolves, which makes random lurker no. 7653 more likely to be town than not simply because of probability. Generally, I think I am pretty good at recognizing and reading low-hanging fruit townies as town. This game was tough because I couldn’t rely on my strongest aspect of my playstyle because I’m heavily dependent on these townies just giving me <em>something</em>, but the quick executing of people who weren’t in the game thread at the time made it difficult to do that.</p>
<p>It’s why I was so conflicted on Officer for a majority of the game as well. They had some good individual posts that I struggled to see coming from a wolf, but I had a hard time getting past the fact that they weren’t very proactive for most of the game. Without the benefit of meta, I didn’t know if that was how they played as opposed to them being a wolf.</p>
<p>I’m just kinda rambling at this point, but thanks for the feedback. I’ll take it into consideration for future games.</p>

<p>this is definitely true<br>
and I was dead for most of the game but I didn’t particularly want Coroner, Facilitator or Scientist out, so good for the wolves that they killed me lol.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I feel like this game was largely “towncore the players posting well” and “PoE the players not posting / players not posting well.” While that can work <em>sometimes</em>, it’s not going to work <em>always</em>. Wolves can post well if they are good at wolfing, and since this was an invitational game, the odds of wolves knowing what they’re doing were higher. The “not posting well” thing only really works if every villager in the game is posting “well,” and that’s never a given.</p>
<p>My perspective was obviously different from that of a villager, but I actively discouraged reading the “best posters” and encouraged pushing the “worst posters” because I knew that would probably lead to a wolf victory. In my experience, “worst posters” are typically going to be villagers. “Wolfy posters” are not the same thing as “worst posters.” Same thing with “villagery posters” - it is not the same thing as “good posters.”</p>
<p>The townies I defended, the ones the town misyeeted, I think I defended for good enough reasons. I was trying to find Points of Villageriness within. I defended them for towncred and caved in rather easily, sure, but I had no TMI, so I could make actual reads.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is, the Comms → Coroner → Facilitator → Scientist misyeets all happened because of post <em>quality</em> and not because of post <em>wolfiness</em> / lack of post <em>villageriness</em>. That’s my impression, anyway.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/prophylaxis">@Prophylaxis</a> Maybe that’ll help?</p>

            <p>Yeah, the time thing was something I was worried about early, but as the game went on I realized we could have been using way more time and it would have massively improved our play. Sadly days 3/4/5 kind of just sped up and it was hard to argue against it. (I also wasn’t thinking very clearly on the later days)</p>
<p>Should just be more vocal when impending doom is arriving I guess.</p>

            <p>I think I could have definitely played better if I wasn’t busy that week</p>
<p>Most of my town game revolves around solving and getting myself cleared by solving, and I wish I was able to put in more time</p>
<p>Still fun though - would definitely play again with yall</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think I’ve said this a couple of times already, but would greatly appreciate feedback on what I could have done better this game, from anyone who actually took the time to read through the end there.</p>
<p>I take a fair bit of pride in my towngame and it’s rare for me to play a game where I get completely shellacked. I know Cryo/Firekitten snowed me completely but I was so goddarn confused for most of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>On a serious note, I’m going to use this post as a opportunity to talk more about what orange talked about previously. Not that this is your fault or anything, but orange is completely right in the fact that town threw away half their remaining time this game.  People shouldn’t be worried about losing too much time in the early game because you can always speed up later game and your mistakes in the early game can lead to a snowball effect similar to this game. If town gave a day or so more on D1, communications could have used that time as a opportunity to clear themselves and switch the wagon to someone else, ect.</p>
<p>In other words, I believe that your play this game towards the end is the exact thing that you should have been doing. You should have been trying to slow the game down, because <em>when the game gets slowed down, the game gets harder to control for scum</em>. Unfortunately, we were in a situation where we could use that play and label it as scummy, but that’s how it goes I guess.</p>
