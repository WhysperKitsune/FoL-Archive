    <description>Even in the darkest of days, there will be shining gems from an academy. Sought after by many, the graduates are said to be the brightest amongst the cohort. 

Characters will be students in a military school. YEAR 1. Characters will be placed in one SINGULAR class.

_Topics include:_
Battle
Study Notes {To be listed}
History Timeline{To be listed}
Organisations {Process}
Locations {DONE}
NPCs {Done}

Don&#39;t worry about studying, you won&#39;t have to answer too many questions while you&#39;re here. 
And even if you don&#39;t, there will be notes available for you to refer to. 

If you think it&#39;s only school life that awaits you, you&#39;re dead wrong.
The wind is blowing. Turbulence would soon strike the land at its heart.

History is in the making. 
What will the students do in times of civil unrest? This military academy is famous after all, churning out tacticians and great vanguards. 

ACT 0: Prologue - A new beginning.
Students will acquaint themselves with their classmates. Learn about their curriculum and the academy grounds as well. As this is a military academy, it is a boarding school. The few teachers in the school are all reasonably experienced, to guide you through the academy life.
Our dear characters at the age of 17(if older or younger, specify through character background) will enter a new stage of life. Those black jackets and white overalls are the uniforms that they have been given.

I hope to have 2 more people be part of the class before I kick off the RP. An average class size of this academy is 8~12 people after all.</description>

            <p>Btw<br>
No need to RP the specifics of the game.</p>
<p>Just state “They had a good time playing a card game.”</p>

            <p>Also, be more specific about stuff, because I have 0 idea what “it” could be at times.<br>
In fact, when asking questions, treat me like a 5-year-old. I can’t deduce automatically what “that” or “it” could possibly mean.</p>

            <p>I have to maintain consistency.<br>
Each person is to state their intentions in their own posts. Even if you are friends irl, and telling that yes this was allowed, it doesn’t mean that everyone else are irl buddies as well, and help them go along as well.</p>
<p><em>If you want to control another person’s character, do it in a messaging platform and screenshot the conversation. And post it here, or DM directly to me.</em> I’ll double confirm everything to ensure integrity and no fuck ups in the RP.</p>

You may control your character, but you cannot control other player’s characters. I’m an exception because I have to regulate everyone and advance the story.</p>
<p><em>The Trio headed, oh no you don’t. Each person has to advance their character individually.</em></p>

            <p>You have to understand I’m the GM and I’m the one giving out possibilities to everyone, but what did I offer I don’t get it</p>
<p>The chance to explain to Elise what Sepith was?<br>
(Btw the RP is fine, but I’m more than confused on this thread)</p>

            <p>The progression of this convo is<br>
Damned weird &gt;_&gt;<br>
Like I have no idea what you’re talking about Out of Character</p>
<p>Aka<br>
1 -&gt; You ask Question.<br>
2 -&gt; I answer Question.<br>
3 -&gt; Thus you state you already explained Sepith to answer Elise’s question (so I’m like…)<br>
4 -&gt; And Im like oh, then why did you ask the question…<br>
5 -&gt; You thought I will say no and thus not wait for a reply…??? But I’ll still take the info tho</p>
<p>HELLO?? WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES THAT MEAN</p>
