    <title>Developer Update 11/12/17</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/developer-update-11-12-17/12975</link>
    <description>Currently the win rates for the 3 main factions are within 5% of each other. While the win rates are close, certain things can heavily influence the outcome of a game, so we’re currently working on minimizing the chances of that happening. We’re going to be testing several changes out on a test server over the next week, so we can get some additional feedback before rolling out a patch. (We have already chosen who will get into the test server. We will let them know when the server is ready.)

The Death Knight is going to be adjusted, so its impact is roughly the same throughout the game. It will still be better to use it later in the game than sooner no matter what the changes end up being, but shouldn’t have as large of an impact late-game.

The Cult is getting changed so their killing power is more consistent throughout the game.

The King’s Allies ability is going to be adjusted. At the moment it is leading to the death of every neutral that is found with the ability. 

We’re aware that some classes aren’t very fun to play for many people, so we’re also working on improving that while trying not to impact the balance too heavily. We’ll be looking at the Court Wizard, Drunk, and Noble.

We’re adding a tutorial match to the game to help new players better understand the core mechanics of the game before going into their first match.

We also have been spending the past week making the lobby more stable with less timeouts and a more-reliable friends list. These upgrades will also be on the new test server.</description>

            <p>I’m not arguing for or against NKs.  I’m saying, specifically, the win/loss rates aren’t a valid argument for or against them. There are certainly other arguments for and against them that are valid, and I’d rather the discussion focus on those.</p>
<p>I actually agree that as the game is, it needs NKs.  The game <em>could be</em> change so that isn’t the case, though.</p>

            <p>If that’s your reasoning then I will have you know that NK’s are important to balencing the game.</p>
<p>For the BD it prevents the Prince from cheesing the game. You can’t just jail the assassin or cult leader the whole game because the NK could kill you or the healers stoping the assassin/CL from killing you in the day. Without the NK the game is too easy to solve.</p>
<p>For the Evils it gives them a reason to be looking for lies that are ment to blend in. It’s not hard for the unseen/cult to find the scorned but the reaper/Possessor is much harder. It also gives them a reason to try and get protection so that they don’t die.</p>
<p>For both sides it makes death more likely and thus support more valuable.</p>

            <p>On a big enough timeline after enough games played, yes, skilled players will, on average, win more games.  However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t still desirable to reduce the effect of luck when possible. Unless you are advocating that balancing win rates via luck is inherently superior to balancing win rates via skill, I don’t see your point.</p>
<p>If it was theoretically possible to have a magical game where the more skilled players won every time, wouldn’t you want that?  And therefore isn’t getting as close to that as is possible not a good thing?</p>

<p>Solid post. I really agree with it.</p>
<p>But i still think NK is what cause most of the RNG of the game.</p>

<p>It would make the game way too static and borring for everyone else. Playing with the NK adds so much to the game.</p>

</aside>
<p>NK killing prince n1, or NK killing the cult leader n1, literally completly change the outcome of the game. Its just an RNG role imo.</p>

            <p>Tbh, if you remove NKs (poss and reaper), i think it will already calm down the whole “neuts out” meta. And it will make the game way less luck based.</p>

            <p>Adding a new Faction ? perhaps, Instead of “neutral” call it something different, that indicate they are neutral, perhaps “Ancestors of *****” Or something a neutral clan that kills/trades/ does certain thing?</p>

            <p>I dont think neutsout is a big a thing as it used to be , Players that clam it on the stand are in trouble , but earlier claimers often can be excepted .</p>
<p>even saw a BD hung the other day because he was the only guy who voted ex when the consensus was to save the the alch .</p>
<p>His defence was pitiful though .</p>
<p>Omg guys <span class="hashtag">#neutsout</span>.  was the only thing he said on the stand .</p>
