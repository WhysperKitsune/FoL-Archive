    <description>**The Prince&#39;s Pride**

The King’s progeny spent his years growing up in Castle Adiart watching strange people pass through from lands near and far. He analysed the antics of many diverse faces and factions in the hope that one day his reticent father would entrust him with responsibility over the kingdom he was set to inherit. Any curious observer may be surprised to occasionally find the Prince sneaking through King’s private quarters at night, piecing together information that his father is too seemingly too busy or overwhelmed to take notice of. 

It wasn’t until a sheriff’s keen eye picked out the errors in the declarations of a nobleman long considered an ally of the royal family that the Court became ridden with chaos. The discovery that the King had put his faith in the hands of a traitor and that the sycophantic noble had been plotting against the valiant Blue Dragon longer than he had been a friend of it stirred accusations of treachery among the town. 

With his already confused allies thrown into disarray by the revelation, the King had no choice but to pass a piece of his authority on to the one person he truly knew the Kingdom could trust; his own son.  

The Prince was overjoyed that he was finally equipped with the influence he rightfully deserved over the kingdom he was heir to. Considering himself untouchable due to his royal blood, the Prince adjusted to his new power and wields it with ease. He was given the keys to the castle’s abandoned dungeons, reopened in the face of the court’s traitors, and tasked with imprisoning suspects of the Kingdom in order to gain information. 

The magnitude of this responsibility does not bother the overconfident Prince. Members of the Blue Dragon are becoming woefully aware of his naivety and fear he will meet his demise at the hands of the enemies he unwittingly sets free. Others grow increasingly wary of the potential consequences of entrusting such a proud young royal with the fate of the Kingdom. And the King? Well, the addition of his imperious son to the court only increases the number of competitors to the throne...</description>
