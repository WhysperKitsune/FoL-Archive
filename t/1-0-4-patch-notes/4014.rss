    <title>1.0.4 Patch Notes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/1-0-4-patch-notes/4014</link>
    <description>## General:
* Player&#39;s will no longer show up in their room during the death recap. They will now show up in places around the castle. For now there are only 8 spots, but more will be added as time goes on. Feel free to suggest ideas.
* Prince&#39;s prison has been reworked some. This might help with crashes some people were having. If you crash in the prison, try the lowest quality setting and let us know if that fixes it.
* Added a little in-game tutorial that displays to players in their first 3 games.
* Added a display in the top right that says the possible number of each faction in the game. It will not display the possible number of each class type or what classes are in the game. This will only be displayed if you have the Extra Info setting on.
* Added more info the Royal Blood passive. Now clearly states that it is kept when converted to the Cult.

## Hunter:
* Wolf will no longer attack jailed players. Hunter will not know.

## Bug Fixes:
* The healing flash and blank message when you didn&#39;t require any healing has been fixed.
* Sometimes the MM couldn&#39;t become an Assassin when using Dirty Work, this has been fixed.
* Fixed the 16th player&#39;s button in the player panel.
* Scorned no longer wins every game.
* A bunch more.</description>

            <p>Someone earlier said that in a Possessor game, they took over the Alche’s body that always healed the confirmed Prince, and when he failed to heal the Prince, the Prince got wind of it and then executed the Possessor.</p>
<p>Had a talk to that guy and said that it should have been fixed when the Physi had a patch so I think he took that further with Blos after me suggesting that it could still be bugged.</p>

            <p>OK cool that’s what I thought, so it was a bug that was patched out just before I started playing, but it appears many players didn’t take the time to read the patch notes yet, since quite a few still think it’s an existing mechanic. Just wanted to make sure it wasn’t an intended mechanic that I was too blind to see.</p>

            <p>The flash used to show when Physician/Alchemist attempted to heal someone, even if they didn’t require healing. This was fixed, now you only get the flash when you’re actually healed. It was a bug that pretty much confirmed Alchemist/Physician’s existence and alibi.</p>

            <p>“The healing flash and blank message when you didn’t require any healing has been fixed.”</p>
<p>Can someone explain the before and after of this one to me. I’m just starting out (pretty much started the same day as this patch), a phys was telling me he was confirmed by healing me, when I saw nothing (though was just starting out so didn’t know to look for a flash), but I don’t recall seeing any flash.</p>
<p>I see a few notes saying this is “fixed”, but that doesn’t really tell me intended and unintended.</p>
<p>Is phys supposed to show a green flash even if his target is not in danger, of which the fix was making it show always?</p>
<p>or is the flash showing when the person does not need healing the bug, which was fixed?</p>

            <p>I love the new death locations<br>
However please can we have them not appear the same place on the same day bodies are found<br>
For example, 2 people killed, both appear on the stairs…<br>
Make it so they all appear in different locations as a rule.<br>
(Its very confusing when the screen stays the same and the bodies switch)</p>

            <p>I think maybe <strong>sometimes</strong> they should be found dead in their room, and othertimes found elsewhere in the castle, would make sense- right?</p>
<p>/shrug Like, sometimes they would be killed in their sleep, othertimes while they’re doing something. Just an idea.</p>

            <h2>General:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Player’s will no longer show up in their room during the death recap. They will now show up in places around the castle. For now there are only 8 spots, but more will be added as time goes on. Feel free to suggest ideas.</li>
<li>Prince’s prison has been reworked some. This might help with crashes some people were having. If you crash in the prison, try the lowest quality setting and let us know if that fixes it.</li>
<li>Added a little in-game tutorial that displays to players in their first 3 games.</li>
<li>Added a display in the top right that says the possible number of each faction in the game. It will not display the possible number of each class type or what classes are in the game. This will only be displayed if you have the Extra Info setting on.</li>
<li>Added more info the Royal Blood passive. Now clearly states that it is kept when converted to the Cult.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hunter:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wolf will no longer attack jailed players. Hunter will not know.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The healing flash and blank message when you didn’t require any healing has been fixed.</li>
<li>Sometimes the MM couldn’t become an Assassin when using Dirty Work, this has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed the 16th player’s button in the player panel.</li>
<li>Scorned no longer wins every game.</li>
<li>A bunch more.</li>
</ul>
