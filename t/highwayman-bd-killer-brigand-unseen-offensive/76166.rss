**Cripling Shot (1 use):** Attacking someone with Pistol Shot will also occupy them tonight.

**Night:**
**Pistol Shot (2 use):** Attack a player. You will not attack if redirected. Cannot be used before n2.
**Riposte (0 use):** You will attack everyone that attacked you tonight. (MAX 1)

*Damn -- I missed your eyes!*

<p>Why would you use Sacrifice if you can just PBS? Or am I reading this wrong?</p>

<p>How about it has a 1 use attack at night that bleeds them to go along with their passive.<br>
Also a mafioso type ability where they perform the kill for the assassin instead, and maybe a day ability that also causes the kill to occupy</p>

<p>Allowing that rampage was kinda my idea lol</p>
<p>Means you can still take two shots post-bleed rather than just 1</p>
<p>Still, your class, edits seem positive <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>The class was carefuly designed around the current “killers out” meta. Creating a Killer that doesn’t want to be outed because he’s an easier target than the Prince to kill should stop yolo upping all Killers as well as give some claimspace to the evils.</p>
<p><s>^ obviously this is a lie, I created it in like 30 minutes while I couldn’t fall asleep, but subconsciously it ended up like that</s></p>

            <p>So I know you already saw this but here’s how I’d change the Highwayman</p>
<p><strong>Guilty Conscience</strong> should be disabled if you are bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Shot</strong> could afford to have an extra use (two total) at the start, and if it needs a nerf later just drop it back to one.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling Shot</strong> should instead power up your night abilities, and start with zero uses.</p>
<p><strong>Pistol Shot</strong> should start with two uses (instead of three), and pierce immunity when powered up by Crippling Shot.</p>
<p><strong>Riposte</strong> should start with zero uses, and should kill <em>all</em> visitors when powered up with Crippling Shot.</p>
<p>I actually really do like this class a lot with these changes, and while I will not try to push them on you if you don’t, I’m at least gonna suggest them. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’d also probably change most of Brigand’s abilities (you already saw why before, no need to repeat myself), but frankly I’ve already spent something like eight hours analyzing Killer classes and I’m not gonna come up with effectively an entirely new class. Feel free to do whatever I guess lol <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
