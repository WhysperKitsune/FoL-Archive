    <description>![CW Possible Bug|690x255](upload://2LYUOErtAIqMcKbJ0ZdwjH8BoU9.png)

I was playing Court Wizard and I chose to ice ward a hunter. I did not get attacked, nor did I get possessed, and from what I heard from the possessor, he had not possessed myself or the hunter, and I ended up being killed by the hunter&#39;s bear trap.

If I really was killed icewarding this hunter, I believe that&#39;s a bug.</description>
