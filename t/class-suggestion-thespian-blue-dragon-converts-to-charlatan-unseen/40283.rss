    <title>[Class Suggestion] Thespian (Blue Dragon) converts to Charlatan (Unseen)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-thespian-blue-dragon-converts-to-charlatan-unseen/40283</link>
    <description>I really like the idea of a Shakespearean actor in the kingdom. So here&#39;s one. Since King&#39;s ally ability is gone, let&#39;s see if we can rework it to be less overbearing and more related to deduction...

----

**Thespian** (Blue Dragon) - An adept actor skilled at seeing truth in fiction.
[Icon: **Actor in green cloak and &quot;Comedy&quot; mask.**]

Passive:
**Background Actor**
[Icon: A silhouette in the distance.]
Others will be &#39;prevented&#39; from investigating you for the first 3 nights.

Day Ability:
**Poor Yorick**
[Icon: A skull in a jester&#39;s hat.]
Choose a single dead player to speak to that night. The dead player will only hear you, not the other dead, so no asking other ghosts for info that night. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Unmask**
[Icon: A hand lifting someone else&#39;s expressionless mask off their face.]
Determine if a player is Neutral. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**King&#39;s Conscience**
[Icon: A heavy-looking crown. :P ]
Determine if a player is allied to the current King. No further information given. (4 uses.)

----

Converts to...

----

**Charlatan** (Unseen)
[Icon: **Actor in purple cloak and &quot;Tragedy&quot; mask.**]

Day Ability:
**Ear Poison**
[Icon: Hand holding a small dropper of poison.]
Send one whisper to the King under your target&#39;s name. Everyone but your target will see your target as the whisperer. Whisper simply does not appear to your target. Similar to Trollbox, but ALWAYS a whisper to the King. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**What Fools These Mortals Be**
[Icon: Silhouette of someone laughing very outlandishly.]
Select two players. The first will be falsely told they were redirected to the second. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Something Rotten**
[Icon: Something... and it looks rotten. XD ]
Cause a player to have a Neutral Killer&#39;s results when investigated. (3 uses.)</description>

            <p>Renamed “Mask Lift” to “Unmask”. Dumb I didn’t think of that in the first place.</p>

            <p>Yep, picking a dead player to talk to would basically be like trying to pick the brains of the ghosts. Making the ghost not be able to hear the other ghosts that night is just to prevent “OMFG Thespian’s talking to me! Everyone tell me what you know now!” and encourages people to actually talk in dead chat beforehand, and ideally not all just quit. XD</p>

            <p>As a working actor, I must respond to this suggestion!</p>
<p>This is certainly an Investigative class that has elements of Social, with the Charlatan being Offensive. It’s hard to categorize the class in this way, and I would recommend streamlining the class so it fits more cleanly into a category.</p>

<p>An interesting investigative ability that I like. It doesn’t just tell you the answer. You can <em>always</em> be wrong about the King’s faction - I’ve been proven wrong on d7 plenty of times. At the least, it gives you more useful information to work with.</p>

<p>Interesting, but that person could just repeat whatever the dead have been discussing.</p>
