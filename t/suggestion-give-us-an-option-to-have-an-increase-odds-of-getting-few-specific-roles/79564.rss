    <title>Suggestion: Give us an option to have an increase odds of getting few specific roles</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-give-us-an-option-to-have-an-increase-odds-of-getting-few-specific-roles/79564</link>
    <description>Can we lets say, pick 3 roles as our favorite role, and every game we play, we get slightly higher chance of getting those roles?

Also, as an expansion to that, everyone hates some roles, so another option would be to choose the least favorite role, in order to decrease the chance of getting it.

Edit: To get around the problem when one player is known to play good or evil role, would be to force players who use this feature to use default (random) name, or alternatively force them to use a different chosen name each game.

I would argue that in theory the &#39;known evil&#39; problem sounds bad, but in practice it wouldn&#39;t be common at all, as well as, once somebody gets killed for being a known evil, he would learn himself that he should use different name each game and would solve the problem on his own, therefore if this will be a problem it will only be a problem for a short time after release of the feature.</description>

            <p>I think this only affects the BD and NK faction, since (I believe) vast majority of players would prefer to play MM over assassin, and CL over random cult.</p>
<p>also, (again I believe), most players prefer to be evil/good rather than a specific role.</p>
<p>My solution (which I will now add to the main thread) is to force everyone who use the feature to use a default name, or force them to switch name each game.</p>

            <p>This can be worked around easily by either forcing the players who use the feature to go with (random) default name, or just pick a different name they didn’t use before in game, also even if a player uses the same name I doubt this will be a real problem.</p>

            <p>I think the best solution is this: You select your favorite role for each faction. Example</p>
<p>BD: Butler<br>
Unseen: None<br>
Cult: Invoker<br>
Neutral: Sellsword<br>
NK: Reaper</p>
<p>Then, when you roll that faction, you are more likely to roll your favorite role.</p>

            <p>Can we lets say, pick 3 roles as our favorite role, and every game we play, we get slightly higher chance of getting those roles?</p>
<p>Also, as an expansion to that, everyone hates some roles, so another option would be to choose the least favorite role, in order to decrease the chance of getting it.</p>
<p>Edit: To get around the problem when one player is known to play good or evil role, would be to force players who use this feature to use default (random) name, or alternatively force them to use a different chosen name each game.</p>
<p>I would argue that in theory the ‘known evil’ problem sounds bad, but in practice it wouldn’t be common at all, as well as, once somebody gets killed for being a known evil, he would learn himself that he should use different name each game and would solve the problem on his own, therefore if this will be a problem it will only be a problem for a short time after release of the feature.</p>
