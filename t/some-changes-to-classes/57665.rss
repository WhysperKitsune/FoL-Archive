    <description>## Mastermind:
Change Foresight to:
&gt;**Foresight (Night) -** Target a player to see who visits them and who they visited at night. 4 uses.

Even though Observer is a hard class to prove , it can&#39;t be easily faked. Giving an evil the ability to watch visits will make people doubt Observer claims and give MM&#39;s a better option to fake. You can still fake princess , but you&#39;ll have to rely on people to actually out their class/claim.

**EDIT** - I no longer stand by this change 100%. ^

## Hunter:
Change Wolf Companion to:
&gt;**Wolf Companion (Day)** - Summon a wolf to attack someone. They will bleed and die tonight unless healed. Unusable until Day 3.  2 uses.

Hunter is a unique class that can easily prove himself with his night ability. Making the circumstances more akin to a Cult Leader&#39;s bleed would help in case there was no Hunter.

## Assassin:
Change Distract to:
&gt;**Distract (Day)** - Target player will be occupied tonight. Infinite Uses.

Right now, if you are occupied in an Unseen game. It&#39;s probably by a Blue Dragon member. Most converts become an Assassin/Mastermind after a while, so you can mostly trust someone who claims Butler/Drunk. While this wont solve Drunk claims, it can throw shade on Bulter claims and hinder the Blue Dragon.


**EDIT** - I no longer stand by this change. ^

## Drunk:
Change Debauchery to:
&gt;**Debauchery (Night)** - Get in a player’s way, causing them to target you. You will heal yourself off any attacks redirected towards you, and you will be conversion immune. Infinite Uses.

I really liked the change that happened with Sheriff&#39;s scout. It still has its initial function , but now has some ambiguity. I would like this to apply with the Drunk&#39;s debauch too. A bonus , reapers won&#39;t automatically be destroyed by Drunk&#39;s if this change is added!

## Herbalist:
&gt;Change type from Offensive to Social.

The Herbalist , quite strangely, has no offensive abilities, but is still considered Offensive. Changing the Herbalist&#39;s class type to Social would fit with their abilities more, and also prevent the Mastermind slipping up on a Princess claim if they find one , and a Princess not being able to know if they were converted.</description>

<p>In this meta, yeah.  But I think in a veteran sort of lobby, nobody would accept that “Obs” claim without you first posting all your logs.</p>

            <p>We are not living in the day 2, everyone compare all your logs against everyone else’s logs immediately.  Sellsword/Merc/Butler/Prince jails give enough reason to be prevented every once in a while and it not be suspicious. Bus one of your assassins for once or do a more tricky one where you call out your third convert for lying in his logs what he visited and you’re “proven” observer in this meta.</p>
<p>Conversely your unseen friends might jump in and claim that occupation. If they get caught, you can just say you were prevented and it must have been some other way it happened. I am not saying fakeclaiming observer is not without its risks, but it is definitely in the realm of possibilities.</p>
<p>Ps. Everyone it’s Peek, not Peak. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>N1, follow x, prevented? Doesn’t seem THAT hard. Observer definitely needs to be toned down in powerlevel. I think this is not the way to do it, but it is not too bad of a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>anyone vouch for that prevention? Basically only works if you’ve gotten a servant… or are willing to have an unseen Make the even harder to fake butler claim. After all unseen couldn’t possibly have had a servant already on n1.</p>
<p>far as unnanounced visits, off the top of my head<br>
alc<br>
phys<br>
knights guard<br>
sheriff’s check<br>
princess’s checks<br>
CW’s shield<br>
merc’s guard ? (not sure if that one counts as a visit)</p>
<p>That’s quite a long list of things that possibly happens to someone that are unlikely to be announced prior to the person dying, that are likely to be called out. If BD is competent. Though yes currently there’s a lot of incompetent players that would let something like that slide.</p>
<p>Peak yes very easy to fake… but if someone is peaking something other than a suspected unseen before having a LOT of good visits recorded… they would be a terrible observer (again something that might work in the current rung of terrible players, but would immidiately explode if we ever got ranked or vets mode)</p>

            <p>Technically the wiki only defines social class and not social ability.  But regardless I’m sticking to my definition of social as involving the chatbox in particular and not the chat system in general.  I’m curious what the devs would define social as.</p>

            <p>Thing is, the odds of an unannounced visit messing up the logs is minimal.</p>
<p>Out of the 16 players, 1 is the King, 1 is the Prince, 1 is the NK, and 3 are Unseen ergo you will know who they visit. So by default at n1, at least 2 players do not have abilities that count as visits, 1 will kill anyone who they visit ergo you will know if they visited a person or not, and for three players you will know precisely who they visited. Usually one or two BD die the first night in Unseen games, so you will know who the dead people visit as they will have it in their logs.</p>
<p>Also remember that players that are occupied, jailed, prevented, or spying Nobles, Hunters, Mystics, Inquisitors, Princes, and Fools do not visit, so mathematically the number of players who will have unannounced visits is not that high, as to qualify for an unannounced visit then it would have to come from a visiting BD-aligned class that was not role-blocked, lived to the following day, and did not speak out and made their logs public the following day.</p>
<p>Claiming Obs is not a flawless strategy, but perfect fake claims such as Knights, Sheriffs, and Court Wizards will always bring suspicion onto you.</p>

<p>Burrito has made a convincing case for why Mastermind shouldn’t have this foresight and I definitely see where he is coming from.</p>

<p>Actually Vandalay has changed my mind.  I think making Foresight the same as Observer Follow would be fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This change has already been implemented into Forum of Lies , so I guess i should add that if you use wolf , u cant use bear that night and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay I would support that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, game balance trumps over thematic sense. This is one case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the point is to make Debauch useless against Reaper, why not just let Reap bypass the Drunk’s immunity?  Adding a self-heal just makes it an unnecessarily complicated change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This does not make sense as all of his abilities are social.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Per the wiki’s definition of social, which I agree with, none of his abilities are social since an ability is social only if it affects the chatbox.</p>
<p>Which means the only abilities in the game that are social are Trollbox, Telepathy, Link Minds, Conduit, Distract, and Icy Touch.  And to a certain extent, Imprison since it hides Prince’s identity in the chat, although the prevention effect (offensive) is more significant.</p>

<p>I mean even if you do pay attention to details, it is still going to be almost impossible.</p>
<p>It probably works because BD is dumb but there is almost no way any class other than NW can fake it perfectly.</p>
<p>But you can sorta claim it as MM if:</p>
<p>BD are dumb<br>
You pay attention to every little detail</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I always claim Obs as MM and it works 95%+ of the time as long as you pay notice to every little detail in the match and are well-versed in the game’s mechanics. You can base your follows off your teammates’ visits, the logs of dead players, and any little detail that comes up during the day, such as a Drunk claiming they were successful in redirecting a person the last night. Adjust your logs based on attempts at occupying you, add a prevented/occupied if you’re not feeling entirely safe with a night, and make sure you Peek only at late game. Peeks are the easiest as you’ll know all the players who are Unseen, and barring the Prince every BD-aligned player can be converted while every neutral cannot, so your Foresight will let you automatically know a player’s faction as long as they aren’t the Prince.</p>
<p>Assume the following game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the Mastermind[6], and you know who is the Assassin[3] and you just converted a Duchess[13] the first night.<br>
The Assassin[3] killed a Physician[9], who healed the Duchess[13] the previous night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the coming night the Duchess informs you that she visited Killer/Off[14] during the first night, so via that information and 9’s logs you put n1: Follow 13 - [9]&gt;[13]&gt;[14].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>D3 comes the Assassin[3] dies to the NK and a Noble[4] is upped for claim as the court has reason to believe that he is the Possessor. The Butler[11] confirms him as not occupy immune as he visited the accused last night, thus he’s pardoned. You know that 11 visited 4 due to mutual confirmation from both and that since 4 was occupied then he did not visit anyone. So you put n2: Follow 4 - [11]&gt;[4]&gt;[None].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For N3 you want to convert the Butler to make up for the dead assassin, but he partied and occupied you, so since you know that he used a party you can easily put n3: Follow 11 - Occupied. You also noticed that the Sheriff[5]'s log has him visiting the Noble[4] n2, so you also add that to your second night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Killer/Off[14] claims Hunter D4 and in N4 you attempt to use Foresight on him, and he cannot be converted. The Prince[8] died N3, so Killer/Off must be a neutral, likely the NK. So come D5 and you accuse him claiming N4: Peek 14 - Neutral.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By the end of this day, your log will look like:<br>
Mastermind the Observer<br>
N1: Follow 13 - [9]&gt;[13]&gt;[14]<br>
N2: Follow 4 - [11,5]&gt;[4]&gt;[none]<br>
N3: Follow 11 - Occupied/Prevented<br>
N4: Peek 14 - Neutral<br>
This makes the log look extremely convincing, especially as you’ve also found the NK, to the point that BD will likely not look too deep into it and will automatically assume that you’re either a legit Observer or at least a Nightwatch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A game won’t look 100% like this, but as long as you pay attention to every single detail that’s going on it’ll be extremely easy to pull this off. The sheer amount of information that comes from Follow is a double-edged sword for BD as not only makes it difficult to fake unless you have an eye for detail, but if you’re good at faking it then BD will always assume them to be legitimate and not take any second glances at it. Hell, I’ve even pulled this shit when I was a Reaper and it worked far better than I thought.</p>
<p>As a side note, know who visits and who does not, as the Mystic, the Prince, the Hunter, the Inquisitor, and the Sorcerer at times do not count as visits. A player that was the first target of Puppet Strings will in addition visit the Puppet Strings’ second target along with their original visit. You can use this as a way to frame people and gives an excuse to cause mislynches as a Possessor, but I don’t recommend it as most of BD are absolutely ignorant of Poss mechanics and will end up executing you for all the wrong reasons.</p>

            <p>N1, follow x, prevented? Doesn’t seem THAT hard. Observer definitely needs to be toned down in powerlevel. I think this is not the way to do it, but it is not too bad of a fix.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When it comes to observer, there is nowhere inbetween impossible and easy without changing his primary ability. Actually I would say in this case… in the hands of MM… it observer would still be a suicide claim if people are paying attention.</p>
<p>Why? because really the 2 most important days to check on an observers will, are n1-2. That’s when there’s the most visits… almost anyone you checked should have like an 80% chance of having both visited and been visited by someone. Also N1-2 is where no non idiotic BD should ever accept a “peak” (who in the right mind would peak when… unseen or cult can’t have their first convert yet, MM is still detection immune, you can’t have had any leads to even try and do a good target… and most scorneds/fools are more likely to be using their frame ability than on any other day, Peak day 1 is effectively a 5% chance of catching an evil, 5% chance of falling for a frame, and a 90% chance of finding a BD… one which you would have no way to know if he was converted that very same night).</p>
<p>In short, if a MM wanted to do an observer act… he probably would need to actively chose not to convert until night 3 or later… As anything else would massively highlight the absense.</p>

            <p>Here’s a handy trick to check if a night action is social or not.</p>
<p>Investigative - The system is giving you feedback</p>
<p>Social - You are influencing someone else’s feedback</p>
<p>Note: Giving someone else the ability to do a social action on you is still social.</p>
<p>This means that gossip is social because it transfers feedback rather than creating it. And Drug is social because it gives someone else feedback. Yes that means that a sheriff that gave someone else his feedback would be social.</p>
