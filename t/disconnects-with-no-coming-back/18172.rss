    <title>Disconnects with no coming back</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/disconnects-with-no-coming-back/18172</link>
    <description>What happened: Since the hotfix that fixed erroneous messages about powers not working properly, almost every single game I&#39;ve tried to play, I have been disconnected at some random time, usually before night 2. I even was disconnected during name select once, stuck there and had to kill the process. But the worst part is that the game doesn&#39;t manage to reconnect me... I remain on the Trying to reconnect screen for a whiile, then back to the menu screen.

During those (failing) reconnecting screens, I can navigate the internet normally on Firefox, Chrome, you name it. My connection seems to be ok, some package losses but I mean, I manage to play League of Legends or Hearthstone so it should be fine...

I have had some disconnections before sometimes (I assume when package losses peak), but I always reconnected in seconds. But I haven&#39;t managed to reconnect once since the hotfix I mentioned. It makes me feel bad for being unable to play the game, and it makes me feel guilty for ruining the game for others with my early disconnects and never coming back.


What was SUPPOSED to happen: Not disconnecting would be great, but actually managing to reconnect me to the game would be a start.


Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Play the game.
2. ???

            <p>There were some bugs regarding reconnection and so on in previous patches; recent patches have fixed these (as far as we know).</p>

            <p>Yeah, been happening a lot lately.</p>
<p>No one ever comes back.  If you crash you <em>really</em> never come back.</p>
