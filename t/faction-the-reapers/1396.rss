**Reaper**
Faction: Reapers 
Room: Cult Room

_Having learned that Corax missed a sacrifice soon after the Black Rose were stomped out of Castle Adiart for good, the Reapers rose to exterminate all of humanity, after the Cultists received their due punishment of death._

The Reapers become an independent faction with two members, both of which are Reapers (Black Rose and Cult do not spawn with them anymore) 

Passive: Brotherhood: Immune to death at night. If somehow killed anyways, consume one soul to remain alive. Killing entities grants you one soul into the soul chamber, which you and your partner share. 

Passive: Blades of Corax: If a Reaper dies, your next attack passes clean through them, flaying the skin from the bones. This converts them into a Reaper. Max: 2 Reapers.


Night 1: Reap Infinite Uses: Reap the soul of a player, killing them and leaving an empty body for 2 days. They cannot speak to or be revived by The Priest. Other Reapers are Immune. If the body is hung, the Mark of Corax is revealed on them, letting the Castle know that there are Reapers.

Day 1: Icy Touch: 2uses, Target is frozen solid, rendered an &quot;empty body&quot; for the day. They regain consciousness if not killed that night. You may use a soul to gain an extra use

Night 2: Dark Gaze: Occupy a target at night.

            <p>I changed it up.</p>
<p>I think it could be a good idea, even if changed up a bit to separate it from the Reaper</p>
