            <p>I understand how you think we have too many healers, maybe this class and the alchemist do not spawn together, and one one physician will spawn in a Clergy game. Yeah, that seems like a good idea.</p>

            <p>I like more convertible Neuts.<br>
But we really don’t need more Healers.<br>
Physician does that fine. And even if I don’t like Alch, it serves the same purpose.<br>
Convertible Neuts = Good<br>
More Healers = Not Good.</p>

            <p>What’s wrong with a convertable neut? I think we need another. Mercenary is all alone.</p>
<p>Also it’s not JUST a healer, it can do way more.</p>

            <p>I don’t think we should have another neutral healer.</p>
<p>And definitely not a convertable neutral. Not again.</p>

            <p>There are neutrals who can win with Blue Dragon: Alchemist, Mercenary, even Scorned and Fool can win with BD even they are against them. Anyone with a BD goal is a BD.</p>

            <p>Hmm, ok. Should I change the goal to be similar to that of the alchemist, which is to survive? I just thought a neutral who would win with Blue Dragon would be somewhat pleasant.</p>

            <p>A neutral class with the same goal as the Blue Dragon is just a Blue Dragon class.</p>

            <p>Because we have too much BD already, and I thought it would be pleasant to have another convertable neutral.</p>
<p>Because I thought that monks usually live off the land in secluded areas, they can resist temptations like wine, and know how to treat things like poison and bleeding</p>
<p>Ok, will fix that.</p>
<p>I thought so too. The Exorcist seems like it would be too weak without.</p>
<p>I was trying to think of a day ability, and that’s what I came up with. I’ll try and tweak it if I can, but for now, I have no other ideas</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So are you saying I should exchange Confessional with something else?</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>

            <p>Why would a neutral have BD goals? Make it BD.</p>
<p>Why is it immune to bleeding/poison/occupation?</p>
<p>Transcendent Meditation is actually a good support ability. Maybe have more uses, but not learn attempted visitors (since that’s investigative)</p>
<p>Heart of Darkness is arbitrary Observer counter.</p>
<p>I like Curse, although it might be more of an Offensive ability.</p>
<p>Unholy Communion is a good protective ability.</p>
<p>Confessional makes all Clergy claims suspicious, and is pretty weak anyways. Marshal does that with no downsides. Also Investigative.</p>
