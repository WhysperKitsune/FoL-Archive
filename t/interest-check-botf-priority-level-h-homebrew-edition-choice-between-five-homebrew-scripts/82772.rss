            <p>Blood on the Forums V: Visions of Doom has been queued. Look to the queue thread OP for details (the setup has changed now; look at that bitly link for more info. Wayward and Omen are now gone).</p>
<p>the change from v1.4 to v1.5 happened on July 17th, it seems.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>through analysis of the Dastardly Devil, or the DD</p>
<ol>
<li>it does not have a demon named devil</li>
</ol>
<p>this one is pretty straight forward the game has already lied</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>it has travelers</li>
</ol>
<p>one of which can just prevent executes every day just for the fun of it and the other which can steal someone’s an ability temporarily once per game but its optional so they can just not let them have it</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>it has conversion and is therefore bastard</li>
</ol>
<p>this game can get to anime-FM levels of LWs</p>
<p>actually, scratch that. <em>Airlock</em> level of conversion. aha! im relevant</p>
<p>its not even just scum converting town</p>
<p>its scum converting scum to town and theres a townfolk making town scum</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>they buffed lunatic</li>
</ol>
<p>they actually did it</p>
<p>madlads</p>
<p>the minions now actively think this is their demon so its not even funny. Youll live and die convinced your actually the demon. And you know what they did? How they built off of this</p>
<p>if its converted, it goes straight to Demon.</p>
<p>‘but what about the original demon’</p>
<p><em>it becomes the Lunatic+</em></p>
<p>i cant make this stuff up</p>
<p>so now the conversion minion actively has a reason to lie to their demon and the demon needs to make sure their the real demon every night. the scariest part of this is if the OG demon realizes their now the fake, they already know who all the minions are. Oh yeah, and the minions now must try to lie to their OG demon that their is another, so if the other does get converted they dont instantly lose. Or maybe theyll just convert the other for the fun of it. After all, it was just a reaction test, right?</p>
<p>lastly for this, there is a townsfolk called the ‘Apostle’ It reverts dead players back to their original alignments automatically. so if the lunatic+(or the enstranged, as its called), dies as the demon, they still win. This is fine.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mad. Mad everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>first of all, theres a demon who can make people mad about being evil. Oh and, this demon can only kill people if either the mad players or nobody was executed the last day, because people will indeed kill the one person who claims scum every day, yes this is a good plan</p>
<p>we also got Soothsayer <em>who learns a PoE of two people that includes a minion</em> EVERY NIGHT as long as they are mad about being a smoothy the day prior</p>
<p>then we welcome the therapist, who silently makes people mad about their own character</p>
<p>there are so many things wrong with that statement im just moving on</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Bard is in this game</li>
</ol>
<p>need I say more</p>
<p>conclusion:</p>
<p>This game would become a meme instantly</p>
<p>I dont think its well suited here; getting converted multiple times per game wouldnt be great, and I think some people would more or less not try as much if they think they will get converted.</p>
<p>but also this could be really funny</p>
<p>probably placing it right below ides on my list, because while this whole post is mocking the stupider things, there are a lot of good ideas amoung the townsfolk.</p>

            <p>blue fun fact</p>
<p>KoDaR(kingdom of Death and Rebirth) sounds cool when abbreviated</p>
<p>hi yes im the KoDaR Ice Cream Man</p>
<p>tell me you dont want to claim that</p>
<p>I fear KoDaR games might go too slow with all of that revival</p>
<p>its like  mercy but the new mercy with the single revive, but everybody and your scum has it</p>
<p>it is more balanced then alot of the other ones though and the KoDaR Glorious Horn(yes) can solve the game’s pace with a double nightly pew pew</p>
<p>the goodies look good</p>
<p>even if a bit swingy, and abraham doesnt need to know who Isaac is to be chad(since it makes it less bluffable)</p>
<p>I also want to explain Convert</p>
<p>they are by far the most powerful outsider in the game because</p>

            <p>Ides is actually really cool</p>
<p>clockhand as a feature is really good</p>
<p>I think Shaman might be a little too strong early on; and a bit luck-based. Blasphemer also; they can mechanically confirm the demon easily. I do think if Blasphemer was a bluff for a minion that would be an interesting scenario, but as it stands tracking who is the clockhand(and therefore demon) would probably be too easy</p>
