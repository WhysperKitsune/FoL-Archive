    <title>[Duo Class Suggestion] The Deathcaller and The Shaman, elements-based opposing Neutrals!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/duo-class-suggestion-the-deathcaller-and-the-shaman-elements-based-opposing-neutrals/69544</link>
    <description>So I had an idea for a pair of Neutrals that can spawn together (much like the Sorcerer and the Inquisitor).

EDIT: It&#39;s been suggested to me that this could be an alternative to Sorcerer/Inquisitor based on whether it&#39;s an Unseen or Cult game. Sorcerer would help Unseen and Deathcaller would fit a Cult game.

&gt; # [color = &quot;gray&quot;] The Deathcaller [/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer [/color]** 
**Master of the Elements (Passive)** - As you commit your murderous rituals, you empower yourself with the Elements. When you complete your first kill, the power of Earth makes you immune to bleeding and poison. When you complete your second kill, the power of Air makes your attacks not count as visits. When you complete your third kill, the power of Water makes you immune to occupation and redirection. When you complete your fourth kill, the power of Fire allows you to bypass healing and death immunity when you attack.
**Doombringer (Passive)** - You are immune to death at night. The journals of people you kill at night will be wiped and replaced with the words &quot;THE END APPROACHES&quot;.
**Mindshade (Day)** - You will send a Shade to target player and choose a feedback message. At the end of tonight, that player will see that feedback message. Killing someone with Ritual Murder grants an additional use. - 1 use.
**Ritual Murder (Night)** - You will attack a player and attempt to kill them in a ritualistic way. Each successful kill empowers you and adds a charge to Call From Beyond. - Infinite uses.
**Call From Beyond (Night)** - [Only usable when it has 4 charges] Call forth your dark master, unleashing a wave of death and destruction upon Castle Adiart. You will simultaneously attack the King, Prince and Cult Leader, if any of these still live. If the Prince is dead, you will instead target the Paladin highest on the list. Each use consumes 4 charges. - 0 uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and the Cult.*

&gt; # [color = &quot;gray&quot;] The Shaman [/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Support [/color]** 
**Servant of the Elements (Passive)** - As The Deathcaller&#39;s power rises, so does yours. When the Deathcaller completes their first kill, the power of Earth makes you immune to bleeding and poison. When the Deathcaller completes their second kill, the power of Air will grant you immunity to effects that warp your mind. When the Deathcaller completes their third kill, the power of Water makes you immune to occupation and redirection. When the Deathcaller completes their fourth kill, the power of Fire grants you the ability to kill at night.
**Spiritual Communion (Passive)** - You are immune to death at night. At the start of every day, you will know the name of one still living player who is not the Deathcaller.
**Spirit Guide (Day)** - Send out a helpful spirit to a target, ensuring they receive accurate feedback tonight. Every time the Deathcaller successfully kills with Ritual Murder, you gain an additional use. - 1 use.
**Ancient Medicine (Night)** - Heal a player. If the Deathcaller attacked them, you will be notified. - Infinite uses.
**Ghostflame (Night)** - [Only usable when the Deathcaller has claimed their fourth victim] Attack a player at night. If you attack the Deathcaller, you will bypass all their immunities. - Infinite uses.
*Survive to see the Deathcaller dead.*

***Notes:***

1) The Shaman&#39;s Air blessing and Spirit Guide both provide immunity not only to the Deathcaller&#39;s Mindshade, but also to Mindwarp effects and anything that tampers with player feedback (such as Frame).
2) Mindshade works by selecting from among a list of premade options. This means Follow feedback is impossible to fake, but you could always choose &quot;No visits&quot;.
3) If you select the same feedback as the ability the target uses, your Mindshade will replace the target&#39;s normal feedback. For example, if you Mindshade a Sheriff and choose &quot;Your target is a member of the Unseen!&quot;, they will receive that message even if they Investigate a BD or Neutral player.
4) Mindshade doesn&#39;t actually create any effects, just the illusion of one. If you select &quot;you were cured of your bleeding&quot;, for example, the target will know the next day they&#39;re still bleeding by looking at their portrait.
5) Spiritual Communion will never tell you the same name twice, but it will always tell you that the starting King is not the Deathcaller at the start of Day 1.

I believe that&#39;s all. Feedback is welcome! :smile:</description>

            <p>That’s who you were talking about, tho.</p>
<p>If we’re referring to whether Deathcaller dies to Knight/Hunter, that happens to the Possessor when jumping and costs a soul for the Reaper. If the Reaper loses a soul N1 and can’t get it back, they can die to a Hunter/Knight N2 as well.</p>

<p>You actually don’t need the classes to be Hardcounters to give them a duality.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Each class needs a reason for existing, which means they need to be related in some way. Since this idea is for the classes to oppose each other, they need to have incompatible win conditions, which means they need to have a way to stop each other from achieving their goals and/or get in each other’s way directly.</p>

            <p>Having death immunity from the start and being a confirmable healer that can help BD get accurate investigation results should do a fair bit at keeping the Shaman alive, especially since they get immunities alongside the Deathcaller. But yes, that sort of thing can happen, but it immediately notifies the entire court there’s a Deathcaller in play, something both BD and evils want to get rid of as their top priority.</p>
