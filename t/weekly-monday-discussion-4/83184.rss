    <description># Welcome to the Weekly Monday Discussion studio, unfortunately DatBirb is on vacation this week so AreteBirb is filling in

**Audience:** *booing*

**AreteBirb:** Well, in any case, last week we surveyed you on how many games you wanted us to run at once.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730855777354514494/738957348412063744/unknown.png

**Audience:** If the poll says we&#39;re running three games at once, then why are we only running two?

**AreteBirb:** After some testing, we determined that having three games running at once causes them to take longer to fill, and causes players to feel stretched thin between games.


Anyways, for this week, we have another hot topic for you to discuss. From an anonymous viewer:


&gt; So
&gt; 
&gt; I think at this point we have a pretty good idea of what we *should* be doing – like, most of the recent scum wins could have been averted by people actually following the Townplay Improvement Advice, the problem isn’t that people don’t *realize* that you should work with other villagers/reevaluate in LyLo/etc.
&gt; 
&gt; however, despite knowing what to do, people don’t seem to be … doing it
&gt; 
&gt; how do we fix this

Does anyone have any suggestions?

**Audience member:**

what if we do an “award” system somehow.
create a thread to highlight the players who had the most impact on the game, tried their hardest, or improved the most
(this also includes scum/neuts, i dont discriminate)
give them a title for a month to show off their awesomeness

maybe people need incentive to try harder

**AreteBirb:** That&#39;s an interesting idea! It&#39;s been tried in the past and was somewhat controversial, but it&#39;s possible that it would work better now, particularly with some minor changes. 

# Poll: Should we create awards to recognize players who tried hard, improved a lot, or performed well in a given game?

[poll type=regular public=true chartType=bar]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

Don&#39;t tune out now -- we also have a few more questions for our viewers.

# Question 2: What categories would you want to see if this was implemented?

In the past, the categories used were Top Town, Top Scum, and Most Improved. 

# Question 3: What other ideas do you have for how we can work together to improve our townplay?

# Questions 4 &amp; 5:

            <p>I also think hosting more setups that are intended to be</p>
<p>“Competitive”</p>
<p>Is a good idea.</p>
<p>I get that some people want to just play to have fun but I think a few games where you Explicitly state that purpose is for it to be competitive (as well as having stricter posting rq) could have a positive impact on people who want to improve and play with other people who genuinely want to improve and be competitive</p>

            <p>Imo I’d do a best town player and best scum player and dark horse best effort put in player overall.</p>
<p>Host should just decide - players voting on who is best town will inevitably go to the townleader or loudest person even though there reads were actually shite but no one can remember what everyones reads were on D1 or 2. Host being informed from start usually gives more nuanced review imo.</p>

            <p>Sometimes genius comes in the weirdest moments.<br>
But yeah, it doesn’t matter, I just agree. I don’t think awards are the solution, it’s more about the mindset of particular players and whether you care about improving in the first place. If you do, the resources are all there and you are free to use them. If you don’t, then no amount of pestering is likely to change your mind, and you will continue to play poorly.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s “playing for awards” instead of “playing to win,” kinda like the Champs syndrome, but on a smaller scale. Not sure how many people it would affect, but it would surely affect some, even subconsciously.</p>
<p>We already praise several people’s play post-game depending on what they did, and I think that’s sufficient.</p>
<p>The title thing, though – I think resetting them might be a good idea, I’m just hesitant because of potential backlash.</p>

<p>Question 3: What other ideas do you have for how we can work together to improve our townplay?</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think there’s anything we haven’t said. Right now it’s a matter of people wanting to improve, because some don’t care. Which is normal, but has a higher impact on our site because we have fewer players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So</p>
<p>I think at this point we have a pretty good idea of what we <em>should</em> be doing – like, most of the recent scum wins could have been averted by people actually following the Townplay Improvement Advice, the problem isn’t that people don’t <em>realize</em> that you should work with other villagers/reevaluate in LyLo/etc.</p>
<p>however, despite knowing what to do, people don’t seem to be … doing it</p>
<p>how do we fix this</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some people want to improve, and they do (and will). Some don’t.</p>
<p>I think it’s natural. The resources are all there at this point, you can’t say they aren’t there. You just have to make use of them, and not everyone wants to.</p>
