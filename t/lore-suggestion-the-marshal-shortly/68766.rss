    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Marshal (shortly)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-the-marshal-shortly/68766</link>
    <description>&quot;As one the King’s loyal subjects , The Sheriff has decided to join his King’s quest : defeating the corrupt members of the Court. He goes door by door , asking The Court Members to let him in. The Court Members accept. One by one he investigates them and to no avail. But then a strange letter is left at his door. He opens it slowly and it reads : “We , the enemies of The Court , would like to invite you to our path to success. Help us and you will be swimming in the riches of the kingdom. Deny our request and you will be punished by The True Court. The Sheriff throws the Letter away and tears his logs with all his findings. And from that day , he became an enemy of The Court.”</description>
