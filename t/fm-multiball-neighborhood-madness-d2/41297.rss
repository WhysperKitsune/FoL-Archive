### Gameplay

Actions are done by messaging me

Days will last 48 Hours and Nights will last 24 hours
Neighborhoods will facilitated by DM groups on the forums and can talk at all times
If you are converted by a vampire or a werewolf you will keep your ability&#39;s
There is no scum chat and scum are not informed of who the others are
The game is multiball and each faction will need to eliminate each other and the town
If you are roleblocked you will not lose any uses of your ability&#39;s
If 2 people roleblock eachother then nothing will happen to either of them and both of them will be told they were roleblocked
If someone already in a Neighborhood chat is Neighborized then the Neighborhoods will merge.

### Executions
To accuse someone say &quot;**/accuse [player]**&quot; or &quot;**/vote [player]**&quot;
When the day ends the person with the most votes dies. If the majority of people vote no Lynch then no one dies.
