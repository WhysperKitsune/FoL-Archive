    <title>SFoL Grand Idea Class Thread V2</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sfol-grand-idea-class-thread-v2/78691</link>
    <description>
# Rules:

Every post here must contain a class. It could be an existing one or something new. If the class is an existing FoL class, the name is simply enough to qualify it. If it is a class that is already in this thread, put down the name hyperlinked to the post in this thread that includes its class card. Otherwise you must make the entire class card.

Classes must adhere to [this format](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/47799). (Although for **Blue Dragon** classes, the objective can instead read “ *Your objective is to defeat the scum faction and any neutrals that seek to do you harm* ”). A class must have at the very least a name, faction, type and win condition (include the win condition even when it’s obvious, such as if they are Blue Dragon).

Include the post number of your post in its description. A post number may only cover one class + any of its conversions.

**Classes can NOT prevent others from appearing in a game by being rolled.**
**You can not change any aspect of an existing post in a future post.**
**Consecutive duplicate posts of the same class are banned unless that class is Vanilla Town. This includes named variants.**
**You may not change the base mechanics of the game using your classes and then say &#39;reroll this slot.&#39;**
**Effort is required for your class, if it is just a named citizen it may be removed by the host.**
**You must use one of the 6 class types from vanilla FoL in your classes.**
**Moderators will delete classes that do not fit the rules of this thread.**

# Special FoL Specific Rules:

If a converted class is not given, Neutrals and scum faction classes should automatically be considered immune, and Blue Dragon should be considered convertable, with their unseen version having the same abilities that their Blue Dragon form does.

Converted classes can spawn at the start of a game.

There is no limit to the number of factions that can appear.

The King can be any faction of those that appear in the game, even new ones. If a Buttered Popcorn faction member is rolled, you can have a Buttered Popcorn King. The chance for each individual King to appear is always the same as any other King.

# Host Notes:

The host has the right to reject/reroll any class if they so wish.

GIFoL games fall under SFoL.

<h2>
<a name="the-realistic-multi-level-marketer-1" class="anchor" href="#the-realistic-multi-level-marketer-1"></a>The Realistic Multi-level Marketer</h2>
<p><strong>Cult Special</strong></p>
<p>Charisma (Passive) - You have access to the following effects:</p>
<p>If any member of the Cult becomes king, they will retain their original class’s abilities alongside their new ones.<br>
If you target the Neutral Evil with your night abilities, they will be added to the scum chat.<br>
The factional kill may not be performed alongside conversion unless there is only one member of the cult alive.<br>
If the Cult Leader dies, their role transfers to the next oldest member of the cult.<br>
You are immune to roleblocking on Night 1.</p>
<p>Essential Oils (Day) - Cause a player to start bleeding. They will die in two nights if not healed. - 1 Use</p>
<p>Brainwash (Night) - Change a player into their respective Cult class. If you are the only member of the Cult alive on Night 1, you may target two players. If the first conversion attempt would fail for any reason, you will attempt to convert the second without visiting the first. - Infinite Uses, 1 night cooldown if successful</p>
<p>Ancient Proverbs (Night) - Retrain a member of the Cult into a different Cult class (other than Cult Leader). Neither you or they will be able to perform other actions tonight. If this is used on a player who is not a member of the Cult, you will learn if they would be able to be converted this night. - Infinite Uses</p>
<p>Defeat the Blue Dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Dementor’s Kiss (Night)</strong> - Choose a player. If they are a member of the town, you will kill them. If they are a member of any informed minority, instead, your presence in the game will be modannounced at the beginning of the next day. (Infinite Uses)</p>

<p><strong>i guess you like your neighbors or are just a weirdo who is exteroverted (Night):</strong> Target a player. You will give them a pie, which does nothing but it does taste good. Unless you’re a bad chef. Regardless of your culinary skills, the target player will be told that you (the player) gave them a pie, and are a <font color="green"><strong>Friendly Neighbor</strong></font>. You may only target a player N places away from you on the playerlist, where N is the night number. - One use</p>
