    <title>Royal Blood broken to Princess to Assassin</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/royal-blood-broken-to-princess-to-assassin/9433</link>
    <description>#### I was Prince who turned into a Duchess. Then I became an Assassin. The King died. I was suppose to have Royal Blood and step up there. But I couldn&#39;t step up there, then the Prince step up there. (Let&#39;s not speak about that)

#### I was suppose to keep my royal blood when I was Princess to Assassin. So I should be able to step up as King before it gets pass down to anyone.

#### Be a Princess. Be converted N2. The Assassin dies D3 by execution. N4 as an Assassin. D4 nothing happened. N5 Kills someone. D6: King is died, anyone can step up as King.

#### Comments: This cost us the game as Unseen. We need to fix this or games with converted Royal blood will be ruin.</description>
