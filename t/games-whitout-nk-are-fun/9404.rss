    <title>Games whitout NK are fun</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/games-whitout-nk-are-fun/9404</link>
    <description>I just played a game where possessor died n1, and i honnestly find those games to be more fun. I remember back when there was a bug and there was no NK, i actually liked it more.

I find these games easier to win, and less luck based.
Nk eats away a % of BD and unseen&#39;s win rate.

Anyone else prefer the games whitout an NK? They do last longer, but they often feel more interesting.</description>

            <p>I liked it better when you weren’t sure.</p>
<p>2 NK?  1 NK? 0 NK?  It was always a mystery, kept people on their toes.</p>
<p>Now it’s… okay there IS one NK, did anyone get possessed?  Okay it’s a Reaper.  Once we get him we’re in the clear.</p>
<p>Oh someone didn’t connect?  Well, there aren’t any NKs then, so focus on getting cult/unseen.</p>

<p>Killing an Unseen or hitting the MM isn’t a big deal</p>

            <p>I agree actually. Cult tend to do better without NK than unseen do.</p>

            <p>I don’t have any numbers to backup my claim, but i think a no NK game isn’t that bad for cult.</p>
<p>You have more convertable targets, and you are sure your guys won’t get random killed.</p>
<p>I mean, lets just say right now NK wins maybe 15%, BD maybe 40% and unseen/cult 45%. If we remove the NK i think it becomes closer to 50/50.</p>

<p>I assume you were playing as BD then lol. Not having an NK makes it incredibly biased towards BD winning, especially in a cult game.</p>
