    <title>How to resolve Tornado or other Bus Driver ability&#39;s. (RAR Usage)</title>

    <description>This is how 2 tornado&#39;s with overlapping targets would resolve rationally if you think it through. This does not require any arbitrary rules or RNG or even a priority system and can resolve all of the tornado&#39;s simultaneously without splitting someone&#39;s target.

There is only 1 rule required and its: &quot;An action will be prevented if it appears twice on a chain&quot;

For this example we have Players 1, 2 and 3. We have Tornado A swapping 1 and 2 and Tornado B swapping 2 and 3. Lastly we have Attack C targeting 2. 

Do not ask who anyone targets. That is the wrong question. Instead just ask 1 thing:

Who dies?

Lets start with 2. Does 2 die? If so why?

By default the answer is no. However he is being targeted by an attack which makes the answer yes.

So we have

Yes - 2 is attacked by C. 

However Attack C is no the only thing targeting 2. There is interference from A and B.

So therefor:

No - A is redirecting C to 1

and

No - B is redirecting C to 3

these 2 responses are independent and have nothing to do with each other. They do not interact. However they can continue into chains. 

So lets take each one and see where we go with it.

with: No - A is redirecting C to 1. There is not just A and C targeting 2. Therefor

Yes - B is redirecting A to 3. This means that A cannot redirect C because it was redirected off of 2.

The No - A is redirecting B to 1 is not valid because it is already on the chain.

Now with the second chain the same reasoning apply&#39;s but it is just switched. Therefor 2 dies and C is not redirected at all.

However, what if Attack C targets 1?

Well here it is just:

Does 1 die?

* Yes - C is attacking 1
* * No - A is redirecting C to 2

There is no conflict with be. However:

Does 2 die?

* Yes - C is redirected to 2 by A
* * No - B is redirecting C to 3

Does 3 die?

* Yes - C is redirected to 2 by A AND is redirected to 3 by B

There is no conflict here so attacking 1 will hit 3.</description>

<p>Hmmm. I see the issue.</p>
<p>Wait actualy! Since each Ability can only act on 1 target per initial target that makes spliting a target a reason for something to fail. AKA: You cannot redirect someone that is being redirected on the same level or higher on a chain. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Attacked by D</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No - Swapped to 1 by A</li>

            <p>This is how 2 tornado’s with overlapping targets would resolve rationally if you think it through. This does not require any arbitrary rules or RNG or even a priority system and can resolve all of the tornado’s simultaneously without splitting someone’s target.</p>
<p>There is only 1 rule required and its: “An action will be prevented if it appears twice on a chain”</p>
<p>For this example we have Players 1, 2 and 3. We have Tornado A swapping 1 and 2 and Tornado B swapping 2 and 3. Lastly we have Attack C targeting 2.</p>
<p>Do not ask who anyone targets. That is the wrong question. Instead just ask 1 thing:</p>
<p>Who dies?</p>
<p>Lets start with 2. Does 2 die? If so why?</p>
<p>By default the answer is no. However he is being targeted by an attack which makes the answer yes.</p>
<p>So we have</p>
<p>Yes - 2 is attacked by C.</p>
<p>However Attack C is no the only thing targeting 2. There is interference from A and B.</p>
<p>So therefor:</p>
<p>No - A is redirecting C to 1</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>No - B is redirecting C to 3</p>
<p>these 2 responses are independent and have nothing to do with each other. They do not interact. However they can continue into chains.</p>
<p>So lets take each one and see where we go with it.</p>
<p>with: No - A is redirecting C to 1. There is not just A and C targeting 2. Therefor</p>
<p>Yes - B is redirecting A to 3. This means that A cannot redirect C because it was redirected off of 2.</p>
<p>The No - A is redirecting B to 1 is not valid because it is already on the chain.</p>
<p>Now with the second chain the same reasoning apply’s but it is just switched. Therefor 2 dies and C is not redirected at all.</p>
<p>However, what if Attack C targets 1?</p>
<p>Well here it is just:</p>
<p>Does 1 die?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - C is attacking 1</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No - A is redirecting C to 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no conflict with be. However:</p>
<p>Does 2 die?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - C is redirected to 2 by A</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No - B is redirecting C to 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does 3 die?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - C is redirected to 2 by A AND is redirected to 3 by B</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no conflict here so attacking 1 will hit 3.</p>
