    <description>## Connection Formed

Hai... is this thing on..? Ah! It is! 

Umu! It&#39;s me Umu from the previous RP! &quot;The one that failed huh&quot; Wha-? It did not fail! I just merely put it away in my stash of ideas! Now this is a better one, no more stats! Fufufufu...

```Ignore Umu, she&#39;s recovered and now back to her nonsense...```

If my RPers are happy, I too will be happy! Now! Rejoice, for your character&#39;s journey (and your fun) starts now!

```She&#39;s clearly not going to give the main idea, so I will. Here is the format for the character sheets.```

# Character Sheet Format

&gt; **Character Name:** Yuna Istucha
**Occupation:** ???
**Age:** 28(Arc 0) / 37 (Arc 1)
**Appearance:** A young lady, with blue long hair. Sharp nose with green irises. 170 cm in height.
**History:** ??? (Only if you join later than a certain arc, please inform me if you wish to create an external character outside of the main first group.)
**Attacking Style:** Offensive/Defensive/Manipulative
**Weapon of Choice:** ??? Magic (Make it reasonable! Note you can learn more, but you wont be as proficient in others than this weapon. This is an NPC so yeah it&#39;s hidden.)

```Hey, bitch. I betcha I make them more happier than you do.```
Huuuh? What&#39;s that you shitty brat, you wanna go down?
```As if I will be scared of y- Bwah!```
Take my elbow drill! Ah! We have a little problem here, so please excuse me as I _pummel the logic of mincing words into this little bastard over here._
```Yo- No! NOT THAT! Shit she&#39;s nuts now! Save me!```

            <blockquote>
<p><strong>Character Name:</strong> Vethre Zansenden<br>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Royal Investigator; Bounty Hunter<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 28 (Arc 1)<br>
<strong>Appearance:</strong> A red-haired woman of average build for her height (180 cm). The left side of her faced is wracked with scars, especially nearing her eye which is covered with an eyepatch depicting the code of arms for a nation long since forgotten to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary>
general gist of their appearance</summary>
</details>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>History:</strong> No known records of their childhood have been found, and most attempts to probe them for information (typically done by high-ranking nobles in Argus) have not yielded much in the way of concrete information. From what the nobles have figured out, Vethre was at one point an innocent bystander in regards to the witch with an admittably ‘squalid’ upbringing. Vethre will not divulge further, as they appeared to have tremors when unearthing this information. For some inexplicable reason, they’ve been paid high amounts to continue their search.<br>
<strong>Attacking Style:</strong> Defensive, attempts to disarm rather than to strike.<br>
<strong>Weapon of Choice:</strong> Battleaxe. <em>…But something is just not right about that eye.</em></p>
