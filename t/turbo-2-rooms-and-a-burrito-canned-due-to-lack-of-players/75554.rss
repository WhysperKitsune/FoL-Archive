    <title>Turbo 2 Rooms and a Burrito - Canned due to lack of players</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/turbo-2-rooms-and-a-burrito-canned-due-to-lack-of-players/75554</link>
    <description>## Welcome

## The situation 
It is @NuclearBurrito&#39;s birthday (Yays!) and he is so happy he is going to explode with joy! For some reason the **[color = &quot;red&quot;] Forum users [/color]** are ok with this and are going to use this opportunity to blow up the [color = &quot;blue&quot;] president [/color] because that&#39;s trump. Luckily for him he has a crowd of supporters which he is anonymously hidden within, unluckily for him the forum users have infuriated that crowd and are and even numbers with them. Also something about 2 rooms I guess

## Rules

Each player will be in 1 of 2 rooms. There will be 5 rounds during which some number of people (depending on player count and round) of the room leaders choice will be moved to the other room.

The rounds will last 20/15/10/5/3 minutes. This may be extended if we get more players than I&#39;m expecting

You may say **/card reveal [player name]** to show your role to the chosen player. You may use color instead of card to instead reveal your alignment. You may use share instead of reveal to make it conditional,  you will only do the share if the other person tries to do the same kind of share with you. You may say &quot;public&quot; in place of a player name to reveal your card/color to the whole room. There is no such thing as a public share. 

Reveals cannot be taken back and are instant. Be careful not to do one accidentally 

Shares can be canceled by saying **/cancel** anytime before the share is accepted. This will cancel ALL of your share requests. 

Yes they have to be in bold. They also have to be on their own line

**Important:** You may not communicate with players in other other room and there will be no private chats of any kind. Anything you say will be said to the entire room

You must play to your eventual win. If that means you go out of your way to switch sides and win as the other team then so be it

Anytime a card is swapped it is as if you received it at the start of the game unless specified otherwise

At the end of the game if the Burrito (Bomber) is in the same room as the President (Trump) then the Red team wins. If they are in different rooms then Blue team wins

The game will be played on a discord server

## Leader

Each room gets a leader randomly assigned at the start of the game. 

The leader may do **/nominate [playername]** to give up leadership to that player. You may not give leadership to the player who just gave you leadership. 

Anyone else may type **/nominate [playername]** to vote for that person to be leader. If the majority of players are voting for someone to be leader then they will become the leader. You may vote for yourself. 

Voting for the existing leader will instead cancel your vote. 

## Rolelist

I will keep getting as many players as possible.  As such the rolelist is unknown until we know how many players we have. It will contain at least the Bomber, President,  Doctor and Engineer. Feel free to suggest roles, I will likely use custom roles (in addition to normal roles)

Players:
1. @GamerPoke
2. @Simon
3: @Isaac_Gonzalez</description>
