    <description>Right now I&#39;m frequently finding myself running out of the 50 likes I get a day and then I have to wait a whole 24 hours after each like I did just to get 1 back and it&#39;s annoying tbh. I just want to be able to spread the love more so I feel like we should get an increase of likes from 50 to idk 100 or something? I need to spread more love instead of constantly saying: &quot;Manual Like&quot;</description>
