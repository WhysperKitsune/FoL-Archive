<p>^Allows Merc to be faked more often and makes the merc less confirmed, also allows merc to talk to evils without being outed.</p>

<p>Did you even think about how your class would play out in a realistic match before posting this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contracted - Immune to occupation and target changing, all whispers from you and your target will be hidden when talking to each other, including noble’s spy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new passive automatically confirms the Merc and his target as the court will always ask the Merc claim to whisper their target, making it impossible to fakeclaim as Merc unless you’re an Illusionist or if BD is stupid. Your idea of a new Merc is about as bad as the current Noble when it comes to confirmability. Hell, I’d say it’s worse as the Noble has limited uses of Political Pressure while this Merc can be confirmed solely based on a passive.</p>
<p>And I’m not even going to touch how this Mercenary is so BD-sided despite BD being the faction with the highest win rate.</p>

            <p>Stop trying to give Merc a way to easily contact their target. There needs to be some risk with a merc claim and being able to freely contact them simplifies the game even more than it already is for them.</p>
<p>I think a better way to go with Stand Guard is a blanket “prevents death”. This stops King kills and Reaper kills. I think for a slight boon to unseen/cult with merc, the merc should also make the target appear as BD. Prevention is better for scum classes, but also makes the game infuriating. Personally I’d be fine with Prevention, but I’d like it to be removed.</p>
<p>Bribe is a confirmable ability, so your idea that Merc can be fake claimed more is false. The hidden whispers also hurt that, but a little less so.</p>
<p>All of this is moot, however, as there are merc changes in the work.</p>

            <p>I don’t like the rework though it is fine. Btw King could order exe merc’s target so that is why we need prevention</p>
