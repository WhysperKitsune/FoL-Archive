    <title>Playing With DirectX10</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/playing-with-directx10/8307</link>
    <description>As title says i was interested into buying the game but on steam it is written that is needed at least **DX11** to play the game while my PC only support **DX10**.
Normally i would just accept the fact that my computer is pretty outdated and stop, but since i was really interested about this game i would like to know if there is some way to play it with **DX10** or if is in program a future compatibility with **DX10**.
Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>I doubt there is a way to play the game with DirectX 10 only. I think even setting is a launch option on steam won’t really do anything since the game itself will force DirectX 11 to run. So, unfortunately, I’m pretty sure you won’t be able to play the game on that computer.</p>
