# Welcome to Viva la Revolution!
&lt;/div&gt;
A game mode where four factions fight against each other, though some do have the potential to win with others. While the town is large, the other three factions are only one member each.

## Mechanics
• Days last 72 hours, and nights last 24 hours.
• Lynch is majority. There is no day one lynch, and day one ends when all players have confirmed.
• There are no wills/journals.
• Multiple antagonist factions are capable of winning the game, but town can not win alongside them.

<p>Not really. I imagined you were really town and that was just a reaction test, which I was correct.</p>

            <p>You are mistaken if you think I had you as lock town in FE Sarun, but with that you had material to accuse me and I might not win that. I hadn’t fakeclaimed as town before, so you were not someone that I preferred to push. I must admit I was not that suspicious of you. I thought my relation to you in FE might help me read you in the chess game, so my marriage proposal was not without any preconceived intentions.</p>
<p>Did you at least consider that I was truly a neutral survivor backpedalling? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Reaction tests typically don’t work that well with experienced scum, though.</p>
<p>Case in point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you town or mafia? I am a neutral survivor, hence me trying to make less of an appearance, but still aid town. I can heal myself or someone else if I have attempted an ITA during the day and I am occupy/redirect immune. I can block ITA’s with a day ability that gives my heal and this ability another use if I successfully block one.</p>

            <p>Also all my pushes are not always genuine and simply reaction testing. I just don’t reveal it after one or two posts as people typically do here.</p>

            <p>In general, I lock on a bit too much I feel, but that is because Wham played me in Cult in the Jungle and I cannot let something like that go I betray my early reads way too much, so I wanted to stop doing that.</p>
<p>I did think you were town on day 3 in the Chess match fyi. You were not my preferred lynch.</p>

<p>He locked on to me at Chess, albeit I have to admit that I fucked up the push on M, and he basically got tricked by scum and locked onto Livicus in FE, so he needs better targeting.</p>

            <p>I read you here as I really doubt that Scum!Solic would try to game-solve while powerwolfing. In Chess, I read you as town as there’s no way in hell a mafia member would try to defend another one so hard like what you did with Unknown. In SFoL28 I read you as you were the one providing the least input and no motivation at all so I assumed you likely were the oldest Eevee. FE is self-explenatory.</p>
