    <title>Add a Game Breakdown after game is over</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/add-a-game-breakdown-after-game-is-over/23226</link>
    <description>Hi, very new player here, 

Could you implement a system that shows what happened every night after the game is over?

Such as:

Night 1: Fred (Knight) killed Bob (Knight)
Day 2: John (Court Wizard) was executed for Treason
Night 2: Tom (Alchemist) was Bled by Rob (Hunter)

ETC, it would help understand what happened during the game for a new player, thanks.</description>
