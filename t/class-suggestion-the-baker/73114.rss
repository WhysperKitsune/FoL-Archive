    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Baker</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-baker/73114</link>
    <description>First time posting a topic here, so please go easy on me lol : P
The Baker was an idea from my ToS days when I (and other players) were wishing for a baker class. With the addition of the fool&#39;s semi-recent change, thought it could be an interesting class. It could be a neutral, or a BD/Unseen class. 
(Props to @overthebin , @anon98616575 and @NAOtheRitualist for the help on this idea.)

&lt;font color=&quot;Gree&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Baker. Neutral. Social. Unique class. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Baker&#39;s Pride (Passive) - The Baker&#39;s abilities will be disabled once their goal is reached.
Taking Inventory (Day) - Check if a player has limited use ability that can be recharged. Unlimited uses.
Pass the Bread (Night) - Give one player bread, recharges one random limited ability use of that player.
Player will only see the recharge the following night onwards. Cannot be used on the same player twice. Unlimited uses.
Flour Mill (Night) - The baker stays in the flour mill for the night. Gains Night Immunity for that night. 2 uses.
Goal: Survive to give 5 players bread.

----or:----
&lt;font color=&quot;LightBlue&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Baker. BD Convertable Unique Social Class. Converts to the Sous Chef.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Baker&#39;s Pride (Passive) - ?
Taking Inventory (Day) - Check if a user has limited use ability that can be recharged. Unlimited uses.
Pass the Bread (Night) - Give one player bread, recharges one random limited ability use. Cannot be used on the same player twice. Unlimited uses.
Tea Time (Night) - The baker has a baked goods dinner with a selected player for the night. They will be occupied for the night. 2 uses.
Goal: Win with The Blue Dragon.
(If its the sous chef, they can only give ability charges to neutrals/their faction.)

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Sous Chef. Unseen/Cult Convertable Unique Social Class.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Chef&#39;s Pride (Passive) - Only offers Unseen/Cult a meal.
Taking Inventory (Day) - Check if a player has limited use ability that can be recharged. Unlimited uses.
Pass the Bread (Night) - Give one player bread, recharges one random limited ability use. Cannot be used on the same player twice. Unlimited uses.
Al Dente (Night) - A player is given a meal laced with light poison. They will be occupied for the night. 3 uses.
OR Al Dente (Night) - Players who visit the Sous Chef stop by for dinner and are occupied for the night. 2 uses.
OR Al Dente (Night) - The entire unseen/cult is given a special meal that makes them not suspicious for one night. 2 uses.
Goal: Win with the Unseen/Cult.

Weaknesses to improve on:
Game for class ends once goal is reached (if neutral).
Confirmable ability (hard to change, tried to reduce it by making extra charges appear the following night).
Simple concept.

Do you like the baker idea?

<p>This seems like an ability attributable to an investigative class, given the manner of how it gives information. However, combined with their night ability, appears to be fine.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is not an ability attributable to a social class. I would recommend trying to find a replacement for this slot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t really feel like this fits the flavour for a social class. It much better fits as a support class given the refreshing mechanic inherently being a supporting ability. If it were support, I would give it 5 fingers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chef’s Pride (Passive) - Only offers Unseen/Cult a meal.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This passive conflicts with their day ability, considering it can only give bread to fellow unseen.</p>
<p>On another note, what is the potential strength of a refreshed ability for unseen?</p>
<ul>
<li>High power level when combined with 2f1, but requires poison to not be used. Balanced</li>
<li>Refreshing foresight is really bad.</li>
<li>Refreshing poison has fringe uses</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, a fairly balanced night ability.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IMO this is the best night ability to add for the Chef. Given that this class (and the Baker) fit more into a supporting role, this further bolsters that perspective.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, I see this class as a better fit for support than for social.</p>

</aside>
<p>Seems reasonable given the objective. However, I would add the additional sentence ‘you will learn this at the beginning of the night’ for clarity.</p>
<p>If you ever were to reduce the total amount of bread needed to win, you would definitely have to reduce this to ~3 charges.</p>

<p>To reduce randomness, how about it prioritizes refreshing the first (left) ability?</p>

</aside>
<p>Make this a day ability. This is far too large of a waste otherwise.</p>
<p>Overall, I definitely get how this flavour works out nicely. It needs some number adjustments, as made clear in my post.</p>
