    <title>[Suggestion] Update screenshot on the 3rd tutorial screen to not include &quot;Stream Sniper Four [14]&quot;</title>

    <description>Greetings!:

I&#39;m not sure if this is a solid idea and I&#39;m fairly certain that its not a simple fix and would probably fall down in the backlog.  Based on the ToL in game news for Oct 15, 2017, it discourages &quot;Streamingsniping/toxicity/bullying calls for the banhammer&quot;. As of today that may not be represented accurately in the tutorial.  On the 3rd tutorial screen with the player &quot;Best Cookie [9]&quot; in the role as &quot;Mastermind&quot;, their ally is &quot;Stream Sniper Four [14]&quot;. The suggestion is to update the screenshot to not include this user to more accurately reflect what I believe is ToL current ToS.  

The reasoning behind this is that its possible that newer users going through the tutorial may think its okay to streamsnipe or possible be confused between the Oct 15, 2017 news post and the tutorial.  Though its also reasonable and fair that the names in the tutorial maybe discounted due to the version on that screenshot (Closed Beta v0.9.14a). I&#39;m not sure what percentage of users would be interested in this change as its likely most users who see the news may not go through the tutorial.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.</description>
