    <title>Cult Rework Version 2.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cult-rework-version-2-0/72237</link>
    <description>[details=&quot;General Cult Changes&quot;]

* The cult now has a 5 member limit instead of 4.  

* Vessel would replace the current cult leader(CL is a generic and unoriginal name).  

* The current benefits for sacrificing a cult member should be removed(Current:  Gives the CL one charge of eradicate and each cultist one charge of their main ability).  Instead, the cult should receive a different effect depending on which class is sacrificed.  

[/details]

[details=&quot;Positive Effects&quot;]

* Attack Prevention (Distinct from Target prevention. Knight Guard and Merc do this)

* Ability modifiers(By this I mean any ability that improves another ability.  For example, Reaper&#39;s Gather Darkness, Court Wizard&#39;s Empower, and Invoker&#39;s enrage are all modifiers)

* Healing

* Immunities granted by another class

* Limited Use Restoration

* Negative Effect Prevention

* Tailoring

[/details]


[details=&quot;Negative Effects&quot;]

* Ability Disabling(This is different from occupation.  By this I mean Poor Fellow and Bewilder)

* Frame 

* Incorrect Feedback 

* Occupation

* Redirection

* Target Prevention

[/details]
