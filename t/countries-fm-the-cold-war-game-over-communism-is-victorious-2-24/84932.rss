    <title>Countries FM - The Cold War - Game Over - Communism is Victorious! - (2/24)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/countries-fm-the-cold-war-game-over-communism-is-victorious-2-24/84932</link>
    <description>*After the second world war came to a close. Germany being split in two and Japan losing their entire empire. The entire borders of the world were redrawn with border disputes staying torn. The cold war began to rage on as Soviet-American ties were ceased and spies were sent in to discover as much as they could about their opponent.*

# Countries FM - The Cold War
Hosted by @Wazza, Co-Hosted by @CRichard564  
## Rules

Follow the [Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules - Please Read First ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244), and the [Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926). Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.
**Important Rule:** Do not get political during the game. I will not tolerate this at all as there is a major risk I am taking with allowing this game to get so close to politics. Any talk about politics in game will lead to either a force replace or a modkill if it gets too deep into it.

## Gameplay

* Upon a player reaching majority or the game ending with plurality, they will be executed.
* Days are 48 hours long or until a player is kicked out, Nights last 24 hours. Plurality does exist.
* You will be provided a DM with your classcard by the host, send your actions there.
* Flavours are alignment indicative. However, any non-Town will be provided flavors they can fake to be.
* There may or may not be anticlaim mechanics.
* There may or may not be lost wolves.
* There may or may not be neutrals.
* There may or may not be dead interaction.
* The game is  *not*  bastard. The OP will not lie to you, the hosts will not lie to you and your classcard will not lie to you 
* Communists will talk through a special Discord server or forum message.
* The game is closed.

## Voting
* While using Democracy in a game where Capitalism and Communism are fighting might be ironic, but that&#39;s how we&#39;re doing things.
* During the day you can vote players to execute them, upon them being executed, they may be eliminated from the game apart from the possibility of dead interaction. 
* Executions will result to plurality if the day ends without an execution, any ties will be sorted by Discobot.
* To vote you must say **/vote [x]** and ping me.

## Win Conditions
* The Win Condition for [COLOR=STEBLUE]**Capitalism**[/COLOR] is &quot;*Defeat [COLOR=RED]**Communism**[/COLOR] any any other nations that stand to harm Capitalism.*&quot;
* The Win Condition for [COLOR=RED]**Communism**[/COLOR] is &quot;*Defeat [COLOR=STEBLUE]**Capitalism**[/COLOR] and any other nations that stand in your way.*&quot;
* Any Neutrals that might exist will have their own Unique win condition relating to their class.

            <p>I would’ve nominated Light if the award wasn’t for teamplay but performance.<br>
Nightingale had a neighborhood and worked reasonably well inside of it from what I’d seen during the game<br>
Even if it was perhaps Vulgard manipulating them<br>
I remember the neighborhood being an issue and myself wanting it out</p>

<p>Yeah, Light and Nightingale both did really well. I was worried the most about Light figuring things out and had to kill him off. But I also had concerns about Nightingale from all the solving I’d seen them doing. I knew I had to get on as soon as possible when the day started to claim the vig shot. Otherwise they might have started thinking of other possibilities like bleeding. I was still worried this might happen, so that’s why I was posting the wallposts with analysis on Nightingale and Gorta. Had to keep thoughts on just those two. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Now which town member deserves MVP from my PoV?<br>
Nightingale and Light are the two I’m thinking of.<br>
They both played reasonably well despite far too many townies not carrying their weight.</p>
<h1>From a personal POV, Town MVP team player award is tied between <a class="mention" href="/u/Aelin">@Aelin</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/nightingale">@Nightingale</a>.</h1>
<h1>Scum MVP team player award goes to <a class="mention" href="/u/whysper">@Whysper</a>.</h1>

Good performance from evils.<br>
I’m looking at Whypser, who managed to carry the communists to a win after subbing in.<br>
So personally Whysper should be scum MVP team player from my PoV.<br>
Now concerning town. Too many inactive town and when wagoned, they just rolled over and got killed.<br>
Majora and Cloned cheese I’m talking about you both.</p>
