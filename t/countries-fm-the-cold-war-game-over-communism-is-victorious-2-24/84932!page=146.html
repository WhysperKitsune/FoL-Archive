<p>So, out of curiosity, why did you ignore all of my more recent games when doing your “oh-so-amazing-meta-read”? If your excuse is that you didn’t know I was in them, you are either stupid or lying. I have all of my games on my profile.</p>

<p>This feels at least slightly cherry picked. For one, who the fuck remembers some shit like this off the top of their head? Upon thinking maybeee they were going through games and saw it? either way bringing up just this example alone doesn’t sit right with me. No thought as to if its AI just that they’ve done it as scum.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To be fair, cherry picked is not entirely incorrect. I was trying to point out that nobody should be clearing Centuries just for putting in effort into a game, as he has done it before as both alignments. This was the first example I could find, and I acknowledged that… what did I say that <em>you literally quoted</em>, “one example is not the same as a trend”.</p>

          <p>Who do I think is town</p>
<p>Me<br>
Vulgard is probably deep enough in his V meta<br>
I kinda agree with AT read  from vulgard<br>
PKR also I guess<br>
YBW is like very townie in a “he’s not like, reinventing mafia or anything but he seems obvious enough fmpov”<br>
Windward would have problems copy pasting their first town game if scum so I doubt it<br>
Astand gave me enough V pings d1 and i dont think im getting pocketed<br>
TWL is probably semi spewed town from d1 I guess<br>
I’ll also agree on Vulgard’s kyo read but less so because I don’t think it’s as unlikely for kyo to be scum compared to AT</p>
<p>That leaves</p>
<p>Sculptordwarf who I think may be a hit but then it’s one of thoses cases where the player is so whatever to me it’s really odd but ive recently had this happen moreso with townies than actual scum<br>
Ami should die at one point idk when but like actually dont let her survive to lylo<br>
Dota is pretty whatever, I don’t think there’s much AI stuff going on with the slot so I’m not as confident with my non TR of them<br>
Light is pretty whatever, I guess shouldn’t die because if he flips town it’s fucking wack so even if I think it’s potentially a hit I’m not going to go around and force my read onto others<br>
Arctic is a thing, reasoning for the vote on Majora makes sense but I can’t help but think the slot is still fairly suspicious? It’s mostly gut and vibes but it’s similar to sculptor<br>
Leafia is someone I don’t wish to engage with and I think it’s like, just pure rng so unless there’s a redcheck or something I wouldn’t necessarily wish to go there today<br>
Gorta I really don’t like if I had to be honest, it’s not the lack of talking or whatever its purely the fact he seems so focused on reading players who have fooled him in the past but I’m not seeing any reads being put out so yeah poe<br>
Eevee I don’t feel anything about it, kinda scared about open lost wolfing gig, not as much priority there compared to other slots<br>
Cheese is still a thing, if he doesn’t put out anything content wise Imma just thinking it’s just pure anti-town gameplay no matter the alignment, especially with his gameplay philosophy, it’s more anti-town in a town way than a scummy way though</p>
<p>oh I skipped Rat</p>
<p>Rat is whatever I guess, 254 without any pings coming my way is pretty sad?</p>
<p>actually I also fucking skipped min</p>
<p>same thing, less so actually, more v pings from min, definetly not poe material</p>
