    <title>NK shouldnt be able to become king</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/nk-shouldnt-be-able-to-become-king/16812</link>
    <description>It goes against the nature of neutral killers when say, for example, a reaper outs himself and automatically gets the throne as a confirmed neutral. They are confirmed because no one would announce reaper, because if they werent voted they&#39;d be instantly lynched. They dont get lynched tho because it&#39;d just be easier to just make him king rather than lynching him and wasting a days lynch. It feels more like a copout when they do this, rather than a nice feature for nk. Remove their ability to become king so games dont just become extremely easy and quick for both bd and the nk.</description>

            <p>The NK usually also knows who the evil guys are. Like MM immune to his attack. It ruins the game for the evils when NK steps up to king.</p>
