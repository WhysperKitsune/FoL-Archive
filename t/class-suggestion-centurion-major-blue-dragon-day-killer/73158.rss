    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-centurion-major-blue-dragon-day-killer/73158</link>
    <description>Note:

This is being canned, as this idea when looked at closely is fundamentally flawed, and will be discontinued.


&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=lightblue]Centurion[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; [color=grey]Blue Dragon Unique Killer[/color]
&gt;
&gt; **Behead (Day) -** Take justice into your own hands and kill a player at the end of the day. You will be unable to use any of your abilities for the rest of the game. Cannot target the King, and cannot be used after trials. *(1 Use)*
&gt; 
&gt; **Rally (Night) -** You will give buffs depending on the class types of players that visit you. They will keep them until the end of the next night. *(2 Uses)*

Same as CW empower.

&gt; **Bellow (Night) -** Your target will be unable to use day abilities during the next day. They will receive feedback as if their abilities had worked. *(Infinite Uses)*
&gt;
&gt; *Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm.*


&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=purple]Major[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt; [color=grey]Unseen Offensive[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; **Leadership (Passive) -** Your votes for treason count as double the normal value. It will not be indicated numerically.
&gt;
&gt; **Charisma (Day) -** The target for the Assassin&#39;s poison will not learn of it until tommorrow. *(1 Use)*
&gt;
&gt; **Search Mandate (Night) -** Guess the target&#39;s class type. If correct, you will gain a copy of their logs and they will be occupied. Cannot be used on the same target twice. *(Infinite Uses)*
&gt;
&gt; *Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals that dare stand in your way.*

-----



Feedback is appreciated.


[details=&quot;Changelog&quot;]
v1.2 - Heroic strike removed. Reduce cap of Behead to 1 from 2, along with making it kill at the end of the day (doesn&#39;t bypass night immunity). 

v1.1 - Prestige Removed, made the class unique.

v1.0 - Added

            <p>Sadly, upon further consideration, I’ve decided to can this idea.</p>
<p>Day-vig abilities, conceptually, are inherently broken. They provide too swingy of an effect. If one were to be added, it should be a more last-ditch-effort that is only a 1f1 trade that kills the user.</p>
<p>ToL doesn’t have much conceptual room for more BD killer classes anymore, and designs that include them should be more of a multiclass with minor kill potential.</p>
<p>Thanks to Burrito for helping me understand that. Fascination with a concept blinded my perception of good design, and for that I apologize for wasting people’s time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Behead (Day) -</strong> Take justice into your own hands and kill a player. If they are Blue Dragon you will be unable to use any of your abilities for the rest of the game. Cannot target the King, and cannot be used after trials. <em>(2 Uses</em></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Imo auto disable all your abilties if you use this, it’s REALLY strong on its own</p>

            <p>A good niche. Day vig is both an auto confirm (yes I know those exist but we have been trying to remove them wherever possible) and extremely swingy. More so than other kill methods</p>
