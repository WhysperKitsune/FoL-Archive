## Rules

Follow the [Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules - Please Read First ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244), and the [Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926). Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.
Wisdom of the Mod will be used heavily for this game in order to ensure a quality game experience.
Alts are also not allowed.

Tell the host if you want to join privately, as WotM will be used heavily

## Gameplay

* Days are 48 hours long or until an execution ends it, Nights last 24 hours. The first day is an exception, it lasts only 24 hours and has no execution.
* You will be provided a DM with your classcard by the host, send your actions there.
* Unseen/Cult will talk through a special Discord server or forum message, which will be deleted immediately once the game ends.
* All other private messages will take place through the forum.

## Executions

* To accuse someone say “/vote [player]”. Please make the life of the hosts easier by bolding it (by putting ** ** around it)
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.
* When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.
* Voting “/no execute” is an option.
* You may self vote.

## Picking a New King

* At the start of d2 and every day phase after a king dies, a king election takes place. There will not be an election if there are 4 players or less alive. 
* When the king dies a 12 hour period starts. In this, players may vote in their class PM for who they want to become the next king. 
* Voting for execution may take place simultaneously. If a majority execution takes place before the end of the 12 hour period, the election instantly resolves. 
* Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned king. If votes are tied, a king election will be held the next day to determine it.

## Action Results

Just ask the hosts.
The feedback list works for most results.

Action order for Nerds

Night abilities will be processed in following order/priority:

1. Visit Prevention
2. Occupation
4. Bus Driving (target swapping)
5. Killing
6. Protection
7. Miscellaneous Effects (like Bounty)
8. Investigation 1 (Faction checks, type checks, etc)
9. Conversion
10. Investigation 2 (Every kind of investigation which checks for abilities used *this* night)

In case there are conflicts on the same level (example: two drunks bus drive the same people), all these conflicting effects are canceled.

(thx Geyde)

## Journals

DM the host what you want on your journal. When you die, the last update to your journal will be revealed to everyone. It has a character limit of 1000 characters.
