    <title>I need someone to describe a generic version of this scenario in mathematical terms</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-need-someone-to-describe-a-generic-version-of-this-scenario-in-mathematical-terms/71374</link>
    <description>Say there are 6 players (one of whom is yourself), you are Blue Dragon and estimate there are 3 Unseen.  You know that if any player is accused by at least 3 people (none of whom is yourself), the accused person is innocent, since otherwise an Unseen would be voting up a fellow Unseen member.

Can someone write a formula for calculating the number of accusations by non-neutral, non-starting king players required to prove the defendant&#39;s innocence, given the total number of players, and the total number of evil faction members?</description>

            <p>Not necesarily. The problem is that neuts won’t know for sure if someone’s unseen in most cases, so they can’t know if someone is evil when they’re being upped. The formula can only include the Unseen, and not even their king, since only they have information on who all of the unseen are.</p>

            <p>Thanks for making me look stupid lol, but seriously how would you include number of neutrals in there?</p>
<p>Votes required to prove someone is not Unseen = Number of Players - Number of Neuts - Number of Unseen?</p>

            <p>I mean wouldn’t there be a King in this situation?</p>
<p>Which means whichever faction controls the throne could dominate votes</p>
