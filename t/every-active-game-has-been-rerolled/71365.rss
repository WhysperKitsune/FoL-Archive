            <p>I would be lying if I said I didn’t guess you were egging me on to go for Lightsin after the way my posts were going in that moment. It was hard to guess alignment from that, but it did influence me slightly. Accidents happen though. I am glad at least some people are enjoying the hunt. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I’m sorry, but you still disregarded Psycho’s warnings and dove into the Pug-Memesky shitstorm in his DMs. If you feel the need to correct a player’s behavior in a case such as this, then please do what I did in FK’s case and ping the host to ask them to intervene in your case. You are not a host and should not have tried to take the matters into your own hands.</p>

            <p>Still, I have no idea why the other spectators were even jumping into other peoples’ class cards after Psycho explicitly told us not to. I really believe we need to give Pug, Boss110, and Luxy stern warnings over this shit as it was obvious that people would have tried angleshooting them as they had access to all the PMs.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I am glad that you got blacklisted. Acting as normal Memesky is fine. Pulling shit that will cause games to get canned/rerolled is just beyond the pale.</p>

            <p>For Ritual Mafia, Pug and Memesky were shitposting in Meme’s class cards and then Meme start asking questions to Pug about Vulgard’s and Icibalus’ alignments. However the thing is is that Pug didn’t tell Meme anything, but the fact that there was an attempt to angleshoot along with the fact that Pug and Boss did start posting in Meme’s class card.</p>
<p>Then Meme outright tells everyone that he’s found scum from angleshooting the spectators and whatnot, and to add fuel to the fire while everyone was tense at Memes’ attempt at angleshooting, I liked one of Solic’s jokes, as in a post with zero information whatsoever, in the thread and people started saying that spectator likes can be used for angleshoot over the panic that Meme caused.</p>
<p>In short, the game had to be rerolled as since spectators were omniscient then people kept trying to angleshoot their actions, the most egregious case here being Memesky.</p>
