    <description>Name - lost soul
Faction - Random(similar to king)

Lost soul is a special class that doesn&#39;t have any abilities but has one passive. 

**Passive 1 -** will keep changing classes at the start of each day for his own faction 

You will spawn as a random faction and is given a random class from that faction. You will be able to use that classes abilities as normal. But here&#39;s the twist, the next day you will wake up as a different class from your faction and can use that classes Ability though out the day and night. 

Example - say day1 I spawn in as noble and then the next day I&#39;m phys. I&#39;ll be able to use the phys abilities at night as usual. 

You keep changing class each night playing as each class from your faction 

Mechanic:
- you cannot become a unique class
- this character will count as a Neutral in the game even if his class isn&#39;t neutral to start off with. 
- if converted then you will keep switching classes in your concerted faction to other classes in that faction
- if you are merc then you can guard someone randomly 
- cannot become any form of NK. 
- if you become a fool one day and get killed in the morning by the Kingdom then you will win because that is the fool&#39;s win condition 
- does count as a member if spawns in beginning of cult or unseen game. Meaning that unseen is at its max during the beginning of their game. 
- if you are a Neutral then you will have to survive until the end or complete the neutral goal such as fools  win Condition
- if you become king then you stay king of that faction
- if you are forced to become the assassin or CL because the original got killed then you will remain as assassin or CL
- it will appear to everyone the class that you were last if you die 

I am also debating if this class should be able to become unique classes or not. 
- like he can become prince and jail someone but isn&#39;t allowed to exe at night
- if becomes MM or CL then isn&#39;t allowed to convert 
- if becomes assassin then isn&#39;t allowed to kill

I think this would be cool because if you became prince and then died, it will tell everyone that the prince has died that day but the real prince is still alive. Can also work for Bad guys if you become MM and die but wasn&#39;t the real MM people would think that no more converts are going to happen but secretly you were just a decoy
