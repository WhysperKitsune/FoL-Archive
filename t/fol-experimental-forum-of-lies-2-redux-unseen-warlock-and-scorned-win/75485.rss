### Executions

To accuse someone say “ **/accuse [player]** ” or “ **/vote [player]** ”
Once majority is reached to accuse someone, that player will die. There will be no trials.
Executions end the Day

# Special Experimental Changes

1. Trials have been removed.
2. Noble has been reworked.
3. The Kings have all been reworked.
4. Mastermind has been updated.

All class cards that have had minor interactions changed are not noted here. Any denotations of voting for execution instead refer to accusations due to the removal of trials.
