    <title>Can we address the Mass Leavers on Day 1 who try to get in the same game as streamers</title>

    <description>Just played a game where 9 people left when they were still alive because they were not in the same game as their favorite streamer (at least that&#39;s what I am assuming when mass leavers do this)

I and a few others stayed (much respect to you guys) just for the principle of not leaving games while alive since its against the rules but this madness needs to stop.

I reported the leavers but doubt they will care and just keep doing it.  Mass leavers really makes the games no fun.

            <p>There’s a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/98uLIJB.png" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">new warning in the game lobby</a> that informs people of the penalties of leaving early. Hopefully this helps curb the behavior.</p>
