    <title>[Class Suggestion] Auditor (Neutral Investigative)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-auditor-neutral-investigative/59859</link>
    <description>&gt; **The Auditor - Neutral Investigative**
&gt; **Blindspot (Passive)** – The Neutral Killer will appear Blue Dragon to your Inspect ability.
&gt; **Second Opinion (Passive)** – The first time poison, bleeding, or an attack would kill you, survive and unlock your second day and night abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fudge Results (Day)** – Make the person on trial appear evil (Assassin or Cult Leader) if executed. (1 use)
&gt; **Do Not Disturb (Day)** – Gain immunity to death, occupation, and redirection tonight. (2 uses; unusable until unlocked)
&gt; 
&gt; **Inspect (Night)** – Determine if a target player is a member of the Blue Dragon. (unlimited uses)
&gt; **Final Report (Night)** – Kill a target player. (2 uses; unusable until unlocked)
&gt; 
&gt; _Your objective is to survive._

Notes: The Auditor cannot be converted.  I lean towards the Auditor not being informed at the start of the game whether it is unseen/cult game, but can see arguments both ways.

This class is designed as an investigative version of the alchemist.  The Auditor has a generally BD-helpful ability in Inspect (which operates like old BD king allies except that NK shows up as BD), but as a neutral has a variety of playstyles.  The Auditor could pose as sheriff/paly, although non-NK neutrals and frame targets represent potential false positives that put the Auditor at risk.  Fudge Results can be used to moderate this risk.

Alternatively, the Auditor can use Inspect to identify neutrals and evils to side with.  Fudge Results is a way to signal evils to your existence because they will know that the person was not the Assassin/Cult Leader.

The Auditor (and evils) could openly claim Auditor with largely the same calculation as alchs.  The Auditor represents a slight nerf to other non-NK neuts (e.g., inquisitor) to the extent  the Auditor pretends to be sheriff/paly and gets the fellow neut killed as a non-BD.  Theoretically the Auditor could also confirm alch claims as non-NKs to the extent people believe two neutrals.</description>

            <p>Visit all living players does not sound fun to me.  The Auditor’s abilities are geared toward survival.  You can find an evil or frame a BD to convince BD to protect you.  Then you play it by ear as to whether to side with BD or evils.</p>
