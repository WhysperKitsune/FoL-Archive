    <title>Priest Prince claimomatic 2000</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/priest-prince-claimomatic-2000/9633</link>
    <description>I have come up with something that seems pretty strong .

day 1 priest 
 
I am priest . everyone send your class to me in whispers please.  Prince please jail me tonight and i will pass on those who have claimed and those who have failed  to claim  . Failing to claim will look very suspicious . Anyone who has not claimed by end of today will be up for execution 2moro.

For me this sets up a very strong position for the blue dragon. Whilst in jail the priest will be safe . The Prince is not outed and those who fail to claim are suspicious . Investigators can be coordinated . 

the thing with this tactic is also that it is not limited to a turn 1 play. 

you can do it at any time you like as long as Prince and priest are still both alive . 

You can even use this the   turn after a Prince res if priest still in play .</description>

            <p>Yeah I think the main issue you would have would be blue dragon players that didn’t like the idea and refused to get involved.<br>
or couldn’t understand how it would work or help .</p>
<p>if be tempted to do it day 1 and 2 . first day get the quick responders.  day 2 again and name and shame those who have yet to claim .</p>
<p>The next day would then be day 3 and the Prince would have had time to Sharpen his axe</p>

            <p>I like it! The only problem would be if you had a talkative group of 16, or prince not paying attention or being new. And scorned and fools hogging the chat. Also I wouldn’t do this till d2 so you have enough time to get everybody’s whispers. But if you had an attentive group of people this would be a nice strategy.</p>

            <p>the whole game is based around knowledge is power . If the Prince and priest knows everyone’s claims then the whole game becomes a lot harder for people to fake claim .</p>
<p>generally you want to get butler claims checked by king or observer . As it’s usually a killer offensive bad guy fake claim.</p>
<p>Get physician s checked by princess .</p>
<p>Get princess to wow to trusted players etc .</p>
<p>all are claimable but all are easily disproved if you know what you are looking for .</p>

            <p>This game ain’t exactly town of salem, almost all roles are intentionally designed pretty darn easy to fake claim, The role list is almost entirely random BDs etc…</p>
