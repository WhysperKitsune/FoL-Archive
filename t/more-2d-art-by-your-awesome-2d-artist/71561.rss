    <title>More 2D art by your awesome 2D artist</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/more-2d-art-by-your-awesome-2d-artist/71561</link>
    <description>The simple 3D polygons are charming but I can&#39;t help but want everything drawn by the 2D artist who did the rest of the game.

Great game</description>

            <p>I see the post as “I want more art from the artist that drew the 2D stuff”</p>
<p>Isn’t it sweet? 3:</p>

            <p>I was being intentionally vague.</p>
<p>I would like everything in 2D, but understand a giant rehaul on the art direction wouldn’t be practical.</p>
<p>And who wouldn’t like more 2D art? I think we all agree that despite the different styles from different artists they all still look great together</p>

            <p>I don’t think that’s what is being requested. They just want more art in general not a change in the entire art style</p>

            <p>I believe it’s impossible to change the art from 3d to 2d at this point.</p>
<p>P.S. as ici said there are more than one artists. Xed (retired), Luxx, Adiart are 2d and Arnenzo 3d if I remember correct.</p>

            <p>There are actually quite a few 2D artists who did the artwork for the game (can’t quite remember exactly which devs are working on them)</p>
<p>fun fact the Court Wizard and the Sage were drawn by two different people despite how simmilar they look</p>
