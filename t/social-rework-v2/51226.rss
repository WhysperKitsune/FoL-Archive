            <p>There’s no reason against Nightshade Wine. While generally certain abilities should go on certain types, it gives the class an interesting twist. And it’s a secondary power, so it doesn’t need to align like the primary power.</p>

<p>I agree that butler needs some buffs to make it more fun to play, but nightshade wine isn’t the solution.  Butler’s other abilities should be buffed instead(like swapping happy hour with concentrated wine and giving bewilder to butler instead of nightshade wine)</p>

<p>I agree that lore alone is not a justification, but the class type argument is also weak and fun is the most important thing.  I think being able to kill the King is a really fun ability for Butler (Knight already has a killing ability).  Fitting with the lore is just a bonus.</p>

Make reveal transcripts into a night ability:<br>
Reveal Transcripts(1 or 2 use) - Reveal all whispers to and from your target.  Can target the king and the dead.</p>

<p>But Nightshade wine is a fun addition to a relatively boring class, and makes the Butler feel powerful.  My last Psycho King game I killed the Butler first because this lowly class was my greatest enemy.  <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:">  At the very least, poisoning the King fits the Butler’s lore.  I think Assassin’s distract should be replaced with Bewilder.</p>

<p>Other people being there is not a flaw, adding people slowly is.  And I did suggest changes, removing the cooldown and changing focus link so it just removes a player would fix that.</p>

<p>Rename this to conduit.  Change this so it just adds your target to the network(this is because players wouldn’t be likely to claim if there are other players listening).  Remove the network limit(or at least say why it should have one).  Also remove the cooldown.  This makes it very slow for the psychic to gather claims(N1: add a player.  N2: nothing.  N3: remove a player.  N4: nothing.  N5: add a player).  I know that it’s for apostle, but they will already be suspicious when they haven’t added a player.  And they could just change their claim if they haven’t been jailed.  Even if they have, this will force the prince to reveal themselves.</p>
