    <title>How to make king&#39;s faction not the game deciding factor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/how-to-make-kings-faction-not-the-game-deciding-factor/55580</link>
    <description>Right now, Bd winning most good king games, evil win almost all evil king games.
There are couple of reasons for it:

1. The king is the leader of the game and can make BD doing all the wrong thing at day.
2. The king usully have alch on their side
3. The king is the  player who got most of the information unless the prince is outed and everyone whispering him
4. The king is an extra player that tiebreak any even vote
5. Order execution is very powerful ability.
6. By the time the evil king is &quot;found&quot;, it&#39;s too late for BD.

If I have to guess, evil king wins about 75% and bd king wins about 60%, yes its looks like the game is balance: 0.65*0.6+0.35*0.25=0.4775 Bd win percentage, but the king faction have to much effect.

I think that NuclearBurrito&#39;s idea for the queen must be made fast, 
https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-queen-unknown-special/54518/158

The queen should be as powerful as the king.

 There is no way that some of the games start with 2 unseen, and some of the games with 3 (possibly 4 with sorc)

 

Another way to deal with it is to remove order execution+ when an evil king spawn only 1 starting unseen will start the game, the king will be able to attack somone n1. Which means that the unseen will know about each other. (or 2 unseen +king vs 3 unseen )

I have to say that i love the queen idea way more exciting.

The game will never be balanced before you address the king&#39;s faction problem, even if the statistic says evil 45% good 45% nk 10%</description>

            <p>Not if it’s like this. This way both of them combined will always account for 1 of each faction.</p>

            <p>I’d think more of a neutral <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/7yta1b/new_neutral_class_jester_tries_to_get_king/dujzz0i/?context=0" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Usurper-like</a> class as I’ve suggested on ToL’s subreddit. A neut whose entire function is to serve as a check on the King’s power in order to prevent power shifts too drastic due to the King’s unreliability element. Adding another class that wins with BD or Unseen/Cult will ultimately make the game more swingy.</p>

            <p>I’d rather go for a role that serves to keep the King in check rather than artificially changing the number of starting Unseen/Cult, as the King’s alignment shouldn’t be given away like that. Especially as in those cases a bad start for Evils(MM failing many conversions in a row and outed for bad claim, CL getting yolo-smited n1) means an instant-lose. IMO the Prince meta is a step in the right direction as it stops giving too much power to a role who’s alignment is a coin toss. Though the main problem with the King right now is the swingy nature of Guards and Order Execution. If the King is Good, the BD’s Power role will be immune for roughly six nights. If the King is Evil, then they could simply execute the Prince when BD least expects it.</p>
<p>My suggestion here would be to tone down the overall power that the King has over the Prince. This should be in the manner of Guards failing if used on the Prince and the Prince being immune to the Order Execution effects. This will ultimately stop making or breaking games because the BD Power was executed by an Evil King or guarded during the entire game by a Good King.</p>

            <p>What if I told you, … that the whisper-the-King-meta is entirely artificial, at best a reminiscence of other games/past metas and generally a sign that people are not/barely willing to think and initiate cooperation by themselves without a guiding leadership? It’s a burden for both, the court as well as the King (or Prince) himself, as the position usually requires a lot of expertise and nerves of steel.</p>
<p>The problem is not the King, it’s the players’ incapability to share information and deduce without having someone tell them what to do. (And the whisper-the-Prince-meta is no different from that.) If we wanted to develop a meta that does not require gathering all information in one singularity, we could do so at any given time. I boldly predict that if all Blue Dragon members would share every piece of information they manage to gather publicly, their winrate would be significantly higher than it currently already is. But the truth is, the players are not ready and not willing to do so. I have played outing-myself-as-sheriff (when he was unconvertable and unique) or -as-prince months before it has become an acceptable way of playing and I have always gotten heavily flamed for it despite reaching winrates above 90%. People do not want to innovate, people do not want to think by themselves.</p>
<p>But to give you some ideas to start: Share information with people you have reasons to trust. For example, if you are a Sheriff and you found someone as Not Suspicious, ask him for his class while outing yourself. Write in your logs whom you have outed to in case its a Princess claim and you immediately and unsuspectingly die the next night. Especially if you are an Observer, go and ask people what they did last night. Tell them you are an Alchemist who healed them and who will continue to heal them. This lowers both their suspicion on you and their incentive to murder you. If the information they share with you corresponds to your findings, tell them about yourself. Additionally, always go and talk to a person you have been redirected to. It was most likely a drunk and you will find ways to cooperate.</p>

            <p>Queen helps because there will always be 1 power BD and 1 Power scum (besides the prince and MM/CL).
