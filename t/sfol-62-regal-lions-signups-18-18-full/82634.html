          <p><em>The Castle of Regalia. A magnificent castle, one surrounded in riches and grandeur. The inhabitants of the castle all live in relative harmony, as even the commonfolk have enough money to stay out of poverty. The castle is also known for quite a few popular individuals, ones who have extraordinary powers and talents. They all band together under the banner of the Regal Lions. But it just isn’t enough for some, or that’s what the Lord’s wife said… before she was found dead in her quarters. A well known topic amongst the citizens of Castle Regalia is the revolutionaries that once plagued Castle Adiart, an ally of the Lions. However, the Blue Dragon of Adiart managed to defeat these revolutionaries… or so was thought until the heinous act of regicide was committed. It’s clear that the Unseen and the Cult are not completely gone… in blood on the wall of the quarters spells “Your riches and your talents cover up the true corruption within this castle. We will liberate this castle and spread your coin across those who deserve it!” Can the Regal Lions silence these familiar foes, or will they consume the castle within their iron fists? Only time will tell…</em></p>
