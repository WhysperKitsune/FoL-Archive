          <p><strong>SFoL 58 – Last Stand of the Virtuous</strong><br>
Starting early or mid December</p>
<p>Lore: The order of the Unseen have taken over the entire world now. Unseen from different lands have joined forces towards their common mission. Their previous enemies, the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium respectively, are almost entirely wiped out. However, it seems one of these two groups of heroes has returned for a last stand against the Unseen empire. Can the hopelessly outnumbered heroes reclaim their homeland? Or will the Unseen secure their rule of the land of Adiart for good?</p>
<p>Baseline Mechanics: This game is a combination of Return of the Blue Dragon and the inverse of Hand of Byzantium. There are 33 possible Unseen classes in game, 17 from the Return of the Blue Dragon roleset and 16 from the Hand of Byzantium that I have reworked to be town classes instead of scum. Every Unseen class from RotBD is here, but I only included Unseen classes from HoB that I could pair with each one from RotBD and FoL, so a few HoB classes are missing as I only picked the ones that could be paired for conversion purposes. Unseen are the town faction and either the Blue Dragon or the Hand of Byzantium are the scum faction. Any neutral and neutral killer class from Return of the BD and Hand of Byzantium can appear, with slight alterations to some classes being made from me to compensate for flipping the town and scum factions. Both the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium are much more similar to the Unseen Faction in Forum of Lies than the Cult Faction in Forum of Lies, although they differ from each other in some notable ways.</p>
<p><strong>Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convert Classes:</strong><br>

<p>20-er, King, 13-14 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 3 BD or HoB, 1 NK</p>
<p><strong>All Unique Non-Neutral Non-King Classes besides Duke, Marshal, Sheriff, Agent, Prince, and Warden will have Prestige, and as such only up to two of them can roll in the entire game. If the starting convert class is rolled as a Prestige class, this would contribute to the limit of 2. An Unseen Prestige class and its scum convert equivalent cannot both roll as starting classes in the same game; i.e. no spawning of both Archivist and Librarian at the start, etc. Sheriff, Agent, Prince, and Warden cannot spawn as the starting convert class.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If a Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantum class can be converted into from an Unseen class with prestige, then that convert class also has prestige for the purposes of factoring into the starting convert, regardless of whether or not that convert class itself is unique (as for most classes, two different unseen classes convert into the same BD or HoB class, and sometimes one of those Unseen classes has Prestige and the other does not). This means that there are a few more BD and HoB classes with Prestige each than Unseen, as unlike with the unseen, a BD or HoB class does not need to be unique to have prestige, just be a convert class of at least one Unseen class which itself has prestige.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 5 players alive. If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium cannot convert night 1. After that, the second conversion has a 2-night cooldown after the first succeeds, and conversions after that have a 1-night cooldown. They may have up to four members alive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There will be no lynch on day 1. After that, lynches will be Majority ONLY (Plurality disabled), every day for the entire game, except for if and when Sword of Damocles is activated, in which case Plurality will be activated for the day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All votes will be locked in both MyLo and LyLo, if MyLo and/or LyLo occur in this game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"No Lynch" is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer “No Lynch” to end the day early without a lynch. If Sword of Damocles is activated, No Lynch will occur if the No Lynch choice wins plurality. Otherwise, without Sword of Damocles active, no one will ever be lynched without being hammered.</strong></p>
<p>No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.</p>
<p>Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.</p>
