    <title>Is that what supposed to happen? drunk+merc+reaper interaction</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/is-that-what-supposed-to-happen-drunk-merc-reaper-interaction/38104</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I debbed reaper n1 and got a merc guarding me that night
it didn&#39;t tell me that i got attacked and immune
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I supposed to know that the attacker attacked me

I know that basicly he coudnt visit me, but i did visited him and forced him to target me.

 if i can&#39;t find attackers then I don&#39;t want a merc and that doesn&#39;t make any sense.</description>

            <p>Well yeah it is what is supposed to happen, though I do agree in the drunks case they probably should make an exception to what the merc does.</p>
<p>The merk makes his target impossible to visit. The same as being jail does. But yeah I also agree… that is kind of a bad combination when it mixes that way for drunk.</p>
