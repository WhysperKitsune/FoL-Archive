## Gameplay
* Days last 96 hours, or until a majority is reached for execution. Nights last 48 hours.
* All actions, must be sent to the mod.
* Unseen/Cult will talk through a special Discord server.
* Priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server.
* All classes will be used, and will be used as they are found in the Class Cards Thread.

## Executions
* To accuse someone say &quot;/accuse [player]&quot; or &quot;/vote [player]&quot;
* Votes saying Guilty or Not Guilty before the target is on the stand will not be counted.
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will go on trial. They can say a defense, and the rest of the players must vote Guilty or Not Guilty on the thread.
* Players can discuss while the target is on trial.
* No one is able to use day powers when a trial is in session. The Only exception is the king’s Decide Fate. 
* Every trial will go on for 24 hours. Only exception is if the king uses decide fate ability.
* The day timer does not stop when the target is on trial.
* If the option with the most votes is what happens to the target.

## Picking a New King
* If there are less than 4 players a new king will not be selected.
* After a king’s execution the day does not end, an election shall be held right after.
* When the king dies 24 hours is given for any player with royal blood to step up and take the throne.
* After that 24 hours anyone is free to step up.
* If only 1 person steps up when the day ends that person becomes the king
* If 2 people step forward everyone votes on who should be the next king. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the day becomes the king. If the votes are tied whoever stepped up 1st becomes the king

## Journals
* PM the host what you want in your journal. When you die, the last update to your journal will be revealed to everyone. (Please do not make multiple posts of your journal, just keep editing the same post)
