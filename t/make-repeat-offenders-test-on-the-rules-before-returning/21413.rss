    <description>I am seeing a lot of repeat offenders in public games throwing, using racial slurs, breaking rules of all kinds. I think after a player is banned more than twice, the next time they attempt to login they will be given a multiple choice quiz (like 5-10 questions) they must pass before being allowed to play again. That way, no arguments that they dont know the rules.</description>

<p>I’d say in the case of racial slurs etc… there’s no reasonable way they don’t understand. They are actively disobeying after the first warning. Honestly if they are returning, the better option is for racial slurs, first time is automatic 3 day suspension, second time is auto ban. These type people are going to bitch, call everyone SJWs and post silly threads and bad reviews no matter what, whether they were given one chance, or 20 it’s just part of online games</p>
<p>Gamethrowing, can be a bit more subjective, and I can slightly better understand the first time offenses even int he more blatent cases. Not saying they are any more right, but ignorance is more understandable so a rules test isn’t a terrible idea for that.</p>
