**A Day ability for the CW, &quot;Silence&quot;**
Target player will be unable to speak tonight. This is a double edged sword. If they are evil, you are inhibiting them in their plotting at the table. If they are BD, you chance them getting screwed if Jailed by Prince or Linked by Mystic. The idea of being Silenced for the night may also be faked by an evil player Jailed who can try to claim silenced that night and why he didn&#39;t talk to prince to buy time. 


**Night Ability &quot;Reinforce Soul&quot;**
If target player would die tonight, they instead live for one more day, unable to talk or vote but able to use abilities and edit their journal. Essentially, being chilled for the next day then dying.


**Night Ability &quot;Ice Wall&quot;** 
Everyone will be prevented from visiting your target. Another double edged sword. On the one hand, they cannot be converted, occupied or attacked, but on the other hand they cannot be healed from poison/bleed, but also allows an extra method of &quot;Prevented&quot; from showing up which helps conceal fools.</description>

            <p>Muting unseen/cult during the night is only a mild inconvenience, since they can communicate through abilities.</p>
<p>Silencing a BD either does nothing or gets them killed because they didn’t claim. You could say the same could happen with evil classes, but the odds are minimal, along with for the most part it’ll just be useless since only a few ways to talk are available.</p>

<p>The thing is the ability is inherently weaker than Heal, so you’d always want a Physician over a CW, since Phys is stronger.</p>

<p>Yeah, it is. But it has the possibility to stop kills. However, preventing someone from speaking never helps. You’ll most likely doom a BD, and if it’s known it will let evils fake silenced, nullifying it and making it counter Prince and Psy.</p>
