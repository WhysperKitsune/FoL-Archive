    <title>[Class Suggestions] Converted Neutrals</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestions-converted-neutrals/9138</link>
    <description>I saw Moleland&#39;s ideas for converted neutrals, but I thought Alchemist deserved it&#39;s own class conversion, and that a Fool conversion had potential too.

Converted Alchemist:
&gt;## [color=purple]The Diviner[/color]
&gt;[color=purple]**Unseen Offensive**[/color]
**Coagulate (Passive)** - You are immune to bleeding and nightshade poison.
**Gargoyle Potion (Night)** - Turns a player to stone for the night, occupying them. - Infinite uses.
**Nightmare Potion (Night)** - Gives the target player nightmares, causing them to be too afraid to vote tomorrow. - 3 uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

Converted Scorned:
&gt;## [color=purple]The Vengeful[/color]
&gt;[color=purple]**Unseen Social**[/color]
**Passion (Passive)** - Immune to occupation.
**Troll Box (Day)** - Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. - Infinite uses.
**Plant (Night)** - Plant incriminating evidence on a player, making them appear as The Assassin to investigative abiltiies. - Infinite uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

Converted Fool:
&gt;## [color=purple]The Trickster[/color]
&gt;[color=purple]**Unseen Offensive**[/color]
**Trickery (Passive)** - Immune to occupation.
**Troll Box (Day)** - Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. - Infinite uses.
**Surprise Mojo (Night)** - Replace a player&#39;s abilities with fireworks, occupying them. - Infinite uses.
**Masquerade (Night)** - You can choose a class you wish to appear as to investigative abilities tonight. Additionally, if you die, you will appear as the chosen class. - 3 uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*</description>

            <p>I’m not sure if fool should be convertible, the alchemist converted class needs a power that looks like it heals because otherwise it can’t fake being an alchemist still.</p>

            <p>Herbalist has nightshade immunity too, even though there’s no way they could be poisoned by it in the current game. Just in case of changes essentially ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
