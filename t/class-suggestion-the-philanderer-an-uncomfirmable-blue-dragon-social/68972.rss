    <description>*&quot;You took me for a useless pretty face. You underestimated me. Because, you see, I&#39;ve pieced everything together. I know who the traitors are...&quot;*

&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;] The Philanderer [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Social [/color]** 
**Wandering Eyes (Passive)** - At the start of every night, you will be given a list of colour-coded players and their social actions during that Day. You retain this passive if you are converted or become the King.
**Overt Intimation (Day)** - Approach a player and mark them with a perfume that lasts until dawn. You will know if any marked players visit you or the target you Spent The Night with. - 5 uses.
**Rise Early (Day)** - Tonight, you will awake sooner than usual and know if the person you Spent The Night with spoke to someone at night. - 2 uses.
**Spend The Night (Night)** - You will stay with a target all night. If they used a night-time ability, you will know if it was used successfully or not. - Infinite uses.
*Defeat the Unseen or Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

&gt; # [color = &quot;purple&quot;] The Ruffian [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;purple&quot;] Unseen Social [/color]** 
**Wandering Eyes (Passive)** - At the start of every night, you will be given a list of colour-coded players and their social actions during that Day. You retain this passive if you become the Assassin or the Mastermind.
**Whisper In Their Ear (Day)** - While this ability is toggled on, your whispers will be hidden from the public. - Infinite uses.
**Sinister Intimation (Day)** - Approach a player and mark them with a special perfume known to both you and the assassin. If a marked player visits the same target as your assassin tonight, the marked player will be attacked as well. - 2 uses.
**Spend The Night (Night)** - You will stay with a target all night, learn the exact result of any night abilities they use and whether they spoke to someone during the night. - Infinite uses.
*Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

***Notes:***

This is how Wandering Eyes gives you information:

The following players talked, accused and did not abstain: [List of names]. [Color=DarkOrange] (Colourless). [/color]
The following players talked, accused and abstained: [List of Names]. [Color=Blue] (Blue). [/color]
The following players talked, did not accuse and did not abstain: [List of Names]. [Color=Green] (Green). [/color]
The following players talked, did not accuse and abstained: [List of Names]. [Color=Gray] (Gray). [/color]
The following players did not talk, accused and did not abstain: [List of Names]. [Color=Orange] (Orange). [/color]
The following players did not talk, accused and abstained: [List of Names]. [Color=Gold] (Yellow). [/color]
The following players did not talk, did not accuse and did not abstain: [List of Names]. [Color=Red] (Red). [/color]
The following players did not talk, did not accuse and abstained: [List of Names]. (White).

If there is no trial that day, the lists will be White and Gray.

1) Converts into the Apostle for the Cult.
2) Neither the Philanderer nor the Ruffian count as Magic Users.
3) &quot;Spoke to someone at night&quot; is not just the Unseen/Cult nightly group chat, but it also covers the Prince, the Mystic if they use Link or Conduit, the Mystic&#39;s Link target, and any two players the Mystic used Conduit on. This ability is affected by Frame as well. It will return positive regardless of whether target spoke at night or not. The ability would theoretically also apply to the Prince&#39;s jailed target, but Spend The Night will be prevented if it targets a jailed player.
4) &quot;Spoke to someone at night&quot; will yield positive even if the target remains silent all night. The ability checks whether they have the possibility of speaking, not whether they actually spoke or not.
5) Public whispers will count as talking for Wandering Eyes.
6) Spend The Night returns either &quot;Your target&#39;s night ability was successful&quot; or no feedback at all.
7) If the target is fooled into thinking their ability succeeded/failed, you will be fooled as well.

Hopefully I achieved my goal of a useful but unconfirmable BD Social class. Feedback is welcome! :smiley:</description>

            <p>I think it’s a good attempt at designing an unconfirmable social class.  Many people have tried and failed, including myself.</p>
<p>I do agree that it’s a social class but I’m not interested in debating this with Nuclear Burrito since we have already defined what “social” means differently <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:"></p>
<p>My two problems with this class are, finding who spoke at night is too powerful.  And color coding players based on publicly available info should, like someone else pointed out, be an option available to every class.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have any suggestions to reform the class or replace this passive.  Like I said, I have already tried and failed to design an unconfirmable social class <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/pensive.png?v=9" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:"></p>

            <p>But on a serious note, yeah. This is how classes need to be made. You need to find a purpose/niche for them and then build the theme and mechanics around it to help them achieve their goal. I can’t really find a niche for the Philanderer.</p>

            <p>Next thing you need to do is get a theme for the class. AKA it’s niche. In one or two sentences what does this class do to further it’s goals?</p>
<p>Ex: Killing (assassin/knight), Finding Unseen directly (Sheriff), Spotting fake claims (princess), coordinating players (Mystic), creating a stable leader (Hunter) ect.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s intended to be a fakeclaimable Social class with some investigative abilities that enhance social deduction. For the third time: if you think the abilities are not Social enough, feel free to suggest alternatives/modifications.</p>
<p>However, as we established above, finding an ability that a Social class can do at night and isn’t confirmable is extremely difficult, so clearly something has to give. So the Night ability has to be allowed to be semi-Investigative and the Day abilities and passive should be mostly Social.</p>
<p>One idea I had for a mechanic I haven’t found a class for yet is gaining a double vote when they’re in a 1v1 situation. This makes the class confirmable only at the end, and that mechanic is definitely Social.</p>
<p>An alternative for Spend The Night could be “you will learn if the target received feedback of their ability”, which can cover anything from success to failure to prevention to abilities that give feedback even if nothing happened, like Guard and Heal. That makes it even less confirmable than it is now, and the Day abilities can synergise with that plus the public info passive. Something like “If your target abstained/refused to accuse today, you will ensure Investigative abilities return accurate results on them tonight.” Which is deceptive, as if you’re evil, you’re letting an Investigative think they’re getting accurate results on a fellow evil when they’re not.</p>
<p>Those are some example ways to make the class more Social and the sort of constructive feedback I’m looking for.</p>

            <p>And what is your thing? Are you trying to make a claimable Investigative class or a social class? Make up your mind and stop pretending like what you have now is social because it’s not. Something has to give.</p>

            <p>Sorry, friend, you just made 4 posts and none of them were actually helpful, as you didn’t suggest alternatives, modifications, or tried to help me accomplish my goals.

            <p>At least 1 person will be able to back up your social ability. If that one person is always scum then it doesn’t prevent a fake claim. However your class is not that</p>

<p>Yea. Noble DOES have gossip. But that’s not license to not actually make the class predominantly social.</p>

            <p>I feel like that’s an overly narrow definition of Social that ends up impeding a BD Social class that isn’t easy to confirm or whose abilities only affect evils.</p>
<p>BD Social classes are allowed to gather information from others (Link/Maid Spy) and other classes are allowed abilities that don’t fit their role. Having a predominantly Social class with some information-gathering is in keeping with other class designs in the game.</p>
<p>If you fundamentally disagree with that and have no interest in helping me come up with alternative abilities, then there’s really nothing else to discuss, we’ve both made our points time and again and the discussion isn’t going anywhere.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say so, since the main power in Wandering Eyes is that it processes information from the day for you. In SFoL it’s not turbo so you could just do it yourself as any old class.</p>
