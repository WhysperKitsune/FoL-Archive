    <description>Camp Bermont... A huge army camp about 200 kilometres from the border. The amenities in here are plentiful, with supplies on one side, and an abundance of tents capable of housing tens of thousands on another. Lines of tanks and AMVs line by the entrance and a strict clearance keeps the camp spy-free.

            <p>“Well shit, a she.”</p>
<p><em>Keyes stood up, standing at attention like the rest.</em></p>
<p>…<br>
Of course, after making her introduction as the army captain, Xamirin Foster… she orders everyone to be at ease… and begins rattling orders.</p>
<h3>“Recruits, all of you will be put in your groups. You will undergo the training that we shall provide for you!”</h3>
<p>Of course, through some fate of dice… All of you are in the same group. Your group has quite a few more people…</p>
<p>And thus, you will undergo training with this exact same group… Group C.</p>
<p>(2 Snipers, 4 StormTroopers, 2 Tank Operators, 2 Medics, 1 Grenadier, 3 Scouts.)</p>
<p>Quite a diverse cast of members in the group. But one thing is certain, your group is noticeably smaller than the rest.</p>

            <p>“Hah! You youngsters look like a fun bunch!”<br>
The eye-patched man exclaimed, his mouth curling upwards into a smile, left hand slamming downwards into his left knee.</p>
<p>And as he did that, a lady of around 30s, with long blonde hair and of army descent entered the tentage.</p>
<p>By now, the tentage was full of people…</p>
<h2>“Attention!”</h2>
<p>She yelled, her voice booming through the tentage, and shutting everyone up immediately.</p>
<p>“Recruits. Stand at attention!”</p>

<p>The three of you decide to sit down, right next to each other. After all, all of you were in the same company.</p>
<p>And of course, there seemed to be some time before the commander came.</p>
<p>Of course, there was a commotion in the other tents, which some of you can make out “No Cigarettes”…</p>
<p>Another man sat down by the three of you, with an singed brown eyepatch over his left eye. He <s>took out a cigarette and lit it, causing the crates nearby to explode, killing everyone</s> watches the three of you, judging the three before him.</p>

<p>Of course, being a man of relative authority, his father was once a military veteran, one of authority which led him to a higher rank, despite his unfamiliarity to it all. Of course, he was just a medic, but a field medic’s job was dangerous…</p>
<p>The camp was wide and huge, and looking out of the entrance, was a dirt road leading towards the city of the Federation.</p>
<p>Of course, that he had been posted to a towering tentage further in, of orange banners. Several people were there, mostly all fresh recruits and conscripts, talking about anything under the sun.</p>

</aside>
<p>The fresh air assaults Jeremy’s lungs, the cooling crisp air of autumn breathing new life into him. Refreshing, if it wasnt that they were about to go into a war.</p>
<p>Of course, being assigned to the orange tentage, with several others there waiting.</p>
<p>And of course… the three will meet. Just outside of the tentage.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Jeremy Forshken Jr. was sitting in his tent, wondering what lays ahead of him. He missed his home and his wife and his kids. He did <em>not</em> miss his job. He needed to be reminded of what was back home to keep sane. He pulled out his wallet, and stared at the picture he had in there. In there was a picture of the thing he wanted to see most, the picture contained the one entity that was his best freind, his partner in crime, and his true love. The Forshken Family shotgun.  He decided not to reminisce on what was back home. He needed to do something, be useful, and keep himself busy. He decided to step outside and get some fresh air. That seemed like a good start.</p>
