    <description>**The Jester.**  

Neutral Killer

Abilities:

**Feline reflexes** (Passive) - Immunity to occupation, redirection, bleeding, poison and death at night.
**Deceptive steps** (Passive) - Appears as a Support class for the first 2 nights. Your **true** visits are hidden.

**Puppet play** (Day) - Silence a player and impersonate him for the rest of the day. You can vote as him, but won&#39;t be able to speak/vote as yourself for the rest of the day. Not usable until day 3. _3 uses._ (Shared with **Dramatic ending**) 
**Deception and betrayal** (Day) - Chose a player, make it look like you visit him tonight. _Infinite uses_

**Cheerful stab** (Night) - Kill the targeted player. _Infinite uses-_
**Dramatic ending** (Night) - Attack a player thrice, killing him. Not usable until night 3. _3 uses._ (Shared with **Puppet play**) (Always kills the target unless something prevents the visit)


The Fool&#39;s brother, any feedback is appreciated.

Edit 1: 

Changed **Deceptive steps** to only work for 2 nights, pretty meaningless passive that will just save you really early in the 

I personally don&#39;t think that a NK with hidden visits is that OP, since all Nks are kind of hard to catch as Obs early in the game.</description>

            <p>If you are in a cult game, you wont need to save charges to kill someone who is immune besides King, so you can Puppet people more, in unseen games you wanna kill the MM, so you wont use it as much.</p>
<p>Abilities with shared charges are always interesting, since you need to think ahead of time.<br>
“If I Puppet this guys that looks like prince and I get him exed, im in a really good spot.”<br>
“This guy claims alch but I think he is the MM, ill kill him to make sure”</p>
<p>I dont think the ability is bad, I think that people would just tunnel vision and go for the kills. In a social deduction game, speaking as someone is pretty good.</p>

<p>Probably noone will use it and would just save the 3 charges to kill King/MM etc</p>

</aside>
<p>Here’s the problem. Make a Ability that a person would use. Not one that no one would use.</p>
<p>You see you could make a Ability that if you use it all it does is ban your account. Of course no (sane) person would use it and then why bother adding it? Make abilities that people will use not abilities that well there the problem guess no one will use it.</p>
