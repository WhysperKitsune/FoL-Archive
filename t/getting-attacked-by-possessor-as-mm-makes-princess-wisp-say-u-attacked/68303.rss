    <title>Getting attacked by Possessor as MM makes Princess wisp say u attacked</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/getting-attacked-by-possessor-as-mm-makes-princess-wisp-say-u-attacked/68303</link>
    <description>I was Mastermind, Princess wisped me night Possessor attacked me.  It made her wisp say I attacked.  

Obviously it shouldn&#39;t have.  I assume the feedback got confused with the puppet string&#39;s two targets. 

Very aggravating to lose a game because of a stupid bug. 

There was nobody to mindwarp the Princess or frame me.
