    <title>Possessor bug or oversight found: Discussed at greater length on my reddit post in the ToL subreddit</title>

    <description>I started as [3], observer, was possessed by [11], possessor. The ending credits suggested that I started as [11], observer, and that [11] started as [3], possessor. Take a look at the screenshot I posted on the reddit link.

The ending credits should clarify that I started as [3], observer, and should say that 3 ended the game as [3] possessed. It should keep my username next to [3]. It should clarify that [11] started out as possessor, and ended the game as something like &quot;Possessed [3]&quot;. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a better way to put it though. The possessor&#39;s username should stay behind [11].

To reproduce the bug, have your playey&#39;s body taken over by possessor or take over another players body as possessor. Look at the game-end chart.

            <p>It’s not a bug, but it should be clarified somehow</p>
