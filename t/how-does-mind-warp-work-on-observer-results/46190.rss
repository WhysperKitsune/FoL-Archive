    <description>I&#39;ve seen it make Sheriff results say NS when they were actually Unseen, but that&#39;s obvious.  How would it work on Observer Follow?</description>

            <p>It’s still essentially random. The class they’re assigned, their target (if Scorned or Mercenary) is randomly generated. While targets may not be completely random, it is mostly a guess, and I think that’s pretty close to RNG. I might talk d1 regardless of what class I am.</p>

<p>How is this RNG any different from any other kind of RNG? Any RNG past game settup should be avoided at all costs. It’s why I like bus crashing systems (where 2 drunks or 2 cw’s choosing the same target both fail)</p>

            <p>I hear you like RNG</p>
<p>New Neutral Killer Idea: The Gambler</p>
<p>Passive: <strong>Addiction:</strong> The Gambler’s addiction to gambling makes him immune to occupation and death.</p>
<p>Passive 2: <strong>Wheel of Fortune</strong>: When the gambler is executed for treason, a random player who voted execute will die.</p>
<p>Day Ability: <strong>Roll the Bones</strong> [unlimited]: Roll a 6 sided die. The result of this roll will affect your night abilities. If the gambler uses this ability, he MUST use an ability at night or he will lose a charge of <strong>Fate’s Hand.</strong></p>
<p>Night Ability 1 <strong>Deal The Daggers</strong> [unlimited]: Target a player tonight and attack them. If you used Roll the Bones, an additional effect occurs. ( 1 = You (the gambler) slip and cut yourself on one of your knives! You start bleeding. 2 - You temporarily lose occupy immunity during this attack. 3 / 4 / 5 - Standard. No extra effect. 6 - Your attack will bypass night immunity. )</p>
<p>Night Ability 2: <strong>Fate’s Hand</strong> [2 uses]: Target a number of players equal to half of your dice result and kill them. (rounded down. Rolling a 1 = no kills. Rolling 2 or 3 = 1 kill. Rolling a 4 or 5 = 2 kills. 6 = 3 Kills.)</p>

            <p>Yes, it is impossible to eliminate RNG.</p>
<p>It will still be there if we eliminate every RNG ability.</p>
<p>but the only way we can do is that we can reduce the RNG.</p>
