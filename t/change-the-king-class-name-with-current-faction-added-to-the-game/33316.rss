    <title>Change the King class name with Current Faction [ADDED TO THE GAME]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/change-the-king-class-name-with-current-faction-added-to-the-game/33316</link>
    <description>**EDIT: THANKS DEVS FOR ADDING MY IDEA! MUCH LOVE &lt;3**

&quot;The King&quot; is confusing for new players, they dont know which side they are!
What if below the portrait says:

&quot;The Cult King / The Evil King&quot; 
&quot;The Unseen King / The Evil King&quot; 
&quot;The Neutral King&quot; 
&quot;The Good King / The Blue Dragon King&quot;
&quot;The Psycho King&quot;
 
If we get this little change, new players will stop to throw their own faction, since they constantly see it.

And yea i know it says at the Beggining &quot;You are allied with&quot; but i think is not enough.

Hope you like my idea :slight_smile:

            <p>If this is done, maybe also make it so, on the player list in the King’s interface, their own name is colored with their true faction.  Most people go by the colors, I think, so seeing your name in purple / red would remind new players what side they’re actually on.</p>
<p>(Obviously only the king would see this color, everyone else would see white.)</p>

            <p>As you mentioned, it tells you who you’re allied with in the first line. That plus the portrait + the portrait border should be able to give enough of an image as to who you’re allied to.</p>
<p>However, I will say I’ve heard this a few times so it might be worth looking into. I can’t make  any promises that anything will happen though.</p>

            <p>While I agree with you. It’s actually more-so distinguished by the portraits.</p>
<p>Cult king have the king with a mutilated face<br>
Unseen will look like a middle eastern dictator<br>
Good king looks like the dad I never had<br>
Neutral/Psycho king I can’t think of anything funny for them, but yeah</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to know what’s what as long as you are paying attention.</p>
