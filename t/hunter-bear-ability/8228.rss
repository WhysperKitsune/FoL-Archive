    <description>#### What happened? - https://gyazo.com/811939be0da17a939528e53c95331a7c

&quot;You will set traps tonight&quot;

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? - 
I think it would be nice if it said &quot;Your bear will guard you tonight&quot; or something similar to that.

#### Steps to reproduce: Just use bear as hunter at night.
