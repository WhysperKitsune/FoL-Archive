    <title>Noob Question: Why do the Unseen spawn so much more often than the Cult?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/noob-question-why-do-the-unseen-spawn-so-much-more-often-than-the-cult/11953</link>
    <description>Title about sums it up.  In the games I play, something like 80-90% of them will have the Unseen rather than the Cult, which I think is kind of a downer since the Cult are so much more interesting lore-wise.  My friend had told me that the Cult won&#39;t spawn if any of the players in the game are new, but I know that this isn&#39;t the case because I wound up being Cult Leader on my very first game (I had no idea what I was doing, the King picked me at random to investigate on Night 1, and I got executed on Day 2).</description>

<p>Contradictory</p>
<p>I believe 75% or so of the players in the game must be experienced (I don’t know how many games) for cult to spawn</p>

            <p>If you haven’t played an amount of matchs you wont get a cult game , if nyone in the game is new you wont get a cult match . so more often than not someone is new so it spawns unseen</p>

            <p>Cult only shows up when there is more than 11 people.</p>
<p>And new player won’t be meeting cult, too.</p>
