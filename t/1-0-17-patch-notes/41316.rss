    <title>1.0.17 Patch Notes</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/1-0-17-patch-notes/41316</link>
    <description>## General:
* New female armor and new crossbow execution added.
* At least 1 Paladin will always spawn in Cult games.
* **REVERTED!** Abilities that do not count as visiting will now bypass things that say they prevented you from &quot;visiting&quot;. (The wording was originally meant as prevented from targeting and was worded before non-visiting abilities. This should provide a minor buff to Psycho King and a few other abilities.)

## Butler &amp; Servant:
* Concentrated Wine now bypasses occupy immunity. (This is the party ability)

## King:
* Starting King now has a 60% chance to be Good, 20% to be Neutral, and 20% to be Evil.
* Order Execution will now announce to the court that the King ordered the execution of a player.
* Order Execution will now bypass everything and will be unhealable.

## Bug Fixes:
* Fixed bug with Defile.
* Fixed a bug allowing people to update their public journal right after they died.
* Fixed a bug where a converted Unseen was promoted to Assassin after Assassin was promoted to Mastermind.
* Added logs to help find a Possess bug, which may have been fixed. If you encounter this bug please post your output_logs in the bugs channel in our discord server.</description>

            <p>It was revered because visit prevention is intended to be powerful. And frenzy shouldn’t bypass it either. And this thread is outdated anyways</p>

<p>Why was this reverted?  It makes sense for the wording.  And visit prevention is overpowered since the only thing which can bypass it is frenzy.</p>

            <p>At this point in time, with sheriff as solid as it is, I feel like his ability should only determine if a class has killing power.  No factions at all.  All it should say is that this class can kill (attack, prince, poison, or bleed).  I feel like that would level the playing field again.  This could report back as Not suspicious/ Suspicious.  I think it would also add to the social side of the game, as a sheriff who gets in contact with an observer can give him some guidance who to follow, and if he gets in touch with a princess, they can work on narrowing down claims… All without ever being able to flat out hang someone over just 1 lucky click.  Ex: Sheriff finds a killer class, has observer follow - killer visits number 11. 11 does not die.  Now they know 11 was either healed, night immune, or their killer was a knight or butler.  If it’s determined that sheriff can also detect MM as suspicious after day 4, then: Sheriff finds MM, shows as suspicious.  MM has claimed butler.  Sheriff whispers princess to check it.  Comes up Special/Invest instead of Support/Social (now I can’t remember if that changed, or if that was in the preview)… they have found their MM… but it took an extra day, and required more social interaction, with more chances for failure along the way (has to find a princess, has to actually BE a princess, princess has to survive)</p>

            <p>Actually, I just feel that if he is going to have a Killer ability, it should just be a regular one: that is overpowered enough. For more support or social based abilities: I think Royal Loan, Royal Decree, Political Pressure, or Private Matter would do great in supplanting two support/socual abilities while incorporating Royal Finger into a passive.</p>

            <p>Maybe it could bypass SOME things like heal or night Immunity (both both). But everything is just too much.</p>

            <p>I would like to say this: I genuinely think it is the best for the balance of the game for the King to have regular attacks, if he’s going to have a killer ability (I would personally prefer more Support or Social abilities on the King)</p>
<p>The fact that the King has two unstoppable kills makes it so possible for a Kings Out Meta to begin, which is really where I don’t want the direction to go. Yes, while 80% of the time, the King is Good and Neutral, (thank goodness), that 20% of the time where it is an Evil King, the King holds so much power that it is in the best interest of BD to get him out.</p>
<p>I just played my first game as an Evil King in this patch. Everyone whispered to me on Day 2, and then I had a Fool on executed on Day 4, allowing me to kill the Prince Night 4 and then the Psychic Night 5, even when they were both being healed and guarded, which heavily swung the game into the favor of the Cult from that point on.</p>
<p>It feels too overpowered to have a power like this. Hunter, I can understand, (except for allowing wolves to get into jail, as I believe nothing should be able to get to the jailed target except for Link Minds), but the King should definitely not have an OP ability as that one.</p>

<p>It should just be changed so sheriff can appear in both unseen and cult games, and expert investigation would determine if your target is cult or unseen(but not which one).  Scout should just determine when your target changes class.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I am worried that this might make possessors really hard to play I guess they could just make possess not count as a class change because technically you are now scouting a new player who’s class didn’t change.</p>
<p>The part about making him appear in both games is one I have suggested before. However Bos confirmed to me that he won’t be doing that (for whatever reason).</p>

<p>If the results are too spacific then it might be a good idea to give him some other things he can see under spacific circumstances for example he might also get a limited use true Faction check</p>

<p>That’s one of the problems I have with sheriff, it only affects the unseen.  Expert investigation is a bit boring since it only has two possible results, and surveillance is overpowered.  Sheriff needs another ability(that’s not overpowered/confirmable) to make him more fun to play.</p>

<p>Having that Ability and being confirmable however is definitely OP (and why Obs Peek needs to be only 2 uses).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed.  Being unconvertable + unique + guaranteed is also OP.</p>
