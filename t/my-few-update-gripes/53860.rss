    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-few-update-gripes/53860</link>
    <description>Hello there!

I don&#39;t mean to make my first post such a Debby... So first off I&#39;d really like to thank the devs for continuing to support this game in the effort to make it better! That said... I really think the new update has taken a step backward, as far as my interest in the game is concerned. I truly feel that some very amazing roles have been neutered, which really degrades the experience.

I believe removing the dead interactions entirely has drastically hurt the appeal of the game to me. It has simply neutered the phys and psy, whilst making the possessor a demi-god. 

I also believe the princess change has made her far too weak and less interesting. She was one of my favorite classes, and while I like trying to encourage her to flirt more - the will-o was her only protection in working with the king/prince daily.

While I like how the evil king percentage has sort of killed the whisp meta... the other changes I could do without.

Thoughts?

-Praise the Sun

            <p>Then reread my suggestion, because nowhere did I suggest that. I suggested a conditional type check, so only in some cases will you be able to discern if your target is of type: Special, Killer, Offensive, Support, Investigative or Social. A princess is now completely non-confirmable outside of stepping up with royal blood, so it is okay to make her have strong results.</p>

            <p>What about this:</p>
<p>Night Ability 2 - Wisp: Discover target’s player class type if they visit someone else. (2 uses)</p>
<p>Type meaning: Killer, Offensive, Support, Social, Special, Investigative.</p>
<p>Converts don’t count as visit, so they won’t be caught. It is strong, but so is Peek.</p>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<p>Night Ability 2 - Wisp: Discover target’s player class type if they get visited by someone. (3 uses)</p>
<p>This requires teamwork for the BD and is a lot less stronger than the earlier one. Princess can discover an exact type and the information that someone visited the target, or only that noone visited their target.</p>
<p>Or possibly this,</p>
<p>Night Ability 2 - Wisp: Discover if target player has royal blood. (unlimited uses)</p>
<p>It should be some non-confirmable investigative ability.</p>

            <p>I agree that the drunk and butler are pretty darn confirmable… See that’s the problem though, it isn’t just the butler and the drunk… it’s basically everyone except for phys. sheriff/pali, and knight. 3 frickin unconfirmable claims for all the evils to try and cram into at the same time. Maybe CW can kinda half way fit in that (but tornado is a confirming ability).</p>
<p>The fact is the game needs either more classes to slide into unconfirmability, Or more unconfirmable classes to be added to the roster.</p>

            <p>Both true! Now a butler needs to kill the king to confirm, but still is easily confirmable. I think I would have preferred giving the duchess the old will-o ability, akin to the invoker/butler. But if the dev’s want to make it harder for BD classes to confirm their roles, I’m also open to that. It seems that’s the direction they want to take it (given the generic messages on deb/serv).</p>

            <p>Not sure I understand what the problem is with making her that confirmable. It’s pretty obvious who the drunk is based off of targets, a butler can easily poison, noble can force vote etc. If anything this makes the princess damn near impossible to outright confirm.</p>
<p>With the increased evil percentage, the old will-o would have made people think twice about will-o-whisping the king, as he could be evil… and giving an evil king the ability to easily confirm simultaneously BD and Unseen roles ought to make any clever princess consider not whisping so early or solely to the king.</p>
<p>I think all that needed to be done was to mess with the evil/good king percentages.<br>
Also, while I agree that the NK ought to be powerful, the new possessor goes leaps and bounds beyond the intended reaper/sorc equivalents right now.</p>

<p>Possessor is supposed to be a demi-god.  If he dies he loses, he has no team.</p>
<p>I would like psychic to be able to talk to the dead again, however if that means bringing back the OP death knights and Possessor problem then I rather the dead interactions stay gone completely.</p>

<p>What if they classified every ability similar to how they do the classes and change the willowisp to an ability that helps you narrow down the ability type the target used that night?  e.g. if a Knight uses cs it would say they used a kill/off ability, if he guards it would say sup/soc, if cult leader converts it would say spec/inv, etc  Not sure how redundant that would be but it’s just a thought, I’m not good at coming up with class ideas</p>

            <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I don’t mean to make my first post such a Debby… So first off I’d really like to thank the devs for continuing to support this game in the effort to make it better! That said… I really think the new update has taken a step backward, as far as my interest in the game is concerned. I truly feel that some very amazing roles have been neutered, which really degrades the experience.</p>
<p>I believe removing the dead interactions entirely has drastically hurt the appeal of the game to me. It has simply neutered the phys and psy, whilst making the possessor a demi-god.</p>
<p>I also believe the princess change has made her far too weak and less interesting. She was one of my favorite classes, and while I like trying to encourage her to flirt more - the will-o was her only protection in working with the king/prince daily.</p>
<p>While I like how the evil king percentage has sort of killed the whisp meta… the other changes I could do without.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
