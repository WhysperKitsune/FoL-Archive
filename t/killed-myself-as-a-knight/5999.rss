    <title>Killed myself as a knight</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/killed-myself-as-a-knight/5999</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was a knight, died protecting the king AND was possessed and killed by a knight protecting the king: https://imgur.com/a/Lv0nG
There was only 1 knight that game (me), so that means i killed myself, which is not right.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was possessed, so I should&#39;ve just killed the king and stayed alive

#### Steps to reproduce:
Have a knight protecting the king and a possessor possessing that knight and forcing him to kill the king

#### Comments:
full chat log recorded in a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss36QWzr3J4

Also there&#39;s something up with the king (1) and possessor (12) classes. 1 was the king the whole game, but his start and final classes are &quot;possessor&quot;. 12 was never king but his start and final classes are &quot;king&quot;. It seems like 12 took over the king&#39;s body, so the start classes for them should probably be reversed: 12 should be possessor and 1 should be king. Or maybe i&#39;m missing something here.</description>

            <p>Nope. It was simply a good play by possessor.</p>
<p>Perhaps you shouldn’t have been guarding when there is a possessor, because you would only kill whoever they possessed and not the possessor.</p>

            <p>Yeah, possessor not occupying the possessed explains it. However i’d say that’s still a low priority bug that needs to be fixed eventually.<br>
I’m still confused about 1 and 12 classes though. Here are snapshots of their classes: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/L7XJf" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://imgur.com/a/L7XJf</a><br>
i didn’t record the game before day 7, but I remember that 1 was the king from the start, which is confirmed by the fact that there are no other dead kings at day 7. If 12 jumped into 1, shouldn’t he have a start class “possessor”?</p>

            <p>Being possessed does not Occupy you. If an observer visited the king they would see you visiting him twice. What happened is your guard went through as well as the possession attack.

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I was a knight, died protecting the king AND was possessed and killed by a knight protecting the king: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Lv0nG" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://imgur.com/a/Lv0nG</a><br>
There was only 1 knight that game (me), so that means i killed myself, which is not right.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I was possessed, so I should’ve just killed the king and stayed alive</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Have a knight protecting the king and a possessor possessing that knight and forcing him to kill the king</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>full chat log recorded in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss36QWzr3J4" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss36QWzr3J4</a></p>
<p>Also there’s something up with the king (1) and possessor (12) classes. 1 was the king the whole game, but his start and final classes are “possessor”. 12 was never king but his start and final classes are “king”. It seems like 12 took over the king’s body, so the start classes for them should probably be reversed: 12 should be possessor and 1 should be king. Or maybe i’m missing something here.</p>
