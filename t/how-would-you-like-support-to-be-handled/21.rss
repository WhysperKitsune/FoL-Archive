    <title>How would you like support to be handled?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/how-would-you-like-support-to-be-handled/21</link>
    <description>Mostly curious about this: Do you want to see a public forum that everyone can see to serve as a &quot;searchable knowledge-base&quot; of answers, in the future? 

**The advantage to this is that community members can help you as fast as possible and may even be able to find answers to your own questions before posting.**

Or would you rather want to see a &quot;ticket system&quot;, more private, with the ability to email your issue (rather than post it here)? 

**The disadvantage to this is that there are fewer staff members than community members, and may answer slower. However, every reply would be most definitely be answered by a staff member.**

Or perhaps a hybrid solution -- start here, then if needs escalation (or private matter, such as billing), you could email support?

## **Let us know your thoughts ~**</description>

            <p>Hmm, well. if they need guides/moderators or (Live-Chat) They’d probably assign a few trusted members of the discord community for this matter. I don’t see how this will be an issue really.</p>

            <p>Still not entirely sure what CGs are, but 40 people probably isn’t enough to guarantee 24-hour coverage, especially if multiple people are seeking support at the same time.</p>

            <p>I don’t see how it takes alot of money to setup a live-chat; i’d be able to fund it myself and participate in assisting it, 12 hours aday <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> but then again, that’s not quite my job to do so.<br>
Anyway, I could actually fund this. if it was requested<br>
Put it this way<br>
A live chat server / could be hosted on a sql database, that has connection to their website database ; a few edits and it should be implemented. Just some php/sql/http coding and a few .js scripts</p>

            <p>Live chat system - would be best.<br>
This way, you gain the following advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy Communication</li>
<li>Better to disclose files, so you don’t have to scatter them across the forums</li>
<li>All chats can be logged and sent via email, instead of having 1,000,000 Posts regarding Bans/or other private matters open to public</li>
<li>Certain people can be active for support chats during different timezones, Requirement (English)  atleast 18 years of age.</li>
</ul>
