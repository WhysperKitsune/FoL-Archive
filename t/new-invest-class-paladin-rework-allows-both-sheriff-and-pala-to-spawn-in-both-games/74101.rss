Targets that can kill or convert
- Butler
- Assassin
- MM
- CL
- Pretender
- Inqu
- Hunter
- Prince
- Knight
- Pala
- Alch
- ALL CAN BE CHANGED
-----------------------------------------------
Pros:
- Can Find people who can attack and see if they are a threat
- Can use his secondary ability to find out if a target has changed class, allowing them to attack or find out if they have attacked without wasting a night on them
- can find out the number of Unseen/Cult left 
- Can use Smite to defend himself and a target from a conversion and allow him to kill the converter 
- can find any fake neutral claims along with cult/unseen

Cons:
Can really only find Assassin,Cult,MM but does have the ability to check if that player has changed their results

            <p>A lot of unseen classes are just the BD version but are apart of the unseen. If I change too many of his abilities than he would be outed to be converted. I just don’t want a mystic convert where you can’t confirm with links anymore but I’m open to suggestions.</p>
<p>Also how do you think this class is too OP. Maybe cut back on his uses some more</p>
