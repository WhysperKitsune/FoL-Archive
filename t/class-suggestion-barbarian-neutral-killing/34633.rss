    <description>**Barbarian** - (Neutral Killing)

_This is a general Neutral Killer idea that introduces a new &#39;status&#39; for players, similar to &quot;Poisoned&quot; or &quot;Bleeding&quot;. The new status is &quot;Dazed&quot;, and would be represented by a spiral image laid over the affected player&#39;s icon instead of the skull &amp; crossbones or blood drops._

Passive 1: [CRACKED HELMET ICON]
**Hard Headed** - You are immune to murder, bleeding, and poison. (The usual thing for NKs, etc.)

Passive 2: [BLOODY FIST ICON]
**Berserk** - Your **Skull Splitter** target cannot be changed by others.

Day Ability: [CLUB ICON]
**Bonk!** - Daze the target player for three days (including the day you use it on). Players who are dazed can only speak once per day and cannot use day abilities. Daze can be healed like Bleeding/Poison. (3 uses.)

_^ If your target has already spoken on the day you Bonk! them, they would not be able to speak again on that specific day. Cannot be used on King._

Night Ability 1: [AXE ICON]
**Skull Splitter** - Choose a player to kill. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2: [ROARING TIGER]
**Beast Companion** - Kill any non-Neutral, non-immunes who visit you that night. (2 uses.)</description>

            <p>Edited this as per comments above. I actually forgot immunity. XD I knew there was something because it looked so short. I didn’t change the three-day duration for Daze yet, before I do, doesn’t it balance that by being healed like bleeding/poison? If not, no problem, just wanted to check before editing.</p>

            <p>Maybe lower Dazed duration to 2 days instead of three?</p>
<p>And not allow Bonking of King, because that’d be pretty OP. Or, if you do allow Bonking King, then lower uses of Bonk to 1?</p>
<p>Might want to add night immunity, because he seems really easy to kill atm.</p>
