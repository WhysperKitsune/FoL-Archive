            <p>a suggestion to change it up a bit. we change the name since the fool is already taken</p>
<p>The Masquerade(Neutral Evil<br>
Day Ability 1: Final Words???<br>
[2 attempt power] When someone dies on stand you can control their final words</p>
<p>Night Ability 1: Mask Of deception<br>
[1 attempt power] Choose a Target: The Target is given your win condition in addition to what they already have if your target dies before you have won you can use this again<br>
Win conditions: Kill the current king by getting everyone to vote him(because if he can any time that’s too easy gotta make it harder then that</p>
<p>I did hear you guys saying that you wanted a class that wanted other players dead and since the king hardly has enough defence to be called out of having something along these lines could give him more defence</p>

            <p>Hi there, these are cool suggestions <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> smart people think alike! We actually have a “Fool” class ;D we have something very similar to “Laughter of Death”, too (although it occupies them, not a kill)! Check it out:</p>
<p><strong>"Surprise Mojo":</strong> <em>The Fool can secretly replace a target player’s Night Ability with fireworks which occupies them and also cancels the target player’s immune during the night.</em></p>
