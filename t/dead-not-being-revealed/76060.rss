    <title>Dead not being revealed</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/dead-not-being-revealed/76060</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I exed a player as prince but we didn&#39;t see there role reveal until after the game was over. A couple other players who died also didn&#39;t get revealed properly as they died. There name appeared as if they were alive but were unselectable for votes/abilties. Game took place around 11: 40-11:54 us central time on 3/29/19

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
there role should be revealed upon death and other such indications that they are dead.

#### Steps to reproduce:
since this is a death reveal issue not sure how I can reproduce this other than play more.

#### Comments:
The main issue was not knowing the factions of several dead players and not knowing how many unseen/evil roles were left.</description>
