    <title>Noble Maid Spy does not work for me at all</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/noble-maid-spy-does-not-work-for-me-at-all/4050</link>
    <description>Joined game, assigned Noble stayed incognito early and waited for whispers to start.. when they did, my chosen targets never actually had their whispers revealed to me. The other Noble in this game said it was happening to him as well

Well, obviously I was supposed to be privvy to the whispers going to and from my target, was most certainly not.

1: Be Noble, 2: Use Maid Spy on someone using whispers.

Bout it, makes Noble very very underpowered as whispers are their only real secret intel gathering forte.</description>

<p>I was reporting hours before the 1.0.4 patch that whispers from cult members using ability Faint Whispers were getting seen by seen by Nobles.<br>
Boslof said it wasnt supposed to happen and they will fix it.</p>
<p>Were the whispers between cult members?<br>
Could you see any other whispers?</p>
