    <description>1.With Nobles, it&#39;s very clear- there is only one traitor maximum, good chance to pick the right one.
But on the second day, everyone can step up, even Fool, Reaper, Cult...
If Black Rose is fast enough, they might get both candidate spots.
The same is true for Cult. Or maybe Cult vs Rose?
It all depends on the clicking speed then, which is not so nice.

2.If the(initial) King has a good chance to be bad/neutral, he will be charged with treason every single time on Day 2.

3.What is stopping the Sheriff to always investigate the King Night 1?</description>

<p>Yeah, there can be a maximum of one evil Royal.(Traitor Princess or Traitor Noble)<br>
(This is also the reason for votes)<br>
But let’s say you really don’t have nobles. Prince is dead and Princess and Noble don’t exist.<br>
How many can step up?</p>

            <p>why not make it that there are a max of 3 of new kings(this would set a max amount of time on how long these waste time<br>
also why not have royals simply get the throne instend of wasting time on voting leave that to non royals</p>
<p>and yea having the voting before night would let for final day powers they some classes can make use off</p>

<p>Hmm, I realized I worded it awkwardly – it’s not that the royals are necessarily <strong>dead</strong>, it’s that they did not step up to become King. To become King as a Royal is actually an ability to click called “Royal Blood”. This trumps all slots and they become King. We haven’t decided if we will announce that a royal stepped up (because a royal could be quiet to see who wants to be king, and THEN trump it, as if they won the vote). There’s a few mechanics to test during Alpha. But the <strong>TL;DR is that royals can OPTIONALLY step up at any time when the king is dead, but they don’t have to, and can wait to use it.</strong></p>

</aside>
<p>We don’t have a determined time yet, but we’re taking suggestions. The thing that we want to avoid is voting TOO OFTEN, which could lead to boredom. Perhaps the king’s voting could take place before night instead of the morning to allow for extra conversation … this part isn’t coded in yet, so now is a good time to hear your voice.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t know the Kings faction unless you already know the living players class. This isn’t a situation that would ever really happen - if you know someone’s a bad guy you’d vote him off, or like <span class="hashtag">#1</span> you vote for the one you think is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good question.</strong> <span class="bbcode-s">The king can’t do much early game. Sure you could, but there’s more important targets. Let’s say day 1 you call out the king. How do you know this? Everyone instantly knows youre sheriff. You’re dead the next day. Worth it? Probably not, you’d likely want to call out the Mastermind, Assassin or a killer.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: In fact, it was so good of a question that I didn’t even know we updated this! It’s not on the Wiki (I’ll update it now), but it was changed so that the king is uninvestigatable (is that a word? haha)</p>
