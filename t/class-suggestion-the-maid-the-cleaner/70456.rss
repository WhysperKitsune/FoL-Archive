# Context

I always thought that a class that can mess up with the day-time can be a challenging and fun class to play as and against.

The BD night ability can use some work, but as of now I couldn&#39;t think of a better ability to use there. Let me know if you have better suggestions.</description>

<p>“no class deserves a hard counter”</p>
<p>i know this isn’t exactly a hardcounter, but it’s still effective against it, and should be removed. NK win rates are already low enough as it is.</p>
<p>also maybe give maid more day abilities or something and another use of coffee but nerf it to 30 seconds. She doesn’t seem very powerful atm.</p>
