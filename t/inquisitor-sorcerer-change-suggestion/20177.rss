    <title>Inquisitor/Sorcerer Change Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/inquisitor-sorcerer-change-suggestion/20177</link>
    <description>I think that inquisitors have too much of a reward for attacking without checking. By day 2 you have a solid idea of 3-4 people who are BD, and you also know you and the king are not sorcerer. Why does that matter? Well that leaves ~10/16 players left. He can now attack anyone have have a ~10% chance of hitting sorcerer. If more people die the next night that % increases again. Randomly attacking even just 2/3 times has a very high % chance of working out using basic binomial probability. If you weren&#39;t even using checks you have ~38% chance of winning by attacking randomly 3 nights in a row from the FIRST night  The check/bait system of sorcerer is interesting but usually a waste of time to confirm before attacking.

What I propose is killing or inflicting a 1 day bleed upon the inquisitor if they hit a non-magic user. This empowers the bait ability from sorcerer to indirectly kill the inquisitor without having to waste 2 turns attacking him or mindgaming the BD to make them execute inquisitor which is nigh impossible. Sorcerer might not need a buff if this change is implemented.</description>
