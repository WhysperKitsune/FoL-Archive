    <title>[Class Suggestion] Knight 2.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-knight-2-0/24888</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve updated this in an easier to read format (using the provided template) and fleshed it out more.

**Knight (Unique)**
Blue Dragon, Killer

**Goal:** Eliminate all Unseen, Cult, and any Neutral Killers.

**Passive Ability 1: Royal Defender**
If two members of the Blue Dragon who have Royal Blood are killed, you will commit suicide. (_If the second death occurs during the day, you will not be able to use your abilities that night and will commit suicide at that night&#39;s conclusion_).

**Passive Ability 2: Oath of Loyalty**
Immune to conversion as long as all living court members with the Royal Blood passive remain aligned with the Blue Dragon. Once a Royal Blooded member has been converted, immunity is lost.

**Night ability 1: Patrol (3 uses)**
Visit someone, guarding them if they appear to be a member of the Blue Dragon, and attacking them if they appear to be Cult, Unseen, or Neutral. Cannot target the King.

**Night ability 2: Command The Troops (2 uses)**
If the King uses his Guards! ability, his target will be revealed to you and you will be immune to death.

I think this would make the Knight a lot more fun to play. Obviously the Patrol ability is very powerful, so the Knight becomes a unique class in this case, and it has limited uses. It also fits the persona of a Knight to have his objective somewhat tied to the Royal Blood passive, and gives him a fairly easily exploitable weakness.</description>

            <p>I know about that. This is why it works as a passive rather than a day ability or something. If that wasn’t true it would make the ability OP for the Knight.</p>

            <p>Here’s the thing. When you kill an evil in ToS, its one less evil. That is not true in ToL. Half of evils are night immune in the first place. And, if you do find one, they can just make more. If they made more, you only speeded the game by making effectively an extra kill, which is actually good for the evils (less time for invest).</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s definitely a powerful ability. It would be OP if it had infinite uses for sure. Limiting the number of uses is the easiest way to balance it. Maybe only 2, or up to 4 uses at most would probably be sufficient.</p>

<p>I think knight is mostly fine.  It is not a late game class and should not be played as such.  I think one change that can address the “unfun to die so early” aspect is to make it so that knights that are rezzed by physicians are more powerful than other DKs.  For example, the DK that was a knight might have extra charges of its abilities or maybe can keep CSing until it targets a BD.</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t guard king night 1 ever, because it’s a terrible play. You don’t know if there is a Possessor, and if there is one and he chooses to possess some random Bd to attack the King on your guard, you’ve lost 2 Bd right off the bat. Let the healers heal King n1 while he does a check.</p>

</aside>
<p>Knight to me is bad because even if you guard a Sheriff/Paladin who just outed himself to get an evil player executed, you can’t prevent them from being converted with Sacrifice, and you have no idea if they were on the night of your watch, or any night thereafter. If Knight has the Patrol ability I proposed (it would likely have limited uses), you could target the Sheriff that just outed himself the night following his lead to an execution. He gets converted that night, but you guard him because he was Bd when the night began. Then you target him again the next night, and you will then attack him as he is now detected as Unseen.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s were if you kill a bd player, instead of killing them. You can no longer guard or coldsteal. Instead you communicate with them at night</p>

            <p>I disagree with your premises. The lack of a role list hurts sure but the conversion system means you are MORE likely to know an evil by yourself. If someone is converted then they might start acting differently, if you are good you can catch this and CS them. Plus the existence of classes like psy mean that you have a shot at getting proper exclusive and reliable info that the rest of the court lacks thus letting you get kills in yourself.</p>

            <p>While I’m on the fence about this design, the knight sure feels super useless. In games like ToS without conversion and role lists, you can figure out evils yes.</p>
<p>But in ToL, especially in cult games, even late game picking an evil tends to be kind of random. So it’s only good to CS when BD loses unless you get lucky.</p>
<p>Like, physician is basically a better knight, cause he protects without dying and summons an immortal knight.</p>
