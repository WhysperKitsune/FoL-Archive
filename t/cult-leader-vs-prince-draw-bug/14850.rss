    <title>Cult Leader vs Prince - Draw? Bug?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cult-leader-vs-prince-draw-bug/14850</link>
    <description>Just had a game where I was Cult Leader vs. Prince and the game ended in a draw. Is this intended or a bug?

I can only see this being correct if Cult Leader and Prince are BOTH out of charges, but in this case I (CL) had bleeds and the Prince had nothing, so I thought that would be a win.</description>
