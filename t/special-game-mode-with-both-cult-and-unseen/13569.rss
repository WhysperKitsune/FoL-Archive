    <title>Special game mode with both cult AND unseen</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/special-game-mode-with-both-cult-and-unseen/13569</link>
    <description>1 king, could not be evil
1 prince
1 MM
1 assassin
1 cult leader
1 random cult not apostle
2 neutrals, one of which is an NK
8 BD

two other options:

1) calm
Because both cult and unseen will decimate the BD, the two neutrals will be BD. No NK

2) extra chaos
Both neutrals are reaper and possessor

---------------

I think this would be tremendously fun</description>

            <p>Yeah if cult and unseen are in the game it only makes sense to have the investigator be able to investigate all scum.  Suggestion call it Chaos Investigator.</p>
<p>Also by upping up the body count per game, Chaos modes could always be a test game in a sense of trying out new classes before going live to Casual or Ranked play.</p>

            <p>I was also thinking of a super investigator, a combination of sheriff and paly, for this game mode only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Detective</strong><br>
Blue dragon Investigative<br>
<strong>Day ability: Scout</strong><br>
Same as sheriff’s<br>
<strong>Day ability: Smite</strong><br>
Same as paladin’s but day ability and activates following night<br>
<strong>Night ability: Background check</strong><br>
Determine if your target is a member of the cult/unseen. If they are, they will be seen as “Conspirator”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Converts to Marshall and seeker<br>
would be guaranteed to have at least one, but could have another</p>

            <p>Well surely this would then be</p>
<p>BD vs Cult vs Unseen? So it wouldn’t be BD against Cult &amp; Unseen together. Would be interesting for sure.</p>

            <p>Right. I was thinking you could just either give the Sheriff smite (does not bypass night immunity) or the paladin scout and giving they’re main ability the power to find both factions.</p>
<p>I’d go with the paladin or a new class with the Ability’s I just mentioned so we can design a converted unseen that can find factions effectively so they can maintain the fake claim by finding cult.</p>

            <p>I was considering that, but it might be too powerful. Of course, it would be balanced by it being suspected of it having been converted every day after it reveals.</p>

            <p>yeah I didn’t know If I could add more BD. The thing to consider is that the bad guys will have issues getting conversions off.</p>

            <p>1 king, could not be evil<br>
1 prince<br>
1 MM<br>
1 assassin<br>
1 cult leader<br>
1 random cult not apostle<br>
2 neutrals, one of which is an NK<br>
8 BD</p>
<p>two other options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>calm<br>
Because both cult and unseen will decimate the BD, the two neutrals will be BD. No NK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extra chaos<br>
Both neutrals are reaper and possessor</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I think this would be tremendously fun</p>
