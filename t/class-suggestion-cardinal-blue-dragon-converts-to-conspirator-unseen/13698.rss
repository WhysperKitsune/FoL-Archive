    <title>[Class Suggestion] Cardinal (Blue Dragon), converts to Conspirator (Unseen)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-cardinal-blue-dragon-converts-to-conspirator-unseen/13698</link>
    <description>**Cardinal** - A church leader who has &#39;selflessly&#39; made himself the King&#39;s right hand.

Passive: 
**Sacramental Toast** - If you are murdered within the first 3 nights, your killer will be poisoned with Nightshade wine.

Day Ability:
**Confessional** - Hear all whispers to the King (but not FROM the King) within the next 8 seconds. (Limited use. 2 uses with 1 day cool down?)

Night Ability 1:
**Midnight Mass** - You will see the class names of players who visit you, but not the names of the players themselves. IE: &quot;Your mass was attended by a Court Wizard, a Knight, and a Physician.&quot; (Limited Use. 2?)

Night Ability 2:
**Condemnation** - Block your target from being converted AND from converting others. (Unlimited use **as per community comments below.**)

Lore: You&#39;re a meddling head of the church who has insinuated himself into the King&#39;s business.


**Conspirator**

Passive 1:
**Trained Rat** - You may still use your night abilities when in the dungeon.

Passive 2:
**Historical Revision** - If executed, you will be revealed as a Cardinal. (Your actual class does not change, it is purely cosmetic. People will figure it out when you can&#39;t be resurrected, IF they try.)

Night Ability 1:
**Mark of Sin** - Cause a player to be revealed as a Conspirator if they are killed that night. (Single use. Note: This does NOT conflict with &quot;Historical Revision&quot;. One is for night death and the other is for daytime execution.)

Night Ability 2:
**Excommunicate** - Select two players. Neither will hear the first three things the other says the next day. IE: Select Pete and Bob. The next day, they can&#39;t hear each other for the first three things they each say. (Limited use. 4?)

Lore: You know, if these impious Blue Dragon folks were to pass away, you could probably remake the kingdom in your image... &lt;_&lt;</description>

            <p>Cardinal is too “confirmable”. I believe the Devs only want confirmable roles to be ones with Unseen counterparts with the Same Abilities (psychic, Noble) or ones like Prince.</p>

            <p>Changed the Cardinal’s passive, and made his night action unlimited. I think the suggestions work a lot better.</p>

            <p>Too many limited uses, make at least 1 ability to be unlimited</p>

            <p>Blessed wine on the cardinal seems counter-productive as most of the time the first poison attempt on the King is a butler who is also BD and you should be working with.</p>

            <p>I feel like the Cardinal is too underpowered and wouldn’t accomplish much, but Conspirator is interesting.</p>
