    <title>Mafia Championship Season 8 - RESULTS ARE IN! (post 464)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mafia-championship-season-8-results-are-in-post-464/87580</link>
    <description>Ahoy there! :)

I’m very excited to invite your community to participate in Season 8 of the Mafia Championship.

The Mafia Championship is an annual forum-based tournament series that pits representatives from various online Mafia (aka Werewolf) communities against one another as they compete to determine the Internet’s greatest forum Mafia player. Each participating community democratically elects one person to represent them and be their “Champion”.

The tournament first started back in 2013. Since then, 320+ different communities and 50+ different nationalities have been represented.

It’s a super fun event that has created many new friendships and close bonds between communities. I hope that you would be interested in taking part yet again :)

### **1) DO YOU ACCEPT THE INVITATION?**

If your community wishes to participate, please confirm your participation to Lissa as soon as you can to ensure yourselves a spot. Currently, the plan is to accommodate 150 communities this season. If there is further interest, additional communities may sign up as substitutes; generally there are some replacements needed both before and during games.

If your community agrees to participate, the deadline for selecting your representative is **May 7th**, but the sooner the better.

The games will take place on Mafia Universe.

[u]**Important notes**[/u]

* You may decide yourselves how you want to elect your representative, but we highly recommend some sort of democratic process (public nominations followed by a poll usually works out well).
* In addition to electing a representative, you should also name an alternate (a back-up) who will be asked to step in if the first choice needs to back out.
* Your representative should be prepared for having to read **upwards of 500-600 posts per 24 hours** during the early stages of the game. Additionally, there’s a requirement that each player must make at least 10 posts per Game Day. Only active players should apply/participate. **I repeat: Your chosen player needs to be able to promise a good amount of activity on a daily basis!**

### **2) SEASON 8 FORMAT**

[u]**The Tournament Structure**[/u]

* **150 communities** will participate, each sending one representative.
* **QUALIFIERS:** 10 Qualifier Games will be played, consisting of 15 players each. I.e. every representative plays in one Qualifier Game. The players themselves vote post-game to determine who is deserving of advancement. 1st and 2nd place will advance to the Semifinal Games.
* **SEMIFINALS:** A Jury consisting of finalists from Season 7 (presumably including our own @Arete) will select 25 additional players to advance to the three Semifinal Games. From each game, five players will advance to the Finale Game based on a post-game player vote, just like in the qualifying phase.
* **THE FINALE:** The Finale Game is played. Once it has completed, the players vote to determine who shall receive the title of Season 8 Champion and a winner’s certificate signed by Dmitry Davidoff, the creator of mafia.

[u]**This year’s setup: Gold Rush 15er**[/u]

**[color=red]2x Mafia Goons[/color]**

**[color=red]1x Mafia Roleblocker[/color]**

**[color=green]1x Town Motion Detector[/color]**

**[color=green]1x 1-Shot Town Vigilante (n2+)[/color]**

**[color=green]1x Town Doctor[/color]**

**[color=green]9x Vanilla Townie[/color]**

Flips are alignment only.

**[u]Relevant Mechanics[/u]**

* Day start.
* Majority elimination is enabled Day 2+, but majority is not required at any point for the elimination.
* Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.
* No outside communication. I.e. you may not contact the other players outside of the thread (unless you are Mafia and wish to speak with your teammates).
* Phase Lengths and Deadlines will be up to the players themselves (I’ll organize your representative into a game with deadlines that suit their preferences).
* Thread is locked during Night Phases.
* Votes are automatically locked in at LYLO.
* Mafia factional kills are [u]assigned[/u]. They can be tracked, watched, roleblocked, etc. (In this setup, that means they display as an action to the Motion Detector action.)
* Mafia share a factional Night Kill, which is a single standard shot for their faction. **The mafia factional kill is mandatory.**
* Mafia may communicate at any time.
* Each individual player may make a maximum of 150 posts per day phase (this restriction is lifted 2 hours before day end).
* The game will have a host to oversee everything and make sure everyone’s following the code of conduct, but otherwise the game is completely automated (automatic votecounts, thread locks and reveals alignments automatically, the bot receives and processes actions, etc.).

### **3) SEASON 8 TIMELINE**

There will be 10 Qualifier Games, and your representative plays in just one of these. They will have start dates ranging from mid-May to early July. So in other words, as long as your representative can play sometime during that period, they should be good and I’ll make sure they get scheduled into a game that suits their schedule well. I.e. if your rep is busy until June, that isn’t a problem.

The Semifinal Games will be played in July/August, and the Finale Game sometime in August/September (whenever we can work out something that suits everyone).

If you want to get in contact with an organizer ASAP, you can reach out to Lissa on Discord (Lissa#8083).

Kind regards,
