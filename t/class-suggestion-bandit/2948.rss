    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-bandit/2948</link>
    <description>&gt;The bandit
neutral offensive
**Night ability: cut-purse**
(3 uses) If the target has royal blood, gain 3 gold. They will lose their royal blood passive.
**Night ability: rob(or mug)**
(infinite uses) occupy the target. They will lose a use of the ability they tried to use if it has limited uses. If they did lose a use of an ability from this, gain 1 gold.
**Day ability: burglarize**
(2 uses) target will lose a use of each of their limited use abilities, and you will gain a gold for each ability you took a use from them of.

Goal: get 12 bars (not sure if 12 is to high or low, please suggest a different one if you like in the comments)</description>

            <p>Also, the bandit is no where near the same as ashe’s thief.</p>
<p>Ashe’s thief is less harmful to anyone. Everyone with a limited use ability wants the bandit dead, so the bandit is on a race to get the 12 bars before he is outed.</p>

            <p>Not to mention this helps the bad guys a lot, should the bandit go for Princesses and Prince just to screw with the Blue Dragons, and they lose their priority to become next king faster as well less trustworthy.</p>
<p>I am saying this hurts BD a lot doesn’t mean they don’t have second thought with converted ‘royal’ members.</p>
