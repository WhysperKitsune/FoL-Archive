    <title>Is it rare to jump bodies with possessor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/is-it-rare-to-jump-bodies-with-possessor/3791</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been possessor atleast 6 times and every time i try to possess someone it says something like &#39;you failed to possess name[number]&#39; then they die and I&#39;m wondering why this happens?

 I read the wiki page for possessor and i don&#39;t see anything indicating why it fails.</description>

            <p>Well, from personal experience, I rarely ever <strong>choose</strong> to jump bodies with Possessor.<br>
So, I’m not too sure if it’s so difficult now.<br>
However, yes, there are variables which stop you jumping.</p>
<p>Night Immunity, Healing, Imprisonment (Of target), Same night death and more.</p>

            <p>If the person you are attacking is also attacked by someone else then the possession fails. If the person survived your attack then the possession also fails.</p>
