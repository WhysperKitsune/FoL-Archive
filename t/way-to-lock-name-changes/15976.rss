    <title>Way to lock name changes?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/way-to-lock-name-changes/15976</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a streamer for TOL and it&#39;s just a matter of time before I come across someone who snipes and ruins the game for me and my team. I don&#39;t really care about the killing me part because it&#39;s what I expect to happen, but to throw the game for unseen/cult the few time I&#39;m on there is pretty messed up. Anytime it happens I wait til large end of the game and I report the player, then I start the next game only to find he changed his name at the main lobby because it&#39;s free and can be done as many times as you like and I get sniped again. 

On the latest patch notes i have not seen anything address this small thing and I understand because the balance of the game is super important. But if I can leave a game because I remember the name and dont want to play with that troll again would be a great QOL  change. 

It could be locked through gold or $ does not really matter as long as there is some oversight to people abusing this</description>

            <p>I don’t see how that will make it easier. They can identify people’s old names, and every time a player is reported the devs look at the reported player’s waning history</p>

            <p>Or you could make it so a mod would check possible reports related to the name before accepting the change. If there is no registered reports, the change would happem automatically tho. That way it would be easier to ban the repeated trolls and snipers.</p>

            <p>Maybe just add a separate tagging system that can be changed, it just takes much longer<br>
Could be that a mod has to look at it, nut it would probably be better to just limit changing this tag to something like once a week</p>
