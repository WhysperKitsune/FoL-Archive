    <title>Assassin loses all double strike and poison when MM dies</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/assassin-loses-all-double-strike-and-poison-when-mm-dies/32876</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was enforcer and our mastermind was put on trial day 3. Since it was early our assassin got promoted to mastermind and I was promoted to assassin. Two messages in chat said I was the new assassin. However when I was the new assassin I had no poison charges or double strike charges.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Since the first assassin didn&#39;t use any abilities I should of had 4 charges of poison and 1 charge of double strike.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Hang the mastermind with an assassin that has used no abilities and make sure that the assassin is promoted to mastermind as the other unseen(Preferably enforcer) is promoted to assassin at the same time.
#### Comments:
This is a huge bug because it negates a lot of the unseen killing power.</description>

            <p>Yeah but I don’t see this interaction listed anywhere so I think it wasn’t intended, and losing a double kill and 4 poisons is kinda extreme especially if the mastermind died for playing bad because they have to die in the first 3 nights for it to happen.</p>
