    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fm-day-one-mafia-town-and-the-exiled-win/63020</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; :clock10: [color=darkblue]Introduction[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
Hate dying first on every game you play? Do you enjoy lynching people? Ever wondered what would happen if you combine Forum Mafia and the film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;?
If your answer to any of those question is yes, then welcome to Day one mafia!

**Lore:**
Town got tired of their own members throwing and letting mafia win, so they hired 3 guys called the Time Keepers. These guys created a loop that rewinds time to the beginning of D1 at the end of the night, reviving anyone that was lynched or killed. The Mafia&#39;s job is to kill these time keepers and get rid of the loop!

&lt;big&gt; :clock10: [color=darkblue]Gameplay[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
**General:**
* Days will be 3 IRL days long, or shorter if someone dies
* Nights will be 1 IRL days long
* Actions are done by messaging me
* When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it
* Mafia will have a day and night chat.

**Main Mechanics:**
* The game mostly works like a normal mafia game, but the game will &quot;rewind&quot; at the end of the night. Anyone that is lynched or killed will revive the following cycle.
* If a player is banished or if a Time Keeper/Exiled dies then they will be dead permanently.
* There are no Town investigative roles, the main way for town to find out a player&#39;s class is through lynches.
* Not all flips will be real however, the Disguiser is able to change some of them.
* If the assassin kills someone their class will flip and everyone will be able to see it.
* Night flips will be made public before the day resets.
* When the day resets, every dead player will revive. Banished players will not revive, and the uses of any limited use abilities will not be recovered.
* Town wins by successfully banishing all the Mafia members.
* Mafia wins by killing all three Time Keepers.
* Most classes have limited uses on their abilities, to balance the fact that they revive when lynched/killed.
* Except for Mafia members and Time Keepers, no other class is unique. There is also no hard limit as to the number of players that can get the same class.

**Lynches:**
* You can lynch people on the first cycle.
* To lynch a player, write /lynch or /vote and the name of the player.
* Once the majority is reached, the player will be lynched.
* Lynching a player ends the day immediately.
* The class of a lynched player will flip, but the lynched player will revive the next cycle, unless they are a Time Keeper, The Exiled or affected by Timelock.
* Town is not directly punished for mislynching, unless they lynch a Timekeeper.

**Quirks and interactions:**
* If the target of a disguise is banished, their banished class will also appear disguised.
* The Disguiser is able to use &quot;disguise&quot; on his mafia members or even on themselves.
* &quot;Emergency Disguise&quot; is not a targeted ability, it will work on whoever is lynched the day its used.
* Timelock is applied at the beggining of the next cycle, which means it will not cancel any night abilities used by the target.
* A player that is attacked or executed while under the effects of timelock will be banished.
* Since timelock takes effect the following cycle, if a player is attacked on the same night &quot;Timelock&quot; was used they will NOT be banished.
* If a Time Keeper dies due to their &quot;Paradox&quot; passive they will die instantly. This death cannot be healed or prevented by any means.
* Vortex has a higher priority than most abilities in the game, which means it will kill other players before they even visit. This can be used to prevent attacks and even banishes from an &quot;Exiled&quot;.
* Time Warden cannot target themselves with vortex. They can however be redirected to themselves with a Wizard&#39;s Teleport.
*The Assassin cannot attack his own mafia members. Disguiser can attack himself or his mafia members with &quot;Setup&quot;.
* The Doctor can only heal attacks. The Exiled however can heal a player that is attacked, banished or timelocked.
* If a player is occupied while trying to use a limited use ability, one use of the ability will be spent.
* Players cannot be redirected when using non-targeted abilities such as &quot;Emergency Room&quot;, 
* Mystic night abilities are instant, so the mystic cannot be occupied or redirected.
* If the forgotten turns into a mafia class, they will not join their night chat.
* If the forgotten turns into a town class and is banished by a Time Keeper, the Paradox passive will not trigger.
* If the forgotten turned into a mafia class, town doesn&#39;t need to banish them in order to win the game.


**Draws and auto-solve**
* If the last Time Keeper dies on the same night the last member of the mafia is banished the game will end in a draw.
* If the Time Warden is the only Time Keeper alive, has a single use of &quot;vortex&quot; and uses it to banish the last member of the mafia, the game will end before the &quot;Paradox&quot; passive takes place and Town will win.

**Logbook and Deathnotes**
* Message me your entire logbook, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed
* You may submit a message or image when attacking or banishing someone. It will be shown when they flip as a deathnote.


**To Join**
* To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like &quot;I want to join&quot; or &quot;/join&quot; or &quot;/in&quot; or &quot;sign me up, coach&quot; or whatever you want

            <p>Post Game Rant</p>
<p>I didn’t even know memesky claimed I just disguised him cause he always gets mislynched D2</p>
<p>Also I disguised myself the next night but you guys lynched squid instead so I had to emergency disguise him(prob bad move &amp;_-) We might’ve won otherwise. Also we knew who the mages were but the god damn protectives, there’s too many of them(literally 3/4 protective classes with a recharger) and then you can target dead people to banish but no dead people to disguise??? Why.</p>
