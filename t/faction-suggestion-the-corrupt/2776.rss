    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Corrupt</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-corrupt/2776</link>
    <description>The Corrupt can have up to 4 members.
Their conversion pierces normal conversion immunities, making almost everyone convertable. And they do this at day, at any point, even at trial.
On the flip side, it has a member that needs to be protected at nearly all costs, and their killing power is not high.
**Conversion/Promotion Mechanics:**
Conversion:avaliable even on trial, if it is a day conversion.
Promotion: 
1. Corruptor : The replacement of the Corruptor takes place according to the abilities of the Corruptor and The Source.
2.The Source: If the Source dies before Night 3, the oldest Corrupt becomes The Source.
                     If the Source dies on Night 3 or later the oldest Corrupt becomes The Source as soon as they have been Corrupt for 7 days. A Source King will have the same position as a regular Source.

It starts with the following two members:

&gt;**_The Corruptor_** (Corrupt Special) 
**Passive 1:Pass on:** If you die or are promoted by any means except The Great Cleansing or the wrong usage of Corrupt Air and if The Source is alive the oldest inferior Corrupt member will become The Corruptor.
**Passive 2:Dependant:**As long as there is no Source, you cannot convert.
**Day Ability 1:Spread Corruption**
Convert someone to The Corrupt, ignoring normal Conversion Immunities. Their class will not change except for the King and Knight but they will meet with you at night(King excluded).2 days cooldown,unlimited uses. Failing to corrupt does not reset the cooldown.
**Day Ability 2:Corruption Focus**
Your Corrupt Touch will ignore immunities, guards, healing, and steal all souls. **Spread Corruption will get a cooldown of 4 days.** One use.
**Night Ability 1:Corrupt Touch**
Kill someone. Unlimited uses, but 1 day cooldown.
**Night Ability 2 Corrupted Air**
Frame someone as a Corrupted when they are not. Usage on The White Agent results in your death. Unlimited Uses, but 1 day cooldown.

&gt;**_The Source_**
Corrupt Special
**Corrupt Aura(Passive)** - You are immune to death at night and the other Corrupt know who you are; however, you only know the Corruptor and do not meet with them.
**Forged Ancestry(Passive)** - You can step up as King as if you had Royal Blood, and you will be promoted into The Source King if promoted as King
**Hide Corruption(Day)** - If you are investigated the next night you will show up as Blue Dragon - Unlimited Uses
**Pass Corruption(Day)** - Convert someone into The Corruptor, ignoring normal conversion immunities. Can not be used if The Corruptor is alive - Unlimited Uses, but 6 days cooldown. Failure to corrupt does not reset the cooldown.
**Corrupt Sight(Night)** - Determine the target&#39;s class, who it visits and who visits your target  - Unlimited Uses


**_The Corrupt King_**
Corrupt Special
(usual king abilities)

&gt;**_The Source King_**
Corrupt Special
**(Passive)Enhanced Corruption:** You are immune to death and occupation at night
**(Passive)Do Not Pass The Torch:**If you die there will be no more king.
**(Day) The Royal Finger**(as usual)
**(Day) Decide Fate**(as usual)
**(Night)Unhindered Corruption:** Convert someone into The Corrupt, ignoring normal Conversion immunities. If you have too many members or if your target is The White Agent, they die instead, regardless of immunities. Unlimited Uses(and NO cooldown!)
**(Night)Guards(as usual)

**_Changed classes_**:

_**Corrupt Knight**_(Corrupt Killing) 
Cold Steel has only one more use; and you can kill Blue Dragon with it.

And now the enemy:
&gt;**_The White Agent_**
Blue Dragon Special

Replaces the Prince(!) and the regular investigative.

**Incorruptible(Passive)** - You are immune against Corruption and Occupy.
**White Barrier(Passive)** - You are immune to Death for the first three nights and on the night you use The Great Cleansing.
**The White Grip(Day)** - Your target will be occupied during next night if they are Corrupt or The King, this ignores Occupy immunities. You may target The King with this - 1 use
**White Bond(Day)** - If you die tonight, your target gets promoted into The White Agent if they are a convertible class and not Corrupt, you can no longer be revived if you succeed. - 1 use
**Resonance(Night)** - Determine if someone is a member of The Corrupt. The Source will show up as Not Corrupted on Night 1. - Unlimited Uses
**The Great Cleansing(Night)** - Kill someone if they are a member of The Corrupt, ignoring night immunities. If you kill The Source or The Source King with this, then they cannot be replaced(as Source or Source King) You may target The King with this. - 1 Use

            <p>With the revival and the talking to dead gone Source was nerfed and Prince not being there means that you cannot convert them(but they are also not a pain if they aren’t) so it should balance out with the nerf to the Agent.</p>

            <p>That isn’t.<br>
The revival and talking to the dead is.<br>
The prince has been removed because some people had complained about trust issues.(notably you have the unconvertable White Agent at your disposal instead)<br>
And yes Source counts as one of the 4 corrupt members. Not that you should expect to see any more than 4 if there was no cap(unless BD chooses the Source as King)</p>

            <p>Not really a great idea! The Agent could just wait until Day 4 ends!<br>
I could tone it down to just disable promotion into The Source(which is bad enough for the Corrupt), and to make it unusable until Night 4.</p>

There is another thing that might need change, then. Currently, The Great Cleansing is a “You lose” button when it hits The Source. That would be not problematic if these Yoloalchs/outing Neutral Killers would not exist but…</p>

            <p>Source does not have MM protection, but does allow limited promotion right now under very limited circumstances. The reason is that the Source should never be found out easily; but I need to make Hide Corruption stronger, especially now that Allies exists which didn’t when I suggested it.<br>
I <strong>could</strong> open up promotion to Source to all Corrupt if the Corruptor is dead(they would still need 7/5 days of being Corrupt; that’s not easy but also not impossible, especially if TWA is dead.)</p>

            <p>Source king should only be allowed to convert one target per night<br>
Source should have same rules as MM (Corrupter becomes source if it dies before day 4)<br>
Corrupter kill should have only one night of cooldown, not 2</p>

            <p>Being able to convert reliably, and being able to convert anyone(except the main enemy, the White Agent), being able to end the game quickly if The Source becomes King… that are the strengths, true… but they need these strengths. They are(or let’s say should be, we need to try that out, some things might require fine balancing, especially various cooldowns) still balanced, however, because they have weaknesses, one of them outright mortal.<br>
The Corrupt can not only convert everyone besides one person… the Source can even resurrect someone, or make an extra conversion(with a strong cooldown tho) in times of crisis, and the Source can blend in as Investigative (or Priest), talk to the Dead…<br>
BUT:<br>
The extra conversion makes The Source vulnerable to Resonance(the main investigative ability)<br>
If The Source dies by any means(is Night Immune tho) then The Corrupt are either in deep trouble or outright dead. As soon as The Source is dead, there will be no more Corruptor replacement(unless the BD make a mistake and let the Corruptor who was Corruptor at the time of The Source’s death alive for 9 days as Corrupt(not Corruptor, Corrupt!)(highly unlikely)), in that case the Corruptor becomes the next The Source. This all means that very long fights can be good for BD and terrible for The Corrupt- you can’t wait too long.<br>
The Corruptor can only convert every 3 days. If there is no new Corrupt by special means or by extinction, then the Corrupt can even convert out of cooldown via The Source, but that is because the main weakness of this Faction is The Source. Nearly everything stands and falls with the source. The Source must be kept hidden at all costs(it is capable of hiding), because if it is outed as such and The White Agent is alive, then it doesn’t matter how many BD are left then next night(unless the White Agent is imprisoned, or hindered by The Source King), the White Agent will use its Great Cleansing and The Corrupt lose.<br>
Even The Source King can be dealt with, if the White Agent uses The White Grip at day and then The Great Cleansing.<br>
The second weakness of The Corrupt is limited information. Their most powerful members are distracted by their duties(The Source and, if applicable, The Corrupt Prince) and cannot join them at night- which means that The Source must find a way to distribute the information without being outed and Cleansed.<br>
Even worse, The Corrupt Prince has only limited information about its allies and may accidentally out himself(via a clever" I am Corrupt" fakeclaim, for example) or worse, kill an ally.<br>
Corrupt Neutral Killers may seem to be the most fearful weapon in the arsenal of The Corrupt(and they are definitely dangerous) but on the other hand they might not have the best fakeclaim. Finding valuable allies and finding your mortal enemy… those two things are necessary for The Corrupt; their killing abilities are not that great…(they can bypass immunity, but with a huge cooldown, and only kill a few times with The Corrupt).<br>
The last line of Balance is White Bond, an ability that turns a convertable class into yourself if you use it on the night you die. This means that The Corrupt can still not act in the open after The White Agent died at night(as opposed to being executed for treason).<br>
The Source King is fairly noticable after some time if they act with haste(especially noticable is the lack of guards, but that can be dealt with) so they need to remove The White Agent fast before the Agent notices who is King.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conversion Immunity exists for a reason, if you convert the fucking prince then GG game fucking over</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this is correct. the prince is tied for the most important class because of his ability to occupy, kill, and be conversion immune.prince could just jail and execute.</p>
<p>the game would become where no one can trust anyone in the bd.</p>
<p>trust me, piercing conversion immunity is over powered.</p>
