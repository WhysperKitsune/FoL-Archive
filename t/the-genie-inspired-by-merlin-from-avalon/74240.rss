Yes, they are all identical!  Explanation time!

The **True Name** passive is inspired by Merlin from Avalon, which I just read about on Wikipedia.  Upon defeat, the evil faction in that game is given a chance to guess which player is Merlin.  If they guess correctly, they win.  **True Name** is essentially a nerfed version of that.

How I envision it working mechanically is exactly the same as accusing a player, except it occurs on stand.  So the player on trial simply &quot;votes&quot; against a player.  And the accusation is only possible (highlighted, not grayed-out) if an enemy Genie exists.  This is so you don&#39;t have to waste time voting when there isn&#39;t a Genie of the opposing faction.  If you guess correctly, the Genie gets &quot;arrowed&quot; like Retribution and you are let off the stand.

The **Ambivalent** passive is to prevent Genies getting themselves killed in order to confirm the findings in their logs.  Because of this passive, you cannot automatically trust the logs of a dead Genie, since you don&#39;t know whether they were converted.

**Window Peek** is a very powerful ability and therefore should not exist on a confirmable class like Observer.  It has infinite uses here, since may as well go all the way, as Genies are designed to be unable to actually claim Genie, much less confirm themselves as Genies.

Thoughts?

Hope this idea doesn&#39;t go too much against the spirit of simplification that&#39;s going on (which I fully support).</description>

            <p>Okay fine, make Merlin exactly like Avalon Merlin.  I thought it would be too overpowered but now that you mention, it might not be.</p>
