    <title>Herbalist and Drug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/herbalist-and-drug/59562</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t help but feel Herbalist is not only too weak, but there&#39;s also an anti-synergy with the Assassin when a Physician gets converted. Herbalist is the only unseen class to be a hindrance to an Assassin in regards to poisoning players since Herbalist cannot prove in any way that they&#39;re a Phys anymore. If they drug a target who is poisoned, it&#39;ll say they were attacked but healed, but also NOT say they were cured of poisoning (or bleeding via a wolf from Hunter), which would immediately prove that an Herbalist exists.

I&#39;d like to see the following small change added to Herbalist: If you drug a target that is bleeding or poisoned, the target sees the normal message as if they were cured of bleeding or poison. The icon would also disappear from their portrait. They would still be poisoned/bleeding and will be alerted if they die of bleeding out or the poison killing them, but they just won&#39;t know about it (similar to a Butler poisoning the King). At worst, this would not only allow the Assassin to freely poison (as they should), but also gives the Herbalist at least 1 more day to fake being a Phys (at least if it was from poison; if bleed, the target would die the same night as an Herbalist tried to prove, but could at least fake being occupied or redirected). At best, the court will assume the poisoned/bleeding target died of something else, such as the Assassin, NK, etc.

The goal of this is to let a fairly weak converted class still retain some level of their proving from their original BD version while also NOT hindering the Assassin&#39;s poisoning ability.</description>

            <p>I imagine players felt cheated that they died from poison that they thought was cured.</p>
<p>Except they most likely would have died to the poison anyway.</p>
<p>Edit: re reading that sounds very pretentious. That’s merely the only idea I could come up with.</p>

            <p>Oh I guess it was.</p>
<p>I’ll admit I’m wrong, but I don’t even remember what that change was meant for.</p>

            <p>Actually, Drug has remained unchanged since its inception. I can see where the idea that it is anti-poison, but that appears less of an intended mechanic, and more of an oversight. Drug is meant to make the player think they were attacked.</p>
