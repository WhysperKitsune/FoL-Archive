<strong>Passive 1</strong>: You are a member of the crew, but aligned with the aliens. You are informed what ship role you are at the start.<br>
<strong>Passive 2</strong>: You appear as that member of the crew that you are and as aligned with the ship to all investigative checks.<br>
<strong>Passive 3</strong>: If you are ever role swapped or seat swapped by the Transporter Chief, the Crew role that you were will be left behind, while you will still be sympathizer, be alien-aligned but register as ship-aligned, and also register as and now instead have the powers of the new role you are swapped into, whatever that is.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is the information about how the game ends:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Win Conditions Information:</summary>
<p>Each team has two standard wincons.<br>
<strong>Ship Wincon 1:</strong> Ensure both all alien roles and all alien-aligned players are dead before reaching the secret destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 1:</strong> Ensure that all ship-aligned players possessing ship roles are dead before reaching the secret destination.</p>
<p>If neither of these win conditions are met before reaching the secret destination, but there are still players alive when arriving at the secret destination, then these other two wincons come into play.<br>
<strong>Ship Wincon 2:</strong> Ensure that all roles with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/biohazard.png!v=9" title=":biohazard:" class="emoji" alt=":biohazard:"> passive and all players with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/radioactive.png!v=9" title=":radioactive:" class="emoji" alt=":radioactive:"> passive are dead when you reach the secret destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 2:</strong> Ensure that there is at least one role with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/biohazard.png!v=9" title=":biohazard:" class="emoji" alt=":biohazard:"> passive and/or at least one player with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/radioactive.png!v=9" title=":radioactive:" class="emoji" alt=":radioactive:"> passive still alive when you reach the secret destination.</p>
<p>The Aliens also have a third wincon, which can come into play if no other wincon is satisfied, before arriving at the Secret Destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 3:</strong> If the VIP is in-game, they die, and are not revived by the next possible End of Day after they die (they have a full warp and day if they die via airlock, otherwise less than that), you win.</p>
<p>If it somehow ends up the case that everyone is dead before reaching the secret destination and without satisfying the Ship Wincon 1, Alien Wincon 1, or Alien Wincon 3 first, that is canonically undefined; I currently have it set as a draw, but that might be changed depending on balance purposes.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is some additional rules stuff for added clarity in addition to the rules PDF:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional Rules Info</summary>
<p>You can attempt to murder someone while alive once per game. Your attack will trigger a D6 that will determine whether or not they die.</p>
<p>Each day will have a timer that players have until the ship is attacked. There must be 80% or more (This percentage was just made up and might change before the game starts) votes in favor out of everyone (alive and dead) to progress to the warp phase. If this happens, whoever is in the airlock dies, or no one does if no one got airlocked. If players do not progress to airlock before the ship is attacked, someone will die and the day will continue with a new timer that could cause a second attack on the same day, and so on.</p>
<p>At the start of every warp phase, every player that has abilities in the Warp Phase will be notified that they have woken up and can act that night, except for anyone who was targeted by the Galley Officer, Ensign, or Contaminator on the previous Day phase, who will instead be informed at the start of the warp phase that they have not woken up and will not be able to act that night. Players who do not have any abilities to use in the Warp phase will not be told this sort of information, however.</p>
<p>Only starting members of the alien team know their teammates for sure. Converted people will essentially be lost wolves. There is an alien leader who will get three bluffs. The alien leader must be either the Queen, Predator, Ambassador, or Sympathizer.</p>
<p>Like BotF, this game will also have a set seating arrangements and the same whisper rules as BotF (where you can whisper neighbors for free). Everyone will be informed if anyone’s seating arrangement changes, like due to the Transporter Chief or something.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is some information on mechanical information that players will not be privy to that they might otherwise be in other games such as Clocktower:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Mechanical information players won't be privy to:</summary>
<p>Some of the mechanical information that players will not be privy to will be game composition (in terms of roles or alignments), how the starting distance to the secret destination and current day’s attack timer were determined, the night priority sequence in terms of which roles act in what order, what you roll on murder attempts (those rolls will be made privately by the hosts and won’t be viewable by any players until the game ends), and possibly more.</p>
</details>
<p>The rest of the information can be found in the canonical PDF’s below, but anything that conflicts with information from above should be ignored:</p>

<p>Credit for the design of this game goes to C63 Industries and the Deduction Engine: <a href="http://press.c63.industries/">http://press.c63.industries/</a><br>

Currently, the only way this game is run officially is at large conventions across the U.S. using a proprietary A.I. software. The game is probably going to change more next year after they’ve hosted more, but this is the most current version as it was run at DeceptaCon back in mid-February of this year which I attended, and that probably was the last time it will be run before 2021 (Since all major conventions in the U.S. for the remainder of this year have pretty much been cancelled), meaning this will be the most current version of the game for a pretty long while. eevee’s in their discord, so contact him if you’d like to join that to speak with any non-me ppl there who’ve played this game officially.</p>
