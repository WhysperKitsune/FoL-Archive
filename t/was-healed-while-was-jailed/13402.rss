    <title>Was healed while was jailed</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/was-healed-while-was-jailed/13402</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was healed from Nightshade or Bleed in night I was jailed.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Probably, healer hadn&#39;t to be allowed to visit me in prison.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Put someone with poison or bleed in jail and heal him.

#### Comments:
I&#39;m sorry if it is normal mechanics and not a bug. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember my class and who healed me since I thought it was normal mechanics and decided not to report immediately. Now I&#39;ve changed my mind.</description>

            <p>If I can investigate and heal a jailed person, I should be able to kill them. It’s logic.</p>

            <p>This is still happening. People who are in jail shouldn’t get healed.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure healers can visit imprisoned players just like investigative classes. Prison grants the player night immunity and occupy immunity (since you can’t even use your abilities anyway).</p>
