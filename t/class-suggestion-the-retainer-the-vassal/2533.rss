            <p>Maid is my favourite new class I agree. Clearly it’s main function is to compare alignments to find scum. As this is weak on it’s own she has that one-use INVESTIGATIVE ability. These two abilities are what compromise Maid, and what defines her. On top of that she has the more situational find Royal Blood, which noone considers the main part of her kit.</p>
<p>To clarify, I am not saying ewwww this class has too much utility and has too much variety. That is always good. But it’s variety needs to be tied into a key concept of what the class is - it’s role in the team and function. The Retainer lacks that clarity of purpose and presents itself as a Frankenstein mishmash of abilities.</p>

            <p>I’m not asking for all of the abilities to be under the same theme, that would be weird. It is fine to have totally different abilities - CW stopping day abilities has nothing to do with Ice Walling people. What I am trying to say as it is CLEAR that the crux of the CW is his ice wall. That is what defines him.</p>
<p>For the Retainer he has nothing that truly defines him and is caught  between two worlds.</p>

            <p>Nobles have abilities to do with spreading information. They are a social class who specialise in spreading information (although let’s face it really the purpose of a Noble is to be King, everything else is kind of secondary).</p>
<p>The ONLY class I can think of which has multiple purposes is, as you say Butler. He has two primary roles - to occupy AND to kill the King. His party throwing ability however is more of a Gimick that was just added, it is hardly one of the main purposes of the class.</p>

            <p>I just do not think they have any synergy and are sort of misjointedly joined together, reducing the amount of strategy playing this class.</p>
<p>Even abilities which at first glance don’t fit together - Like Princess’ Wasp - are actually integral to the class, and <em>thats</em> what makes them great. Without it no one would ever believe the easy as Princess claim.</p>
<p>I just don’t really see why these abilities go together in any way, sorry.</p>

            <p>I dunno I like both of the abilities but they just do not really seem to fir together.</p>
<p>Princess has an investigative ability and an ability to prove herself in order to get the scum she found hung (which can also function as a hindrance to attackers).</p>
<p>The point of Observer, like it says on the wiki I think, is that he can find out vast amounts of information  in very little time but to counter-act this he has no abilities to prove himself.</p>
<p>Priest for example can revive, and to ensure he survives long enough until a good BD dies he has a one time-vest. Sure, his grant immunity ability is sort of random, but that is not considered a large part of his kit.</p>
<p>Most class’ <em>main</em> purpose you can sum up very easily - Knight kills scum, Phsycican heals, CW blocks and protects, etcetera. I just think this class is stuck halfway between two (very interesting) concepts.</p>

            <p>you should make thee vassal the “chauffeur.” For both, personal escort makes observer see “your target left with a chauffeur”, makes them immune to being occupied that night, allows them to bypass ice ward, and allows them to bypass the mercenary’s/sell sword’s stand guard/stonewall.</p>
<p>Also, life-link is kind of weird.</p>

<p>I don’t quite understand the synergy between Personal Escort and the voting ability. It almost seems like you put a few separate ability ideas together. Do you mind explaining your thought process on that?</p>

<p>Observer has the ability to see who visits and who they visit and see somebodies faction.<br>
Princess has the ability to check someone’s class type and reveal people who visits her.</p>
<p>Synergy isn’t exactly a huge deal in this game <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>But in my mind, “Personal” came to mind. Personally escorting somebody and Personally voting somebody.</p>

            <p>for thematic purposes, perhaps the retainer can only step up for the title of king if all but one royals are dead?</p>
