            <p>to me, there’s not much recoverable from it. I disagree with the premise. (there’s already an entire faction that punishes the prince from executing too hastilly, the entire BD).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Putting a goal involving the princes executions… means you can lose as early as n1, but can’t possibly win until after n3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I mentioned previously… the existance of the fool (which I already dislike the existance of as it punishes making the right call). But the very existance of a class that now also punishes the prince, means it’s a coin toss for how to try and get rid of anyone who just outright is acting blatently evil. I can’t think of a good result that comes from punishing BD for using a night kill on a class that is clearly not working with the BD.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So… if it loses any focus on prince… doesn’t punish BD for night kills (unless fool is removed, not that I like the idea of either existing), but you really can’t leave BD with a constant punished no matter what you do, lingering over their heads.</p>
<p>I can’t really suggest much, because what I’d consider the list of pure non-starters. Leaves us with the starting point of “3rd class with trollbox”.</p>

            <p>well unfortunately I can’t say I’m a fan of this one. Fool itself is already a lose lose scenerio. Punishes BD for correctly determining that someone is working directly against them. Executing the fool has a punishment, leaving the fool alive is also punishing (as he takes a vote, and has no diesire to see BD win). So I can’t see a reason to favor removing the only good option.</p>
<p>Secondly, why would he use his night ability 1. The ideal strategy for this class would be to make BD think you are a fool (as obviously that’s what will drive suspicion high enough to make them want you dead but not want to kill you on the floor). Basically telling the BD that fool and scorned existing is unlikely (as you are taking up one of the neutral socials).</p>
