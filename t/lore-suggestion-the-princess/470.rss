Lore Subject: The Fair Princess

Lore:
Among Adiart&#39;s Royal lineage each of the crown court uses their own particular gifts to their advantage in a way that befits their station. The King rules in a manner befitting his kingdom with divine providence behind him, The Prince wields the power of the realm to weed out those who would harm him or his liege. The Princess however does not wield the resources of the crown to her advantage not because of her status as a woman but because her most powerful weapon is her mind and she has no need of her brother&#39;s brutish methods. Blessed with the beauty Royal blood provides and the cunning of her ancestors the princess weeds out those who would give into temptation and gathers those who would fly her father&#39;s banner. However her abhorrence to violence guarantees that should she strike someone they will be discredited in the eyes of the entire court for the wrath of the princess is rare and should be taken into account.


(Night Room)
When a princess comes of age they are gifted with a precious Will-o-Wisp that they shall keep beside them while sleeping. The tradition behind this is that the princess is the guiding light that shall guide Blue dragon to victory in troubled times and shall always be bathed in the light of those who love her. It is also because as luminous the Princess is she does not rely on the powers that a sword or shield can provide and the threat of an assassin being exposed is of great use to those who would avenge her and use her death to rally their comrades.Nobody wishes the Princess to die but there are those in the court who would use her to their advantage nay find jealousy and curse her naivete in her claim to the throne.


Comments/Explanations:

Wrote an introductory piece for the Princess role and some history behind the willow wisp ability for her room. I felt like the Princess should be a simple of excellence in the court to be able to reveal her factions players.</description>
