# Welcome to Gold Rush, hosted by @Arete and @Nightingale !

*Credit to Bearsquared from Mafia Universe for creating the setup.*

# &lt;Whethe&gt;R&lt;we win the game or lose the game is beside the arg&gt;u&lt;ment You shooting me if you are a vi&gt;l&lt;lag&gt;e&lt;r is probably the worst single ITA shot in the hi&gt;s&lt;tory of ITA shots that I have ever seen in my entire life in three years on MU on POG and Ive been a host for two of them and played dozens&gt;:

Follow the Global Forum Rules, given in this post:

https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926

Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of **15 substantive, on-topic, game related posts** per in game day are required. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing *solely* a vote. Players who fail to meet this requirement will be immediately force-replaced at the discretion of the hosts. This requirement may be reduced or waived if an execution is hammered early by majority.

Arete is the alt mod for this game. Contact them if you wish to play on an alt.

The game will begin when full.

# Role List

**[color = ligreen] Elf Doctor [/color]**

Sample role PMs:

[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
&gt; # [color = ligreen] Anfalen, Vanilla Elf [/color]
&gt; 
&gt; You are Anfalen, Vanilla Elf. Your only weapons are your voice and your vote.

# Gameplay

- The uninformed majority in this setup is the Elves and the informed minority is the Humans.
- The set-up is a 15 player set-up with 9 Vanilla Elves, 1 Elf Doctor, 1 Elf Motion Detector, 1 Elf 1-shot Vigilante (Cycle 2+), 1 Human Roleblocker, and 2 Human Goons.
- Flips are **alignment-only**, and will not reveal the role. (They may reveal non-role-indicative parts of their flavor.)
- No role can self-target. The Human Roleblocker may roleblock other Humans, but the Humans may not factional kill other Humans.
- The Doctor cannot target the same player on two consecutive nights.
- The Roleblocker cannot target the same player on two consecutive nights.
- If the Vigilante&#39;s kill is prevented or interfered with in any way (including being roleblocked, targeting a player protected by the Doctor, or targeting the Human nightkill target), their shot is NOT refunded.
- Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.
- Executions are majority and plurality.
- No-execute is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-execute and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-execute will have priority in the rand. In all other cases of a tie, the execution will be determined at random from among the tied players.
- Self-votes are considered valid votes.
- Votes are locked in LyLo (execute-or-lose) scenarios, but not in MyLo (misexecute-and-lose) scenarios. That is to say, in situations where elves must execute correctly or lose, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.
- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.
- The Human factional kill is assigned. If the member performing the factional kill is not specified, the last member to submit a kill will be assumed to be performing it.
- The Human factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living Elves.
- The Humans will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

<p>Although the invaders claimed that their stated goal was solely to steal Alva’s gold, after Farryn’s death, they did not simply take the gold and leave. Instead, each remaining invader laid a <strong>Curse of Withering</strong> on one of the remaining residents. They then took advantage of the weakness imposed by these curses in order to steal the gold and flee the city.</p>

<p>The Capital Center holds the Stone of Talion’s Memory, a memorial to the fallen of Talion: Ellimie, Naevys, Halaema, Sylmare, Tannatar, Maiele, Kymil, Isylinor, Cyran, Farryn, Sanev, Elisen, and Ciliren. The Stone of Talion’s Memory can freely be visited; it is customary for visitors to leave poetic compositions in front of the Stone. Try creating your own poetic composition, then leaving it before the Stone. Then, answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What inspired your poetic composition?</li>
<li>Describe the experience of visiting the Stone of Talion’s Memory. What did you notice?</li>
<li>Do you feel a greater connection with the martyrs of Talion after your visit?</li>
</ol>

</h2>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the failures of their system, Talion continued to resist the idea of modifying it to support the <em><font color="red">rights of the accused</font></em>. However, as the residents began to grow more desperate, they began to reach for increasingly dubious solutions. The most significant among these is the <em><font color="red">permanent allegation system</font></em>, which stated that once someone had made a formal accusation in a given day, they could not change or modify their accusation in any way, even if new evidence came to light. By implementing this system, they hoped to limit the ability of humans to speak in their own defense.</p>
<p>However, their attempt at denying fair trials to the humans backfired when one elf, <em><font color="red">Sanev</font></em>, formally accused another elf, <em><font color="red">Farryn</font></em>. As a result, the human members of the Gold Rush Mission were able to also lodge accusations against Farryn, creating an unbreakable majority in support of Farryn’s execution. As a result, the human operatives were easily able to overcome the remaining residents of Talion and recover the gold they needed to support human innovation and research.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Gold Rush Mission, the goldbinding technique allowed magic item production in the Human Empire to increase in efficiency and volume by 113 percent. This led directly to the discovery of <em><font color="red">Circlets of Rejuvenation</font></em>, which increased the maximum human lifespan by an average of 18.7 years.</p>

<p><strong><font color="green">Comprehension Questions</font></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How did Talion modify its legal system in light of its failures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How were the human operatives able to undermine this system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the ultimate result of the Gold Rush Mission?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><font color="green">Discussion Questions</font></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is the permanent allegation system a good idea? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What virtues were displayed by the human operatives in exploiting flaws in the permanent allegation system?</li>
<li>How does the failure of the permanent allegation system display the importance of adaptability?</li>
</ol>

<div align="right">
<blockquote>
<h3><font color="ecf2c2">The Heroes of the Mission: Myth vs. Fact</font></h3>
<p>There are many myths that circulate about the heroes of the Gold Rush Mission, often defamatory. Several of the more common myths are addressed here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: The three members of the mission were government spies.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: None of the members of the Gold Rush Mission had previously worked directly for the government. All of them were selected due to skills they had displayed in their normal lines of work. <em>Cristóvão</em> had previously worked as a bodyguard, where he had learned several techniques that allowed him to prevent others from leaving their home to interfere with the operation. <em>Hans-Peter</em> had learned about magical disguises due to his work as an actor, which allowed the humans to pass undetected. <em>Margarid</em> had previously served in the Empire’s telepathic relay network, which allowed them to maintain communications with mission leaders at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: The Gold Rush Mission was a “war of conquest.”</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The Gold Rush Mission was a peaceful reconnaissance mission provoked by the Province of Alva’s refusal to trade for its natural resources, which were critical to many elements of magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: The restrictions introduced by the Province of Alva in response to the Gold Rush Mission were reasonable and proportionate.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The restrictions imposed by the Province of Alva have still not been lifted, despite several centuries passing between the Gold Rush Mission and the present day. Furthermore, these restrictions are extremely broad (affecting even humans fully in compliance with Alva’s laws) and highly limiting (preventing many ordinary activities).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: The Gold Rush Mission carried out unprovoked murders against Talion’s residents.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Although some residents of Talion did die in the course of the Gold Rush Mission, the human operatives only killed in self-defense. Furthermore, approximately half of the deaths during the course of the Gold Rush Mission were the result of Talion’s flawed judicial system, or vigilante violence by residents of Talion against each other.</p>

<p><em>An excerpt from the most popular history textbook of the Province of Alva, typically used for children between the ages of forty and fifty.</em></p>
<div align="center">
<h2>
<a name="chapter-4-the-gold-rush-3" class="anchor" href="#chapter-4-the-gold-rush-3"></a>Chapter 4: The Gold Rush</h2>
<p><strong>Part 10: The Aftermath</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Terms: Sanev, Farryn, honor-in-procedure, Curse of Withering, Restoration Charm, Stone Wards</strong></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, even Cyran’s attempts at implementing the Final Accusation System were insufficient to avoid human manipulation. After <strong><font color="goldenrod">Sanev</font></strong>, an alchemist, lodged an accusation against <strong><font color="goldenrod">Farryn</font></strong>, a miner, the human invaders ceased to maintain their facade. Due to Alva’s tradition of <strong><font color="goldenrod">honor-in-procedure</font></strong>, the residents of Talion did not deviate from the agreed-upon procedure, even though doing so risked their death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the invaders claimed that their stated goal was solely to steal Alva’s gold, after Farryn’s death, they did not simply take the gold and leave. Instead, each remaining invader laid a <strong><font color="goldenrod">Curse of Withering</font></strong> on one of the remaining residents. They then took advantage of the weakness imposed by these curses in order to steal the gold and flee the city. Although such curses are easily treatable through the use of a <strong><font color="goldenrod">Restoration Charm</font></strong>, none of the remaining residents of Talion had training in how to cast them. By the time a trained healer arrived in Talion, all of Talion’s remaining residents had perished.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to this attack, Alva instituted several sanctions on the Human Empire. Most significantly, Alva barred further exportation of gold and other magical components to the Human Empire. In addition, Alva implemented several new precautions to prevent humans from entering the Province of Alva, such as the <strong><font color="goldenrod">Stone Wards</font></strong>, which automatically detect unauthorized crossings of the border between the Human Empire and the Province of Alva.</p>
</blockquote>
<div align="right">
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><font color="lightseagreen">Practical Connection!</font></strong></h3>
<p>After the Gold Rush Invasion, some scholars suggested that the tradition of honor-in-procedure was causing harm to Alva by preventing flexibility even in situations where it would be unambiguously beneficial. Yet this tradition lies at the core of many of Alva’s institutions. Whenever a merchant honors a verbal contract, or a suspected criminal is temporarily released to their family in advance of a trial, or a Councilor abstains from voting to compensate for an opposing Councilor responding to an emergency, they implicitly invoke the concept of honor-in-procedure. Can you think of ways in which this concept affects your own life?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><font color="magenta">Try it at home!</font></strong></h3>
<p><font color="acb5af">The Capital Center holds the Stone of Talion’s Memory, a memorial to the fallen of Talion: Ellimie, Naevys, Halaema, Sylmare, Tannatar, Maiele, Kymil, Isylinor, Cyran, Farryn, Sanev, Elisen, and Ciliren. The Stone of Talion’s Memory can freely be visited; it is customary for visitors to leave poetic compositions in front of the Stone. Try creating your own poetic composition, then leaving it before the Stone. Then, answer the following questions:</font><br>
<font color="acb5af">1. What inspired your poetic composition?</font><br>
<font color="acb5af">2. Describe the experience of visiting the Stone of Talion’s Memory. What did you notice?</font><br>
<font color="acb5af">3. Do you feel a greater connection with the martyrs of Talion after your visit?</font></p>
