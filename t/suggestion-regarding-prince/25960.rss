    <title>Suggestion regarding Prince</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-regarding-prince/25960</link>
    <description>This might be the shortest topic I ever make.

Please, PLEASE make Prince immune to death once. 
He is far too important to just die night one because of a lucky assassin or a yolo alch.
Killing Prince should be a well-thought act, part of a strategy, not luck.</description>

<p>How exactly would that work?  If it’s random, then no.  RNG is bad for the game.  Maybe instead, there could a new class which would become the prince if the prince dies.  They would overhear the prince’s chat and see who the prince jails each night.  They also would have an ability that gives the prince 1 use of execute back.  Maybe they could even talk with the prince at night.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was thinking about it as an addition to the Royal Blood passive. You are first in the line to become king AND if Prince dies before d4, you become him. That second part would follow a priority order. Princess first, then Drunk. Or the other way around.</p>
<p>Regarding the new class, I don’t think a new class based solely on the prince would be a good idea or even an enjoyable one.</p>

</aside>
<p>I gave the idea of the possibility of the second prince being unseen. If a Drunk or a Princess got converted before the prince died, they would become an evil prince. So the first prince would still be 100% trustworthy, the second prince not so much.</p>

</aside>
<p>I like Prince’s 3 execution with the chance of losing all of them. That’s BD only lethal weapon against evil outside of official executions and Knight’s (and DK’s) cold steel. But yeah, losing occ immunity would be great imo.</p>

            <p>Prince really shouldn’t be convertible. You can’t claim to the king because there’s 66% chance he’s not BD. You can’t claim to Psy because he might get converted. Prince is the one class that can be trusted to hold the claims for the classes and pass judgment.<br>
If the king was always BD, we wouldn’t need that and sure you could convert the prince. But that’s not the game we have. Prince is the real leader of the BD, he needs to stay BD.<br>
I could agree to prince losing his immunity to occupy. That way his exe could be prevented by cult and unseen with occupy abilities. But put that nerf with the passive that if he dies until n3, someone with royal blood take his place. Would be awesome if unseen managed to convert a drunk before that and he’d get a shot at being the Prince lmao. He could execute the BD claims XD.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not sure if this is the <strong>best</strong> solution, but this is what I want to happen as well. Only because Prince dying on night 1 seems to be happening at LEAST every other game for me. It’s become a meme at this point. People predict it happening and it actually does happen more often than not, despite the odds.</p>

            <p>I’ve wanted to see some reworks too. I don’t personally consider the sheriff/paladin to be hardcounters. After all those are countering factions not classes. That being said I have been pushing a rework that keeps the sheriff as the linear Investigator but for all factions and makes the paladin something else entirely.</p>
<p>As for the priest thing I would like to remind you that this is compensating for one of the biggest BD nerfs ever. The loss of the Prince being unconvertible is more than the gain of the priest.</p>
<p>If you don’t like that then you should prepose what to do instead or at least argue that the core idea of nerfing the prince like that is a bad idea.</p>

            <p>Hmmmmm… Ok I got it! First of all the prince should stay guarenteed BUT! He can lose Occupy and Conversation Immunity. I would also like to suggest that he be given the special type and have his own cult class.</p>
<p>Now obviously this would dramatically lower BD winrate so to compensate the BD should regain the priest in her most powerful form!</p>
<p>The unconvertible guarenteed one where the revived person is also unconvertible.</p>
<p>Unlike the Prince they cannot die N1 or anything so that’s not an issue but also unlike the prince you can counter claim a priest more effectively. Especially if you have a way to let unseen talk to the dead too.</p>
<p>In addition to that other BD would need some (not too big) buffs too.</p>

            <p>Ok fine I will admit BD is a bit at a disadvantage if Prince goes down N1, then what would you do?</p>
<p>I mean, all I can think of is if Prince is dead within the first three Nights, if there is a Drunk, one will be chosen at random to become the new Prince. I mean sucks if there are no Drunks, but then again, this would still be a buff to BD.</p>

<p>You guys do realize how impactfull the Prince is right? If he wasn’t in a game at all the BD would get screwed over more so than if he dies N1. If he isn’t in the game he could be fake claimed and that in addition to him not being in the game would give BD almost no chance of winning. Same for if he is converted except that one also makes him more likely to “die” or be lynched when he IS in the game.</p>

<p>The Prince is the Prince, he’s the most powerful role in the game, and without him or his abilities, the Blue Dragon would go downhill. He’s perfectly fine as he is now.</p>

<p>That’s part of the reason why he needs a rework, the BD’s chance of winning shouldn’t depend on a single class so much.</p>

            <p>At the very least, he should be convertable.  This would make players less willing to claim to him.  He also shouldn’t be guaranteed.</p>

            <p>Eventhough I understand the sentiment of the OP I have to disagree.<br>
The Prince is extremely powerful as is… he can occupy a person 3x in a row… even if said person is occupy immune. He bypasses night immunity with his execute. He can also protect someone against conversion/death by jailing said person. He has royal blood so he can easily step up to King if need be in the end game etc.</p>
<p>The whole idea  for evil factions  and the NK is to find and kill the Prince asap… yes this can happen by sheer luck n1. If it happens the dynamic of the game changes, the Blue Dragon will have to double their efforts to win and that makes it all the more fun.</p>
<p>The Prince not having death immunity in its current state is much more fun and when playing Prince myself its always tense every single night to see if I survive. That keeps the game moving forward and exciting.</p>
<p>Plus if your team is any good you can still easily win with Blue Dragon. You have knights, healers, investigators. Its only when deduction skills are lacking that the Blue Dragon loses since they start with a vast voting majority.</p>
