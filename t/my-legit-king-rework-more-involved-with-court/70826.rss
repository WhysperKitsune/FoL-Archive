    <title>My legit King rework (more involved with court)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/my-legit-king-rework-more-involved-with-court/70826</link>
    <description>The idea of these new Kings is to add more strategy then having them receive whispers for claims. Now they have to decide to go into attack or defense mode for the next day changing his abilities. 
 

&gt;# [color=blue]Good King[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Passive: tenacity** - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing.**[same passive as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Passive: loyalty** - if you are executed by the court then the court will not be able to vote anyone up for treason tomorrow. **[same passive as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 1: Order execute(_Attack mode_)** - Send a guard to attack a player. The attack bypasses any night immunity, and it will be announced to the court the next day. It will only be announced if the attack was successful. _**(2 uses)**_ **[same ability as before]**
&gt;
&gt;_Note: Staring king will have two uses, any king after that will have 1._ 
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 2: Royal finger (_Attack mode_)** - The King&#39;s next vote for treason will count twice._**(infinite uses)**_ **[same ability as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 1: Decide fate (_Defense mode_)-** instantly exe or pardon the player on trial, this will veto any votes that have been made. **(_1 use_)** **[same ability as before]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 2: Double duty (_Defense mode_)** - have a player work two shifts tonight, allowing them to target up the two players with any night ability that allows them to visit a player (Meaning classes like Noble can‚Äôt use _maid spy_ on two people, because that doesn‚Äôt make sense). **(_4 uses_**)
&gt;
&gt; Note: 
&gt;- This ability does not effect ANY unique classes. The King will not know if this has effected them or not. _
&gt;
&gt;- _the player effected by this can also choose to only pick one person that night if they choose so_
&gt;
&gt;- If the player is unique, he will get a message saying  _‚ÄúThe King has requested you to do a double shift but you denied it‚Äù_ 
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 1: change of mind -** switch between offense and defense mode, changing the day abilities you use the next day. _(Will start in Attack mode)_
&gt;
&gt;**Night ability 2 - Good Guards** - send a guard to protect a player from death and will defend against conversion. **(3 uses) [starting king gets 2 more uses]** 

Win con - BD win con

&gt;# [color=Purple]Evil King[/color]
&gt;

Please give me feedback. Also tell me if I made any typos in post 

Some questions to answer about this topic:

- will these be good classes to play along with in the game?
- will you have fun playing these classes?
- do you think these classes are too overpowered or too underpowered?
- do you think these classes will change the game in a positive or negative way?</description>

            <p>I can change the OE for King and can replace it. Also I agree with the neutral king passive. You don‚Äôt have to be so aggressive about itüòÇ</p>

            <p>The idea of these new Kings is to add more strategy then having them receive whispers for claims. Now they have to decide to go into attack or defense mode for the next day changing his abilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="blue">Good King</font></h1>
<p><strong>Passive: tenacity</strong> - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing.<strong>[same passive as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive: loyalty</strong> - if you are executed by the court then the court will not be able to vote anyone up for treason tomorrow. <strong>[same passive as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 1: Order execute(<em>Attack mode</em>)</strong> - Send a guard to attack a player. The attack bypasses any night immunity, and it will be announced to the court the next day. It will only be announced if the attack was successful. <em><strong>(2 uses)</strong></em> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: Staring king will have two uses, any king after that will have 1.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 2: Royal finger (<em>Attack mode</em>)</strong> - The King‚Äôs next vote for treason will count twice.<em><strong>(infinite uses)</strong></em> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 1: Decide fate (<em>Defense mode</em>)-</strong> instantly exe or pardon the player on trial, this will veto any votes that have been made. <strong>(<em>1 use</em>)</strong> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 2: Double duty (<em>Defense mode</em>)</strong> - have a player work two shifts tonight, allowing them to target up the two players with any night ability that allows them to visit a player (Meaning classes like Noble can‚Äôt use <em>maid spy</em> on two people, because that doesn‚Äôt make sense). <strong>(<em>4 uses</em></strong>)</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This ability does not effect ANY unique classes. The King will not know if this has effected them or not. _</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>the player effected by this can also choose to only pick one person that night if they choose so</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player is unique, he will get a message saying  <em>‚ÄúThe King has requested you to do a double shift but you denied it‚Äù</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Night ability 1: change of mind -</strong> switch between offense and defense mode, changing the day abilities you use the next day. <em>(Will start in Attack mode)</em></p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2 - Good Guards</strong> - send a guard to protect a player from death and will defend against conversion. <strong>(3 uses) [starting king gets 2 more uses]</strong></p>
