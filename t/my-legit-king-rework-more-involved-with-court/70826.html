<p><strong>Passive: loyalty</strong> - if you are executed by the court then the court will not be able to vote anyone up for treason tomorrow. <strong>[same passive as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 1: Order execute(<em>Attack mode</em>)</strong> - Send a guard to attack a player. The attack bypasses any night immunity, and it will be announced to the court the next day. It will only be announced if the attack was successful. <em><strong>(2 uses)</strong></em> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: Staring king will have two uses, any king after that will have 1.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 2: Royal finger (<em>Attack mode</em>)</strong> - The King’s next vote for treason will count twice.<em><strong>(infinite uses)</strong></em> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 1: Decide fate (<em>Defense mode</em>)-</strong> instantly exe or pardon the player on trial, this will veto any votes that have been made. <strong>(<em>1 use</em>)</strong> <strong>[same ability as before]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day ability 2: Double duty (<em>Defense mode</em>)</strong> - have a player work two shifts tonight, allowing them to target up the two players with any night ability that allows them to visit a player (Meaning classes like Noble can’t use <em>maid spy</em> on two people, because that doesn’t make sense). <strong>(<em>4 uses</em></strong>)</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This ability does not effect ANY unique classes. The King will not know if this has effected them or not. _</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>the player effected by this can also choose to only pick one person that night if they choose so</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player is unique, he will get a message saying  <em>“The King has requested you to do a double shift but you denied it”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Night ability 1: change of mind -</strong> switch between offense and defense mode, changing the day abilities you use the next day. <em>(Will start in Attack mode)</em></p>
<p><strong>Night ability 2 - Good Guards</strong> - send a guard to protect a player from death and will defend against conversion. <strong>(3 uses) [starting king gets 2 more uses]</strong></p>
