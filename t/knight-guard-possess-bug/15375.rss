    <title>Knight guard/possess bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/knight-guard-possess-bug/15375</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I was playing Knight and guarding the King. I was also possessed to attack the King. I ended up killing myself protecting King from myself.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

It should either be that I guard the King - and don&#39;t attack. Or I attack the King and don&#39;t guard. It makes no sense that I can perform both actions at the same time

#### Steps to reproduce:

Knight guard King and get possessed to attack King

            <p>It seems weird, but it isn’t a bug. When you guard, you kill all attackers and yourself. In this situation, it was you in both cases.</p>
