    <title>I don&#39;t even know where to start. Physician issues</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-dont-even-know-where-to-start-physician-issues/40873</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Game was down to: Me (Physician), Prince, Cult Leader, Evil King, Reaper
It said two nights in a row someone tried to change my target, but I was immune.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Not that.  There was no one in the game that could change my target and if there wasn&#39;t I shouldn&#39;t have been immune to it.  Reaper claimed Drunk so I assume it was him and there was a CW barriering me.  When... none of those things was correct.  A drunk was alive at one point so maybe I remembered wrong and he was debauching me, but I still couldn&#39;t be immune to it, unless Physicians secretly got occ immunity.

#### Steps to reproduce:
God only knows.

#### Comments:
We lost because the Reaper&#39;s claim was pretty solid thanks to me getting &quot;debauched&quot; and &quot;barriered&quot;.</description>

            <p>I hadn’t been occupied ever.</p>
<p>There were 2 attempts, but they both failed, though they shouldn’t have since there was nothing that would make me occ immune in the game.</p>

            <p>well without knowing the full context of the game etc… one thing to note is any class is occupy immune if they are occupied/redirected 3 times. Meaning if say on n1 a butler and drunk visited you, than on n2 someone else occupied you… you’d be occupy immune for the rest of the game.</p>
