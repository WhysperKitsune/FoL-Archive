    <description>https://www.ThroneOfLies.com/legal/terms.html

**Terms TL;DR additions:**

1. We can use your suggestions without a copyright troll trying to sue us for using them.
2. We can use submitted content - like fan art, ideas, class suggestions. We&#39;ll usually credit if we use your stuff, but not guaranteed.
3. Content/stuff submitted to our sites becomes property of i42 -- don&#39;t post things you don&#39;t want us to use. This means that if you post a cool deathnote you made or screenshot from your game, we can promote the game by using that without anyone yelling at us like &quot;I didn&#39;t give you permission to use that screenshot!!&quot; (Who does that?! &quot;That one guy&quot; exists out there, somewhere).
4. Uptime guarantee -- we&#39;re indie, so we can&#39;t guarantee uptime, but we&#39;ll do our best to make sure stuffs working.
5. No refunds - sorry ;D we&#39;re less than 10 bucks for an indie online game, cmon.

**Privacy TL;DR additions:**

1. We use Unity analytics and performance/error reporting to help improve the game and get rid of bugs.
2. We use PlayFab to store your stuff. The game would an offline game without it.
3. Friends can find you via your PlayFab id, your email address, username, or display name - and Steam friends, too. If you don&#39;t want your friends to find you, then ... don&#39;t play ;)</description>

            <p>And another:</p>
<p><strong>YouTube/Twitch</strong> etc – Stream away <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> No rules (talk all the crap you want – we won’t try to pull anything shady to get your video taken down), but hopefully we encourage good things! We always tell our audience that we’re willing to adapt and try to fix bugs.</p>
<p>We always try our best and willing to improve, so we take crap talk as feedback. However, if you REALLY want a change, better to come to us first so we aren’t grumpy when we make the change <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> it may even encourage us to do things faster!</p>
<p><font color="red">Only 1 rule while in alpha/beta: If you run into a nasty bug, remind watchers it’s alpha/beta.</font></p>
