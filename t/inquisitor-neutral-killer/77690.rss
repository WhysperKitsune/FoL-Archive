    <description>&gt; **The Inquisitor :shield:

&gt; -
&gt; **Passive: 
&gt; Unholy Slayer:** Your abilities grow stronger with each Heathen you kill. 
&gt; **Guided by God:** You are Death Immune once. 
&gt; If you killed 2 or more Heathens you become Bleed Immune. 
&gt; If you killed 3 or more Heathens, you will become Death Immune permanently. 
&gt; If you killed 4 or more Heathens, you will become Occupation and Redirection immune.
&gt; 
&gt; **Day: 
&gt; Judgement (inf use):** Check if a player is Heathen. Can be used day 1.
&gt; If you killed 1 or more Heathens, you will be able to check 2 players. 
&gt; **Radiant Light (2 use):** If a Heathen has visited you tonight, you will be told their number. 
&gt; If you killed 2 or more Heathens you will also see who the Heathens visit tonight. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Night: 
&gt; Ruthless Efficiency (inf use):** Attack a player. They will not die unless they are Heathen. 
&gt; If you killed 1 or more Heathens, your attack will also kill Non-Heathens.

&gt; If you killed 4 or more Heathens, your attack will also bypass death immunity. 
&gt; 
&gt; --- 
&gt; *Win condition: Eliminate both major factions* 

--- 
*Heathen: There are always 2 Heathens alive. A player is randomly assigned Heathen status. Players do not know that they are Heathen. If a Heathen dies, a new player is chosen to be Heathen. Heathens cannot be King, Prince, Mastermind, Cult Leader or any Neutral. If a player becomes one of those classes the Heathen status will be removed and another player will become Heathen.*</description>

            <p>Aside from your first kill, you can either go straight for Prince, or wait until you feel confident enough that your ability is enough to kill him.</p>

            <p>But getting out a hyperconfirmable class like Prince should always be a priority target for NK though? You can keep that balance yourself with kills. Heathen prioritization throws that out of wack, so it’s a tradeoff you’d need to make, but is it a healthy one?</p>

            <p>They can still kill those classes at any point they want (just need some heathens first).<br>
Generally you don’t want to focus down the MM/ Prince as NK, because you need some help with keeping the BD/Cultseen balance.</p>

            <p>So I don’t really like how Heathens are done currently. So I decided to remake Inq and his Heathens into something completely different.</p>
<p>I can see some issues with this class having a slow start, being RNG heavy and just getting rekt by bad luck, but there’s probably something that can be done about this.<br>
I was thinking to just make his abilities grow for each Heathen dead, doesn’t have to be his kill… but that’s a last resort imo.</p>
