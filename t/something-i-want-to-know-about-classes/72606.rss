<p>If it’s gotten to the point where people have deduced you are scum simply by how you act then it is 100% fair for you to be lynched for that. This isn’t like a mechanical confirmation where your play was irrelevant, this is something that you can always prevent by playing better</p>

<p>Forum is different from actual ToL.  It’s worse in the forum games,but balanced in ToL.  The only fool change I would support would be changing deceive(and frame) so it causes all visitors visiting you/your target to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities, reducing the uses of deceive to 1, changing hide to the old hide, and reducing hide uses to 1</p>
