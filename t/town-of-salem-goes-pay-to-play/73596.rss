    <title>Town of Salem goes Pay To Play</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/town-of-salem-goes-pay-to-play/73596</link>
    <description>Town of Salem now costs $5.00.

As Throne of Lies is also pay-to-play, it is pretty cool to see ToS finally taking this critical step towards improving the quality of their matches.

I for one welcome this change, and I think as a community we all should. More paid SDGs is good for all of us in the long run.</description>

            <p>Everything can impact the game one way or another. That doesn’t make it relevant. Even Russia’s government decisions can impact the game as we’ve seen with the bans of amazon servers. So yes, I disagree, it’s better in off-topic.</p>

            <p>I know you say don’t compare two different games in the same genre, but look at throne of lies yes you may get the average troll and they will be quickly be dealt with either through a ban, warned etc, but it costs money so if they were to make bots they would have to buy the game first which would cost around £7 so it is just to much of a loss in order to just make a few people mad, while in tos the game was free allowing users to troll free especially since they could just make another account. Note this is not against you I just want to strengthen the fact that this is a good move</p>
