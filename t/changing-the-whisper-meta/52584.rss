    <title>Changing the Whisper Meta</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/changing-the-whisper-meta/52584</link>
    <description>So, a lot of people have expressed their dislike for the Whisper Meta (WM). However, many of the suggestions have been to make the WM impossible, rather than simply a bad strategy. Here I’ll go through some reasons that the WM is a good strategy right now, and how we can change that.

1) Giving a player all the role claims lets them deduce liars. 

This is something that will always be a fact, and that has no good workarounds. Having lots of info is something fundamentally important in ToL.

2) The King is unconvertable and usually siding with BD, and it’s difficult for evil kings to pass information to the evils.

If everyonr claimed to a confirmed Sheriff, that sheriff will get converted quickly, and all the info will be in the hands of the unseen. Good and Neut kings won’t give the evils info, and evil kings can only pass info by outing people in their logs when they die. So, claiming to the King means the evils will probably never see your claim. This is also why everyone claims to Prince.

So, we have a few options for this. The most obvious one is to play with the numbers to make evil kings more common. Another thing you can do is make evil kings more punishing, by letting them see who the unseen are or have private communication channels with evils (obviously all kings would have this). However, those solutions seem a bit brute-forcy. We could make the Psychic unconvertable, which would lead to them being a secondary claiming method if they outed themself day one, or we could create a class to fill a similar role.

3) Whispering protects your important roles and increases the chances of too many claims on a role.

My suggestion here would be to replace the MM’s Scout with an ability that let them see all whispers to the king the next day. Then the MM’s claims will be better, we’ll have some intersting counter-meta plays, and everyone will be scared to claim to the king until a Paladin outs themself. Obviously you could give an NK or the CL this ability instead, but I feel like it best fits the MM.

These three suggestions were to stop or hinder the whisper meta. Another option is to make it more enjoyable. Here’s some ideas I’ll throw out.

1) don’t have the king’s logs appear when he dies - see Aquillion’s post.

2) Make the Prince immune to King’s executes.
This will get the Prince claiming to the King regularly, allowing for a secon logbook, and more ways to pass info back and forth to select people (when the prince jails them). This would need to come with an increased chance of evil kings, as you’re weakening them.

3) Make night two 30 seconds longer and n3 15 seconds longer.

This is the simplest and least impactful meta-wise. We all know that when you’re a king and you’re presented with a pink wall of text, you have one day to make a brilliant deduction from it or be forever suspected as an evil king. By making the nights longer, the king has some extra time to process all the info that got dumped on him.


So, these are just my thoughts on the topic, and a few suggestions on how to either change the Whisper Meta or make it a bit more fun.</description>

            <p>Here’s my suggestion. Change the Assassin ability Distract to: “Target player cannot hear whispers for the rest of the day”, make it 1 charge only like 2-For-1, and let Cult Leader have it as well.</p>

            <p>Making the king not able to whisper is NOT the way to solve this and the devs already said that this won’t be implemented. Also, I agree with Biperspectival and think that brute force is not the way to solve it.</p>

            <p>That destroys the main goal of an evil king (deducing and killing the prince), and massively changes the game. I feel like brute force solutions in response to meta changes is generally a bad policy.</p>

            <p>Just make King unable to whisper, so he has to say everything out loud. That changes the game a little bit.<br>
Also make him know who the Prince is since the beginning and make him unable to OE the Prince. Problem solved!</p>

            <p>Hmm.  Would it break anything if the Illusionist was still able to link and speak to the dead?</p>
<p>It would change things pretty drastically, of course, but would anything actually break outside of it being somewhat harder for the Psychic to collect claims?  Making things harder for the Psychic and adding distrust are not necessarily bad things.</p>

            <p>True, but the Psychic is pretty much a wasted convert right now, as when people stop getting linked it’s not hard to guess the psychic is evil.</p>

            <p>Just going to note, as I have previously, that if you make EK too likely then BD will just exe them and put up a confirmed good royal.</p>
<p>And there are tons of ways to get a confirmed royal on the throne.</p>
