    <title>Court Wizard Changes/Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/court-wizard-changes-suggestions/54617</link>
    <description>Hello there.

My idea for the Court Wizard Contest (https://forum.imperium42.com/t/court-wizard-contest/54572) would be the following:

.

First Night Ability: 
Redirection: Any person that targets your target will get redirected to yourself, while you are immune to all their effects. 
Recommended amount of uses: infinity
Optional: 
1. ... except heals. 
2. You will see what effect you countered. 
3. This also gives the target immunity to death, occupation and prevention while attacking.
4. (In Addition to 3:) If your target attacks a non-BD-member, he will also ignore their night-immunity.

Examples for Optional 3 (and 4): 
- CWs target will ignore merc&#39;s &quot;stand guard&quot;, killing their target.
- CWs target wont die to a knight defending, but will kill ONLY the knight.
- CWs target wont attack through a guard from the king.
- CWs target wont die to a bear, but also WONT kill the hunter
- CWs target will kill the butler/servant through their abilities.

I would consider #3 and #4 of the optional features only if the CW gets the info of which ability he countered (#2), since he can be actually somewhat useful with this ability and detect, if the person he protected is a killer. While you also could just leave those optional things out, protecting a knight CS&#39;ing a bad guy which is guarded by his merc and might be death immune, seems like a cool option.

.

Second Night Ability:
Transfer: All effects casted on you this night get transferred to your target. You will see what abilities you redirected.
Recommended amount of uses: 3

.

Day Ability:
Inner Strenght: Make a person immune to day abilities today (except their own). You and your target only get notified if you cured any negative effects they were already infuenced by. Can be casted on yourself. Can cure poisoning and bleeding, if those effects were inflicted on this day.
Recommended amount of uses: 2

.

Additional Comments: 
While CW wasn&#39;t the best class in terms of influence he had on the game, his kit was quite unique, which is why the idea behind the abilities is kind of the same as before. Also since I miss the old WoW from the princess the second night ability was a little inspired by that aswell.

I dont think that his kit will be overpowered with those changes, since the second ability only really gives him &quot;night immunity&quot; for 3 nights but doesnt really do that much else (similar to the old tornado, but only one-way), aswell as the first ability only being a &quot;reverse drunk&quot;. 

What I do think is that his kit will be quite complicated for beginners with all the optional things active, but I still think that it would be neat addition.

.

I hope my ideas will inspre you to improve CW somehow or that they will help you widening your horizon in things that could be possible with CW.

Cheers,

            <p>Fair enough, you got a point. Perhaps i42 need to change CW to “non-unique” again, so people could claim CW again without having to fear the instant-execute, because someone else is CW. Before that change CW was just a useless claimfiesta that noone could confirm but everyone executed because he was useless anyways.<br>
So right now CW is JUST useless and noone really claims the role as a bad guy, perhaps this change + a limit of 2 CWs per game would change CW into an actual useful, not as easy to confirm role, that bad guys still could claim and get away with. But thats something that needs some testing, we will see what i42 will come up with.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but only the bad guys have negative abilities to test that (not taking butler-poison into account). You could make that ability not affecting butlers poison and there you have it, an ability that cant just be as easily tested as the nobles/mystics ability.</p>
