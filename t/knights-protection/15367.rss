    <title>Knight&#39;s Protection</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/knights-protection/15367</link>
    <description>I was in a game where I was Alchemist. Someone claimed poisioned, so I was like &quot;sure, let&#39;s heal this guy&quot;. That night I got the message that I couldn&#39;t heal him. Turned out he was Possessor who attacked some guy protected by Knight. I was wondering if Knight&#39;s Protection goes through Healing. No, I don&#39;t have screenshots. Yes I won the game on Day 4 after that night because we had hanged the Assassin and the MM, and the Knight killed Possessor and Assassin in one night. I do seem to get lucky in my Alchemist games: I have never lost, been attacked or used Emerald Potion.
So, does Knight&#39;s Protection go through Healing?</description>
