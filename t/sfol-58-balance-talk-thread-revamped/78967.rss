    <description>**SFoL 58 -- Last Stand of the Righteous**
Starting early or mid Decemberf

Lore: The order of the Unseen have taken over the entire world now. Unseen from different lands have joined forces towards their common mission. Their previous enemies, the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium respectively, are almost entirely wiped out. However, it seems one of these two groups of heroes has returned for a last stand against the Unseen empire. Can the hopelessly outnumbered heroes reclaim their homeland? Or will the unseen secure their rule of the land of Adiart for good?

Baseline Mechanics: This game is a combination of Return of the Blue Dragon and the inverse of Hand of Byzantium. There are 33 possible unseen classes in game, 17 from the Return of the Blue Dragon roleset and 16 from the Hand of Byzantium that I have reworked to be town classes instead of scum. Every unseen class from RotBD is here, but I only included unseen classes from HoB that I could pair with each one from RotBD and FoL, so a few HoB classes are missing as I only picked the ones that could be paired for conversion purposes. Unseen are the town faction and either the Blue Dragon or the Hand of Byzantium are the scum faction. Any neutral and neutral killer class from Return of the BD and Hand of Byzantium can appear, with slight alterations to some classes being made from me to compensate for flipping the town and scum factions. Both the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium are much more similar to the Unseen Faction in Forum of Lies than the Cult Faction in Forum of Lies, although they differ from each other in some notable ways.

**Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB**

20-er, King, 13-14 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 3 BD or HoB, 1 NK

**All Unique Classes besides Duke and Marshal will have Prestige, and as such only up to three of them can roll in the entire game. If the starting convert class is rolled as a prestige class, this would contribute to the limit of 3. An unseen prestige class and its scum convert equivalent cannot both roll as starting classes in the same game; i.e. no spawning of both Archivist and Librarian at the start, etc.**

**Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 5 players alive. If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.**

**The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium cannot convert night 1. After that, the second conversion has a 2-night cooldown and conversions after that have a 1-night cooldown. They may have up to four members alive.**

No unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.

Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.

<p><font color="goldenrod"> <strong>Hand of Byzantium Special</strong> </font><br>
<strong>Battle-Tested (Passive)</strong> - You are immune to every possible form of death except a lynch, including all attacks that bypass immunity. You are also occupation and redirection immune even if you become the Champion or become elected as a Purified King. If the Duke attempts to imprison you, he will think he has imprisoned you and you will be able to send a message to each other, but you will not be occupied and visits to you will not be prevented. You may also write a fake logbook when imprisoned. If the Duke attempts to execute you, he will fail and the Champion will automatically attack him in addition to his night action, bypassing all forms of healing and protection if the Duke has any. If you wrote a fake logbook while imprisoned, it will be revealed instead of the Duke’s real logbook and you will obtain access to the Duke’s original logbook.<br>
<strong>Inside Seclusion (Passive)</strong> - You will appear as a class of your choice which you can inform the host at the start of the game or when you are promoted to the arbiter which you would like for to investigators. This class can be any class in the game, even any prestige class. You are fully immune to all investigative abilities for the entire game (or entire rest of the game if you are the second arbiter) and will always appear as your desired class to investigators. You may choose one day ability from any class in the game besides the Duke, Warden, Sheriff, Agent, or any BD classes to add to your classcard, either at the start of the game for the first Arbiter or when you become the Arbiter for the second. Additionally, if you are the original Arbiter and die, if and ONLY IF the current Champion is the original champion or was promoted from a Socialite, they will become the new Arbiter. The only exception to this is a Socialite who will automatically become the new Arbiter before the Champion and the Magistrate who will do so if and only if they utilized a one-shot day ability and the Arbiter is lynched during the day. Otherwise, there will not be a second arbiter, and there can never be a third Arbiter.<br>
<strong>Imperial Urgency (Day)</strong> - Become the Champion at the start of the night; if there is a current champion, if they are the original champion, they will become the new Arbiter; if not, they will become their convert class again. Cannot be used before day 4. - One use<br>
<strong>Entrust (Night)</strong> - Convince someone to join the Hand of Byzantium. - Infinite uses, Cannot Convert Night 1, then a two-day cooldown after the first conversion succeeds, then a one-day cooldown for every conversion attempt after that.<br>
<strong>Imperial Judgment (Night)</strong> - Target a player. You may force them to target another, or force them to target themselves. If they target themselves, they will instead be occupied. You will also know who visits them. - Infinite Uses<br>
<em>Defeat the Unseen and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.</em></p>

<p><strong>Battle-Tested (Passive)</strong> - Immune to every possible form of death except a lynch. You cannot be killed even by the duke. This passive is a form of supreme protection that overrules death immunity bypassing attacks. If the Duke attempts to execute you, he will fail and instead the champion will counterattack, unleashing a bonus strike onto the duke which bypasses any and all forms of healing and protection in addition to their normal night action. There will be at least one hour each time between EoN and SoD; if this occurs, you will have that period available to replace the Duke’s logs with whatever you would like or nothing at all.<br>
<strong>Imperial Pledge (Passive)</strong> - You are entirely immune to all forms of occupation and redirection for the entire game. You keep this passive even if you choose to become the Champion or become elected as a Purified King. You also cannot be imprisoned by the duke. If the duke attempts to imprison you, he will think he has imprisoned you and you will be able to send a message to each other, but you will not actually be occupied.</p>
