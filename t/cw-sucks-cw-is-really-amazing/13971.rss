    <description>**CW is amazing:**

I was in a game where an obs was able to get a nightwatch killed with follow. he then proceeded to find another unseen (I think MM) with window peak. He finds a BD, I recharge him, and then with that extra use he finds the last unseen.

I warded him and am pretty sure based on the deaths that Saved his life (gonna admit a phys was on him, but that phys needed to take breaks to heal poisons and I warded obs then)

**CW sucks:**

CW protects from death and conversion, but also investigations, which means it is best not used n1-n4 because king so you sit there and do nothing.

In addition, you can only ward someone twice, so you have to GUESS when they will be killed or converted. Not only that, but you do not know when a conversion took place!

--------------
In sum, I think ice ward should be usable on the same person 3 times instead of 2.</description>

            <p>This is why I don’t Ice Ward n1 and only begin icing once a confirmed BD pops up in day chat.</p>
