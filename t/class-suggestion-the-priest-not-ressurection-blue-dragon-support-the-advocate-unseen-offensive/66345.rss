    <description>&gt;# [color = &quot;steblue&quot;]The Priest :shield: :star: (Not revival type… Any better names?) [/color]
&gt;**[color = &quot;steblue&quot;]Blue Dragon Support[/color]**
**[color = &quot;gold&quot;]Unique [/color]**
Converts to **[color=&quot;purple&quot;]The Advocate[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;Hidden Preaching (Passive): Your visits are hidden.
&gt;
&gt;Stake Out (Night) (Unlimited): Guard the target from any converts or attacks. You will be notified if it was attempted.
&gt;
&gt;Empower (Night) (Not usable before n3, 2 uses): Make sure the target finishes their action tonight no matter what. Your target will be told they were Empowered (Frenzy a BD)


[details=&quot;Lore&quot;]
*Generalized*
The Church has become more and more prominent. As one of the Archbishops you have been tasked to help the king in times of need, or help to switch the King out if he appears to be a wrong-doer.

Now Adiart is being infested by the Cult and Unseen and you have been specifically tasked to protect everyone. Everyone deserves to get God&#39;s grace. Everyone except for the wrongdoers.
[/details]


[details=&quot;Comments&quot;]
Stake Out will not block Occupation, target changing or death to poison/bleed, will be shown as “The Priest blocked you from attacking/converting them” to any attackers/converters. It WILL block King execution.

Stake Out won’t kill yourself if you were to guard them from attack.

The target won’t know that a Priest guarded them.

Empower will allow your target to pierce visit-prevention, as in Sellsword were guarding a bleeding person or Prince, you could Empower a Physician and let them heal them.
[/details]


&gt;# [color = &quot;purple&quot;]The Advocate :shield: :star: [/color]

&gt;God’s Curse (Day) (Unlimited, cannot be used if a player is already cursed): Curse a player.
&gt;
&gt;Mortal’s Remedy (Night) (Unlimited): Occupy the Cursed Player
&gt;
&gt;Inhibition (Night) (2 Uses): Prevent anyone except the Assassin to visit the Cursed Player.

[details=&quot;Comments&quot;]
You DO visit the cursed player when using the abilities.

            <p>Overall this class has basically all the marks of a poor class suggestion across the board.</p>
<p>Its first ability is basically a mixture of the CW’s primary ability along with parts of the Physician’s healing. Even though it can’t block occupations nor heal poisoning it still performs the main function for each of these roles, which is bad game-play wise as this would blatantly make the Priest a better CW with protective skills on the side.</p>
<p>Its second ability flat-out confirms the user at night which is a huge no-no on any BD-aligned class or BD-leaning neutral. There is no reason why a player should be outright informed that they were empowered, especially as the only class that can do this is a Priest, so this leaves very little doubt against a Priest claim and also reduces the claim-space for evils.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be a power role ergo the unique portion, but its design is just a mishmash of two support roles put together which results into boring game-play. Power roles are supposed to have innovative and interesting designs to offset their impact on the game balance.</p>
<p>Its passive just seems to be thrown there and has absolutely no synergy at all with the rest of the class. The Inquisitor has his non-visiting passive in order to counter Circle of Death. The Sorcerer has hers as a survival mechanic as she’s a Neutral Killer who is easily caught by the Observer unlike the Reaper and the Possessor.</p>
<p>To make it worse, its converted equivalent is a basically a re-skinned Sellsword with a gimmicky curse ability that has no effects in the gameplay whatsoever.</p>
