    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/unplayable-idea-class-thread/80100</link>
    <description># Rules:

Every post here must be a Class.
Classes must adhere to [this format ](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/47799). 
* Every class posted here is assumed to be neutral.
* Every class must include a win condition, a type, and a name.

Include the class number of your post in its description. You may have multiple class numbers in one post.
If a class that you created has already won a game, please make note of it on the original post.

**Classes can NOT prevent others from appearing in a game by being rolled.**
**You can not change any aspect of an existing post in a future post.**
**Consecutive duplicate posts of the same class are banned unless that class is Vanilla Town. This includes named variants.**
**You may not change the base mechanics of the game using your classes and then say &#39;reroll this slot.&#39;**
**Effort is required for your class, if it is just a named citizen it may be removed by the host.**
**You must use one of the 6 class types from vanilla FoL in your classes.**
**All classes must technically be able to win. Classes that require other classes to spawn for them to win are allowed, while classes that flatly can&#39;t win are not.**
**Moderators will delete classes that do not fit the rules of this thread.**

# Host Notes:

A game ends when a player has completed their objective. Multiple people are able to win if they win at the same time.
The host has the right to reject/reroll any class if they so wish.
If a class has already won a UIFoL game, reroll the slot if you wish.

UIFoL games fall under SFoL.

To start:

&gt; # [color=yellow]The DoubleFool[/color]
&gt; **[color=yellow]Social[/color]**
&gt; **Double the Trouble (Passive)** - When you are lynched, choose another player to become a Fool.
&gt; *Have yourself lynched along with another type of Fool*</description>
