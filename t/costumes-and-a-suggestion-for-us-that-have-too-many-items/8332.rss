    <title>Costumes and a suggestion for us that have too many items</title>

    <description>Hey there.

Like many, I&#39;ve sunk a huge load of hours into this game and have spent a tonne of gold on various costumes and weapons. I do have one suggestion though, I wish to have the ability to remove the default skin and default sword from my &#39;randomise gear&#39;, as I find them to be an eye sore in-game ;). This is only a small thing but would provide a comfort factor for those of us that have spent a dime or two on kick-ass exe weapons that we would like to see randomised each game, without having the default sword appear.

Thanks for a great game so far. Loving everything about it and so is my wife.</description>
