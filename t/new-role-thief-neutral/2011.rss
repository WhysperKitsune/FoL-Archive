    <title>New Role: Thief (Neutral)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-role-thief-neutral/2011</link>
    <description>I had an idea for a new role, the Thief. The Thief is neutral aligned, aka no faction, with the win condition to steal 5 gold bars, and live to tell the tale. (Survive)

To steal gold, you would use your night ability, Steal. Depending on the role, you will steal 1 gold bar, and occupy the player you stole from that night. You can only steal from a player once

However, occupy immune roles can&#39;t be stolen from (with the exception of the king), and a few roles have unique interactions:

The King, Cult Leader and Mastermind will be notified of being robbed, but noone else will receive this message,
Visiting the King won&#39;t occupy him, however it will steal 2 gold bars. If however the King has guards on him, they will kill you.

The Thief is immune to conversion.

So, what do you think? Are any of the unique interactions to harsh for what may be random chance (depending on the night)? Would it be too easy/hard to win as? Does it fit in Throne of Lies? Please leave feedback below.</description>

            <p>i think the role is neat but doesn’t really have a point in the game. If he can’t be converted by the unseen and the cult he basically serves as another fool in the kingdom.</p>

            <p>Thief should be immune to being converted imo. As I said above, his objectives hurt neither faction and completely changing a role just because of a convert doesn’t make much sense to me.</p>

            <p>Only problem I have tho is, neither BD or the Unseen/Cult is hurt by the Thief completing their objective. Once they find the Thief, they can just use him as an extra vote during treason and let him rob in peace till he reaches his goal. Yes they will be occupied if robbed, but is that really a big deal?</p>

            <p>Looks quite hard as a role to actually win with.<br>
I assume you can’t rob the same person twice with your idea?<br>
If there’s a game of 16 people there possibly are 2 Butlers and possibly a Fool.<br>
And if you add all the other ranks which cause you to either be converted or killed, you have a 50/50 chance to be stopped in your tracks.</p>
<p>The Thief should be immune to being occupied and when visiting the Mastermind or Cult Leader, you should not be converted. It WOULD be cool if they were alerted that they were robbed, but only the King, Cult Leader and Mastermind can get this alert.</p>

            <p>Sellsword was more of a placeholder than anything. It passes the member cap due to it not being really the mm/cl’s choice, and just a reaction of the thief visiting them. If that seems odd, it could be changed. Also, it isn’t killed by some classes for “no reason”, it’s killed by the assassin because they are presumably a trained killer who will notice a thief in their room and “dispose” of them, and the reaper is well, the reaper and one wouldn’t have anything to steal, and two would also be able to notice a thief and dispose of them. The survive condition was added purely because it seemed it fit, but if that makes it to hard to play then it could probably go. And the overall point of the class is an extra neutral to cause more chaos in games. It gives more doubt if that butler claim is really a butler, it can help any faction and is just an interesting neutral to have around.</p>

            <p>So you have to visit 5 people but can be arbitrarily killed by some classes for no reason and you bypass the member cap for no reason, also you have to survive as well as if this wasn’t difficult enough</p>
<p>I don’t see the point to this class</p>
<p>Also why tf does it become a sellsword?</p>
