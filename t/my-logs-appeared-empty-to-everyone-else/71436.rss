    <title>My logs appeared empty to everyone else</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/my-logs-appeared-empty-to-everyone-else/71436</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was killed at night, and when my logs appeared the next day, they were empty to everyone else. On my screen they showed up fine, both during the death sequence at the beginning of the day and when I clicked on the icon next to my name in the player list.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Everything I wrote that night should have been visible to everyone else.

#### Steps to reproduce:
I have no idea what caused it, so I&#39;ll just post what happened.
1. Be Prince.
2. Jail 3 night one.
3. Get killed by possessor using puppet strings. (At least I think that&#39;s what happened.)

I&#39;m not sure what exactly was different about this game. I had already begun to prepare logs my during D1, but they were completely empty to everyone else upon death. They appeared fine to me.

#### Comments:
This might explain the number of empty N1 logs I&#39;ve been seeing, but it&#39;s impossible to tell this sort of bug apart from someone not bothering with N1 logs.</description>
