# Welcome to JoaT^2, hosted by @Arete and cohosted by @DatBird!

# Rules:

Follow the Global Forum Rules, given in this post:

https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926

Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of **20 substantive, on-topic, game related posts** per in game day are required. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing *solely* a vote. The first time a player fails to meet this requirement, they will be given a warning; the second time they fail to meet it, they will be replaced out. A player who zero-posts will be subbed out without a warning. This requirement may be reduced or waived if an execution is hammered early by majority.

The game will begin when full.

Alts *are* allowed; Arete is the alt mod.

# Gameplay

- The set-up is a 15 player set-up with 10 Vanilla Townies, 2 Town Jacks-of-All-Trades, and 3 Mafia Goons.

- Each JoaT has access to three abilities, and must use each ability once before using it a second time. They are not required to use them in the same order each time.

- A JoaT cannot target the same player with the Heal action on two consecutive nights.

- Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.

- Executions are majority and plurality.

- No-execute is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-execute and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-execute will have priority in the rand.

- **In cases where two or more players are tied at the end of the day, the Mafia will decide which player is executed. They have up to half an hour to make this decision (for angleshooting purposes, the full half hour will always be used). They may submit preferences in advance, and if they do not submit a timely choice it will always be assumed that they wish to save a member of the Mafia if that member is put to rand with a member of the Town.**

- Self-votes are considered valid votes.

- Votes are locked in LyLo (execute-or-lose) scenarios, but not in MyLo (misexecute-and-lose) scenarios. That is to say, in situations where town must execute correctly or lose, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.

- All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote**. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.
- The Mafia factional kill is assigned. If the member performing the factional kill is not specified, the last member to submit a kill will be assumed to be performing it.

- The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.

- The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.

<p>The moon was a thin crescent in the sky above her; a canvas of stars dotted the sky behind it. As she sat on the deck, staring at the sky, she remembered how katze had taught her to navigate by the stars. She had been but a kitten then, and many of the older cats had mocked the idea of teaching one as young as her how to navigate, but katze had listened to her when she’d asked to learn. She glanced down at the deck; even now, it hurt to remember.</p>

<p>At last, one pirate stepped forward. “We’re all tired of this,” said PsychoKang. “Why don’t we just – turn some of these crates into rafts, and each head our separate ways? It’s not a good solution, but at least it protects us from the dogs.”</p>

<p>The rest of the cat pirates converged on Intensify. “Is that true?” asked Vulgard.</p>
<p>“Of course not!” said Intensify. “I would never kill anyone. Me-oof – see, I just meowed, could a dog meow?”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t even a meow,” said Vulgard. “It literally ended in a ‘woof.’”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!” said Leafia. “It ended in an ‘oof,’ not in a ‘woof.’ Maybe they just have a weird accent that makes their meows sound different or something.”</p>
