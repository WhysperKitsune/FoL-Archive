<p>I doubt I’ll change this vote at all today, unless Gorta improves massively. Right now, I’m 85% sure that Gorta is a wolf as well, and considering at EoD 2 I was 95% sure that Mole was a wolf, that’s saying a lot.There was a small part of my brain saying What if I’m wrong and Mole is town? that was only silenced upon seeing his flip, which was definitely a relief to me admittedly. EoD2 was stressful, but in the end, we yeeted a wolf.</p>

<p>I’m not saying I should be completely clear due to it and there’s nothing BS about my accusation and I think that you know it. What you’re doing now is just making me suspect you even more.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll admit that if I was a wolf and you were a town in this situation, what I’m doing now is exactly what I would do</strong>, but the reverse is also true. You need to take other things into consideration while trying to solve my slot, like how Mole acted towards me among other things. If you take just one thing as proof of someone’;s alignment, you’re just asking to towncore a wolf or misyeet a town. You need to look at the whole picture.</p>
<p>If I was someone else who knew my playstyle as well as I do, I’d be reading myself as a townlean currently. Could still be a wolf but is slightly more likely to be a villager. <strong>I’m guessing the uninformed spec chat reads me as close to that, although I can see how someone could scumlean me even now, as I have done at least a few scummy things.</strong></p>
<p>Plus, you never explained why you hard defended Mole, who happened to be scum. That’s what a villager would’ve done I think. A villager would understand me scumreading them after how you hard defended Mole.</p>

          <p>I’m not the one playing bad here. If you’re town, this is godawful play coming from you. Of course people are going to think you’re scummy if you hard defend a wolf. The fact that you can’t see how that makes you look scummy has me convinced that you must be a wolf. A villager would at least understand my view on them. A wolf would act like you’re acting right now. A wolf hard defending a wolfbuddy literally happens all the time. Especially in ToS. I know this is FM and not ToS, but the same principals apply. If you think you can prevent a wolfbuddy from being lynched, you defend them. That’s the bottom line here. Look towards App and me in both Insurgency and CFM 2 for that. Also, I can’t throw shade when it’s already there. I’m just pointing out why you’re a super obvious wolf ancd I’ll be shocked if I survive tonight after getting you yeeted.</p>

          <p>Derps: He’s making a lot of godawful pushes and defending obvious wolves but sadly, this is town AI for him. I did read through Hell in a Cell where he was scum and this feels closer to his town games than he did there.</p>
<p>Wazza: Not sure how to read him right now, but giving off a slightly townie vibe currently. His reaction to my confusion regarding his slot seems townish to me as I feel scum would’ve handled that differently.</p>
<p>Centuries: I don’t remember much from him so I don’t really have a good or even bad read on him, but GTH, I’d slightly townish.</p>
<p>PK: He replaced in for one of my towncore so now he’s in my towncore in CatLover’s place.<br>
Vulgard: My top townread and the only one that it’s impossible for me to be wrong about. Clearly town.</p>
<p>Gorta: Very clearly scum. His defense of himself at the start of D3 was godawful and included OMGUSing me and being ultra LAMIST. I honestly can’t see how anyone could possibly think he’s town here. He’s virtually openwolfing here and he was even scummy before EoD1. The ones TRing him need to take a close look on his slot and re eval.</p>
<p>sulit: Not too sure about this slot. I remember TRing her but I can’t really recall why exactly. It doesn’t help that I keep getting her confused with Wiisp.</p>
<p>CallMeIo: I desperately want lo here to be town as I’d love a world where she’s town, but her reads and how sure she is of everything have me slightly doubting that such a world exists. I still TL them though although that may be due to me wanting her to be town so badly.<br>
Elephas: Considering that they’re a dead flipped townie, I’m equally as confident that they’re town as I am about Vulgard being town.</p>
<p>Leafia: I have my reservations about this slot as it really puzzles me Her push on Gorta so early in the day seems pretty scummy to me and they’re a known hard busser, so I can see why people would be scumreading her. Hmmm, her interaction with Mole does paint her in a good light as Mole was clearly trying to make her look scummy. She’s been more re evaluatily and is making her own reads too, but whether that’s a sign of an improving scumgame or a towngame is hard to tell for certain. I’ll have to ISO her later to be s- wait. This is me. Oops. This is town. I’m as sure of it as I am about Vulgard being town.</p>
<p>Moleland: I’m as sure of him being scuum as I am about Gorta being scum. Considering he’s a dead flipped scum, that’s saying something.</p>
<p>Ash: I have no idea why people were scumreading him honestly, although he has dropped off the radar after EoD1. Considering that’s when he was yeeted though, that’s completely understandable.</p>
<p>Katze: Another slot I wasn’t sure about all of D1. RIP you townie you. You were an excellent cat and we’ll win this for you.</p>
<p>Wiisp: Pretty sure this is town at the moment. She’s had a very townie feel to her ever since the second half of D1.</p>
<p>Flameo: I’m slightly confident that he’s town. Although if I’m misclearing scum, this slot and Wazza are the most likely candidates.</p>

<p>Leafia: I have my reservations about this slot as it really puzzles me Her push on Gorta so early in the day seems pretty scummy to me and they’re a known hard busser, so I can see why people would be scumreading her. Hmmm, her interaction with Mole does paint her in a good light as Mole was clearly trying to make her look scummy. She’s been more re evaluatily and is making her own reads too, but whether that’s a sign of an improving scumgame or a towngame is hard to tell for certain. I’ll have to ISO her later to be s- wait. This is me. Oops. This is town. I’m as sure of it as I am about Vulgard being town.</p>

<p>Did you seriously just make the largest read in here… on yourself?</p>
<p>And you included dead people too, because… why not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I figured the mood was getting a bit too serious, so I decided to add a bit of humor to my reads. Besides, I was getting a bit tired of readlists that just flat out call the one making it town.</p>
