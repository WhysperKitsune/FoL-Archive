    <title>Change the King</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/change-the-king/53148</link>
    <description>Meta is too much oriented around King now and here are my thoughts on the problem.

1) Make King unable to whisper. Force him to say everything out loud, it&#39;s like, everyone is watching him so he can&#39;t just whisper to anyone. This change would mean he has to say things like &quot;bomb 10&quot; which is a nice nerf for EK.
2) Make King know who the Prince is since the beginning, BUT make him unable to OE him.
EK can somehow manage to get Prince killed indirectly, but can&#39;t OE him on his own.

            <p>Yeah this nerfs evils way too much. BD already have about a 50% winrate, we should be helping evils a bit, not the BD. This will also make prince deaths way too common and boring. Letting evils hear some whispers but letting them hear just the right amount would probably help solve it, although it will be hard to find the balance. Also the devs said that they won’t remove whispers/prevent the king from whispering.</p>

<p>This is incredibly heavy handed. This needs to be an absolute last resort. A better solution is too make whispers leak to evils.</p>

<p>How does this stop the meta? And Order Execution is an important tool for an Evil King, and should stay.</p>
