# New player guide:

###### Posting this here, so I don&#39;t have to duplicate it 16 times in classcards.

Always ask the hosts when in doubt. We don’t mind if we get 20 mechanical questions a day from you to ensure that you understand how the game works.

Read the original post carefully as many questions are already answered in there.

[FoL Class Cards (Now Officially Official)](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fol-class-cards-now-officially-official/1998) is where all the classcards are that are possible.

There are definite deviations from Throne of Lies the game, although many many similarities persist.

We have even completely new classes like Priest, Archer, Demon etc., so be sure to look at this link carefully. Small deviations for existing classes exist as well to provide a more forum balanced game.
An example is that a Knight can Cold Steel Night 1 already and a Physician’s Exhume only provides the faction of the dead person’s killer instead of the whole class.

The Cult functions very differently too and the following guide should provide some insight.
Cult points were added to allow for better fakeclaiming potential.

![|20x20](https://forum.imperium42.com/user_avatar/forum.imperium42.com/marluxion/40/10921_2.png) [Cult Points - How do they work?](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/cult-points-how-do-they-work/62045) [Forum of Lies](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches/forum-of-lies)

&gt; mithras Cult Point Introduction corax What are Cult Points? Well, young disciple, I’m glad you asked! After being converted to the Cult, you receive a set number of Cult Points based on the class you were converted from. These can be found just below your Class Card in the [Class Card Thread](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fol-class-cards-now-officially-official/1998). Wowee, Mithras is great! How do I spend these points? At any time (Day, night, on trial, whenever!) via your Class Card DM you may spend your cult points into new abilities. You can take ANY ability…

Feedback is also heavily reduced in comparison to Throne of Lies. For an feedback (exhaustive for at least the BD) guide follow:

![|20x20](https://forum.imperium42.com/user_avatar/forum.imperium42.com/marluxion/40/10921_2.png) [Forum of Lies Hosting Feedback Guide](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/forum-of-lies-hosting-feedback-guide/75082) [Forum of Lies](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches/forum-of-lies)

&gt; IF AN INVESTIGATION FAILS FOR ANY REASON “You were unable to investigate your target.” IF AN INVESTIGATOR HAS THEIR TARGET SWAPPED “Your target was changed!&quot; (They aren’t told who they were swapped to) IF AN INVESTIGATOR TARGETS A PHYLACTERY HOLDER “You feel a chill surrounding the target player. They are a Phylactery Holder for The Lich!” MAID Change Sheets: “Your targets were killed by the same player!” “Your targets were not killed by the same player!” Matchmake: “Your targets are comp…

Examples are that mainly investigative classes gain feedback. A butler occupying another player will not see if they are occupy immune or not. The player being occupied will not see that they are being occupied by anyone unless they are an investigative. Another example is that a Physician will not know whether their target was bleeding/poisoned and the target player will not know whether they are healed.

Trials also do not exist similar to Throne of Lies. That means when someone is “voted up”, they are immediately executed once majority is reached, so ensure that you stand behind your vote!

Forum players use a specific lingo and some common abbreviations can be found in the following link:

Remember, when in doubt, ask the hosts in your classcard: Solic and Datbird</description>

Like Gikkle said, on our site awards don’t really mater too much. If you get one, it’s just like letting you know you did well. Makes the receiver feel happy and accomplished. It’s usually rewarded to people that make good reads and push them. Active in thread, etc. We never really count them, giving out awards is just a fun thing to do endgame. Never really take them too seriously. Hosts give em out.</p>

            <p>Do awards hold weight or something here? On my site, hosts are the ones who give out awards, but they don’t really mean anything, and are nothing but “Virtual Bragging Rights”, and people don’t really care about them on my site. I have around 4 “best” awards on my site, but I don’t really pay attention to them much or really consider them when playing on there. Since y’all are debating about how to give out awards and taking it super seriously, I’m wondering if awards actually have some kind of importance here.</p>

            <p>It’s smart to always ISO quickly whoever you involve in your night actions. It doesn’t take too much time in that way, but you still ensure your mechanical play is on point. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> This way you ensure you kill somebody that you really do read as scum or you protect someone you really do think is town. You did do it on a conversion night, so props for that.</p>

            <p>Only time will tell about that. I think it’s a bit insulting to players that you say a majority won’t understand the concept of getting converted into a loss and are able to separate town and scum play after conversion.</p>
<p>Also this system encompasses all games on this site and not just the ones that have conversion.</p>
