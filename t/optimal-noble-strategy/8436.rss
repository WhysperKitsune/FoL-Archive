    <title>Optimal Noble Strategy</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/optimal-noble-strategy/8436</link>
    <description>As noble, night 1, you use private matters.

Day 2, Wisper EVERYBODY a message that looks like this:

&quot;Hey, i am merc, you are my contract. I did not protect you night 1 to keep charges. Let&#39;s win together =)&quot;

As a general rule, BD players will happily tell you their role, or at least reply that theyre bd. Its quite easy to find their role. You usually at least find around 4-5 roles using this strategy.

Then, of course, listen to conversation of the king.

Using those 2 things, you can quickly know every roles. With some luck, maybe a cult or a neutral will even admit their role to you. And best thing is, if you get converted, you can really help out the cult.

I just used this strategy in a game, was converted night 2, and we literally did not lose a single cult member.


Note: if at some point they figure out what you did, you can easily prove you are noble by saying &quot;well i used private matters and wisped all of you...&quot;</description>

<p>This exactly. But i noticed 2 mains problems with it:</p>
<p>1: If players are weak, they think you are the fool (even tho you obviously cant be one…)<br>
2: If there is a real merc, he tends to out you.</p>

            <p>MM/Cult Leader and Assassin/starter cult member (additional with converted member) will discuss about the ‘merc’ claim will be guarding two people at same night and they couldn’t see the whispers on chat? Dead giveaway and it’s not worth converting.</p>
<p>Psychic links with the people and they are telling to got merc contract, again the single merc with ‘two’ contracts.</p>
<p>Since Noble and Aristocrat are the same, both sides will suspect with this Strategy but at the same time, you play both sides.</p>

            <p>People might not figure it out. No one else knows the whispers are happening and they don’t out people that claim merc on them. They would figure it out eventually but since noble is a provable claim it won’t get you killed.</p>

            <p>As noble, night 1, you use private matters.</p>
<p>Day 2, Wisper EVERYBODY a message that looks like this:</p>
<p>“Hey, i am merc, you are my contract. I did not protect you night 1 to keep charges. Let’s win together =)”</p>
<p>As a general rule, BD players will happily tell you their role, or at least reply that theyre bd. Its quite easy to find their role. You usually at least find around 4-5 roles using this strategy.</p>
<p>Then, of course, listen to conversation of the king.</p>
<p>Using those 2 things, you can quickly know every roles. With some luck, maybe a cult or a neutral will even admit their role to you. And best thing is, if you get converted, you can really help out the cult.</p>
<p>I just used this strategy in a game, was converted night 2, and we literally did not lose a single cult member.</p>
<p>Note: if at some point they figure out what you did, you can easily prove you are noble by saying “well i used private matters and wisped all of you…”</p>
