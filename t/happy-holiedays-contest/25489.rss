    <description>**Happy HoLIEdays**
 
The year is rapidly coming to a close and the HoLIEday season is upon us. In order to thank you, our beloved Liars, we are giving away NINE free copies of our game, Throne of Lies, that you can gift to your friends.
 
So when you spend the next month shopping only to realize you bought games for yourself on Steam and need to get gifts for your entire family with the lone requirement that they are Prime eligible, you’ll have one unique gift to give!
 
The Happy HoLIEdays contest will be rewarding players for the best in-game screenshots in each of our three HoLIEday categories:
 
 **BEST HOLIDAY DEATHNOTE:**
 
Break out the crayons and curl up next to the fire while you concentrate more on your work of art than your investigative abilities. 
 
The deathnote can feature your favorite holiday characters, sayings or themes. Bonus points for any note that’s actually left at the scene of a murder. Three different deathnotes will receive a prize.
 
**BEST HOLIDAY ROLEPLAY:**
 
Embody the Ghost of Christmas Past or inhabit the robotic form of Kwanzaa-Bot to bring joy to your fellow members of the court.
 
Be sure to throw in your favorite Holiday quote and send multiple screenshots (from the same game) to display your commitment to the character. Bonus points for proof of victory, especially as a neutral killer. Three different deathnotes will receive a prize.
 
**BEST HOLIDAY THEMED GAME:**
 
This one will take some coordination, but we want to see everyone work together for the best holiday-name themed game. Are you Jesus and his 12 apostles? Santa and his 8 Reindeer?  You’ll have to be more creative than that to win best group theme.
 
Bonus points if every single player in a 16-player game participates in the theme. And feel free to add a little holiday cheer to the chat box. One winner will be selected with three keys given. Additional participants in the winning theme will receive GP for their efforts

**Ways to Submit:**

There are three ways to submit your entries in order to be eligible for the contest. You can submit your screenshots right here on the official forum post for the Happy HoLIEdays contest. 

You can also submit your screenshots via Twitter, using the #HappyHoLIEdays hashtag or post your submission, including multiple screenshots, as a primary response to the Happy HoLIEdays Reddit post. Please make sure that you include the username(s) of the participants as a screenshot of the game’s final screen.

Submissions will not be accepted any other way. 

KEEP IN MIND: Roleplaying is not an excuse for breaking the rules. You must still play the objective and support your faction. Roleplaying for this contest will not be an acceptable excuse for getting suspended.

Winners will be chosen on or after January 10th.

**EDIT:** For submitted pictures, please submit full-sized pictures :)</description>

            <p>You said winners would be chosen on or after January 10th, so here is my late submission! Since it is no longer the Holidays I couldn’t get anyone to do a Holiday-themed ANYTHING so I got a home-iday roleplay going. I played as the Ceiling and three complete strangers roleplayed as the Floor, the Wall, and the Door. We had a spectacular time, being in-character the entire time without having known each other. It was delightful. I hope you will consider my submission in the spirit of community haha!</p>
