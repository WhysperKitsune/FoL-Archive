            <p>The mechanics aren’t flawed the character is . Its a limitation of the witchhunters ability that he cant discern between princess and witch .</p>
<p>Obv playing as a witchhunter you would know that your ability is flawed and would likely do further investigation before putting a witch to the flame .</p>

            <p>Lore is no reason for flawed game mechanics, to be honest. There are ways of making a class interesting without making them inherently worse than their alternatives <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>The princess on the night result is to give a degree of misguidance .<br>
Its meant to reflect the witch hunter being somewhat of a zealot and pointing the finger at anyone who they think could be  a witch with very little evidence other than that they are a woman .<br>
The old joke of testing for a witch by seeing if they burn when set on fire . If they burn , not a witch . If they don’t burn - a witch .</p>
<p>The whole idea I had for the witch hunter is that although he works for bd he is not a perfect tool .</p>
<p>It could easily be changed to be a vanilla sherrif  clone but I just thought this might be fun .</p>
<p>Also as you say instavote is OP to balance this the witchhunter abilities are imperfect</p>

            <p>Witch Hunter confuses me. Why Princess on the night result, and why would BD have any need for class disguising, and how is 3 uses for an instavote (already extremely powerful, if not OP) fair?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So the hex , curse and mark , can be carried out on targets during the day . The players that are effected get a message saying they have been cursed marked or hexed .<br>
At night a different witch will get a different effect if their target is hexed cursed or marked .</p>
<p>I have just thought of a better way of wording it all though . Ill update my original post .</p>
