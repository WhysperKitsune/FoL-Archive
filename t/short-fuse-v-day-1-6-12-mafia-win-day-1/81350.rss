    <description># Short Fuse V

![bomb|204x180](upload://6gWSMU8Vn2CRXlOKBzIXsQ7hqnN)

### Hosts

# @Marshal and &lt;small&gt;@Wazza&lt;/small&gt;

### Setup

[color=green]**9 Town**[/color]
[color=Red]**3 Mafia**[/color]


Mafia requires parity to win rather than the total obliteration of the town faction

Nightless
Mafia have a factional chat, but do not have a factional kill
Days are 48 hours long
Prods will be sent out every 24 hours of non-activity. A second prod means a force replace out.
Lynches happen through either majority or plurality
Votes are cast with command  **/vote [insert playername]**
You cannot vote for a nolynch

### Game Gimmick

Each player has a bomb strapped to them, the bombs can only be disarmed when 1 faction wins.

At the beginning of the game, each player is publicly given a detonator.

At any point, you may type  **/detonate**(and ping the hosts)  in the game thread to kill the player whose detonator you hold.

When a player dies for any reason (detonation or lynch), the detonator they hold is given to the player who holds their detonator, so if A can kill B and B can kill C, if B dies, A then has the detonator to kill C.

A player may detonate a maximum of one player per 24 hours.

Before the game starts, the Mafia must tell us if they want a Town detonator, a Mafia detonator, or for it to be random. A maximum of 2 Mafia detonators can be taken. A 24 hour time limit holds for pre-game. It is allowed to talk during this period. If no choice is made, it will be random.

Once the player who has your detonator types  **/detonate**  , you can no longer detonate anyone.

            <p>Nothing, I’m just pissed at Braixen going “I solved the game, I solved the game” because he had all wolves in a 6-person PoE with 8 other players alive after he fucked up by detonating a villager for no reason. I’m not only pissed off at being detonated, but I’m also pissed at his ego when it comes to his reads and that he’s always deflecting the blame for the losses onto other people.</p>
<p>Frankly, I hope that I’ll never have to play with him again. I quit playing here when gamethrowers like Isaac and Marg were allowed to run rampant without any moderation actions whatsoever as games were a foregone conclusion when you had Marg vig’ing greenchecked players or Isaac claiming wolf and voting against consensus townreads as a villager, so if I keep having to play with a person who makes such plays purely out of grudges and then blames their gamethrowing on other players, or even accuses the wolves of breaking the rules because of salt over a loss, then forget it.</p>
<p>A social deduction game is only fun when people are playing to, or at least not playing against, their own wincon, and trust between players is essential for it to work.</p>
<p>So it should be obvious that if there is a player who intentionally plays against their own wincon and disrupts this form of trust between players, then the game becomes unfun and not working. I’ve been disliking Braixen since he returned due to his angleshooting, his accusation of people of breaking the rules for shit reasons, and now the straw that broke the camel’s back was him blatantly gamethrowing by vigging me because of me quickhammering as a wolf in RM4.</p>
<p>So in short, if he’s ever in a game, I’m likely outing as I don’t want to play with a person like this anymore. If he’s allowed to keep making these accusations such as how he claimed that Chloe was strategically replacing out despite that several people here backed her story, or if he can vig people he dislike just because, or if he can repeatedly nightpost to get themselves modkilled, then forget it, I’m out.</p>
<p>I’m here to enjoy a game. Having players who play against their wincon, angleshoot, or who intentionally try to weaponize the mod makes the game unenjoyable, so if I keep having to deal with Braixen throwing matches, being arrogant over his RNG’d reads, and other forms of shit-tier behavior then I’m simply going back to MU.</p>

<p>Appel has been logical and unbiased in many circumstances. She tries to solve, and generally aids threadstate.</p>

<p>Something I noticed from Vul’s W games in that he’s super aggressive and votes like there’s no tomorrow, but I understand and somewhat agree with the logic behind this one. He’s being kind of aggressive again <s>and shading, hmm</s> but there’s nothing that would make me scumread him yet</p>

</aside>
<p>If there is scum in Vul/Italy he would be semi-risking being accused of TMI, so this looks to be the post of an uninformed slot, but more info on that when/if Vul and/or Italy flips.</p>

Alice</summary>
<h1>
<font color="undefined">Town</font><font color="gray">lean</font>
</h1>
<p>A lot to say about this slot tbh. <em>Sigh</em><br>
But fuck that. I’ll TL:DR that shit.<br>
This slot has been very active, right next to Vulgard, and has gotten into near mod-trouble trying to prove some point about appel. Bonus points for that one. Very solve-y, but this slot isn’t clear entirely; Earlier on there were some weird things she didn’t pick up on that Vulgard pointed out, and the like, as well as some mixed associations that maybe could be interpreted as distancing. Deeper ISO planned for this slot later, but probably not a D1 lynch candidate.</p>

<summary>
Vulgard</summary>
<h1>
<font color="undefined">Town</font><font color="gray">lean</font>
</h1>
<p>Tone has been <em>horrendously</em> scummy, but general mannerism stay in V!Vulgard fashion, so this slot is confusing to me rn. Plenty of solving attempt, but also some weird shades I don’t understand. Townlean, but nullish.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
DryBones</summary>
<h1><font color="gray">Null</font></h1>
<p>Typical V!DryBones behavior, but I worry about people with Maniac metas, as simulating that as scum, in theory, wouldnt be too hard.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Braix</summary>
<h1><font color="gray">Null</font></h1>
<p>This one <em>was</em> typical V!Braix but after awhile he got slanky and more relaxed, which is atypical afaik. Null for now, but I might detonate if things get frisky and he is still skanking.</p>
