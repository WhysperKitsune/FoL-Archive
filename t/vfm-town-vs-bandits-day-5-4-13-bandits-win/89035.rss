## Town vs Bandits - Hosted and designed by @Wazza and @Geyde, Reviewed by @DatBird 

[QUOTE]
## Dagnabbit! Them there bandits have invaded our prestine Town!
But we can&#39;t figure out who they are, so we&#39;ve recruited all members of the Town to come together in order to find and enact *justice* upon em! Unfortunately, we entered WIFOM hell and have to out-predict them because our officers are trainees and are terrible at their job. Good luck, we suck.
[/QUOTE]

## Mechanics:
* Open Setup
* 48/24 Phases - Night can be skipped if all players agree, when the day ends may be changed depending when the night is skipped.
* The Bandits will speak in either a private thread or private discord depending on what they desire.
* The Bandits have a mandatory Factional Kill (if not performed the kill will be randomized among living town players) and a Factional One-Shot Rolecop.
* The Bandit Factional Kill and the Bandit Factional One-Shot Rolecop may not be done alongside each other.
* Threadmarks will include Final Vote Counts, day starts, night starts and any other important events
* Bandits do not flip as their role, instead they flip as Bandit, because that&#39;s the only thing we&#39;re competent enough to figure out.

## Rules:
* Follow the [Global Forum Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) and [Forum Game Rules](https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-game-rules/78926). Failure to do so will result in a warning and consequently a force-replace or modkill if needed.
* A minimum of 20 content posts are required per day, if it is impossible for you to reach this amount, please inform me beforehand. If you are prodded twice for this, you will be force-replaced or modkilled if needed. If you post no content in a single day that did not end early, you will be force-replaced immediately unless you can provide a good enough reasoning beforehand.
* Excessive AtE is frowned upon, don&#39;t use it.
* Each day, you make make a maximum of 200 posts, on content or not, an hour before EoD this will be lifted. Any votes done after you have reached your post limit will not punish you.

## Voting:
* Majority and Plurality are enabled, however on Day 1, Majority is disabled. Which, of course, means there is a Day 1 executed.
* If two or more wagons are tied for plurality, a random player between the tied wagons will be executed.
* To vote a player, type **/vote [name] @Chloe** otherwise the vote will not count.
* MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will be announced, and votes will be locked. This means that your first vote is final and cannot be changed.

## Rolecards:

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=GREEN]Vanilla Town[/COLOR]
Your only abilities are your voice and your vote.

You are practically completely useless in anything you try to accomplish or do in life, your uselessness holds no bounds whatsoever, but that doesn&#39;t stop you from enacting your *right* as a citizen to murder people in the name of justice.

*Defeat the Bandits in the name of justice.*
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=GREEN]Town Informed Tracker[/COLOR]
Each night, you may choose to track a player, you will know who they visit.
Your results will be either &#39;Your target visited [player]&#39;, &#39;Your target didn&#39;t visit anyone&#39; or &#39;No Result&#39;.
Additionally, You know that [x] is the [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Jailkeeper**[/COLOR].

After being arrested for committing tax fraud, he was released on set circumstances because he&#39;s actually good at not being useless.

*Defeat the Bandits in the name of justice.*
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=GREEN]Town Informed Jailkeeper[/COLOR]
Each night, you may choose to jail a player. Their action will be roleblocked and they will be protected from nightkills.
You may not target the same player consecutively.
Additionally, You know that [x] is the [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Tracker**[/COLOR].

Extremely delusional, constantly talks about how the bandits are wolves or mafia for some reason, also calls fellow citizens villagers to go along with this, would be in a mental facility, however he&#39;s still one of the only compteent ones.

*Defeat the Bandits in the name of justice.*
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=BROWN]Bandit Goon[/COLOR]
Your only abilities are your voice and your vote.

You tagged along with your fellow bandits, you&#39;re similar to the person who just mouths the words to a song during a choir, you&#39;re absolutely pointless, but you&#39;re trying your best and that&#39;s all that matters. However, your best clearly isn&#39;t enough, you&#39;re practically useless anyway.

*Have majority of the Town be Bandits or have equal numbers of both.*
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=BROWN]Bandit Inheriting Ninja[/COLOR]
Your visits are hidden when performing the factional kill.
If the Strongwilled dies, you will become immune to roleblocks when performing the factional kill.

Cannot stop screaming about how it isn&#39;t just a phase.

*Have majority of the Town be Bandits or have equal numbers of both.*
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
# [COLOR=BROWN]Bandit Inheriting Strongwilled[/COLOR]
You are immune to roleblocks when performing the factional kill.
If the Ninja dies, your visits will be hidden when performing the factional kill.

You have no dignity, nothing to lose, so at the end of the day, who cares who you pick and choose.

*Have majority of the Town be Bandits or have equal numbers of both.*
[/QUOTE]
Flavour Written here will not be used, instead the flavour will be tailored to The Princess Bride.
## Things changed from the previous game (that got canned):
[QUOTE]
* Players will flip as [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Jailkeeper**[/COLOR], [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Tracker**[/COLOR], [COLOR=GREEN]**Vanilla Town**[/COLOR] or [COLOR=BROWN]**Bandit**[/COLOR]
* [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Universal Backup Fruit Vendor**[/COLOR]&#39;s competence got it killed, instead its intelligence spread out to other Citizens...okay nevermind, it only went to the other two Citizens that could actually do things and they became [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Jailkeeper**[/COLOR] and [COLOR=GREEN]**Town Informed Tracker**[/COLOR]. A new [COLOR=GREEN]**Vanilla Town**[/COLOR] also joined the Town to accommodate this.
* [COLOR=BROWN]**Bandit Tracker**[/COLOR] learned a new skill but unfortunately lost it&#39;s own to gain Bandits a One-Shot Factional Rolecop.

            <p>I used poor words to describe why I made a split decision</p>
<p>There’s a lot of factors that come into making a decision</p>
<p>How do I explain to someone why I sus’d them?<br>
Well, there’s a few ways<br>
First, you can cite admin table you used to come to that conclusion<br>
Second, you can employ an appeal to logic</p>
<p>What I ended up employing was the second, because I felt like I was getting nowhere with the first<br>
Marl toting the line with how he handled his tasks, ultimately culminating in a way that could very easily be interpreted as announcing intent to vent<br>
Nothing about this is necessarily wrong<br>
It is not explicit<br>
However, it’s pushing borders and threatening the game over something like <em>that</em> is what drilled me the most when I was talking</p>
<p>That’s the split decision<br>
Do I give Marl benefit of the doubt, despite the fact that this is pushing the rules a lot to not take action on? Or do I step the line and try to preserve the integrity of the game by going through with a sus on the premise of the action breaking the rules.</p>
<p>That’s why you get…this</p>
<p>I don’t know, even now, what is the best way to run this situation from the host’s side<br>
I’ll stick to my guns and say that, while I have been in a massive funk since I made the decision, I refuse to believe what I did was out of bad faith<br>
It could have been misguided or flat out wrong, but I believed that what I did was the right thing to do</p>

            <p>At least give town some sort of compensation lol</p>
<p>A host decision should never tilt a game in a teams favor as significantly as it did here</p>
<p>The amount the modkill effected the game is unjustified for what marl did</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used poor words to describe why I made a split decision</p>
<p>There’s a lot of factors that come into making a decision</p>
<p>How do I explain to someone why I MK’d them?<br>
Well, there’s a few ways<br>
First, you can cite rules you used to come to that conclusion<br>
Second, you can employ an appeal to logic</p>
<p>What I ended up employing was the second, because I felt like I was getting nowhere with the first<br>
Marl toting the line with how he handled his posts, ultimately culminating in a post that could very easily be interpreted as announcing intent to replace out<br>
Nothing about this is necessarily wrong<br>
It is not explicit<br>
However, it’s pushing borders and threatening the game over something like <em>that</em> is what drilled me the most when I was talking</p>
<p>That’s the split decision<br>
Do I give Marl benefit of the doubt, despite the fact that this is pushing the rules a lot to not take action on? Or do I step the line and try to preserve the integrity of the game by going through with a modkill on the premise of the action breaking the rules.</p>
<p>That’s why you get…this</p>
<p>I don’t know, even now, what is the best way to run this situation from the host’s side<br>
I’ll stick to my guns and say that, while I have been in a massive funk since I made the decision, I refuse to believe what I did was out of bad faith<br>
It could have been misguided or flat out wrong, but I believed that what I did was the right thing to do</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>geyde I understand everything you did this game and I don’t think you should get shit for it</p>
<p>but this reads like a copypasta and I can’t stop giggling</p>
