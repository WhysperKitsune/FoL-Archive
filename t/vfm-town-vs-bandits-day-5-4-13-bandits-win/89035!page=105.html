          <p>General summation of spf’s posts/stances from yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing I was noticing is that she was mostly trying to keep Chloe at kind of an arm’s length throughout most of her posts, which makes me think that if she’s a wolf then it would be really weird to kill that slot since she had a couple of posts (112, 342, 343, 887) where it looks to me that she was setting up herself to push the Chloe slot once Vulg flipped v. She said that she’d work with her but I didn’t really get a sense of that reading her D1 ISO? She was mostly asking questions TO me/chloe rather than… real-timing with either of us to get better reads on us or other players ITT.</li>
</ul>
<p>spf, is there a reason why you were keeping most of the thread at arm’s length yesterday? I do notice that you were trying to play the game in a certain way but then decided later on to treat it like chat mafia (which is IMO the correct way to play mafia in FOL) but IIRC you were more collaborative in the ROCKS mafia game and I feel like you’ve been playing intentionally curt.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pretty consistent about having the towncore of Alice, Leafia, Arctic. I like her reasons for townreading all of them (towncoring Alice because her reads/process aren’t as outwardly/intrinsically villagery, Leafia because of how she treated Chloe at SoD, and Arctic because of his enjoyment being ITT and his high depth/nuance with his reads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also the big thing that I noticed her doing throughout most of Day 1 was that she wasn’t really defending Vulgard, but she was talking about other people’s reads on him in a way where she encouraged them to consider possible worlds where Vulgard would be a villager playing poorly (which is what he actually was) as opposed to what their current reads on him were. (418, 734, 879, 899, 1008, 1618, 1622, 1783).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also one thing that I looked at over night that made me immediately feel bad about mislunching Vulgard was that I looked at one of his <a href="https://www.mafiathesyndicate.com/viewtopic.php?p=819565#p819565" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">postgame comments</a> in the Syndicate game that spf linked that was run that had a bunch of MUers in it (the Cognitive Psychology game) and I really wished I looked at that post on Day 1 because I would have probably shifted my read on Vulg. He talked a lot about his thought process when randing W in a strong playerlist like he did in that game and how demotivated he got when he didn’t see that town jailkeeper sunbae’s jail on him trumped his roleblock on him.</p>
<p>So honestly I can see where spf is coming from because she was in this game with Vulg, and saw how serious/intense he was about playing the wolf alignment in that game. So seeing him just kinda flop around here when she knew that Vulg was able to play a (I think?) much better, more serious game than what he showed here makes sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>She was pretty consistent about voting off Emilia/WWA yesterday because both didn’t really do much of anything to impact the game state on Day 1. Though I have to ask - why is she so confident that there must be a wolf in this pair of three?</li>
</ul>

<p>there’s probably exactly one wolf in the pool of windwardaway/will/emilia. i don’t think that will/emilia are ever partnered, so a world where that pool of 3 names contains 2+ wolves (like some have suggested, iirc?) is a world where windwardaway has to be a wolf. i would probably resolve in that pool today</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>And finally one final observation I noticed was that she was pretty eager to engage with and solve Ghana/will on Saturday night, hence why she realtimed with both of them a fair amount. But the intriguing thing I noticed (and it’s something that kinda lined up with how curt she’s been wrt her reads) is that after trying to sort them on Saturday night, she logs onto EoD and then mainly focuses on the players that she <em>hadn’t</em> real-timed with - Emilia and Windward. She also never really puts out her read on will or Ghana after she real timed with them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So in the end… I’m not sure if SPF is scum or not (I would not know where to begin looking for that if that is the case), but I think she is definitely playing different from I think the game I saw in ROCKS, where IIRC she was extremely collaborative and she worked pretty hard to sort Hally and work with her in that game. She also I think tried to work with Visor in ROCKS as well, and in this game, I feel like… we’re all kinda specimens to her, where like she’s asking questions TO us and interacting WITH us, but not exactly working/solving WITH us, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think the big thing I need to ask myself is - does she defend Vulgard in that specific, nuanced way she did if she’s a wolf? I think that if she randed W in this game it would be pretty easy for her to display TMI and have more of a… clear-cut, black-and-white approach to Vulg. But her read on him here was pretty fleshy and she gave him a lot of slack - and it kinda lined up with what she explained about the Syndicate game.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/alice.html">@Alice</a> - if you think SPF is wolfing, then what are the types of things you would normally look for wrt her wolf game compared to her town game? I know this is more meta talk you hate, but I’m finding it challenging to read her without a clear baseline (or more accurately my baseline being a game from much earlier this year).</p>

          <p>Hmmm, not too sure, although she doesn’t look too scummy. While her playing has been a bit subpar so far, she’s explained why it has been subpar so I’m willing to overlook that for the time being but I can see a world where wolves try to take advantage of her being subpar to push her, so the fact that there’s been a lot of people pushing her as a wolf has me townleaning h ed r at the moment. Part of that might be me wanting her to be town though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>General summation of spf’s posts/stances from yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing I was noticing is that she was mostly trying to keep Chloe at kind of an arm’s length throughout most of her posts, which makes me think that if she’s a wolf then it would be really weird to kill that slot since she had a couple of posts (112, 342, 343, 887) where it looks to me that she was setting up herself to push the Chloe slot once Vulg flipped v. She said that she’d work with her but I didn’t really get a sense of that reading her D1 ISO? She was mostly asking questions TO me/chloe rather than… real-timing with either of us to get better reads on us or other players ITT.</li>
</ul>
<p>spf, is there a reason why you were keeping most of the thread at arm’s length yesterday? I do notice that you were trying to play the game in a certain way but then decided later on to treat it like chat mafia (which is IMO the correct way to play mafia in FOL) but IIRC you were more collaborative in the ROCKS mafia game and I feel like you’ve been playing intentionally curt.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pretty consistent about having the towncore of Alice, Leafia, Arctic. I like her reasons for townreading all of them (towncoring Alice because her reads/process aren’t as outwardly/intrinsically villagery, Leafia because of how she treated Chloe at SoD, and Arctic because of his enjoyment being ITT and his high depth/nuance with his reads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also the big thing that I noticed her doing throughout most of Day 1 was that she wasn’t really defending Vulgard, but she was talking about other people’s reads on him in a way where she encouraged them to consider possible worlds where Vulgard would be a villager playing poorly (which is what he actually was) as opposed to what their current reads on him were. (418, 734, 879, 899, 1008, 1618, 1622, 1783).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also one thing that I looked at over night that made me immediately feel bad about mislunching Vulgard was that I looked at one of his <a href="https://www.mafiathesyndicate.com/viewtopic.php?p=819565#p819565" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">postgame comments</a> in the Syndicate game that spf linked that was run that had a bunch of MUers in it (the Cognitive Psychology game) and I really wished I looked at that post on Day 1 because I would have probably shifted my read on Vulg. He talked a lot about his thought process when randing W in a strong playerlist like he did in that game and how demotivated he got when he didn’t see that town jailkeeper sunbae’s jail on him trumped his roleblock on him.</p>
<p>So honestly I can see where spf is coming from because she was in this game with Vulg, and saw how serious/intense he was about playing the wolf alignment in that game. So seeing him just kinda flop around here when she knew that Vulg was able to play a (I think?) much better, more serious game than what he showed here makes sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>She was pretty consistent about voting off Emilia/WWA yesterday because both didn’t really do much of anything to impact the game state on Day 1. Though I have to ask - why is she so confident that there must be a wolf in this pair of three?</li>
</ul>

<p>there’s probably exactly one wolf in the pool of windwardaway/will/emilia. i don’t think that will/emilia are ever partnered, so a world where that pool of 3 names contains 2+ wolves (like some have suggested, iirc?) is a world where windwardaway has to be a wolf. i would probably resolve in that pool today</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>And finally one final observation I noticed was that she was pretty eager to engage with and solve Ghana/will on Saturday night, hence why she realtimed with both of them a fair amount. But the intriguing thing I noticed (and it’s something that kinda lined up with how curt she’s been wrt her reads) is that after trying to sort them on Saturday night, she logs onto EoD and then mainly focuses on the players that she <em>hadn’t</em> real-timed with - Emilia and Windward. She also never really puts out her read on will or Ghana after she real timed with them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So in the end… I’m not sure if SPF is scum or not (I would not know where to begin looking for that if that is the case), but I think she is definitely playing different from I think the game I saw in ROCKS, where IIRC she was extremely collaborative and she worked pretty hard to sort Hally and work with her in that game. She also I think tried to work with Visor in ROCKS as well, and in this game, I feel like… we’re all kinda specimens to her, where like she’s asking questions TO us and interacting WITH us, but not exactly working/solving WITH us, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think the big thing I need to ask myself is - does she defend Vulgard in that specific, nuanced way she did if she’s a wolf? I think that if she randed W in this game it would be pretty easy for her to display TMI and have more of a… clear-cut, black-and-white approach to Vulg. But her read on him here was pretty fleshy and she gave him a lot of slack - and it kinda lined up with what she explained about the Syndicate game.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/alice.html">@Alice</a> - if you think SPF is wolfing, then what are the types of things you would normally look for wrt her wolf game compared to her town game? I know this is more meta talk you hate, but I’m finding it challenging to read her without a clear baseline (or more accurately my baseline being a game from much earlier this year).</p>

<p>oh thats a big post</p>
<p>I agree with your townread or wolfread on them(depending on your conclusion)</p>

<p>I’ve never villaged <strong>against</strong> SPF, tho I have wolfed against her. She’s basically known to be the best player as either alignment from EpicMafia, so I basically have her at a pretty high standard to clear.</p>
<p>Like, I’m basically just reading her how I generally read other elite wolves where I see how they interact with the gamestate as that’s the most accurate way that I read them. So far I feel that SPF falls a bit flat in this department as I’ve been agreeing with her takes a lot and she has had a fairly broad view on the game-state, but so far it doesn’t really feel like she’s making many waves as I’d expect her to?</p>

<p>A) The NK was more likely than not a PR hunt so the wolves prolly thought that Chloe/GGhana were informed that the other one was a PR from their play d1.</p>

<ol>
<li>If it was a PR hunt in a world with GGhana and Will both as villagers, it’s almost certain that one of them would’ve died seeing as how certain GGhana sounded about Will being town. He was all but claiming that him and Will were the town PRs and Chloe showed no signs of being a PR.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll concede on the other points as I think they have at least some merit even if I don’t agree with your GGhana read.</p>
