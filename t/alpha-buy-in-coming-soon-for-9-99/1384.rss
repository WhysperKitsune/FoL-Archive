    <description>Coming Soon. Teaser:

**¿What about PayPal?**
At first (while we manually hand out keys), **yes -** PayPal will be accepted. 

Later, we will temporarily remove PayPal (once we have auto-distributed keys ready with our card system).

Later later, PayPal will return once we also have that setup with our key-distribution system.

**What about at release?**

Steam is awesome, however the developers save money when purchased a Steam key _from our site_ instead of Steam: This means that, currently, the &quot;bonus&quot; for purchasing from our site is Alpha/Beta access. Upon release, the bonus will likely be switched to some extra gp if purchased from our site instead of Steam.</description>
