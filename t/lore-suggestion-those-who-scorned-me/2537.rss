    <title>[Lore Suggestion] Those Who Scorned Me</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-those-who-scorned-me/2537</link>
    <description>This is my first attempt at lore so go easy on me :wink:

The names of those who scorned me are etched into my mind. I will not forget them. I will see Passel Adams, Ivo Atlee and Alice Yonge all executed before the court, if it’s the last thing I do. I must be careful, as I no longer find myself an ally of the Blue Dragon. They say that my actions were unwarranted, but they don’t know what it’s like in my position, being rejected by all those I once thought were my allies. So I must be precise, so that I may see the three fall before the court, before I am likely taken with them.</description>
