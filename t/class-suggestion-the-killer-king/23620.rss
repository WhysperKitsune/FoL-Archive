    <title>Class suggestion: The killer king</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-killer-king/23620</link>
    <description>**Passive:** immune to death at night

**Night ability**: disguise killer, killing one player while pretending to follow another (infinite).
**Night ability:** Kill a player, while sending guards to another player.(4 uses)

**Day ability:** The same as the starting king

**Idea:** 
Every natural killer will become a killer king if they are voted as king.
A killer king will be the starting king 1/16 of the games, as any other players.</description>
