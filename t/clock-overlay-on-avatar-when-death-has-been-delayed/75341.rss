    <title>Clock overlay on Avatar when death has been delayed</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/clock-overlay-on-avatar-when-death-has-been-delayed/75341</link>
    <description>Similar to the bleeding overlay (blood drops) on your picture when you are bleeding, I would like to have a clock or something whenever your death has been delayed.

This is because I often confuse the feedback for getting healed with getting delayed, and I have seen other players mistaken about this too.  I guess what happens is we just see the red &quot;you were attacked&quot; and green &quot;you were healed/delayed&quot; message without really reading them and misunderstand them, but a clock icon on your picture would remind you that you were delayed and not healed.</description>

<p>The colors for heals and delays should also be different.  Maybe dark green for one and light green for another</p>
