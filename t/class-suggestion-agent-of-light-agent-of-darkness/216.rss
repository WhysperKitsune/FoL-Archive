    <description>Agent of Light (Blue Dragon Offensive) 

Converted class:Agent of Darkness

Passive Ability 1:
Protection of Light(Passive) You are under the protection of Light. No member of another faction may convert, occupy or kill you at night unless you are under the Curse of Distrust. This does not include poison, bleeding and public execution.
Passive Ability 2:
Curse of Distrust(Passive) If anyone used an offensive, converting or killing action on you then the Curse of Distrust will be activated for the next day and night.

Day Ability 2:
Curse of Light(unlimited Uses): Any ability of an enemy targeting you tonight that is thwarted by Protection of Light after Night 1 gets a cumulative cooldown of two days, permanently.


Day Ability 1:

Power of Light(1 use):Instantly deactivate Curse of Distrust and be conversion immune for the next two days and nights. The Curse of Light expands to all abilities targeting you this day and night, even if they are sucessful.



Lore:
sorry, nothing yet

Comments:
Conversion role(no matter the converting faction, this is the convert):
Agent of Darkness(Unseen Killer/Cult Killer/whatever Killer)
Day Ability 1 :Presence of Darkness(Unlimited Uses):Your presence will be noticed publicly every day. This is used automatically at the end of the day, if possible.
Day Ability 2: Hiding Darkness(1 Use) Your presence will be concealed today. Cannot be used the day after conversion.
Passive 1:Blessing of Darkness: The cooldown of all Night abilities of your faction is removed.
Passive Ability:No demotions:You will not replace anyone(Mastermind, Assassin, Cult Leader)
Night Ability:Unlimited Uses:Deadly Darkness: Kill target enemy, ignoring Occupation(not redirection!), healing and immunities.

Comment: This role needs to be disposed off very very quickly. Its continued presence is a death gurantee for every other faction. The Blue Dragon should avoid this from happening at nearly all costs.</description>

<p>Just like the Fool has to trick others into executing for treason…<br>
the Agent of Light has to trick enemies into visiting. Preferrably when under protection. Besides, a lot of roles are useless- or worse, harmful to the own team-  if they pick the wrong targets or strategy.</p>

<p>Well, that can be changed, no? I know that the Mastermind usually doesn’t get replaced. And it shouldn’t, usually. But if you really allow that role to replace the Mastermind, you do something seriously wrong.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Try to prove that you are the Agent of Light… And if you do investigate the Agent of Light, you may be responsible for a really horrible role spawning. Keep in mind that only offensive and investigative actions trigger this.<br>
And you can still die to Nightshade(assassin’s poison ability).<br>
On the other hand, if you are not weakened and do use Power of Light when the assassin poisons you, they will have a problem.<br>
Trying to convert this role is highly dangerous, but if you manage to do it, then you spawn a role that is the nightmare of all Blue Dragon players.<br>
Trying to convert that role Night 1 will not punish you in excess.</p>
