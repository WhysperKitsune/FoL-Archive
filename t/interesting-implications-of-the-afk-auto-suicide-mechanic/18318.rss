    <title>Interesting implications of the AFK auto suicide mechanic</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/interesting-implications-of-the-afk-auto-suicide-mechanic/18318</link>
    <description>The AFK auto suicide mechanic is normally just a way to get inactive players removed so that they stop wasting investigative resources and can be replaced in the case of cult leader, assassin and king. But in some cases, it can be more beneficial to your team to disconnect on purpose.

For example, in one game I had, the mastermind was caught on day 3, but we decided not to execute him so that he would not be replaced. His answer to this was to immediately disconnect. This caused him to automatically die on n3, which was within the time limit that would allow him to be replaced.

Another time this tactic could be helpful is when you are cult leader and are getting occupied/jailed/redirected repeatedly for the purpose of preventing conversions. This will allow another cult member to become cult leader and break the infinite lock.

Should such a strategy as this be allowed, or should it be report-worthy? It feels unintuitive that the only way to help your team in certain situations is to take an action that is outside of normal gameplay (by quitting), and it also feels pretty scummy to have this trick used against you.

There isn&#39;t really a clean way to fix this. Adding a suicide button would make it more of an intended gameplay mechanic, but it would also likely be abused. Preventing mastermind from being replaced if original disconnects could fix some scenarios, but doesn&#39;t help when the mastermind disconnects accidentally day 1 and the unseen are almost guaranteed failure.</description>

            <p>I don’t think that would be good for the health of the game.</p>

<p>If Prince dies n1 then you have 3-4 people suicide to get a new queue.</p>
