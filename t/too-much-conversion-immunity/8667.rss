    <title>Too much conversion immunity?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/too-much-conversion-immunity/8667</link>
    <description>Prince and Priest in every game, both immune.
King is immune
Alchs, Fools and Neut killers are immune.
Rez&#39;d people are immune.

That&#39;s like 6-8 immune people every game.  When you get cult you just get &quot;immune&quot; over and over until everyone is immune and then you generally lose the game when they just rez a Paladin and go down the line.

Not sure I&#39;ve seen Cult win without an Evil King since Priest was made conversion immune and added to every game.  Even with an Evil King they typically lose.</description>

            <p>Guaranteed Priest pretty badly screws over the Neutral Killers as well, I’ll agree.</p>
<p>Possessor can’t jump until the Priest is dead.  And the Priest typically lives a REALLY long time.</p>
<p>Game felt better when Priest wasn’t guaranteed and wasn’t convert immune.  Sure first round random Prince kill sucked, maybe give him immunity early on or something.  Or have the Priest be convertible again, so if Prince dies early, you can rez him, but then you aren’t an unstoppable dead speaking bulwark afterwards.</p>
<p>Almost every game the evil faction loses because it’s down to like one dude and a pile of unconvertible BDs and Neutrals.  Then they typically rez a Paladin/Sheriff and just go down the line and there isn’t much you can do about it.  Most evil wins anymore rely on BD completely dropping the ball with a terrible King/Prince ruining everything.</p>

            <p>They need to revert everything back to before the first priest patch and just fix soulcatcher. The game was great up until then. Take the cult leader bleeds away. Give assassin back just 2 nightshade. Priest not guaranteed and convertible. The true problem is soulcatcher. It spawned all of this new mess we dislike. Also buff neutrals so it isn’t kill all neuts or neuts out. To help the reaper and possessor there needs to be 1 or two neutral special/invest class and killer/off class. Riggt now reaper and possessor have to claim butler drink knight or princess to not be called out. They are all BD…see the problem.</p>

            <p>also does bring up the question of a scorned that already won… With alc, it isn’t when they are converted they are screwed, but before they are converted, with the new bleed updates, BD just barely tollerates their existance some of the time, When you throw in that they could be turned into a guaranteed against them role even if they started pro BD, it does become much more of a question on keeping them alive.</p>

            <p>Well yes that’s understood to be the key goal. and yeah throwing around poisons/bleeds to try and pull phys’s off etc… is always helpful, but it’s a crapshoot, and we’re drifting off topic from the issue we were origionally talking about, which is that the quantity of unconvertables is making keeping the faction alive long enough to do so, significantly more luck based, as the people you are able to succesfully kill before then, are quite likely not to be the key unconvertable BD roles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should be looking to kill people who are not convertible usually</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You should be, but they are usually also the hardest to kill</p>
<p>Priest - 1 time immunity, likely to be guarded once out<br>
King - unconvertable, has guards and likely to be guarded, and uncertain if he is an enemy<br>
Alc, has 3 stoneskins<br>
Scorned unconvertable, and immune<br>
Fool - unconvertable, though you are hoping he gets executed<br>
Prince - Absolutely going to be guarded if any BD can or kings guards<br>
Revived - also likely to be guarded.<br>
Reaper/possesor - immune<br>
That’s of course also completely ignoring the CW possibly blocking conversions.</p>
<p>Yes it’s still worth it to take the shot after you hit an immune in case it’s the priest or prince, though 4/5 times you just waste a kill bouncing off the reaper/scorned or alc.</p>

            <p>I think it’s balanced. You say too many people conversion immune, but there are also posts about how executing an unseen is an awful idea before you find all 3 because MM can now just convert somebody else. The amount of conversion immunity makes it so you can execute unseen on the spot. Sometimes you see games where mm chooses the wrong people and only 2-3 total unseen all game. Some games mm chooses right and there are 5-6 total unseen all game. So I do think it’s balanced.</p>

            <p>Assasain ain’t a big loss for Unseen at all. It’s an inconvenience sure, but something that’s likely to be corrected by n4, unless of course the unseen has really bad luck with conversion targets.</p>
<p>Assassin is replaceable, cult leader is replaceable, They all can be replaced unless BD has a really lucky followup with the prince or someone catching the second one. Heck even Mastermind is replaceable for the first 3 days.</p>
<p>It’s really only a dealbreaker when the unseen or cult hit an unlucky string of conversion attempts, which I agree is a real problem, almost 1/3rd of the layout is unconvertable right now, and mostly the unconvertables are the ones that stay alive longer which means that gets worse the more that die.</p>

            <p>Maybe a better solution to the issue, could be to make more of the neuts convertable? Obviously not the assasain, but fool or scorned would certainly be plausible to have evil versions. I would say alc, but they just added a reason for BD not to kill alcs on sight, adding in that vulnerability may or may not be a good idea.</p>

            <p>The priest being convert immune is to help bring back a turn 1 prince death which 90% of time was a bd loss.<br>
As suggested you should not be depending on luck to find convert targets , Convert people when they say they are something convertible.<br>
Have a decent story and pressure people for roles so you know where you are going .</p>

            <p>Realistically if you find yourself getting Immune once or twice you should then use your class check in order to check someone instead of straight up trying to convert them? I think anyway.</p>
<p>I agree it is harder for Cult/Unseen to win with the amount of immunes there are guaranteed now but that’s the fun of the game, to figure out how to pull it off.</p>
<p>Reaper has 15 targets essentially so it’s definitely harder for them.</p>

            <p>Balance. Game is swingy if Priest is converted night one, and Prince dies night one.</p>

            <p>Also if there are ANY player’s with confirmed non immune BD roles, go after them. IE there are 8 people still alive. I’m mm. One person is confirmed physician. Nobody else is outed yet. My assassin wanted to kill the phys so he couldn’t heal anybody. I told him to kill somebody else, that phys is the only person I know I can convert. I’d rather the assassination failed than the convert. Other than that, it’s luck. Princess, sheriff, observer are usually the easiest to pick out. As they whisper the most to king and are quickest to out themselves when they find somebody sus.</p>

            <p>Lost a game as Unseen, first 5 converts were immune.</p>
<p>Assassin got Sheriff’d first night.  14 players so no neut killers, there were like 4 people I could convert in the game plus they had a Court Wizard.  Way too much immunity.</p>

            <p>Prince and Priest in every game, both immune.<br>
King is immune<br>
Alchs, Fools and Neut killers are immune.<br>
Rez’d people are immune.</p>
<p>That’s like 6-8 immune people every game.  When you get cult you just get “immune” over and over until everyone is immune and then you generally lose the game when they just rez a Paladin and go down the line.</p>
<p>Not sure I’ve seen Cult win without an Evil King since Priest was made conversion immune and added to every game.  Even with an Evil King they typically lose.</p>
