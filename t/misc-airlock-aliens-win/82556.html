<h1>Welcome to Airlock!</h1>

<p>I believe this game plays anywhere between 9 and 15 players or something. The best way I can describe it is Clocktower in Space with some other elements as well.</p>

Passengers (Aligned with the Ship):</summary>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>Passengers</strong></font> (Aligned with the <font color="blue"><strong>Ship</strong></font>):</p>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>Guard</strong></font> (Difficulty Class on a D6 Murder Attempt: 3)<br>
<strong>Warp Ability 1</strong>: Select a player to protect them from all killing, offensive, alien-oriented converting, and harmful effects for this warp phase.</p>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>Stowaway</strong></font> (Difficulty Class on a D6 Murder Attempt: 4)<br>
<strong>Passive 1</strong> : If any living player that is not the VIP (yes, anyone, this passive applies to all players, not just yourself) claims to be the Stowaway, they will be airlocked immediately. If any dead player that is not the VIP claims to be the stowaway, a living player of the host’s choice that shares alignment with that player will be airlocked immediately. This passive applies fully, both in public chat and within all whispers. This passive will always be in-play, even if the Stowaway is not in the game. This means that this role, if it’s in the game, is just a nerfed VT that must lie about their class if they ever choose to claim. This passive can override itself if used later by multiple players the same day (will always go with the latest). This passive will also activate if anyone attempts to communicate that they are claiming stowaway in some sort of obvious way that the hosts can detect, such as “I am not the stowaway" or something. This will also happen if the Quartermaster sees the Stowaway via their ability and chooses to reveal that (The quartermaster would be considered the stowaway-claimer in that case), or other similar events. Basically, discussion of the Stowaway role should usually be avoided. Generally, you should avoid trying to claim stowaway via any means, layerally protected or otherwise. Think of it as somewhat like Madness from BotF 2, except it doesn’t really matter what you claim; just not stowaway. This passive has Airlock Priority Level Two. If it activates, it must trump the standard airlock process (which has Airlock Priority Level Three) for the day, but it will not trump the Pet’s Passive 3 (which has Airlock Priority Level One) if that also occurs the same day.</p>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>Hybrid</strong></font> (Difficulty Class on a D6 Murder Attempt: 4)<br>
<strong>Passive 1</strong>: You will be informed if you ever have at least one living alien neighbor.<br>
<strong>Passive 2</strong>: You might register as one of the alien roles to investigative abilities.</p>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>VIP</strong></font> (Difficulty Class on a D6 Murder Attempt: 6)<br>
<strong>Passive 1</strong>: If you die, and are not revived by the next possible End of Day after you die (you have a full warp and day if you die via airlock, otherwise less than that), the Aliens win.<br>
<strong>Passive 2</strong>: If the VIP is in the game, the Guard must also be in-play.</p>
<p><font color="#CD00FF"><strong>Pet</strong></font> (Difficulty Class on a D6 Murder Attempt: 2)<br>
<strong>Passive 1</strong>: You will know how many of your living neighbors are aliens at all times while alive.<br>
<strong>Passive 2</strong>: You cannot die via any method besides airlock.<br>
<strong>Passive 3</strong>: You may only communicate via text-less, number-less emojis and text-less, number-less images, videos, MP3’s, GIF’s, and symbols. You may not speak, use any text, numbers, or characters from any language. Videos and MP3’s can only be used in which there is no transcribable speech or song in the video, in any language. Same goes for GIF’s and lip-reading. Note by “character” I mean any alphabetic character or numeral that exists in any language. If you ever defy this, you will be airlocked immediately. If this passive activates while you are already dead, a living player of the host’s choice that shares your alignment will be airlocked instead. All of these rules apply fully within whispers, as well.</p>
<p>There are a few necessitated exceptions to the above rule to make the game run properly. They are, however, the only exceptions, and they are as follows. Note that you must use the syntax below exactly to eliminate any chance of triggering this passive, and that such syntax must be the only contents of the post in which it is within. I recommend copy pasting and replacing the word <code>username</code> when applicable:</p>
<p>You may propose whispers with players that are not your neighbors based on seating order via the following syntax. If you send a whisper request, you may send requests to others but may not send another request to the same person until they either accept or deny your original request:<br>
<code>**/whisper @username**</code></p>
<p>You may accept whisper requests from other players that are not your neighbor based on seating arrangement have sent to you via the following syntax. Note that you can only use this as a reply message to a whisper request to you. Also, if a neighbor sends you a whisper request, you must ignore that request, of course. Make sure your post is a reply message to the whisper request to you based on Discourse’s UI:<br>
<code>**/accept**</code><br>
or<br>
<code>**/deny**</code></p>
<p>You may never vote for warp or for airlock, but while you are alive, you may nominate any living player that has yet to be nominated that day for airlock up to once per day, using the following syntax:<br>
<code>**/nominate @username**</code></p>
<p>You may nominate a user for the captainship with the following syntax:<br>
<code>**/nominate @Username for Captain**</code></p>
<p>You may attempt to murder someone with the following syntax, so long as you as a player (not role-related) have yet to attempt to murder anyone, you are alive while making the attempt, and the individual you want to shoot is also alive:<br>
<code>**/shoot @username**</code></p>
<p>There is one more thing: The best way to be able to communicate understandable information with this class is probably via use of Ciphers. If you would like to use ciphers, please keep in mind the following rules, of which if any of them are broken, you will also trigger this passive:</p>
<ol>
<li>All other aspects of this passive also apply to ciphers at all times.</li>
<li>All the ciphers that you use must be created by you. You may not use any already existent ciphers, well-known or not (so morse code is obviously banned, for instance). It is recommended to spend a few minutes searching to ensure that you have not created an identical cipher to one that already exists.</li>
<li>Each cipher that you create may only be used in a maximum of five posts each.</li>
</ol>
<p>This passive has Airlock Priority Level One. If it activates, it must trump both the standard airlock process (which has Airlock Priority Level Three) and the the Stowaway’s Passive 1 (which has Airlock Priority Level Two) for the day.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this passive never applies within your classcard, so if you would like to walk us through any thought processes, cipher creation methodologies (if you choose to make and use any ciphers), and/or argue as to whether you have broken PR or not (if there’s a grey area, we will hear your side of the story within your classcard before making a determination), feel free to do so.<br>
<strong>Passive 4</strong>: All of your votes will be ignored and not count. This passive remains postmortem.<br>
<strong>Passive 5</strong>: You will register as some alien class and as alien alignment to all investigative checks.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a murder attempt might also change if you are targeted by the transporter chief, if the role whose abilities you have now has a different D6 Murder Attempt DC than the one whose abilities you had before.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is the information about how the game ends:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Win Conditions Information:</summary>
<p>Each team has two standard wincons.<br>
<strong>Ship Wincon 1:</strong> Ensure both all alien roles and all alien-aligned players are dead before reaching the secret destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 1:</strong> Ensure that all ship-aligned players possessing ship roles are dead before reaching the secret destination.</p>
<p>If neither of these win conditions are met before reaching the secret destination, but there are still players alive when arriving at the secret destination, then these other two wincons come into play.<br>
<strong>Ship Wincon 2:</strong> Ensure that all roles with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/biohazard.png!v=9" title=":biohazard:" class="emoji" alt=":biohazard:"> passive and all players with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/radioactive.png!v=9" title=":radioactive:" class="emoji" alt=":radioactive:"> passive are dead when you reach the secret destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 2:</strong> Ensure that there is at least one role with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/biohazard.png!v=9" title=":biohazard:" class="emoji" alt=":biohazard:"> passive and/or at least one player with the <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/radioactive.png!v=9" title=":radioactive:" class="emoji" alt=":radioactive:"> passive still alive when you reach the secret destination.</p>
<p>The Aliens also have a third wincon, which can come into play if no other wincon is satisfied, before arriving at the Secret Destination.<br>
<strong>Alien Wincon 3:</strong> If the VIP is in-game, they die, and are not revived by the next possible End of Day after they die (they have a full warp and day if they die via airlock, otherwise less than that), you win.</p>
<p>If it somehow ends up the case that everyone is dead before reaching the secret destination and without satisfying the Ship Wincon 1, Alien Wincon 1, or Alien Wincon 3 first, that is canonically undefined; I currently have it set as a draw, but that might be changed depending on balance purposes.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is some additional rules stuff for added clarity in addition to the rules PDF:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional Rules Info</summary>
<p>You can attempt to murder someone while alive once per game. Your attack will trigger a D6 that will determine whether or not they die.</p>
<p><strong>Day actions are processed as soon as hosts can process them during the day. Canonically, they usually work like going to speak to the host and computer privately. Warp actions, meanwhile, are processed at the end of the warp phase.</strong> Also, all cop effects detect alien roles, not alien alignment, except when specified otherwise.</p>
<p>Each day will have a timer that players have until the ship is attacked.  If players do not progress to airlock before the ship is attacked, someone will die and the day will continue with a new timer that could cause a second attack on the same day, and so on. To progress to warp phase, a majority of all living players, rounded up, need to be voting for the warp phase to hammer that.</p>
<p><strong>Captain Mechanic: Living players may nominate others (including dead players) to be the captain at any time. For someone to become captain, they need to half half of living players rounded up voting for them, post-nomination. The captain has their voting power doubled. If a captain is elected, they will remain captain until someone else is nominated and receives the necessary votes down the line. Dead players cannot vote for the captain.</strong></p>
<p>When players die, they lose all their abilities (except in rare cases when specified otherwise), may no longer nominate players for airlock, may no longer use their shot if they haven’t yet, get one each of two different kind of dead votes: One for airlock and one for warp. Note that you may only have one of each of these for the entire game. I.e. if you were dead, come back to life, and then die again, you do not get a second one of either. The same principle applies to your shot; i.e. if you were alive, died, and then alive again, you can only ever attempt one shot for the game. All of these resources are always tied to the player, never seat or role, and thus cannot be transferred by the Transporter Chief or anyone else. <strong>Airlock voting will be using the BotF vote locking system. For airlock voting, the end of the sequence for the locking system will be the nominee. For warp voting, there is no locking system and is just majority, of which ghost warp votes may also contribute to. Also, no warp votes may be cast for the first 12 hours of each day. Please remember this.</strong></p>
<p>At the start of every warp phase, every player that has abilities in the Warp Phase will be notified that they have woken up and can act that night, except for anyone who was targeted by the Galley Officer, Ensign, or Contaminator on the previous Day phase, who will instead be informed at the start of the warp phase that they have not woken up and will not be able to act that night. Players who do not have any abilities to use in the Warp phase will not be told this sort of information, however.</p>
<p>Only starting members of the alien team know their teammates for sure. Converted people will essentially be lost wolves. There is an alien leader who will get three bluffs. The alien leader must be either the Queen, Predator, Ambassador, or Sympathizer.</p>
<p>Like BotF, this game will also have a set seating arrangements and the same whisper rules as BotF (where you can whisper neighbors for free). Everyone will be informed if anyone’s seating arrangement changes, like due to the Transporter Chief or something.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether the proprietary A.I. used for the official version of this game randomizes everything or makes choices. To reduce swing, everything in this game except for randing which role goes to whom (choosing roles is host decided) and D6 murder attempts will be chosen by the hosts what will happen when there is any ability or action in the grey area, just like clocktower.</p>
</details>
<p>Here is some information on mechanical information that players will not be privy to that they might otherwise be in other games such as Clocktower:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Mechanical information players won't be privy to:</summary>
<p>Some of the mechanical information that players will not be privy to will be game composition (in terms of roles or alignments), how the starting distance to the secret destination and current day’s attack timer were determined, the night priority sequence in terms of which roles act in what order, what you roll on murder attempts (those rolls will be made privately by the hosts and won’t be viewable by any players until the game ends), and possibly more.</p>
</details>
<p>The rest of the information can be found in the canonical PDF’s below, but anything that conflicts with information from above should be ignored. Also, <strong>contrary to the information in the rules PDF below, anyone who publicly sabotages the ship’s movement will NOT have their identity publicly revealed. I think I’ve gone as far as I can without making the game too mechlock-able in a longform, text-style game.</strong>:</p>

Currently, the only way this game is run officially is at large conventions across the U.S. using a proprietary A.I. software. The game is probably going to change more next year after they’ve hosted more, but this is the most current version as it was run at DeceptaCon back in mid-February of this year which I attended, and that probably was the last time it will be run before 2021 (Since all major conventions in the U.S. for the remainder of this year have pretty much been cancelled), meaning this will be the most current version of the game for a pretty long while. eevee’s in their discord, so contact him if you’d like to join that to speak with any non-me ppl there who’ve played this game officially.</p>
