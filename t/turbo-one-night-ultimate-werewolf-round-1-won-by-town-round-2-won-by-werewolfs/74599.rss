    <description># One night ultimate werewolf

Yes, I&#39;m bored.

### Mechanics:

There are two phases: The Night and The Day.
The Night will last for 5 minutes. The Day will last for 20 minutes.
During the Night nobody can post. All players may send me their  **Night Action** during this phase. After this phase, roles may be secretly swapped, so you may not even know who YOU are!
During the day players must attempt to figure out what happened during the Night. All players may vote during the day at any time. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the day will die.

* If a  **Villager**  dies, the  **Werewolves**  will win.
* If a  **Werewolf**  dies, the  **Villagers**  will win.
* If a  **Minion**  dies, the  **Werewolves**  will win.

Lynching nobody is an option.

* If nobody dies during the day and there are  **Werewolves**  alive, the  **Werewolves**  will win.
* If nobody dies during the day and there are no  **Werewolves**  alive, the  **Villagers**  will win.


## Setup will be published after we get enough sign ups (cause it depends on number of players).

### Players:
1. Fk
2. PS
3. NB
4. NP
5. BS
6. G


### Setup:
Robber, 
Troublemaker, 
Tanner, 
Minion,
Doppleganger, 
Mystic Wolf, 
Paranormal Investigator, 
Witch, 
Dream Wolf</description>
