    <title>A noble buy pointless gesture</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-noble-buy-pointless-gesture/10917</link>
    <description>SO as noble I have the ability to double vote to pardon or execute once a turn and twice a game 

So here are the scenarios where I can use this ability .

1)We have managed to get an unseen on trial . Ok  but because this has happened we likely already have a majority over unseen , so its not needed .

2)The unseen have got someone good on the stand because they have a majority .  I cunningly use my ability to stop them and the bd is saved . The Unseen then put up another random bd , or me , and hang me .

3) Someone nobody is sure about is on the stand , I can use my ability but I have no more info than anyone else , possibly less as I have no investigative ability of my own .

I just don&#39;t see the point in this . Has anyone got something I am missing ?</description>

            <p>I wasn’t saying the same abilities for noble and aristocrat are bad. I was just stating that.</p>
<p>And maybe insanely over powered was an exaggeration. But I do think late game noble/aristocrat is OP. Not saying that’s a bad thing, it’s actually good because it balances out him being useless in the beginning.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that early game it’s very boring to be noble. You have to wait till mid to late game to impact the game much. Provided you survive to that point.</p>

<p>4 evils execute, 3 BD pardon. With your ability, 4 pardons, and a tie in the vote gets a pardon.<br>
and then evil can’t get them back up because the king can’t sue royal finger again</p>

            <p>All the suggested things so far seem to be " in this very convoluted scenario you might possibly do something good . "<br>
The same abilities on a aristocrat have a lot more weight .<br>
You can pull of an execute on someone with a bit of stealth .</p>
<p>Not even sure , if I pardon using ability , can the unseen just put him straight up again and exe when I cant use the ability …</p>

            <p>you can counter act an evil king push, and then the king cannot put them back on the stand with royal finger.</p>
<p>example: unseen are able to just barely have majority thanks to royal finger, you put the BD of the stand and then no more royal finger</p>
<p>another example: your use of royal decree prevents the unseen from taking control of the court and executing prince before he kills one of them</p>
<p>another: your court order thing prevents unseen from mentally starting a band wagon (people less likely to be the first person to vote in a band wagon)</p>

            <p>I know this is why I particularly don’t like it , your putting extra power to a player that has less information , this ability is only as good as the player that gets it , if the noble is the one getting sucked in then it causes twice as much grief , if the noble saves a bd with this because he is more switched on the unseen will just shout aristocrat and hang the noble instead .</p>
<p>There’s very little social skill involved with the social class .</p>

            <p>It’s mostly about overcoming trickery, and betting on your instincts over your teams instincts. When it’s 4BD vs 3 unseen, and you are 80% sure the unseen just tricked someone, that’s your time to save your teammate and convince the others of who you think is really evil.</p>
