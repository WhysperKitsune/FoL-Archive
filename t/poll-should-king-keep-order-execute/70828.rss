            <p>Uh…</p>
<p>That’s the purpose of attacking the king N1…to get rid of a powerful ability…</p>

            <p>I like that more but I think it would be even better if King had no support abilities, and was simply so powerful with his social or voting abilities that a clever King would be considered worth protecting.</p>

            <p>He should be reworked as a social/support class. We tried an investigative King with Allies and it caused the court to become too reliant on the King for leads.</p>
<p>FoL’s King has supportive night abilities and social day abilities is typically agreed to be an extremely balanced and effective version of the King.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see King reworked into more of an investigative or special class rather than a killer.</p>
<p>The thing that sucks about the current system is your faction is really held back if your king dcs or goes afk on n1.</p>

            <p>I think instead of a poll we should vote and say why we voted that. I’ll start.</p>
<p>King doesn’t need a killing power. Possessor SHOULD be able to out run it. King should instead have more power during the day instead of night. Like night abilities that affect day.</p>
<p>Give me one good reason why king even needs OE</p>
