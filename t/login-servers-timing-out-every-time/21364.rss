    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/login-servers-timing-out-every-time/21364</link>
    <description>Hi. Just purchased and installed the game.

Every time I load it up, it tries to bring up the login servers but comes up with Login Servers timed out&#39; every time. Switched off firewall as suggested but still no change. First time I&#39;ve ever had such an issue with any game.</description>

            <p>This sounds weird but I have identified a way to get on consistently.</p>
<p>If loading Steam is the first thing I do, I can log into ToL no problem.</p>
<p>If I use my browser or another game with an online component first, no dice.</p>
<p>I just have to work around that, I guess.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice given. Good to finally be able to play.</p>

            <p>Well, how about it…tinkered with a few settings and now it works.</p>
<p>And then installing the patch that was required a few mins ago made it not work…</p>
<p>I am confused…</p>

<p>This sounds VERY similar to the problem you’re having with us.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75b59a5471315e55f76ab659648ce9d10a297a18.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gNiWFNdlHiseze0mvhjRNC6RyMU" width="475" height="63"></p>
<p>Seems that your network is unable to connect securely.</p>
<p>You may, instead, want to do a full antivirus scan + malware scan (malware bytes or spybot search &amp; destroy software choices). Our API is secure (https), yet your PC for whatever reason is trying to connect via HTTP (not secure). Best guess is that you have a virus, malware, or root kit trying to steal your passwords or something.</p>
<p>It’s VERY unusual to have an SSL (https) connect error (it’s a generic error) – try Googling it a bit to see what I mean. This would probably fix your Discord issue too. They also use secure connections (https/SSL/TLS)</p>
<p>To be honest, I’d reinstall Windows, if you know how.</p>

            <p>Hello there, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>At home. Own network.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Discord never works for me. It could try for forever and a day to try and login/connect to a server but never does. While every single other voice comm program does work for me (Teamspeak, default ones in BattleNet, Steam, etc.). No idea why. So I can’t use that. I did ask Discord for help but they were unable to figure out the cause.</p>
<p>I did have internet security running the first time. I disabled it but every attempt after that didn’t result in any change.</p>
<p>v1.0.10h1 at the bottom right corner during login.</p>

            <p>Hi there, since this isn’t a known issue for others at the login screen,  it seems that your network is blocking something. It may not be an operating system firewall issue, but maybe see type of network firewall on your router (are you on a campus or using a shares network?).</p>
<p>Have any internet security software or anti virus? Try disabling just temporarily to see if it’s the cause.</p>
<p>Can you please post your logs? If you open up the ToL install directory, search for output_log and drop that here or on Discord @ <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a></p>
<p>Sorry you’re experiencing this <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> but since others don’t experience this, it’s most likely a personal network issue so we’ll need logs to continue ~</p>
