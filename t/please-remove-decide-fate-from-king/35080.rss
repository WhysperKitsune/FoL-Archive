    <description>This ability is way too strong for evil kings as they can force killing prince/hunter, or pardon MM and win the game when everyone know who the unseen, bd have majority but can&#39;t do anything.

Evil king win rate should not be that high, and this ability only help evil king.</description>

            <p>Agreed agreed agreed! It’s an entirely appropriate power for the King and can only be used once, so the King must time it correctly. Stopping vote for classes on its own is a valid reason to keep Decide Fate in the game.</p>

            <p>I think plex was also being double sarcastic, but in case he wasn’t, I was being sarcastic when I said kings had no power. Kings had the ability to make people call them your royal highness. Perhaps an ability could make anyone who wanted to accuse the king have to first say “I am sorry your royal highness, but I think you may be evil!”  2 uses, can help stall for time</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The king is <span class="bbcode-i">supposed</span> to be strong.  That’s the whole purpose of all the stuff around deciding who the king is!</p>
<p>Allies are a problem because they’re strong in a way that can easily wreck games early on.  But Decide Fate is working exactly as intended, and if it’s causing problems for you you need to be more aggressive about removing opposing kings and getting your faction on the throne.</p>
<p>(Also, the evil king’s high winrate is almost certainly because of Allies being overpowered rather than Decide Fate - it’s very rare to see an evil king decide the game with Decide Fate, whereas losing Allies in the early game hurts BD immensely.  Most good kings will find at least one evil in the first few days.)</p>

            <p>No, if he meant that, he would have said it.</p>
<p>I know that because he already did.</p>
<p>Plus, VFR technically doesn’t have a direct correlation to game balance. It can help you, but a game could be made which would be specifically balanced for VFR. It may not be fun, but it could exist.</p>

            <p>what he means is the game play would change. VFC (because of two trial limit, it would probably be more of a mass claim and refusers get voted up) would likely become more common</p>

            <p>I fully agree that it works as a great deterrant to VFR, but I fail to see how the game becomes “super unbalanced” without Decide Fate.</p>

<p>Each kind of King treasures some of their abilities over others.</p>
<p>Guards! and Allies barely have any use for Evil Kings, while Royal Finger and Decide Fate are their most important abilities.<br>
A Neutral King has little use for all their abilities except Guards! (though Allies can help make the game end quickly).<br>
A Good King barely ever needs Decide Fate, but has use for all their other abilities.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why would we remove it if the whole point of it being there is to be a power tool for the Kings?</p>
<p>Decide Fate has many uses. For example:</p>
<p>It stops vote for classes. People are less likely to vote people up each day to get a claim because if the Prince pops up, say byebye, because Evil King will punch the decide fate without a hesitation.</p>
<p>It lets the Kings save their power players in dire situations, like you pointed out. Works in Good King’s favour too if they’re trying to save a Prince from an outnumbered situation.</p>
<p>If we were to remove Decide Fate, 90% of the community will explode and the game becomes super unbalanced.</p>
