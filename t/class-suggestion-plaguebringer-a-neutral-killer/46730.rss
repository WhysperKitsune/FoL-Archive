    <title>[Class Suggestion] Plaguebringer, a neutral killer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-plaguebringer-a-neutral-killer/46730</link>
    <description>Class: Plaguebringer

Faction: Neutral

Type: Killer

Goal: Survive to see the Blue Dragon defeated.  (Wins with Cult/Unseen, like Sorceress.)  

Plaguebringer will always spawn with at least one Physician and at least one Alchemist.  

Passive (Quarantine) - Immune to bleeding and Nightshade poison.  Night immune the first two nights.  If the Assassin or the Cult Leader attacks or applies poison/bleeding to the Plaguebringer, they will fail and be notified.  

Day (Contaminate) - Apply bleeding or poison to up to two players.  They will die in two days.  (Changes depending on Evil faction.  Plaguebringer **does** know which one is applied.  Choose only one player by picking the same one twice.)  Consumes one Leech.  (Starts with two Leeches.)

Day (Stoneskin Panacea) - Become immune to death tonight.  Consumes one Leech.  (Cannot be used until Day 3).  

Night (Vile Leeches) - Heal a player&#39;s bleeding or poison and replace it with Plague.  (Other healers visiting the target will believe they succeeded.)  Players with Plague cannot be healed, will not be aware of their condition, and will die the following night.  Grants two Leeches.  

The idea behind Plaguebringer is that it&#39;s very easy to use Physician or Alchemist as an alibi, since targets will believe they were healed.  Killing off Alchemist or Physician claims also becomes incredibly risky in Plaguebringer games, since up to three players can be afflicted with bleeding/poison in a single day, and the Blue Dragon will quickly be wiped out if the healers are lost.

The Plaguebringer is much more aggressive than other neutral killer classes, being able to kill many more players per day.  They also have a stronger alibi, but in exchange they are significantly more vulnerable, lacking consistent night immunity or occupy/redirect immunity.</description>

            <p>Then why have Stoneskin Pancea at all, if you’re never gonna use it?</p>
<p>Just give it Night Immunity, it’s simpler.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Neutral Killers should have full Night Immunity, always (or something to similar effect, like Reaper souls). It makes it too easy for Cult/Unseen to randomly kill them. It seems interesting other than that.</p>
