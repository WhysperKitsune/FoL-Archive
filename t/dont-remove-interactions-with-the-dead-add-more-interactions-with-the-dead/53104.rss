    <title>Don&#39;t remove interactions with the dead. Add more interactions with the dead</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/dont-remove-interactions-with-the-dead-add-more-interactions-with-the-dead/53104</link>
    <description>So.  If people haven&#39;t heard yet, the next patch is planned to remove [i]all[/i] interactions with the dead (DKs, Psychic / Mystic&#39;s ability to speak with them, Chill&#39;s ability to speak with the dead, all of it.)  The stated reason for this is that because people sometimes leave after dying, those abilities are unreliable (and the upcoming patch will give you 40% of your winnings if you leave before the game ends.)

I&#39;m strongly opposed to this change.  My reasoning, taken from the patch thread:

1.  No class in ToL was [i]entirely[/i] dependent on the dead.  Physician and Psychic / Mystic were still obviously very useful even if every dead person left immediately.  So it&#39;s not really a problem if people leave while dead.

2.  People often want to stick around after death in order to see the end of the game (and if you&#39;re a member of a faction, you&#39;re still going to lose a lot of GP if you leave early under the new rules.)  When people do stick around, it&#39;s more fun for them if they have some way to get messages to the living, even if it&#39;s unreliable.

3.  The ability for the dead to talk to the living smooths out randomness a little bit by ensuring that it&#39;s still possible to get their results on their last day (so, an investigative dying on the same night that they visit someone doesn&#39;t always mean their results are lost forever.)

4.  Communication with the dead leads to more strategically-deep gameplay because it adds more people who can devote their time to analyzing events and generally applying social deduction, then gives them a way to relay that to the living.

5.  Fun is an important part of the game (it is, after all, a game.)  Yes, the game needs to be balanced to be fun, but &quot;Call The Dead is fun&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s fun to hang around as a dead and try to give good advice to the mystic&quot; are totally good arguments for keeping the ability.

The only people who it really [i]matters[/i] if they stay or not are BD, and BD still lose a lot of their winnings if they leave early.  Beyond that, a lot of people like staying around to see how the game ends.  To me (someone who almost always sticks around to see the end), this change is going to make me enjoy the game significantly less, to the point where it might even make me stop playing - being dead is going to be utterly boring, so the options will mostly be &quot;never see how a game ends if you die&quot; or &quot;sit around being bored, with most other people leaving because they can&#39;t influence things so you won&#39;t even have anyone to talk to.&quot;

This is just the wrong direction to go.  Add [i]more[/i] interaction with the dead so people are incentivized to stay, not less.  And try to design dead-interaction classes so they&#39;re not 100% dependent on interacting with the dead (ie. they have other stuff to do, too.)  This is mostly the case.

Honestly this wasn&#39;t even a [i]problem[/i].  The Psychic&#39;s link causes way more problems than their ability to speak with the dead (since it makes it impossible to fakeclaim psychic.)</description>

            <p>Anyways, here is how I would rework DK (even assuming it was always BD)</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue">Death Knight</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Blue Dragon Special</font></strong></p>
<p>Passive: Undead</p>
<p>Night Ability: Dark Steel: Attack someone. 2 uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or a different version (reanimate turns all dead BD into this)</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue">Awakened Soul</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Blue Dragon Special</font></strong></p>
<p>Passive: Undead</p>
<p>Night Ability: Dark Steel: Vote to attack someone. If a majority of Awakened Souls (excluding afk and people who have left) vote to kill the same target, they will be attacked. 2 uses, does not use a charge if it fails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further Reanimates give an extra 2 uses to Awakened Souls.</p>

            <p>I’m actually really confused on why they decided to remove dead chat in the first place. Seems like a step backwards to me. Dead chat was always good for killing boredom, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Plus, if you were confused about how your class interacted with someone else’s, what got you found, etc., you can ask them if they’re in dead chat too rather than waiting for the game to end.</p>

            <p>I hate the new patch. I’ve been playing regularly since October and never thought I would stop playing. The removal of dead interaction is the biggest reason. One of the best things about the game was that people still occasionally had a reason to play after they died. I always wished it had more of that. This version not only stripped it out entirely it it actually rewards people for leaving early. Who wouldn’t rather take the 40% than sit around in an empty chat room for 20 minutes?</p>
<p>The other thing I hate is the rebalance of the king. It fixed so many problems to know the king was likely good. I far preferred the “whisper king” meta to this “tell the king nothing and then kill him for knowing nothing” meta.</p>

            <p>Not especially, but you weren’t supposed to leave a ranked match when dead, unless neutral.</p>

            <p>It’s not forcing, imo if you give more interaction with the dead you will  see more people stay and it should never be forced it should be recommended, and it’s not really impossible check out NightX’s post it mostly balances things out</p>
