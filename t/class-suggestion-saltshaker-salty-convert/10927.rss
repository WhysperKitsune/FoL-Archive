            <p>Oh wait misread your post. I though you meant that you in particular are always voted D2. Rather than 1 being voted D2. Yes that is a bad strat but you should still claim if that happens to be you.</p>

            <p>I have had more luck in games with random voting than in games where it’s a 'll about blank staring at the  clock to tick to 0 .</p>
<p>of cource random isn’t really random . its more about bringing up the quiet talkers .</p>
<p>I’ve won games as mm before where no body has even asked me a question all game</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a good thought and you’re promoting teamwork and all, but you’re allowing a mislynch to happen just in the OFF CHANCE the evils would’ve killed you tonight instead of the Prince. The Prince is powerful, but he isn’t worth a deliberate mislynch. You’re acting like your sacrifice gives the Prince night immunity or something…it does not. Your sacrifice wastes a day and narrows down the Prince suspect list for evils ANYWAY. Utterly pointless.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hanging a person who won’t claim is a solid BD AI move. Just because you don’t agree doesn’t mean your team is the one who drops the ball.</p>
<p>I play the precise opposite of your strategy - I always claim my class when I am on the stand AND I <em>occassionally</em> fakeclaim when I am the Prince if I don’t trust the King. When you are getting everyone’s journals from jail interrogations, fakeclaiming when you’re a Prince is incredibly easy to do.</p>
<p>Whether it is random or not, getting on the stand is serious business. If you refuse to claim, you are allowing scum the chance to call you out as being scum and having a solid alibi of “well, he didn’t claim on the stand. That’s why I executed!”</p>

            <p>The only time you should ever not claim is if there is another person who is trusted and knows 100% that you are good. EX: You are the prince and have outed to a confirmed phys or a Psychic who also just used a code word with someone to let them know you are confirmed. Or you noble in a cult game that protected a sheriff who knows you when everyone else doesn’t. Then you just have the 3rd person explain that you are confirmed BD 100% and get innoed that way. 90% of the time if you are being random voted it is early game and none of those have happened.</p>
