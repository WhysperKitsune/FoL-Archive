    <title>Things that Scum do</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/things-that-scum-do/13733</link>
    <description>Some things I see players do that often turn out to be scum .

1. Ask the king his opinion before doing an execute , or state they are siding with the king . Early game this for me usually is &quot;a tell&quot; the player is scum . I think they are attempting to get someone else to take responsibility for the Execute , it makes them look less suspicious if they follow a King into an execute.

2. Neuts out !, this used to be everyone but its edging now towards being a scum shout , a lot of bd are realising that alchemists in particular is not always an insta kill . Especially if they have been proven before they get to the stand .
Early in a game a few days ago the observer pointed to a neutral and they got him up , but I had confirmed him as alchemist as king and asked to pardon , 5 executed 6 saved , 4 of the 5 executers turned out to be scum .

3. Princess Claim but everyone you ever checked is dead .. 

4 . Court Wizard claim with random Ice wards from N1 , not always sus but not really a tactic most CW employ .

5. Sherrif/Paladin claims , that still haven&#39;t found anything by n10 

6 Knight claims that are alive after n6

7 Butler Claims ............

Any of you guys got other stuff you look out for ?</description>

<p>that is very different from what i was saying, clearly. That second sentence alone is flirting with the line tbh, mentioning Hitler is not the same as what your saying at all, not that the amount of deaths some how means anything in terms of the rules.</p>

            <p>nobles very often are good choices for becoming the new king.  which is a zero to hero kind of promotion .</p>
<p>I have lots of pretty interesting games that started off as boring classes .<br>
In cult games noble is quiet interesting because it’s very provable . Which makes you powerful</p>

</aside>
<p>that’s really worst case scenario and extremely unlikely. I have this mindset and i still only have left a game once. Its not like everyone is going to leave every game every time they get a role they don’t like. I honestly don’t care if the king or sheriffs leave day 1 I’m still gonna just enjoy the game and see what happens. I personally like hunter and wouldn’t leave as drunk or CW as they can be pretty important to the game at certain points but nobles, you can play 10 games as noble from start to finish and never actually be needed for your abilities.</p>

<p>Ok…i will ask again…how do i see this there must be a way to see them, they don’t expect you to remember it after signing up for the first time.</p>

<p>so you are breaking the rules by not reading it. You are wrong. Go read the rules. You have no excuse now</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok I had to sign up for a new account just because I would of atleast remembered skimming through the rules but it turns out they don’t show you rules before you sign up at all so thanks for that blatant lie. They do have it after in a message with the bot thing but even then its not required when you sign up and i didn’t even know if this forum was active or if i was going to post anything.<br>
I am wrong? I don’t know what I’m wrong about as i never stated anything and was just asking a question. You tell me to go read the rules but I’ve been asking all this time where they are and all you say is useless answers. If you don’t know just say you don’t know.</p>
<p>Ok i have found them, Its kinda hidden for some reason but imma look through it.<br>
Ok nevermind they were just the guidelines and the actual rules are hidden even more, right at the bottom of the guidelines.</p>
<p>most of it is ambiguous and is up to the mods to decide, there for sure is no rule that says I cant mention a historical figure. What were doing right now could be against the rules if the mods decided.</p>
<p>Because you lied in such detail I made a third account to make triple sure i didn’t miss anything and there’s literally nothing they ask you to read. When you sign up you automatically agree to the ToS and Privacy Policy which has no rules in and the only time it asks you is vaguely in a message from a bot and even then it doesn’t really ask you to read them.<br>
(btw I’m aware that its a rule not to create multiple accounts but in this case I don’t see an issue)</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes I’m sure every player gives a damn about the other strangers they happen to be paired with, that’s why i see constant toxic players and arguments. Its annoying having to repeat myself all the time but like i said there’s really no reason to put a considerable amount of time being bored just so BD don’t lose 1 noble and possibly may affect the outcome of a single game. I also want to say again that i have only done this once and my main point is that I’m fine with other people doing it and would happily do it again if i was not in the mood for a role. If you wanna bring maturity in this then i can just as easily say just have the maturity to not get so upset over 1 person leaving in a game and learn to enjoy it.</p>

            <p>Leaving if you don’t like your class severely disrupts the game for everyone. This leads to a less fun game for everyone as the game is balanced around the assumption that there are 16 players, and an unbalanced game is less fun.</p>
<p>Just have the maturity to think of the other 15 ppl I your game not just yourself, like most people already do.</p>
