    <description>* Knight 

If you don&#39;t get flirted or coldsteeled by the real Knight, this is a good fake claim.

* Obs 
* Princess
* Sheriff

You&#39;d think these classes would be decent fake-claims because like MM, they are Special/Investigative and not occupy immune, but Obs is impossible to fake.  Princess gets outed as soon as King dies, and Sheriff gets outed because there&#39;s usually two real Sheriffs.

* Phys

Very easy to write fake logs for, but almost every game has two real Phys.

* CW 

As impossible to fake as Obs, since you can&#39;t fake the N1 swap that every good CW performs.

* Butler 
* Drunk 

Impossible to fake and you have nothing in common with these classes.

* Hunter

Unique, you can&#39;t fake claim it when there&#39;s a real Hunter and you have no way of knowing if there is before it&#39;s too late. 

* Mystic 
* Noble 

Impossible to fake.

# Conclusion:

Knight is the only well-rounded **BD** fakeclaim for Mastermind.  All the others require more luck than social manipulation to maintain your cover, like there not being 2 real Sheriffs or you randomly converted one N1 and he changed his claim upon becoming Assassin. 

I believe this is another illustration of why we need new BD classes in the game.</description>

<p>Observer claims polarize to Observer/Nightwatch. So if you lose your 3rd Unseen recently when you’re MM claiming Observer, you have more credibility.</p>

            <p>I think I have made a thread about it before. But Observer claims are the reward for strategy’s that give you a lot of information. Like with Butler or Mystic an Observer is falsifiable. HOWEVER! Unlike with those 2 what you need to fake the class is information which can be gathered yourself.</p>

            <p>I do not disagree that claiming Butler or Drunk as Mastermind is a bad idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claiming an Investigative as the MM is your best bet in the grand picture. It allows you to claim occupied, AND you can turn things in your favor by mislynching in MYLO with false accusations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are lucky for game to reach MYLO claiming Sheriff in a double sheriff game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally claim Observer as MM … it is the hardest to fake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is practically impossible to fake until very late game.  Which requires sheer luck to reach, if you claimed Observer earlier.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been reading along with this thread for a while and want to throw in my 2 cents about fakeclaiming.</p>
<p>The reality is that BD get occupied all the time. Sometimes you are unable to visit somebody. Things go wrong where your action doesn’t go through, and that is perfectly normal. However, when you are claiming Butler or Drunk and cannot claim “occupied”, you remove a vital tool in your kit to obfuscate. So you must either write fake information or claim you could not visit them. You lost 1 of your 3 tools to work with when creating a fake will, and be forced to input fake info that could catch the eye of BD. The biggest mistake you can do as scum is to never include “occupied” or “unable to visit” in any of your journals.</p>
<p>Claiming any occupation immune role like Butler/Butler is incredibly limiting and is strictly a -EV play in most games. Not only is your ability one that gives feedback and is generally easy to prove, the passive of real Butlers/Drunk prevent you from writing “occupied” in your journal.</p>
<p>Drunk is definitely worse of a claim than Butler because of the royal blood passive. Almost all Drunk claims are polarized to Drunk/Alcoholic/Assassin. Even Assassin’s may be wary of claiming their previous role of Alcoholic if they haven’t debauched anybody in a while.</p>
<p>Claiming an Investigative as the MM is your best bet in the grand picture. It allows you to claim occupied, AND you can turn things in your favor by mislynching in MYLO with false accusations. Using your claim as an Investigative gives you a 4th tool in your toolbox. It’s more difficult to mislynch somebody when you are claiming Physician/Butler than when you are claiming Princess/Sheriff as calling a BD out as scum with fake results.</p>
<p>I personally claim Observer as MM. Princess and Sheriff are fine claims, but I enjoy the challenge and flexibility of the Observer. Observer is the hardest role to play in the game, and it is the hardest to fake. But if you pay enough attention to the game, make educated guesses with where people are going, are good at lying and CC’ing, and have a little bit of luck as well, Observer can be a grand slam claim for MM in any game.</p>

            <p>Or the fact that any Drunk/Butler can find you. Princess can find you. Any person who checks logs can likely find you like Mystic/Noble/Prince/good king, since you will have zero legit preventions. Fakeclaiming butler is really ill-advised as MM in my opinion. The feedback changes to prevention only were a step in the right direction, but I do not think it is enough. Any night you “party” might be false too due to whoever would be visiting you.</p>

            <p>I believe Boslof already confirmed that. Merc and Sellsword exist to balance the game, more offset with the King’s alignment.</p>

            <p>I agree that’d be true IF it were the case but I sure hope it’s not, that would make the reveal of a Sellsword have way too big of an impact on the game.</p>

            <p>Spawn rates by themselves do not give a huge advantage, but something like if there is a Sellsword, the king is 50% more likely to be a good king can be huge.</p>

            <p>Well I gave up because Vandalay explained why it’s not worth the trouble.  But if it were, I would have continued in order to protest the lack of response from the devs on this issue  <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Okay I see your point. Which I think is basically it’s not worth recording data from 100 matches to figure out spawn rates to get a significant advantage?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My point is the significance of the advantage is probably very very low. It’s likely the difference between turning a 50/50 into a 55/45 off of statistics alone, and quite likely trying for it is more likely to cause you to miss something in the logs/chat etc… that could have actually solved it. I don’t think published or unpublished it would have a significant advantage in winrates in either direction.</p>
<p>That being said, I probably lean more towards transparency over secrecy with regards to those rates. Just on a general principle that if someone cares they will find out and it creates more of an image of fairness for it to be known, even if the information is worthless strategically.</p>

            <p>right, but I’m saying those are probably close enough that it’s a pretty insignificant effect on your winrate. (well minus the part that we do know… of which there is 1 guaranteed sheriff in every game, which automatically makes it so that unless there’s some insane reduction to the odds of a class being sheriff sheriff is most likely twice as likely to 2 more.</p>
