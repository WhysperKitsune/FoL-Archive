    <description>&gt;Monk
Neutral wildcard
**Passive: Enthrall spirit** Upon dying, you will enter the marked player&#39;s body as the _spirit._ They will be informed that you entered their body.
**Night ability 1: Bind self** Mark the target player -infinite uses
_Goal: survive_

&gt;The spirit
Neutral wildcard
**Passive: Departed** You don&#39;t count towards the vote cap, can&#39;t be targeted by day or night abilities, and can&#39;t be voted on for execution.
**Passive: Bound** You can speak to the player you are bound to during the day and night (no one else will see your messages). They will see you as &quot;the spirit.&quot; If the player you are bound to dies, so will you.
**Night ability: Scavenge** If the player you selected dies tonight, you will enter their body and become the monk in their body. The player who died will enter your previous monk body. The player you are bound to is informed that you left their body. 
_Goal: Scavenge a new body and win as the monk_


The monk won&#39;t spawn in any games the possessor does, to avoid confusion.

In case you don&#39;t understand, let me show you an example:

player 1 is the Monk. He binds his soul to player 2. player 1 dies the next night. player 1 is now in player 2&#39;s body as the spirit. Player 2 knows the spirit is inside them. Player 2 still has full control over their body. The next night, player 1 scavenges player 3, and is lucky as 3 dies. Player 1 becomes player 3 as the Monk, and player 3 enters the dead body of player 1. Player 2 is informed that the spirit has left their body.

You might be wondering how the Monk can die. It is simple: when they become the spirit, if their host dies before the spirit can scavenge a new body, the spirit dies as well. This could happen easily if they enter a bad person who is executed the next day.

Additional notes: the spirit can&#39;t target the king with scavenge.</description>

            <p>Player starts as monk. When monk dies. they enter the marked targets body. The marked target still controls that body</p>
<p>The spirit can only talk tot he player they are in. No one else hears it, or knows it is happening. Then the spirit leaves to take over a dying body.</p>
<p>The main character is the monk. The spirit is the transitioning part.</p>

<p>this makes him completely useless to everyone. I think he should be able to vote, but only after a set amount of days (For example: you could make it that he can only vote every third day.)</p>

<p>This is interesting, my only question is that if the other players see the whisper like normal, or does it just say the spirit has talked to that selected person. If so, that makes that person a bullsye for the evil faction to kill.<br>
Overall, i definitely like the role. it sounds fun to play as.</p>
