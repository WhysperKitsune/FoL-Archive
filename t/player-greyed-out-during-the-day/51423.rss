    <title>Player greyed out during the day</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/player-greyed-out-during-the-day/51423</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
D1: Put a scout on 9, N1: Investigate 6
N1: Scout got tripped, 9 was converted. Also, 6 (original assassin) came up unseen
16, the possessor died that night, reasons unknown as the player left the game

D2: 6 was no longer selectable from the right side player list, could not put him up. His bar was a light grey shade, no red number. No system message stating his death. Nobody knew if he if he was dead or alive (MM might)
N2: 6 was no longer targetable from the number selector box. 
D3: 6 showed up as alive in court for the rest of the game, but still not clickable. 
We put up and executed 9 who at that point was an assassin, implying that 6 had died N1 or N2.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Player 6 should have been targetable if alive or show up as dead.

#### Steps to reproduce:
This is just speculation but some combination of actions could have resulted in this:
1. Have an assassin attack a hunter that has a bear, or a target with a knight guarding
2. Have a possessor jump into that assassin
3. Have an investigative class check the assassin
4. Watch the system go nuts trying to resolve all statuses

It could also just have been a more general error as more things went wrong that game.

#### Comments:
Note: Result messages popped up 3 times for a lot of players, including me (inv only, scout showed once)
More things went wrong that game: People seemed to be massively abstaining at faster than expected speed

Did not make a screenshot, unfortunately. Did upload my log. Here is an excerpt:
