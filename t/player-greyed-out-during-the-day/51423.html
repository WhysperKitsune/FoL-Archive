          <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>D1: Put a scout on 9, N1: Investigate 6<br>
N1: Scout got tripped, 9 was converted. Also, 6 (original assassin) came up unseen<br>
16, the possessor died that night, reasons unknown as the player left the game</p>
<p>D2: 6 was no longer selectable from the right side player list, could not put him up. His bar was a light grey shade, no red number. No system message stating his death. Nobody knew if he if he was dead or alive (MM might)<br>
N2: 6 was no longer targetable from the number selector box.<br>
D3: 6 showed up as alive in court for the rest of the game, but still not clickable.<br>
We put up and executed 9 who at that point was an assassin, implying that 6 had died N1 or N2.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>Player 6 should have been targetable if alive or show up as dead.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>This is just speculation but some combination of actions could have resulted in this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have an assassin attack a hunter that has a bear, or a target with a knight guarding</li>
<li>Have a possessor jump into that assassin</li>
<li>Have an investigative class check the assassin</li>
<li>Watch the system go nuts trying to resolve all statuses</li>
</ol>
<p>It could also just have been a more general error as more things went wrong that game.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>Note: Result messages popped up 3 times for a lot of players, including me (inv only, scout showed once)<br>
More things went wrong that game: People seemed to be massively abstaining at faster than expected speed</p>
<p>Did not make a screenshot, unfortunately. Did upload my log. Here is an excerpt:</p>
