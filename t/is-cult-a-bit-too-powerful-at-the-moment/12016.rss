    <title>Is Cult a bit too powerful at the moment?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/is-cult-a-bit-too-powerful-at-the-moment/12016</link>
    <description>It just seems they are very hard to pin down , particularly if the king is neutral or evil .

A typical game 

2 cult 
9 bd
1 nk
3 neuts 
1 king

turn 1 convert ,  and neutral killer gets a bd

3 cult 
7 bd
1 nk
3 neuts
1 king

at this point if they can get the neuts on board they already have a majority 

next turn kill on bd  from cult , nk gets a random

3 cult
6 bd
1 nk
3 neuts
1 kning

turn 3 

4 cult 
4 bd
1 nk
3 neuts 
1 king .

I know this is an extreme example by turn 3 but its not really implausible .

It can be pretty hard if you don&#39;t have many investigators , you can try scum reading but  often these games have very little room to create cracks . 

How has everyone else&#39;s win rates been in cult games since latest patch ?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Couple things. First off, several classes are immune to conversion. Also cult could hit Neutrals. Second off, You are ignoring abilities of bd in the mix. Debauch, Sacrifice, Mercenary, Butler - All these affect the odds.</p>
<p>Theres more to it, but if you want to work out the probablilities, you need to work out ALL of the variables.</p>

            <p>Cult’s weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>If BD find the CL, they can just jail/occupy him until investigators find the rest of the cult</li>
<li>cannot kill and convert in the same night</li>
<li>Must sacrifice own members to kill</li>

            <p>the conversion and killing rate has gone u a bit without the priest .<br>
the thing with the scenario is it may instead take 5 turns to reach the same point , but it still edges in that direction , with maybe only 1 or 2 investigators it can be pretty tough to find anything at all in those turns .</p>

            <p>Your scenario requires successful conversion both times (something pretty rare), successful killings, and the NK not killing any cult. I do agree that cult luck based</p>

            <p>The main thing your post shows is how NK makes the game super luck based. If they randomly target 1 or 2 bad guys during the game, its SO MUCH easier for BD than if they never kill one. I wish they would removes NKs. Games were more fun whitout them.</p>

            <p>Cult do tend to be stronger Imo. I’d prefer if neutrals in 16 player games was reduced to 2-3 and there was cap on only a Max of 2 neutral killers, and neither possessor or reaper were unique and they win together.</p>

            <p>The chance of your scenario is pretty slim to not existent.</p>
<p>However with my version although it sometimes takes 5 turns rather than 3 it is pretty likely to happen .</p>
