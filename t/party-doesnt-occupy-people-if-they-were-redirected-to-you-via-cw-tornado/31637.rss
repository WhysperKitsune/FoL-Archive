    <title>Party doesn&#39;t occupy people if they were redirected to you via CW tornado</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/party-doesnt-occupy-people-if-they-were-redirected-to-you-via-cw-tornado/31637</link>
    <description>I died on a night I partied. NK (sorc) was already dead, so I assumed that unseen must have an enforcer. When the post-game screen comes up, I realize their were no converted knights that game, so no possible enforcers. A CW has tornadoed me that night, however. This is what I believe may have made the attack bypass the party.

I don&#39;t know if this is intended behavior, but it is certainly very unintuitive.</description>

            <p>just had another game where the same thing happened, except this time CW was dead. So I guess it’s just the 3-occupy lmit in effect?</p>
<p>Guess maybe there is no bug.</p>

            <p>The CW would have been occupied. Possablely the assassin was occupied 3 times already?</p>
