    <title>NK becoming King too often</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/nk-becoming-king-too-often/20208</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen too many games where NK becomes king. Hell even I do it. It&#39;s the easiest way to win as NK, just kill the king and boom, BD loses a NK and gains a 100% neut king. I made this thread for possible suggestions and discussion</description>

            <p>I agree with this, I’ve had several game when the NK just outs themselves and says that if they let them be king they will out the mastermind, which is easy to find as a NK.</p>

            <p>This should be removed for King’s guards so he can do a better job keeping his morality hidden, but guard notifications need to stay for mercs to prevent merc claims with contracts on anyone, otherwise there’d be no way to disprove from abilities.</p>

            <p>I like this idea but it would be really easy to find the NK king if someone just asks him “Send a guard to protect me to prove you are not Psycho king”. I think the NK king should still have the guard ability and not be night immune, if he is afraid of being attacked at night he can just guard himself, and since he was the NK he can only be killed by the unseen/cult who don’t usually target king since he is usually protected.</p>
<p>Also this is a random suggestion but he could also have a different decide fate that has 2 uses instead of 1 but can only force executions, not pardons. The second charge would be very powerful but the king should be careful and not use it until the end since it basically outs him as psycho king.</p>

            <p>Not to mention it also puts a crazy high risk on just becoming king as an NK… and a pretty funny NK strategy.</p>
<p>Step 1, Kill king<br>
Step 2, don’t become king<br>
Step 3, stop killing, let everyone notice the reaper/possesor has stopped acting<br>
Step 4. Watch BD kill the new king.</p>
<p>Though I do agree with psycho there, he needs guards, Personally I’d say make him a regular king, with a kill all BD/Unseen/Cult goal.</p>

            <p>I like that psychopathic king. All NK could have that as the king role so no there won’t be ppl asking for a NK king because the king would be as bad as NK</p>

            <p>while I like the psycho king, I’d say it’s reasonable for him to get the NK level of a win condition… IE remove the “neutrals” from the list of things he can’t win with. Make it an option for alcs etc… to win with him, and no real reason for him to eliminate scorned/inquis etc…</p>
