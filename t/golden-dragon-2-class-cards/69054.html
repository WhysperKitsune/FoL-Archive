          <p><strong>Note: Some of these classes might be outdated, so for people in the Golden Dragon SFoL please use the classcards provided in the SFoL’s thread.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve made some changes to the golden dragon class cards for whenever I host Golden Dragon 2, so I was hoping to get some feedback.</p>
<p>The main changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most Golden Dragon classes have been nerfed.</li>
<li>Accused, Prosecutor and Lawyer have been reworked.</li>
<li>New NKs added: The Siren and The Collector</li>
<li>New neutrals added: The rivals, the occultist and The Identity Thief</li>
<li>Bounty Hunter has death immunity</li>
<li>The Count can frame two people each night instead of 1 and starts with 1 use of Fate decided.</li>
<li>EFoL notifications will be used.</li>
<li>Reptilians have been added, and will be the main scum faction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reptilians have been greatly changed from my original suggestion, so please give me your thoughts.</p>

<p><big><font color="darkgreen">The Reptilians</font></big><br>
Reptilians are a slow but powerful faction. Reptilian classes become stronger the longer they can stay alive. While there are only three reptilian classes that players can convert to, these classes can change their abilities to adapt to the current situation. This, combined with eggs that make people appear as Reptilians to investigators and Venom, a new status effect that works like a slower poison but disables day abilities, make Reptilians a very sneaky faction.</p>
<p>Reptilian games start with a Matriarch and one random Reptilian. There can only be a maximum of 3 reptilians at a time</p>

          <p>Tbh, you kind of made misplay after misplay in the last match and made yourself look scummy while you could easily have outed as the Prosecutor and started attacking ethos by compiling and detailing his scum-tells.</p>
<p>Claiming that ethos was fakeclaiming as a neut was a downright bad play as the existence of the Lawyer basically automatically confirms him as Accused. Also the by-the-numbers play was a pointless move as the EV from lynching the Accused was technically a negative as if a GD-aligned Accused was to be lynched then the Assassin would have gained an additional 2F1 and boosting the Unseen’s KPN by one for a night. After that, you called for Marl to be lynched over him trying to lynch Pug for being a Neutral, which in retrospective made you look like a hypocrite or scum, so yeah.</p>
<p>What you should have done was to analyze ethos’ post while putting a realistic negative spin on it, outing yourself as a Prosecuter, and then presenting it as an ISO and having a good reasoning to why ethos was not on GD’s side.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is redudant nerf. Golden Dragon already are much more rellying on lynches than Blue Dragon considering they have a Prince AKA Jailor.<br>
Public Execution is one of the “High Risks and Hights Rewards” abillities. It’s already balanced considering Royal Guard ALWAYS commiting suicide after this.</p>
