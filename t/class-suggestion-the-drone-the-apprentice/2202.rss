After a round where only The Prince and The Invoker remained. The Blue Dragon won, but they had to do something with The Invoker. So they sentenced him to 5 years in a mental hospital. The Invoker was cured of his loyalty to the cult, however he still had his abilities.

            <p>Drone seems almost impossible to win with compared to the Mercenary. It’s almost like your actual objective is to get converted.</p>
<p>The Apprentice just seems way too strong and i’m not a fan of the RNG in Rummage.</p>
