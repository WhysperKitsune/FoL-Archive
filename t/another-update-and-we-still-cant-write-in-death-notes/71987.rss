    <description>It&#39;s a pain in the ass to write with ur mouse you know.

Being able to type in DN would make this game so much more interesting, I dunno why the devs still haven&#39;t implemented this, I like ToL a lot more than ToS but the sole reason I&#39;m still playing ToS is that you get to play with death notes.

In ToS you gain the ability to draw but LOST THE ABILITY TO TYPE which sucks so much, not everyone have a wacom pad. When I&#39;m an assassin I&#39;d like to type something like 7 is immune when noone died N1 to cause confusion, but no, you have to draw every letter with the mouse it&#39;s like wtf I&#39;d rather just chill with my DN and fuck my live till BD finds me I don&#39;t care.</description>

            <p>Allowing people to write paragraphs of text would be bad I think. I don’t want the unseen to have gamesolving arguments outing the NK. I just want a DN that says x# = NK.</p>

            <p>Yeah something like text typing in a paint kind of software would be fine, would make this game much more fun.</p>
<p>Say if a players name is John Lennon and I’m an Assassin I could type in John Lennon’s lyrics for the fun, ppl may suspect John Lenon tho it may not work but sure does make this game much more fun.</p>
<p>Dunno why they still haven’t implemented this, maybe because of technical reason? Not everyone knows how to implement text typing into a painting module.</p>

            <p>I think we should have an option of drawing or typing, since some people are really good at drawing(me, nope) Maybe it could be like you have to make a Text box for you to be able to type in? And you have to make it, not pre-set?</p>
