    <title>Stat website about ToL</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/stat-website-about-tol/9278</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. 

I&#39;ve just did a small website to log your stats about the differents classes. I&#39;ve added a page to display the global stats so we  can have fun info about the differents classes.
For the moment there are just a few stats available but I think I&#39;ll had some later.
It&#39;s missing a lot of things and the code is not optimized but the security part is fine. The project is open source so everyone can check that it&#39;s clean and the email used for the registration is just use for having an unique identifier (so later you&#39;ll be able to change your username). You can even use a yopmail adress I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll not use them to send mails. (code here : https://github.com/jocelyndubois/tolstats)

The website is accessible here : http://tolstats.jocelyn-dubois.fr/
You can check what a personnal stat page looks like by searching for &quot;Eau Minerale&quot; in the search field. And after you&#39;ve register, y&#39;oull be able to log you own stats.
ATM the website uses the wiki images, but if the devs want me to remove them, i&#39;ll do it as quick as I can ! :)

Hope you&#39;ll enjoy :)

EDIT : After posting this message on discord, my server died in like a minute :frowning:
I hope he&#39;ll be back soon. I&#39;ll post a screenshot of the render to show you how it looks like.

            <p>Yup … I had the same idea about the winning rate.<br>
But I had two problems about it.</p>
<p>1 - It’s one more action at the end of each game and I’m pretty sure we’ll forget it pretty often.<br>
2 - If you forget it only ONE time, your global winning ratio it totally screw up.</p>
<p>While writing this I thought to a potential solution : After you click “+” or “-”, the webstie ask “Win or loose ?” in a popin.</p>
<p>If you anwser, fine, the information is saved.<br>
If you forget or don’t want to answer the information is note saved and the stat is calculated ONLY on the games where you answered.</p>
<p>Problem with this, the 200 games already registered can’t have the information so the current players will have a great lack of information on their previous game :s</p>
<p>I dunno, what do you guys think about it ?</p>
<p>Any other ideas ?</p>
<p>I though of a percentage of “Evil/neutral/Good” pop while king.</p>

            <p>This is great! I’ve really wanted something like this and short of actual stats in the game or an official API, this is is the next best thing. (Because I’m way too lazy to make my own spreadsheet lol). Thank you for making this!</p>
<p>Edit: An obvious stat to add would be the ability to track if you won or lost for each game. Unless it’s there and I’m just missing it.</p>

            <p>I’ve already tried scanning memory, as I was curious about the topic. The information is there, but obtaining it from different segments of ram used by process is troublesome. Also, they switch content, so the memory scanning should be performed quickly and quite often.</p>
<p>Not worth it. Seems like the best solution will actually be waiting for devs to provide some kind of api for stuff like that.</p>

            <p>Well, I have litteraly no idea.</p>
<p>I could add some automatisation to my website, but it will require to have access to an API and it’s on the game dev side.</p>
<p>I guess it’s globally the same for a desktop app, even if my knoledges here are more limited.</p>
<p>But some software like “Livesplit” (speedrun app) can get infos about different game without using an API. If I well remember, it’s done by searching infos directly in the ram and not in the packet sended online.</p>
<p>They use some soft like cheat engine to search some data that are fixed in the RAM and then they uses those data for their App.</p>
<p>Sorry I can’t tell you more about this without doing some horrible mistakes about the process ! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>I was thinking about something similar - but rather addon for the game (desktop app), that would hijack data (probably network trafic) from game and actually gather stats on it’s own. I’ve seen many addons like that for other games and I also tried to listen to traffic on ports of ToL, but the information I got in packets was not readable and I’ve never made any app like this before.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from devs if and how could I achieve gathering data from game with another desktop app?</p>
