    <title>Occupy/prevented from visiting system message not displaying</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/occupy-prevented-from-visiting-system-message-not-displaying/10872</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
play a class thats not occupy immune and use an ability, and nothing appears after the ability is used
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
a message saying you were occupied should appear.
#### Steps to reproduce:
1. a class with a night ability thats targeted.
2. someone with an occupy ability targeting the first person.
3. ???
4. profit.
#### Comments:
also no message says when trying to visit a person who has been sage walled. i was a hunter who was being debauched by a drunk but no message displayed when drunk was prevented from visiting. 
basicly, theres a bug in the system that does not display when ever you are occupied, it will display when you are attempted to be occupied, and you are occupy immune, and other related methods, but not when you are successfully occupied or specific cases of prevented visiting.</description>
