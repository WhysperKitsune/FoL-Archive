    <title>Acolyte ideas compendium. (Cult killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/acolyte-ideas-compendium-cult-killer/5354</link>
    <description>The Acolyte is a class that has potential to make the cult more interesting or at least more varied. Please list ideas and why they are better than the other ideas. 

My own idea&#39;s are:

Day ability - nightshade poisoning (1 use). Poison the target. Just like the assassin.

Night ability - Blood drain (1 use). Make the target bleed just like the Hunter.

These Ability&#39;s are not particularly strong as far as killing Ability&#39;s go but are still impactful and let you fake claim Hunter.

Meny people have mentioned that a cult killer should use the erraticates of the cult leader. Another idea that uses that idea is this:

Day ability 1: Transmute power - convert 1 use of erraticate into 1 use of both nightshade and blood drain

Day ability 2: Nightshade - Poison the target (0 uses)

Night ability 1: Erraticate - Kill the target (uses shared with cult leader)

Night ability 2: Blood drain - Make the target bleed (0 uses)

This idea is arguably stronger as you can now fake claim Knight. But it also means that you won&#39;t be adding as meny additional kills per Acolyte.

Please post additional idea&#39;s below.</description>
