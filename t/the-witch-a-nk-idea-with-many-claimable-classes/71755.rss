&gt;
&gt; **Passive (Potion Adaption)** - You are familier with many potions, including the ones that make you death, occupation, and redirection immune. You will appear to have been redirected/occupied to classes that may use it on you (Unless **Change Form** is used)
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Change Form)** - Select one of three potions from your collection to deceive the BD. The options for this are: *Appear occupation and redirection immune tonight.* *Appear to be BD tonight, and your visits will be hidden to tracking abilities.* *Appear to be a class type of choice to the princess, seeker, and mastermind tonight*. *_3 uses_*
&gt;
&gt; **Day Ability (Potion of Deception)** - Tonight, the selected player will receive the selected notifications. The options for this are : Wolfed( their class card will appear to be bleeding and they will be &quot;healed&quot; the next night. If a healer tries to heal them they will get the notification for healing a bleed),Attacked and healed, or occupied (they will not get their night results). *_3 uses_* 
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (Potion of Poison)** - Attack the selected player. *_Infinite Uses_*
&gt;
&gt; **Night Ability (The bomb of prophecy)** - Attack a player with a extraordinary attack. This attack is guarenteed to kill, it bypasses heal, guards, and night immunity.

Goal: Same as reaper and poss :p

            <p>I feel like we have enough bleeding as it is, im not sure nks need it. Witch has a fake bleed thats useful for claiming hunter and phys, but it has no kill potential. Turning poison to a bleed is a good idea though, wolf should still stay a night ability imo</p>

            <p>Yes, but, this attack seems like it needs a way of being avoided, or else its pretty much an attack just to kill prince, or maybe a late game mm. But the reason its not refunded is so when and if the bd knows there is a witch, get someone to claim prince and jail him, and hope the witch wasted their ability. If it was refunded, it is near innvitable for princes death.</p>
