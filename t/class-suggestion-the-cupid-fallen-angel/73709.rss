            <p>alternatively you could have it resolve with a bus crash system. So 4 vists 6, 7 visits 6 and 6 visits his original target with no effect</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Question: What will happen if Both Lover’s Cuffings have a similar player target and use Dating Night?</p>
<p>Answer: That player tries to visit Lover’s Cuffings A target but a force to visit Lover’s Cuffings B target then. For example Lover’s Cuffings A cuff <span class="hashtag">#4</span> and <span class="hashtag">#6</span> and Lover’s Cuffings B cuff <span class="hashtag">#6</span> and <span class="hashtag">#7</span>. When Dating Night is used, <span class="hashtag">#4</span> and <span class="hashtag">#7</span> are a force to visit <span class="hashtag">#6</span> and <span class="hashtag">#6</span> are a force to <span class="hashtag">#4</span> then force to <span class="hashtag">#7</span> and visit <span class="hashtag">#7</span>. This also applies to Scary Night and Devil’s Cuffings.</p>
<p>I am thinking should I add the minor passive and nerf the charge of Dating Night and Scary Night to 2 and 1 respectively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><big><font color="LighBlue"><strong>The Cupid</strong></font></big><br>
<font color="LighBlue"><strong>Blue Dragon Offensive</strong></font><br>
<strong>Love Matters</strong> (Passive) -  when Dating Night is used, the cuff players cannot be debauchery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><big><font color="purple"><strong>Fallen Angel</strong></font></big><br>
<font color="purple"><strong>Unseen Offensive</strong></font><br>
<strong>Devils Calling</strong> (Passive) -  when Scary Night is used, the cuff players cannot be debauchery or occupied.</p>

            <p>Overall I like this. Just think this one Passive is a bit too good. Other than that good job</p>
