    <description>There needs to be a harsher punishment for false reporting. I keep seeing people say things like &quot;this person threw for exeing me&quot; &quot;This prince threw cuz he sucked so bad&quot; and then reporting it or trying to get others reported. I KNOW these reports dont go through, but ffs, the whining from these people is ridiculous. Today I got reported from a sheriff who I exed (I was prince obviously) because it was d7 with no new info lol. He tried (and failed obviously) to get everyone to report me. According to him however, he DID report me. If he did, Im glad because you can track that report.

But really, Id love to see alot more of these snowflakes getting temp bans for false reporting. Just to cool them down. In a game of lying, making a bad call isnt throwing. *sigh*</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>But some people may be confused on where the line of bad play and throwing is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could use some clarification from the moderation team, to be fair. There are obvious cases of game throwing such as a CW claiming Sheriff and randomly accusing people of being Unseen, a Cult member outing all of their cult in their logs, or a GK using OE on the Prince when the NK is not a Possessor. The problem comes with less cut-and-dry cases such as a Butler yolo poisoning where the move is either a bad strategy or borderline game throwing.</p>

            <p>Check out <span class="hashtag">#justice</span> in the discord. It has something akin to that. I have seen people that I have personally reported represented there.</p>

            <p>I actually would too. Maybe they should open up a report listing showing all reports (with names blacked out if they want anonymous?) and their decisions? That would let people browse the decisions and see what they are judging to be throwing or not.</p>

            <p>I am sure that intentionally false reports are getting punished, but it is really hard to draw the line on what that exactly means. If reporters get frequently punished for misreporting, you create a culture where noone will report anymore, which completely kills the system. I am curious to know what the percentage of reports that lead to an actual punishment would be. That should provide some insight on how serious this problem is.</p>
