    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/tiny-buff-to-princess-survivability/65916</link>
    <description>Just thought this might be a good idea to make Princess slightly more survivable and help her be a little different from other investigative classes.

_**Will o&#39; Wisp:**_ Tells you if the target attacks anyone tonight. Only detects attacks that count as visiting. **If the victim of the attack is you, the attack will be prevented.**

It&#39;s a small buff, but it helps Princess stay alive if they got good intuition or an evil avoided being lynched/was pardoned, but it still has ways for evil to get around it (not to mention the limited charges).</description>

            <p>Yeah that’s the technically correct way to put it, since a barriered Princess would wisp a framed fool as using a social ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flirt reads a specific pre-existing trait from a class. Ability’s do not have types so reading them requires you to assign them. So yes it is more arbitrary than flirt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arbitrary means based on personal preference rather than logical reasoning.  I’m not suggesting we classify abilities according to what I think “feels right” but rather according to the same logic that currently classifies classes.  I already posted some examples using Mastermind, Cult Leader, Paladin, and Knight.  There’s nothing arbitrary about it.  I think I explained my reasoning well.</p>

            <p>I would still consider Hide/Self-Care as Support abilities, as they do protect people in one way or another. And Frame would be a Social ability, not Killer. This isn’t just for Fool, but also Scorned</p>

            <p>Despite both those objections, this upgraded wisp would still be more useful and interesting than the current one, and would make Princess capable of catching a Mastermind claiming Sheriff or a Cult Leader claiming Paladin (which she cannot do right now).</p>
<p><strong>Mastermind</strong><br>
Convert: Special<br>
Foresight: Investigative</p>
<p><strong>Cult Leader</strong><br>
Convert: Special<br>
Eradicate: Killer</p>
<p><strong>Paladin</strong><br>
Test Faith: Investigative<br>
Smite: Killer (instead of support, so that a Cult Leader caught eradicating could claim he used Smite).</p>
<p>Abilities which don’t have an obvious type could be classified differently than the other ability, for the sake of keeping things interesting. For example Defend is arguably both killer and support, but since Coldsteel is clearly killer we’d call it support.</p>
<p><strong>Knight</strong><br>
Defend: Support<br>
Coldsteel: Killer</p>
<p>It would also be fun to have Fool’s Frame classify as killer!</p>
<p><strong>Fool</strong><br>
Hide: ?<br>
Frame: Killer</p>

            <p>I think if wisp gave you the exact ability type it would address your concerns.  Instead of merely narrowing it down to two.</p>
<p>With this you could wisp a Mastermind using a special ability (convert), proving he isn’t Sheriff.  Unless you wisped him on Foresight night (investigative).</p>
<p>If someone claimed Knight and you wisped them using a Killer ability, they would have to claim they used Coldsteel instead of defend.</p>
<p>It’s basically the same as current wisp except better.</p>

<p>e.g. if you wisp a phys and he heals someone, you will be told he used a sup/soc ability<br>
same for knight defend, but if knight CS it will say kill/off ability etc</p>

            <p>Yeah, with Prince and a Neutral Special type, you could allow the Will o Wisp to just determine exact class type (plus another minor utility).</p>

            <p>We could carry this over to the other thread? Because we’re not talking about Princess survivability anymore</p>

            <p>That might be best as a Neutral Special class? I’ve been discussing with a friend now Neutrals need another Merc/Alch/Inq type (Neutral “Benign” if you will) to counter the “Neuts Out” mentality that encourages to kill all Neutrals just in case (and is often actually effective).</p>
<p>Having a Neutral Special that can perform a wide array of services for BD would definitely help in that regard.</p>

            <p>This made me think of a class which would have like 5/6 night abilites that are 1 use for being able to sub in for other classes. While other classes can still do it better than them</p>

            <p>Fair enough, I see no reason why Prince can’t be a Special class type. It sure fits the bill.</p>

            <p>Foresight would show as that a player is not convertible for Prince, not that they’re Special.</p>
