            <p>The reason I say Possessor can <em>safely</em> avoid this late game is because that coincides with the time when there are no Knights, bears, or Observers - or when Possessor has enough information to play around them (possibly by Puppet Stringing a known Killer class).</p>

</aside>
<p>Currently 1 of possessors few benefits is the fact that he doesn’t kill himself, he get’s other to do it for him so he doesn’t risk running into Knight, Hunter, Observer etc. You’re idea of “Just use yourself” makes him vulnerable to everyone he’s meant to avoid</p>

<p>You’re idea of deceiving Exhume by showing the targets class instead of possessor is actually a nerf to him<br>
Someone dying to observer n1 proves possessor game and also shows there’s at least 1 observer in the game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current Exhume already proves Possessor game, so no nerf there.  And proving the existence of a class early game is pretty useless to BD.  Possessor can safely avoid proving this late game (where it matters) by Puppet Stringing himself.</p>
