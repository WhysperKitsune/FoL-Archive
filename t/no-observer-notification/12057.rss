    <title>No observer notification</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/no-observer-notification/12057</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Followed 16. It said you will follow 16 tonight. Then when night turned to day, it said nothing. Not even you were occupied or prevented. Just no further notification. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
It shoulda said who 16 visited and who visited 16
Or that I was occupied
Or prevented 
Or literally ANYTHING

#### Steps to reproduce:
Only happened once

#### Comments:
Devs, go into the last game that I played. Im getting offline for a while so it should be my last game. It happened N1

Oh also if you go into my last game, either the assassin or reaper had a penis for his deathnote. So you can see that too.</description>

            <p>No there was only a reaper. I actually accused him of being a fool because you jailed him the night I observed him, you had to correct me. But regardless, if he’s a fool and hides, I would get a notification, like the notification I got when you jailed him. I mean it literally said nothing at the end of the night. Last thing it ever said was you will follow 16 tonight.</p>

            <p>I was actually in that game too. I was prince and got recharged twice by the CWs.<br>
And the person who drew the inappropriate Death note was the assassin.<br>
Also was there a fool in that game? They might have hid.</p>
