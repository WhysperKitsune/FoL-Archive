    <title>Possessor facelift bugged</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-facelift-bugged/53857</link>
    <description>I facelifted myself as Hunter. My number was 16
those night i jumped into Observer, number 8.
The game says i was hunter, all annoucement fine.
At the right panel bugged into my target. So its showed up like this | My name(observer)
This must be | My name(Hunter)

of course all can saw it was a jump.

other infos: 
i bleeding at the night when i jumped
i was attacked at the night when i jumped.

i think it is abnormal.</description>
