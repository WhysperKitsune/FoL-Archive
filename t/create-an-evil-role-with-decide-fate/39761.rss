    <title>Create an evil role with Decide Fate</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/create-an-evil-role-with-decide-fate/39761</link>
    <description>We were discussing the danger of voting-for-roles in another thread when I came up with this idea.

It would be interesting to have an evil role with the ability to Decide Fate (for guilty only, although if they&#39;re an NK with no allies there wouldn&#39;t be any real harm in letting them decide Innocent if they really want to).  This would deter VFRs, since you&#39;d be exposing any important role to get Decided to death without warning.  Additionally, if this evil role&#39;s Decide Fate was indistinguishable from the king&#39;s from the perspective of the court (&quot;The King or an EvilRoleName has decided...&quot;), it could lead to additional chaos by providing potential cover for evil kings who Decide evilly, or by allowing this evil role to frame a good king (forcing them to waste their own Decide to demonstrate that the first one wasn&#39;t them.)

Probably only one shot of Decide Fate would be enough, although if VFR ever becomes a severe problem they could get more.  Although this would obviously be powerful, its power could be adjusted depending on what role it&#39;s given to - eg. if it were an NK, that NK&#39;s killing ability overall could be factored into this, and using it would potentially out who the NK is; if it&#39;s a converted role, again, using it could potentially out yourself as converted.</description>

            <p>Maybe as a possessor style day ability. Like puppet strings during the day. Only works on the king, consumes the king’s decide fate. Or, just give it to the possessor anyways. He needs to be buffed! /s ;p</p>

            <p>If this does get implemented, it should be a neutral, and only guilty, to avoid them openly claiming, and for Inno to be confirmed king</p>

            <p>Sure, but again, it depends who has it.  In the hands of an NK who is balanced around it, it could be reasonable.</p>

            <p>The problems with Evil King as the <span class="bbcode-i">sole</span> evil role with Decide Fate are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only one Evil King can exist at a time, and there’s only a 33% chance of him appearing at the start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, an Evil King who uses Decide Fate to kill someone who was obviously innocent gets instalynched.  We need a role that can do this from the shadows so it’s more of a threat (and to provide at least a little cover for the Evil Kings so they’re more likely to do it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you’re moderately sure the king is BD, there’s no risk.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea here is to make the risk of a rogue Decide Fate much more serious - something that the court will seriously worry about in a way that would deter them from voting people up frivolously.</p>
