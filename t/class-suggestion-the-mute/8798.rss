    <title>[Class suggestion] The Mute</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-mute/8798</link>
    <description>Class name: The Mute

Alignment: Neutral

Goal: Live to see the Unseen,cult or a neutral win the game

Passive Ability: Cannot speak however can send death note pictures to override the next killings death note. When Converted this class will appear converted to cult and unseen however will remain the mute.

Day ability: Force a player to change their language. Targeted player will Speak a different language for today&#39;s length. (Could possibly implement google translate technology)

Night ability 1: The sound of silence, Your passivity and lack of sound convinces anyone who visits you that there is nobody there giving them a &quot;You could not complete this action&quot; Prompt (Immune to death at night including reaper immunity bypass)

Night ability 2, I just want to be left alone: Empower a player, If that player is neutral they will be immune to a public execution tomorrow. (If executed &quot;But it failed&quot; Will show up in letters above the players head after voting.) Doing this successfully 3 times will also serve as the mutes win condition. THIS INCLUDES TARGETING THE MUTE. (Using this ability will still leave the mute open to being killed at night)

No converted form. Class by all rights should be unique.</description>

            <p>Clarified the second ability. Didn’t want to make mute invincible but make him immune to all forms of death and protect others.</p>

            <p>I wouldnt trust google translate this much. <a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@Vandalay</a> had good idea to make it speak pure gyberish, in my opinion it would be much better than speak another language.</p>
<p>Google translate might even translate some everyday words to something bad in another language, we don’t want that to be happen…</p>
<p>Otherwise this is really neat suggestion, <span class="hashtag">#neutsmatter</span></p>

            <p>That is possible. Back in Beta we had a “Black wine” Mechanic that did exactly that.</p>

<p>This would need to just be switched to speaks pure gyberish. Being polylingual should not be an advantage in game.</p>
