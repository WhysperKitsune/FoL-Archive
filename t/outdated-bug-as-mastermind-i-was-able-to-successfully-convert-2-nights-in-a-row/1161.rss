    <title>[Outdated] BUG: As Mastermind, I was able to successfully convert 2 nights in a row</title>

    <description>**What Happened**

I was able to convert 2 consecutive Assassins, two nights in a row.

**What SHOULD have happened**

The Mastermind&#39;s conversion ability is supposed to go on 1 night cooldown after a successful conversion.

**Reproduction**

Be Mastermind in Closed Alpha build v0.8.17

Convert a target on night 3 into Assassin
Get the original Assassin jailed for night 4
Convert new target (in this case it was a Butler) into another Assassin on Night 4

**Comments:**

Ignore what the gamer timer says in the center.  See the chat for the results.  Notice my successful conversion that occurred on night 3, and notice how I still have the capability to convert (which I successfully did convert) on night 4.
