    <description>&gt; [color=red]Mithras, Cult, Special[/color] :sparkles:
&gt; =
&gt; 
&gt; **Mithras class is unique**
&gt; 
&gt; **Passive: Dark Friendship: talk to the cult at night**
&gt; 
&gt; **Passive: Undead: Cant vote, be killed, be visited, or look alive to other players, will also die in 3 days**
&gt; 
&gt; **Day Ability: Gaze: gaze into a player&#39;s eye causing them to be unable to use their day abilities**
&gt; 
&gt; **Day Ability: Pally Stop: Stop the paladin from using his night abilities in the next night, use it on someone who isn&#39;t paladin and nothing will happen to him, 1 use only!**
&gt; 
&gt; **Night Ability: Bite: 1 use only! bite into a player&#39;s arm causing them to bleed.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Night Ability: Power of Mithras: control a player to visit another player, goes through target change immunity they also will not be informed of this**
&gt; 
&gt; **Ritualist now has a day ability making him able to make the Mithras poss a dead Cult  but in order to do this he has to sacrifice himself, this ability is called Forming Demons, this ability can only be used once if a Ritualist has already done this the other Ritualist will not be able to use it for the rest of the game**
&gt; 
&gt; **Lore:**
&gt; **The Ritualist will now help the Mithras be free by sacrificing himself to make the Mithras come to the throne of lies world! (Yeah I&#39;m kinda terrible at making lore)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments**
&gt; **I think it&#39;s a bit strange to talk about the Mithras but not adding him in the game as a class maybe adding this will make a lil more sense or possibly adding something different that is still called the Mithras and part of the cult, also when the Mithras posses a player the player will still be that player he will just transform into a bot or something** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Suggestions/Feedback would be appreciated**</description>

            <p>Yup, I see what you’re talking about I fixed everything, now pally claim isn’t a suicide</p>
<p>Now Ritualist isn’t OP since he dies while using his ability and other Ritualists can’t use it too</p>
<p>I am not sure I agree that the Mithras shouldn’t be a player, if you really want the Mithras not to be a player I can rename it to maybe anything else and change the lore a bit</p>
<p>and Now he can only kill one person but it takes a while</p>

            <p>This has adverse effects on the Cult’s kills per night. While I’m not opposed to Death Knights, you can kill at least one extra person, a lot more if there are visitors. It also makes it suicide to claim Paladin.</p>
<p>Also Mithras should never be a player. He is a god.</p>
<p>Also Ritualist doesn’t need this buff, and even more expendable.</p>

            <p>Hmm… really? the last games I remember playing as cult we got completely destroyed, maybe Ritualist sacrifices himself to help summon the Mithras and maybe Ritualist can do this only once also other Ritualists can not do this if one has already done that, also make the Mithras live 1 day only, possibly remove pally death and replace it with pally occupation stopping the pally from doing anything the next night</p>

            <p>Cult’s winrates are fine now. They have insane KPN and very powerful classes with the only drawback of limited survivability, which considering they source their killls from sacrificing other cultists, they are in a fine spot. Would you want to play against a faction with a potential 5.5 KPN? (on average, because Rage-like abilities kill 1.5 people on average.) Bam! Half the BD wiped out in one night!</p>
<p>Also Ritualists will be OP afer this you wouldn’t want any other convert</p>

            <p>Well you have to know who the pally is first, and even then he can still be guarded, jailed, or healed out of it</p>
<p>Well i don’t see it as a real problem, cult barely can win anyway, it is only 1 use too, maybe you can only have it kill 1 person or just make it do the same thing as hunters ability which is wolf</p>
<p>Maybe instead of BD, only dead cult can be turned, lots of cult die anyway</p>
<p>For the last one, well it’s already in the game, phys can rezz a person to make him become dk</p>

            <p>Mithras’s purpose is to be the Cult’s god, their idol.<br>
Having an omniscient kill that targets only Paladins is very swingy. Plus, it’s just kind of a ‘click this button once the Paladin claims’ thing.<br>
Rage bumps Cult’s Kill power to be even more ridiculous than it already is. 2KPN with a potential 3KPN from bleeding is just about as much as I’m able to deal with. Also, being converted after death will make a lot of people very salty.</p>
<p>There’s also the conceptual problem of the fact that the dead should stay dead in my opinion.<br>
Sorry, this class probably won’t work.</p>
