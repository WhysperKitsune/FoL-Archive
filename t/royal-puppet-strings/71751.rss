    <description>Let Poss be able to use Puppet Strings to control the King. This would raise Poss&#39; winrate from being the absolute worst NK right now to a more balanced state, as well as increasing the possibility of dead Kings due to running them into Knights, but most importantly, destroying the King whisper meta. (Or at least making it a major risk)</description>

            <p>this is to discourage people from whispering to King</p>
<p>and Knights could just guard the King if they susoect anyone but then the poss can just control people into attacking the King so there’s WIFOM even at N1</p>

<p>This isn’t comparable to what I’m talking about with the king. You’re comparing an ability in ToL to my suggestion that the Possessor doesn’t believe it is socially acceptable to possess the king.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t make sense “flavorwise” for Possessor to read whispers, either.  That ability only exists to counter possword meta, for balance.  Balance concerns in my opinion should also continue to not allow Possessor to puppet string King.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t even make sense flavorwise why the Possessor CAN’T puppet strings the king. Does the Possessor have a moral code for royalty or some strange respect for the king?</p>

            <p>Oh and here is a risk: If an observer See’s the King visit someone then he also knows that the Possessor visited the King. If the Observer follows the King then he will find out both if the King was possessed and if so who could have done it</p>

            <p>I oppose this suggestion.  If Poss wants to get King’s claims he should have to Possess him.  Puppet stringing the king is almost no risk but extremely high reward.  I strongly oppose this.</p>
