    <title>[RESOLVED] Delete Old Account Create Request / Name Change</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/resolved-delete-old-account-create-request-name-change/1117</link>
    <description>What happened: I made an account through the name( moparsniper ) and the email would never show up. I attempted to make another account by the name of (moparsniper1) and it worked. 

I wanted to know if the name could be changed or if the old account request could be deleted so that I can change my name to (moparsniper).</description>
