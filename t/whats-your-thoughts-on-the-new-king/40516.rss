    <title>What&#39;s your thoughts on the New King?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/whats-your-thoughts-on-the-new-king/40516</link>
    <description>In my opinion the New King is.... really bad. There is no reason to remove Allies from King, it was a GREAT ability and made it easy for (BD/Neut/Evil) King to distinguish who is who. Now if you use an ability on the wrong person, you might just get executed for it.</description>

            <p>i believe that <a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a> has already mentioned this , but giving an evil king a lower chance of spawning actually buffs him.</p>
<p>Less chance of spawning = more likely chance of good king = more chance of trust , and assumption of good king.<br>
You can try a smokescreen tactic , and observe the people who dont respond , then ask the people you didnt that you might force exe them , and if they have typical claims like princess/ cw / knight etc. you may have your man.</p>

            <p>It’s really a shame that it is basically no longer possible for Evil Kings to find and communicate with Evils anymore. Evil King was once fun, exciting, and difficult, now it’s very boring. All you do is sit on your ass and execute the Prince/Sheriff as soon as you are given the opportunity. Evil King is practically autopilot.</p>
<p>This situation is made even worse by the fact that Evil King only has a 20% change to spawn They took one of the game’s most intriguing roles and utterly gutted it.</p>

            <p>I don’t like king having kills at all. I much prefer pretty much any other type of ability other than Kills on the king. For one it makes neutrals life even harder (especially when numbers are lower) to win which I don’t think was needed at all.</p>
<p>And for two It becomes even more of a problem for who to trust as bd. I know there have been people who have argued that the day phase answers this but I strongly disagree given conversion is a thing in every game among other things.</p>

            <p>OK with the percentage switches and the notes for king executions I think this works great. Never had so much fun playing king. No more getting exed d4 because you found 3 BDs or had a check prevented or found someone who died. No more getting killed by NK on n1 or n2 because they know you’re the one most likely to unmask them as neut. And with an 80% chance you’re BD or at least neut you get plenty of info to work with. It feels more like what a king should be, getting information from your subjects while also having power to protect or execute them.</p>

            <p>I think he got across much better what I was trying to say in this thread, orange.  Also, I obviously forgot the  whole prevents visits part, which is huge. Burrito does have a point about engineering the block, but then the fake claim still has to try and guess who attempted to visit him.  I’d say, basically, that sheriff is now the embodiment of King’s old Allies.  It may take an extra day or two to confirm absolutely, but once he is, it’s totally uncontestable outside of claiming framed… and unlike King, he’s guaranteed to be BD.</p>

            <p>Prevent visitors and learn the name of those that try. You will be alerted if an Unseen member tries. 3 uses.</p>
<p>It’s whisp on steroids… (minus informing an extra person)… It’s a prevention (so visitors know you did it). You learn who visited you… AND if any of them were unseen. So you out yourself publicly to the court… and if you are using one of those 3 uses… anything the unseen tries to do at night, outs and kills them… meanwhile any friendly visits basically confirm you… knight tries to guard but is prevented, he knows you are indeed sheriff, and you know he is indeed knight.</p>

            <p>If I remember right, it tells sheriff everyone who visits him that night, and if any of them are unseen. So basically wisp, but without the second party notification.  So it can be fabricated, but there’s no way for unseen to fake it accurately in logs except by using other unseen who can back it up.  It could be lied about, but if anyone is alive who visited, it falls apart.</p>

            <p>Ok, yeah, that’s a good point. Sheriff can’t punish a cc like the other two, so there is a case there.  Edit: Surveillance gives them a bit more provability if anyone visiting from logs is still alive, or if sheriff has one left to use that night.  Unseen’s only option there is to have another unseen back them up, which gives you a Trainwreck if you go down.</p>

</aside>
<p>a CC can work… if it’s down to the wire… or you are a disposable member. I’m a huge fan of sacrifice plays… but yeah you got competing sheriff claims… the BD should hang one. and if they are wrong, obviously hang/jailexe the other.</p>
<p>Admitted it isn’t as bad as prince or hunter that obviously will solve the conflict of claims personally.</p>

            <p>Sheriff is as confirmed as Prince.  There is simply no faking it anymore in an unseen game.  Nobugz: I thought they changed Defile?  That would be the one case where it is doable, but that seems very situational.  After looking back in patch notes, I have no idea why I thought they changed how Defile works. My bad.</p>

            <p>The King was ALWAYS unverifiable through checks, since he’s able to lie.  In fact, the new King actually does more to Nerf Evil/Cult king as before, he had a way to actually discover reasonably reliably an evil, and could use multiple whispers as cover to contact them and let them know.  Now he has to infer who his allies are just like most of BD. With or without allies, important roles should’ve always been hesitant to out to the king.  Also, nobugz: Unfortunately we now have an Infinite faction checker that always spawns with unseen and is now unconvertable AND unique.  That is the only part of this patch I really have a problem with.</p>

            <p>FYI I have played the new BD king. He is amazing to play and gets tons of info and can allow for lots of interesting dynamics (particularly with prince, hunter and knight)</p>

<p>“Roles” lol. Lesser important classes however are MORE likely to contact you so as to A: bait out your alignment, B: Coven themselves from yolorder and C: Allow themselves to be given direction like they already do.</p>

<p>You seem to be forgetting that a killing ability lets the king force someone to claim. You aren’t going to hold back your Sheriff claim to a king that will kill you anyways.</p>

            <p>The new king is a problem for BD. The problem is:</p>
<ol>
<li>King can no longer verify self through checks, meaning never trustworthy</li>
<li>Because kings are never trustworthy and can kill at night, important roles are unlikely to contact</li>
<li>Because important roles are afraid to contact king, king often lacks good information</li>
<li>King has lots of guards now but rarely knows who to use them on</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, I’ve played the new king as Evil and Neut and it was great fun both times. In the last game I won as the only unseen left because I was able to deduce prince and another bd in the endgame. The neut game I also won by working with unseen after they outed themselves late game. King is less suspected of being evil now that he has less ability to actually generate information.</p>
<p>I haven’t played BD king yet but I suspect it’s an overall bad position, unable to gather good information, unable to gain trust of BD, and afraid to use guard attack for fear of killing a BD.</p>
