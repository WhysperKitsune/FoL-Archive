    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fighting-he-could-be-fool-as-scorned/76217</link>
    <description>Just had a game where I marked two evils coincidentally but both time they got upped I saw the he could be fool remark popup. How do I go about convincing people they are actual evils and not a fool to get the exe I need and not left to prince?</description>

<p>I believe I remember referring to that particular update as “worst update NA” at the time, and I meant it</p>
<p>There’s so many better ways to do that, many of which are already in the game, that the silly WIFOM threat doesn’t even do its job there</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Hunter</h1>
<p>Wolf Companion is now a day ability.</p>
<p>Add a new passive, Food Supply, that prevents you from using Wolf Companion on the day after you used Bear Companion and prevents you from using Bear Companion the night after you used Wolf Companion.</p>
<p>Remove Retribution.</p>
<p>Make Hunter non-Unique.</p>
<p>Not strictly necessary, but I’d really prefer a weaker Hunter than can appear in games more often, and isn’t instantly a “vote each other” if somebody fake-claims it with a real one in the game.</p>

            <p>Yeah and I wish it wasn’t brought back. It doesn’t do a good job at preventing VFR anyways since like… Hunter’s will still claim on the stand?</p>

            <p>Because saying nothing is viable as Fool, it follows that saying nothing is viable as evil once everyone realises that is the meta.</p>
<p>So now we can theoretically have both evils AND fools sitting there being AFK, but somehow using epic reading skills we can tell them apart?</p>

            <p>The meta is common knowledge, if fools thinks it will allow him to win by being mute than you can put yourself in his shoes and realize it too, and you are back at the “d1 im evil please dont exe me in case im fool” strat which doesn’t work for reasons explained twice already.</p>

<p>Saying jack shit is a viable strategy to score wins as Fool.</p>

            <p>You misunderstand</p>
<p>What the majority does is what <em>was</em> the meta</p>
<p>What they don’t <em>is</em> the meta</p>
<p>It shifts and the cycle continues.</p>

            <p>Then the current meta tells you whether a mute is likely to be fool, so it’s still readable.</p>

            <p>So you are using the “afk but not really” strat as an example of an unreadable fool.</p>
<p>If you were right, either only fools would do this (revealing themselves to be fools), or evils would do it too, making this nothing more than an implicit “d1 evil claim” strat where only 17% of the suspects are actually fools and executing the mutes will result in a speedy victory even if a fool accidentally gets executed during the day.</p>
<p>Because this strat results in a speedy victory for bd, evils won’t just be mute … only fools … revealing themselves to be fools … so not even fools do it.</p>
<p>This means the example you’ve raised, in an attempt to prove that fool is unreadable, does not accomplish its purpose.</p>

            <p>Arguably yes</p>
<p>Talking too much will draw <em>too</em> much attention, especially if you’re bad at being scummy and try too hard</p>
<p>Using troll box outs your existence and should pretty much never be used as it’s not even necessary</p>
<p>Slanking gets investigatives on you and then it’s gg</p>
<p>Sure there are other ways to win but in the end just leaving your computer may just be the most reliable lmao</p>

<p>Okay but in a format of minutes instead of weeks the equivalent amount of talking is literal complete silence or like “hi” or something.</p>
<p>That isn’t even playing the game, yet it’s basically optimal strategy.</p>
