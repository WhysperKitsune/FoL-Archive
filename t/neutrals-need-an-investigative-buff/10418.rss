    <title>Neutrals need an investigative buff</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutrals-need-an-investigative-buff/10418</link>
    <description>Too many games Ive played recently have the &quot;Neuts out&quot; thing going for them.

I suggest that ALL neutrals have some sort of hiding ability to protect them from investigative roles. Not a permanent or infinite thing, but maybe even a 1 or 2x a game thing to at least give them a CHANCE.

Every time Ive played as a reaper or possessor, SOME investigative role has been able to out me within 3 days. Doesnt matter if I talk alot, or not at all. Having an ability that can hide you within the first 3 nights would REALLY help with being any of these neutral roles.

And ffs there needs to be something to stop this NEUTS OUT thing. Some reason to keep them in the game lol. As it is now, neither BD nor unseen/cult wants neutrals in the game.</description>

            <p>Bumping this again - Ive had 4 games as reaper and 2 as possessor, and at least HALF of those Ive been outed by d3 from some sort of investigator. These 2 classes NEED a buff of some sort to have any chance of winning even a bit more often.</p>

            <p>Rather than making neutrals more able to hide they should lower the amount of allies the starting king has because they are impossible to kill eairly</p>

            <p>The only threat to nks are observer and king. I do feel they need something to deal with king. I’ve seen enough ‘non-ally’ results in my time</p>
