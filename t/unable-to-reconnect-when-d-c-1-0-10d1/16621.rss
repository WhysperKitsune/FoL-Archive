    <title>Unable to Reconnect when D/C 1.0.10d1</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/unable-to-reconnect-when-d-c-1-0-10d1/16621</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

In earlier versions (prior to 1.0.9c), I was able to reconnect upon very brief disconnect. Now I am kicked back to the start menu after several seconds. Basically this is making the game unplayable for me at this point, it has happened in over half my games. Still happening in 1.0.10d1... Please help!

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Reconnecting to game.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Short period of disconnect, unable to reconnect to game in progress.
