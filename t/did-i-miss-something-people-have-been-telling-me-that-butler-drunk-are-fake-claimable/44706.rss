    <title>Did I miss something? People have been telling me that Butler/Drunk are fake claimable</title>

    <description>Seriously. Why? Butler and Drunk are super confirmable. Just target someone with anything and BAM! Your confirmed. Obviously it can make a decent last resort and if you are converted/invoker or something then sure that&#39;s fine. But a MM or starting assassin should not be claiming drunk.

If you do this or know why other&#39;s do then please explain because I don&#39;t get it.</description>

            <p>Wouldn’t that make everyone but Psychic, Noble and Prince claimable?</p>
<p>Actually that STILL wouldn’t answer the question because the Butler has a confirmable day ability!</p>

            <p>Nigh impossible unless you are the converted form (or Invoker converted from Killer). Too easy to prove. Worst claim for other classes.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard people saying stuff like “Assassins are always claiming drunk” or “Butler is a good MM claim” Or whatever. That’s what I am asking about.</p>
