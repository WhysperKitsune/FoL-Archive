    <description># The Hunt Is On

Adiart&#39;s military presence grew thin after The Blue Dragon&#39;s enemies gained new weapons for their arsenal. The Cult&#39;s greater threat meant they had to increase their protection and bring in a new weapon. Many came forward but there was one who stood out. With a hound at his side and a bear he&#39;d tamed, he was definitely something the Prince was looking for.

He impressed many of those at court with his ability to attack his enemies without killing them instantly, allowing for proper interogation, but even then, if they were untreated, they would die in the end. Many of the Blue Dragon enemies feared this man, as the nights were full of sounds of howling. The bear too, had growled in the night.

The looks he gives others was often stern and he would not be caught off guard, while wearing his hooded cloak and thick leather armour, movement was not restricted. Quick and sharp, his judgement was swift, for his accusers would be punished.</description>
