    <title>Blue Dragon king shouldn&#39;t have ANY investigative powers</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/blue-dragon-king-shouldnt-have-any-investigative-powers/8134</link>
    <description>At the moment, you either get an evil in the first 4 nights or get killed because you&#39;re evil. Why is the King of the kingdom the one who has to prove himself to everyone in the first few days or die?

Evil King - I am forced to find a member of my own team and get them killed. If I try to get a neutral killed, it can just turn out to be a Blue Dragon, in which case I die myself because I was wrong. But now that everyone thinks I&#39;m good, I&#39;m going to get killed by my own allies.

Neutral King - I am forced to join the Blue Dragon&#39;s side. If I try to remain neutral, I&#39;ll just get called an evil king and get executed. So It&#39;s basically Blue Dragon king, but I also have to survive to the end of the game.

His investigative results also promotes the awful &quot;Kill all neutrals&quot; game play, since you only see if people are not allies, making it worth it to just kill all neutrals (The fool isn&#39;t enough to stop this behaviour).

The visits should also be immune to observer, to avoid them instantly knowing the king isn&#39;t Blue dragon (If it isn&#39;t already)</description>

            <p>Agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/kyle">@Kyle</a> , this is a good change for the Evil King being able to ally with neutrals.</p>
<p>I’m still not liking how games are completely reliant on the BD King’s investigation results. Makes for very generic games.</p>

            <p>was talking about it on a different subject, but what if we go one step foward there. What if good king couldn’t find neutrals. King going neuts out would prove him neutral or evil.</p>

            <p>What if the BD King could have a 1 use night ability that protects EVERYBODY from conversion but can only be used Night 3 or later (similar to Hunter).</p>
<p>It would create an incentive to let the King live but also be unconfirmable, yet powerful.</p>

<p>I’d like to see Decide Fate changed so that he can just hang anyone on his own, using up the execution for the day and instantly hanging the target. It could still be used in the old way but it would be far far stronger and actually scary. That would also mean VFR would be shit as if Prince/Priest claims an evil Prince may just hang them immediately.</p>

            <p>Give the starting king something else which won’t be used for proof. Or they could give BD king a jester like ability. If the King is executed, but turns out to be blue dragon, X happens.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Royal blood line is useless, meaning that evils can easily take over the role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New kings can’t be voted again, so if they’re evil, the BD is in big trouble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first voter for the king is forcibly executed the next day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment the king doesn’t feel like a king, he doesn’t feel powerful, it feels like you’re at the mercy of everyone else, until you get an evil hung.</p>

            <p>Oh? Then I must have experience as Evil King.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, none of Unseen members won’t have to do the bussing thing and takes experienced player as Unseen/Cult to distinguish king’s true allegiance.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have taken the hint and will do the same later on and replace with one of their converted members which I am ok with that.</p>
<p>Or they kill me and let BD become next king.</p>

            <p>Being the Evil King can definitely incur a lot of accidental gamethrowing reports. An evil team member with no night chat with their own allies, the Evil King will be “gamethrowing” a lot.</p>
<p>Their current rule system for bussing is not sustainable for the long term health of this game, and it is concerning to everyone.</p>

            <p>He’s kinda twisting what the dev’s have said on a different topic, they more or less implied if possible co-ordinate your bussing and get consent, and these things will be judged on a case by case basis with “you must get concent 100% of the time or you are game-throwing no exceptions”</p>

<p>If you are an evil king and you point at another evil and get them hung when knowing they are evil you are game throwing apparently … ( unless you have asked their permission first )</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not at all, getting one confirmed Unseen eliminated because you can verify Sheriff’s claim and check as King give BD the benefit of the doubt that you are not evil king and Unseen will able to convert again and kill at the same time. The Sheriff will have no idea the king is subtly gaining Sheriff’s trust.</p>
<p>Losing two BD members in single night means a lot.</p>
<p>It’s not gamethrowing as long it’s not MM post night 3.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@Vandalay</a> is spot on with all their points, IMO.</p>
<p>Taking away the BD’s King ability will encourage BD to hang the King ASAP as there is a low chance he started BD and he doesn’t have a useful invest ability anyway, whereas a Neutral or Evil King can gather allies with their invest ability and become an actual threat. The risk/reward of keeping a “I’m BD King I swear” claim is much too high for almost no reward.</p>
<p>We need to replace BD King’s ability with something that helps BD.</p>
<p>How about this: BD King’s guards now also prevent conversion as well as preventing death at night. Is that enough?</p>

            <p>How about this. The starting king can use both of his day ability’s on the same day.</p>

            <p>I’m not denying the problem, but I’m pointing out the second problem that comes to light when you eliminate the public investigation callouts.</p>
<p>Mathmatically speaking, the starting king is a high risk for BD. He is far more likely to be non-BD than any random shot in the dark. Meanwhile the random royal bloods, are far more likely to be BD than any random shot in the dark. As they couldn’t have started non-bd, unseen/cult have only had 1-2 chances to convert by day 3, meaning it is unlikely they hit a royal blood, and even if they had, he’s probably going in an election against 1-3 BD royal bloods.</p>
<p>Right now the reason why we don’t universally kill the king ASAP, is simple, even if he’s evil or neutral. he’s likely to deliver usable intelligence for those first 4 days. If you replace him, you don’t have any investigations.</p>
<p>So the real issue is, what do we do to not encourage the BD to kill the king by default?</p>
