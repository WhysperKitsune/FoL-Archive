<p>Priest <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/shield.png?v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:"><br>
Night Ability: Channel: Use the primary power of a dead person. You can only use each corpse once, and you may not utilize Killer or Special classes. Unlimited uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unseen and Cult may always speak to their allies at night, regardless whether they are dead or alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the reason behind it, they are the only ones that can speak to each other while alive. it’s fun as a prince to tell somone my number before i execute them, or as a hunter to have a knight death note so evil won’t know my class after attacking me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>physician: Day Ability: Reanimate: Turn all dead Blue Dragon into Awakened Souls. 1 use. Give them all 2 charges of Dark Steel if they are already Awakened Souls. 2 uses, charge only used when successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t like it at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Ability: Alter Link: Instantly add someone to the Astral Network. Will fail if they are another Mystic or part of another Astral Network. Maximum four people in the network. Will remove someone if they are already in the network. Unlimited uses, 1 day cool down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mystic is perfect as it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hunter: Day Ability: Wolf: Make someone bleed. They will die in two nights unless healed. 2 uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the hunter will beome unconfirmable at night and confirmable at day in any unseen game. what’s the point? also, 2 nights for hunter is too slow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>merc: Guards no longer notify contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incoming, kill every merc. merc are only confrimable if their target is confirmable, so now every merc should be executed because it’s a neut that only help bd if he is really a merc and his target is bd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You no longer learn if you failed to occupy or redirect someone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>its make the game boring for drunk and butlers</li>
<li>it’s a big nerf that bd doesn’t need.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The Butler/Servant can bypass the occupy immunity of the Prince, Possessor, and Sorcerer the first time they occupy any of these classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t like it at all. there is a reason those classes are occupy immune. Drunk can do it but with his secondery ability.</p>

<p>Illusionist shouldn’t have this.  People won’t claim if they could be converted.  I know that this psychic is for coordination, but they can’t coordinate if they don’t know what people are.  Also remove the cooldown.</p>
