    <description>&gt; # [color=steblue] The Sergeant[/color]
&gt;**[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Investigative[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (From The Shadows)** : Make a bird follow targeted player and see if they left the room the following night.(Infinite Uses - May Not Target The Same Player Twice In A Row)
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Curiosity)** : Find Out What The Targeted Player Did Last Night.(Infinite Uses - Not Usable Night 1 , Can NOT See Attacks and Conversion &amp; Not Usable On The Same Target Twice in a row.)
&gt;**Night Ability (Master of Battle)** : Find Out If Your Targeted Player Was Attacked Or Healed.(Infinite Uses - May Not Target The Same Target Twice In A Row)

&gt;# [color=purple]The Commander[/color]
&gt;**[color=purple]Unseen Investigative[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Confusion)** : Target A Player And He Won&#39;t Be Able To Speak The Next Day.(2 Uses)
&gt;**Day Ability (Veteran)** : Make Yourself Look Not Suspicious Tonight.(1 Use)
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Revolt)** : Find Out Who Visited Your Fellow Unseen Last Night.(Infinite Uses)
&gt;**Night Ability (Treachery)** : Find Out If Your Targeted Player Is A Killer or Support Class.(Infinite Uses)

Notes : 1 | This Is How Sergeant&#39;s &quot;From The Shadows&quot; Ability Is Gonna Work : 
1) You Target A Player Day 1(for example)
2) You Use Your Night Ability Night 1 As Usual AND THEN You get Results From Your Day Ability.
2 | I know The Sergeant&#39;s Night Abilities Kind of Contradict Each Other BUT He Is An Investigative Class. ( I Made It So It Has &quot;The Bird&quot; Ability From The Old Observer And Kind Of Has Noble&#39;s Abilities)
3 | Now Converting A Sergeant May Seem Like A Bad Idea And In Some Cases It Is BUT If One of Your Unseen Has Caught The Attention Of The Court , Then The Commander Will Give Vital Information To The Assassin/MM About Who To Kill/Convert.</description>

<p>Way too broken. This instantly narrows down a player’s classes, confirms Blue Dragon members, and also instantly outs scum with no defense at all.</p>

<p>Kind of useless, really. You’ll rarely see your target attacked, and if you do it’s kind of obvious as they’ll be dead the next night. Plus, you’ll rarely, if ever, find a night immune target this way.</p>
