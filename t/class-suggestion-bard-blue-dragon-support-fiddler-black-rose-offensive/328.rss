    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-bard-blue-dragon-support-fiddler-black-rose-offensive/328</link>
    <description>**Bard:**
Day Ability 1: ??? of Glory (3 uses)
No one can use day abilities for the next 20 seconds.
Night Ability 1: Serenade of the Lake (2 uses)
The target falls into a trance, causing them to leave the castle. They are occupied that night, but cannot be killed.

**Fiddler:**
Day Ability 1: Fiddle (Infinite Use)
Targeted player cannot hear correctly (the text is jumbled) for the next 20 seconds.
Night Ability 1: Early Bird(?) (3 uses)
The Fiddler wakes a player up early. The next day ability that target uses instead targets a random player.

More later.</description>

<p>The Butler can send anonymous whispers, Publicly. (Others will see “Someone whispered to ______”). why would the butler have this if everyone was able to whisper? hate to say it but not everyone is able to whisper. that is why there are Social powers that let you do something along these lines</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure everyone can whisper to everyone, it’s just that the Butler has special whisper abilities.</p>
<p>And the other abilities aren’t immediately invalidated if one ability is bad (─‿‿─)</p>
