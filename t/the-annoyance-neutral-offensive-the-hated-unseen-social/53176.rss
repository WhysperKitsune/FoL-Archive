    <description>The Annoyance (Neutral Offensive)

Passive 1:Bounty:If you are killed at night whoever killed you gets another use of their limited ability. If they have no limited ability they gain a Death immunity Pierce for there next attack. Does not work for Blue dragon killers.

Passive 2:Run away: if someone tries to kill you for the first three days you shall hide. Preventing them from visiting you. Does not use any Hide charges.

Day ability 1:Hear all whispers for the current day(2 uses)


Night ability 1:Stare: you stare at the target long enough for them to get  occupied for the night(unlimited uses)

Night ability 2:Hide: Hide from all visitors(3 uses)

Goal:Survive

Converted into the Hated (Unseen social Ik I changed it to social other classes do it to GET over it)

Passive:Bounty: If the Neutral killing/Blue Dragon use a killing ability on you, they will gain the charge they used back if it succeeded.

Day ability 1:Troll box(Unlimited uses)

Day ability 2:Hear all whispers for the current day(3 uses)

Night ability 1:Silence agreement: Choose a target. You agree to not annoy him if he does not talk at all the next day. The target can not talk.(1 use) (can vote and use abilities)

Night ability 2:Your up late:Keep the target awake all night. Occupys them. (Unlimited uses)

I came up with this class just for fun. Tell me what you think.
Will be making more convertible neutral classes. Leave suggestions!!!</description>

            <p>BD get occupied for the night killing/jailing them, that’s another night that the Prince doesn’t find or jail the MM for a claim. Sure, the knight armor MIGHT be useful, although it’s more likely that they’ll kill him before he gets to use it. Also the assassin/NK gets to remove another 2 BD while the The Hated is jailed. It’s doubtful that he’ll really do anything or that it’ll matter if Prince manages to get 4 successful executes off anyway since the unseen is probably getting destroyed. The passive should be something reliable and more useful than the current one IMO.</p>

            <p>Its passive is suppose to HELP BD by letting prince kill a unseen for free. Knight gets another protect armor thing if he hasn’t used it already. Hunter another wolf. You kill a evil for free what’s not to love.</p>

            <p>Passive is useless, sure it’s good for evil since Cult get another eradicate and assassin gets another 241, so yeah, pretty good for evils kinda. But what does the converted passive do for BD?  Only thing that benefits them is that prince gets to keep his execute(but still wastes a night) since knight CS is infinite(unless hunter wolf counts as well). Also he hides for first 3 nights and has another 3 hides, basically letting him live to day 6 at the very least. Most games are pretty much over by then and it doesn’t seem like a very fun class to play IMO. Would suggest changing the passive to something different(no idea to what yet).</p>
