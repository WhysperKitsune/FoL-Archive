    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Basilisk (NK)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-basilisk-nk/70528</link>
    <description>&gt; # [color = &quot;olive&quot;] The Basilisk [/color] :shield: 
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Killer [/color]** 
**Scaled Armor (Passive)** - The Basilisk is immune to death at night, immune to occupation or redirection, nor can she be bled.
**Drake&#39;s Senses (Passive)** - The Basilisk will be alerted of every player who visited her during the night and will learn of their classes.
**Voice of Stone (Day)** - Choose a stoned player, whisper a phrase and it will show as if the targeted play said it. Can be used at most five times per day. - Infinite uses
**Stone Gaze (Night)** - Turns a player to stone. Does not bypass death immunity but bypasses healing. Players who are turned to stone will be seen as alive until they are either attacked or executed. Stoned players are not counted when factoring in the amount of votes to put a player on trial. - Infinite uses 
**Gorgon Stance (Night)** - Uses Stone Gaze on every player that visits the Basilisk at night while also bypassing their immunities. - 3 uses 
*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult and any neutrals that dare stand in your way.*

Theme: A neutral killer with a focus on creating and maintaining pseudo-reaped player.
Survivability: Scaled armor covers most of the issues that can kill a NK, meanwhile Gorgon Stance can safely kill enemies who try to visit the Basilisks without fears of Knights/Bears.
Late-game: Stoning as many players as possible will make it easy to cause mislynches and will also prevent information from flowing, making it harder to find you.

</aside>
<p>What about changing this to “visited” and letting them count against the total amount of votes? So there’s still something you can do about it, but you can’t just let the statues pile up.</p>
