    <description>**Welcome to [Misc] Donner Dinner Party I**

*Who&#39;s safe when there are cannibals hiding among you? That&#39;s the question at the heart of this fast-paced game of social deduction in which cannibals and pioneers face off in a fight for survival. Set in the winter of 1846, players are members of the ill-fated Donner Party wagon train, stranded atop a mountain with no food. Who will avoid becoming tonight&#39;s dinner and make it off the mountain alive? And who are the suspicious scoundrels hungry for human flesh?*

Hosted by @KyoDaz

This setup follows simple forum rules.

**Gameplay**

Camp Dinner phases will be 24 hours long or until all players have contributed.
Voting Phases will be 48 hours long or until all players have voted.
All actions must be done in your rolecard.
Everyone is given a supply card at the beginning of the game.
The town alignment are the [color=lightblue]Pioneers[/color].
The mafia alignment are the [color=brown]Cannibals[/color].
The [color=brown]Cannibals[/color] are aware of each other however will never have a private chat.
Flavor claiming is strictly prohibited. This includes fake flavor claiming.
Claming your Camp Dinner Cards during the Camp Dinner Phase is not allowed. This includes any form of softing. 
Everyone is given a supply card at the beginning of the game. Their usage is public and are revealed if you are eaten. No players will have the same supply cards.
The camp leader rotates down the player list. The first camp leader is random. 
In the event of a tied vote, the next camp leader will decide who is eaten in the tie.
Any breaking of the rules will result in very, very bad consequences for the player.

The [color=lightblue]Pioneers[/color] win at the end of the 6th round (4-6 players) or 7th round (7-10 players).
The [color=brown]Cannibals[/color] win once their numbers are equal to the numbers of the [color=lightblue]Pioneers[/color].

**Camp Dinner Phase**

Players may talk during the Camp Dinner phase. All players will be given three camp dinner cards and may provide one to camp dinner. It will not be revealed who contributed what but all contributions will be public at the end of the Camp Dinner phase.

Rather than contribute one of three cards, the camp leader is dealt a random card and is allowed to select a player to see their contribution before it is contributed to camp dinner. The camp leader&#39;s target is publically announced however the contribution is not. The camp leader does not know the card they are contributing.

If the camp dinner&#39;s contribution is equal to the amount of players alive then the voting phase will be skipped straight to the Camp Dinner phase once more. Lasts 24 hours.

**Voting Phase**

Players may talk during the voting phase. Votes will be revealed at the end of the voting phase and who voted. All votes must be done privately inside of your rolecard. Lasts 48 hours.

            <p>That’d classify games such as Mindnight as not Misc.<br>
Though this game does seem slightly similar the base mechanics are just too modified to be FM.<br>
You are getting two classcards, no faction kill, no scum chat, everyone is vanilla, the list goes on</p>
