Lore</summary>
<p>3 years after their victory against the unseen. The Blue Dragon slept peacefully in their castle, not worrying of what is to come next. But this night is what they will regret. You see the unseen have spread their influence far across the realm. There are many Masterminds and Assassins doing many different things. The day before now a message was sent to one of these unseenists. It was a aristocrat with a letter. He was holding the letter in one hand, slowly approaching the mastermind of the unseen and showed him the letter. What it stated was that their stealth invasion of the castle of Adiart had failed. You see Adiart is a important castle within the realm. For it was one of the major empires that was still standing. The Mastermind looked at the note, he was angered. The fact that their operation failed was not something to let loose to the fellow unseen. The Mastermind began to study all of the people that lived in the castle of Adiart and how to manipulate them into helping the unseen. He first looked at the prince, a powerful figure. He figured that if he was to threaten the prince with revealing that 5 years ago he executed a Blue Dragon member then he would join. He saw the alchemist, he could easily destroy his reputation by revealing that he killed our beloved observer that she thought was a mastermind. The scorned, oh how easy he could get him to side with the unseen. For the scorned already had a hatred, and the unseen would help to kill those who she hated. Now we jump back to the present, 2 figures were at the gate of Adiart. The Mastermind and The Assassin, although these were not the old ones. These were more experienced ready to take Adiart.<br>
But with this time the sheriff learned how he could find the unseen better. The unseen were let into the castle none to suspect them.</p>

          <p>Wait no. The Unseen still has a limited number of people I think. I’m confused how the sheriff buff is supposed to help. Sheriff isn’t the most useful class or anything so getting a new one isn’t that helpful.</p>
<p>Also to compensate for being convertable the starting king should always start good.</p>
