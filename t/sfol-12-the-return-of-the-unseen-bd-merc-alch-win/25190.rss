#  Welcome to the Rise of the Unseen, SFoL12 
[details=&quot;Lore&quot;]
3 years after their victory against the unseen. The Blue Dragon slept peacefully in their castle, not worrying of what is to come next. But this night is what they will regret. You see the unseen have spread their influence far across the realm. There are many Masterminds and Assassins doing many different things. The day before now a message was sent to one of these unseenists. It was a aristocrat with a letter. He was holding the letter in one hand, slowly approaching the mastermind of the unseen and showed him the letter. What it stated was that their stealth invasion of the castle of Adiart had failed. You see Adiart is a important castle within the realm. For it was one of the major empires that was still standing. The Mastermind looked at the note, he was angered. The fact that their operation failed was not something to let loose to the fellow unseen. The Mastermind began to study all of the people that lived in the castle of Adiart and how to manipulate them into helping the unseen. He first looked at the prince, a powerful figure. He figured that if he was to threaten the prince with revealing that 5 years ago he executed a Blue Dragon member then he would join. He saw the alchemist, he could easily destroy his reputation by revealing that he killed our beloved observer that she thought was a mastermind. The scorned, oh how easy he could get him to side with the unseen. For the scorned already had a hatred, and the unseen would help to kill those who she hated. Now we jump back to the present, 2 figures were at the gate of Adiart. The Mastermind and The Assassin, although these were not the old ones. These were more experienced ready to take Adiart.
But with this time the sheriff learned how he could find the unseen better. The unseen were let into the castle none to suspect them.

            <p>So basically, I was the one that says Nuclear have to die N2.</p>
<p>That slowed down for sure otherwise PKR would be caught much earlier when Nuclear find out he’s not from royal blood with his princess claim.</p>
<p>Why PKR decide that I healed him, I never know.</p>

            <p>BD just made a lot of sensible plays, some unintentional.</p>
<p>Dama blocking PKR N1 undoubtedly won us the game this early so he is somehow the mvp. Kyo made a good call steeling Simon, as did eevee for calling him out first (although technically he wasn’t BD he basically was). Insanity remembering Maid was also good but kind of obvious I guess.</p>

            <p>I am also actually wrong about the night results between “You have been attacked but you survived” and “You have been attacked but you got healed” sort of thing, turns out it has to be the one and same “but you survived” part.</p>

            <p>I was in 10. The very unfortunate one where it turns out that every single message was asked for clarification so I got caught out that way. Still slightly mad about that game as every single message was revealed when I was the last member of the Unseen, so that screwed me over big time with my fake Physician claims</p>

            <p>Ahhhh</p>
<p>So he blocked me from debauching you.</p>
<p>Also Frost, I have to admit, you have been working on your playstyle better and better. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley_cat.png?v=9" title=":smiley_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley_cat:"></p>
<p>You had me convinced that you were the physician at first and the fact that you didn’t show your scummy side. However, you can improve it slightly more. When you’re caught, don’t fall into further panic and the start flip flopping with claims, as you got caught out that way. As well as that, don’t try and follow the BD too much, as that’s when I started getting a bit suspicious of you</p>
