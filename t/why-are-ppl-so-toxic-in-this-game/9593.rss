            <p>I actually find this game to not be too toxic, especially considering the number of really bad players there is. Sometimes it can be enraging to see people make really poor plays, but i don’t see that much toxicity.</p>
<p>I guess the mods do a good job about it.</p>

<p>They obviously did not have the number of souls needed to protect them from being killed as the souls are essentially like the Priest’s night immunity, but they consume two souls just to stay alive</p>

            <p>Outing you’re the priest day 1 might not be the best strategy though.<br>
