    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Magic Commission (Update 1.2) (Magician is being worked upon)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faction-suggestion-the-magic-commission-update-1-2-magician-is-being-worked-upon/59124</link>
    <description>**The Magic Commission** is a group of Magic users that Banish the dark arts of magic within their powers.

now, ive already made 2 roles for this but now they will believe they were immune to conversion as it actually worked.

I recommend checking out the puppeteer and the Magician before reading this. They will not have their attributes in this list

_If  the original Grand wizard dies, someone may step up from the Magic commision to become the next Grand Wizard. Converted classes will not be able to step up_
**

The Magic Commision roles:


[details=&quot;1.Grand Wizard&quot;]
Grand Wizard/Killing

Night-Grand Barrier-Block someone from being poisoned or bleeding this night as well as give them immunity to these. 2 Use. if not the original, 1 use

Night-Sacred blast- Use the power of the Magic commision, instantly killing someone as well as going through night immunity as well as target changing. 3 uses. if not the original, 2 uses. not available until n3_

Day-Rng- Give a player either Nightshade, bleeding, or immunity for both randomly. 3 uses. If not the original, 2 uses_

Passive-Respect your Elders- If someone uses a day ability, it instantly fails, making them think it worked_

Passive-Immortal God- Immune to death at night as well as Nightshade and bleeding_

[/details]

[details=2.Magician]
_Magician/Offensive_

_Night-I Gotcha! _
_Poison someone with nightshade, only being informed within the halfway point within the day. 3 uses_

_Night-Who am i?_
_Swap your current role for someone else’s permanently. That person becomes the Magician/Witch and will be notified two days after, keeping there current role until those two nights are over. 1 use. The person you swap with gains that charge back._

Day-
[/details]

3.Puppeteer
4.Elemental
5.Light 
6.Nature
7.Gl!7ch

**
**

Converted Magic Commision:

1.Cannot be converted
2.Witch
3.Artisan
4.Not convertable
5.Darkness
6.Death
7.N1GH7M4R3

**

The reason the attributes arent done yet is because im writing this at 5 in the morning -_-
