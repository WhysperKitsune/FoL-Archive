    <title>Make victorious Scorned and Inquisitors part of the &quot;audience.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-victorious-scorned-and-inquisitors-part-of-the-audience/53748</link>
    <description>I was talking about the Scorned issue in another thread when this came to me.  Basically:

1.  Having Scorned stick around when they win is bad because they become kingmakers, disrupting the game (remember, people might not even know who the Scorned is, so it&#39;s not necessarily the BD screwing up and leaving them alive.)

2.  On the other hand, dying or being forced to leave when you win is no fun.

Instead, what if Scorned who won lost their voting rights and abilities and were basically removed from the game in every mechanical sense, but could still speak and contribute in the Day chat?  (They no longer count towards vote thresholds, obviously - for all intents and purposes, they&#39;re &quot;dead&quot;, but they&#39;re in the living chat and not the dead chat.)  Granted, they might rant and rave, but people can ignore them, and the usual rules against spamming or trolling would apply.  I suspect most would try to contribute intelligently to discussions.

This status could maybe be used for a victorious Inquisitor, too, and perhaps other future roles that can win midgame without dying.

Of course, their being shifted to the audience would be announced so people would know what&#39;s going on (and they&#39;d no longer be a valid target for abilities - they&#39;re basically &quot;gone&quot; in a mechanical sense, just allowed to contribute to day discussions so it doesn&#39;t feel like winning is a penalty.)</description>

            <p>It’s confirmable. The whole point of it being alive is as a fake claim.</p>
<p>If you’d rather have it keep Trollbox, it would be better to simply make it suicide.</p>

            <p>One of the reasons Scorned should stay alive is that it becomes a fake claim. Not a good one, of course, but it’s something evils can try.</p>
<p>It should just stay alive and lose Trollbox when they’ve won.</p>

            <p>I can like this if you let it keep a trollbox. Reason is trollboxes are a 1 use short phrase. If you announced “Firekitten was a scorned that has won and is now a audience member” they will likely be on alert for trollboxes.</p>
