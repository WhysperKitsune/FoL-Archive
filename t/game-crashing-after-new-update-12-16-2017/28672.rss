    <title>Game Crashing after new update (12/16/2017)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/game-crashing-after-new-update-12-16-2017/28672</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I joined a game and as soon as the loading screen went on, it crashed. Okay, I accepted that it could have been my PC, but no. I have entered 2 more games by now and it has crashed both times. I have, lastly, asked others about the problem and they are facing it too.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to be in a game right now.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Enter a game and wait until it crashes.
#### Comments:
It definitely has to do with the new update on 12/16/2017, since I played some hours before the update and it was going well. Thanks!</description>

            <p>Next time it crashes please upload your game logs. If you donâ€™t get a crash pop-up message go for the non-crash logs.</p>
