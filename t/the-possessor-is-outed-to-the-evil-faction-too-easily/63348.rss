    <title>The Possessor is outed to the Evil Faction too easily</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-possessor-is-outed-to-the-evil-faction-too-easily/63348</link>
    <description>Skip to **Suggestion** if you already know what I&#39;m talking about

If Possessor jumps into Cult Leader, the next oldest Cult member becomes Cult leader and knows who Possessor is.  If he jumps into Assassin when there are 3 Unseen, the newest convert becomes Assassin and Unseen knows who Possessor is.

Also that night, Possessor will not be present at the meeting so if they know he&#39;s not jailed or reaped, all the evil faction knows who Possessor is.

This is unfortunate and I believe an unintended meta mechanic.  I think it should be fixed somehow or Possessor buffed against the evil factions in order to compensate.

How?

**Suggestion**

I say let Possessor be present at the nightly meetings.  But I&#39;m afraid this would already have been implemented if the devs felt it wasn&#39;t too much work.  But this isn&#39;t the biggest problem since there are other explanations for why that member isn&#39;t present at the meeting.

So I say don&#39;t let the role of Assassin or Cult Leader be transferred whenever they get possessed.  Reaps don&#39;t transfer roles, so why must possessions?  I hope this can be implemented.

Someone might complain this makes Possessor too strong against the evil faction.  However evils find out who Possessor is too easily.  He is unconvertable and death immune.  At least if Reaper is attacked, he can claim he self-cared.  And Reaper can kill Mastermind, Possessor cannot.</description>

            <p>I’m sure this has already been suggested, but what if possessor became Psycho King just by possessing the current king? I think this gives him a very real win condition and no longer makes king a bad jump.</p>

            <p>So let’s say possessor gets to sit in on the meeting and do everything you want. It still doesn’t help him. If he spends more than a night in a member of the unseen, I’m pretty sure the other unseen/cult members would know you’re possessor due to you not using you abilities. Very rarely do I ever have team members not use something at night, unless you’re a cult member without abilities. No matter what, certain meta gaming is going to happen due to this. While it’s very unfortunate how it currently happens, it makes it less frustrating for the most players.</p>

            <p>Looking at it and while I understand the situation you’re making (hopefully)</p>
<p>Transference of the roles of Assassin or Cult Leader is intended. Cult will not be able to do anything useful (Yeah Reaper does that for one night, but what if the Possessor uses the last jump and happens to hit either the Assassin or CL?)</p>
<p>Now, while Evils know easily who NK is, which is needed because if they did. (They cannot distinguish between Alchemist/Possessor/Scorned/Inquis/Sorcerer/KingGuardedTarget).</p>
<p>Did you know Reapers claiming Phys can be found out if they did not heal people? :3</p>

            <p>It’s as long as the evil faction either doesn’t realize he’s possessed or is too scared to out him as Possessor.</p>
<p>I just realized that letting Possessor in on nightly meetings would give him the identity of all the evil faction.  However I do think it’s fine, since he should be a formidable foe to both factions.  Instead of the laughingstock of the Unseen and Cult.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  On second thought, this would let Possessor jump and expose the entire evil faction in his logs.  But on third thought, Possessor could lie, so not necessarily game breaking.</p>

            <p>Skip to <strong>Suggestion</strong> if you already know what I’m talking about</p>
<p>If Possessor jumps into Cult Leader, the next oldest Cult member becomes Cult leader and knows who Possessor is.  If he jumps into Assassin when there are 3 Unseen, the newest convert becomes Assassin and Unseen knows who Possessor is.</p>
<p>Also that night, Possessor will not be present at the meeting so if they know he’s not jailed or reaped, all the evil faction knows who Possessor is.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate and I believe an unintended meta mechanic.  I think it should be fixed somehow or Possessor buffed against the evil factions in order to compensate.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong></p>
<p>I say let Possessor be present at the nightly meetings.  But I’m afraid this would already have been implemented if the devs felt it wasn’t too much work.  But this isn’t the biggest problem since there are other explanations for why that member isn’t present at the meeting.</p>
<p>So I say don’t let the role of Assassin or Cult Leader be transferred whenever they get possessed.  Reaps don’t transfer roles, so why must possessions?  I hope this can be implemented.</p>
<p>Someone might complain this makes Possessor too strong against the evil faction.  However evils find out who Possessor is too easily.  He is unconvertable and death immune.  At least if Reaper is attacked, he can claim he self-cared.  And Reaper can kill Mastermind, Possessor cannot.</p>
