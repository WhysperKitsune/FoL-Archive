    <description>**Lore**: Does it have to look like this?

Princess&#39;s life wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t a bed of roses. From childhood, she was raised among the corridors of the castle. Nobody knows this castle as well as she... well maybe the creator of the castle knows so well too.

One dull day, the princess, as a child, decided to go with the guards to the castle tavern. When she started to enter the tavern, the guards also began to follow her. _&quot;Ughhh, nothing will happen to me.&quot;_ She turned to the guards. _&quot;I just want to drink some berry juice... &quot;_ After these words the guards let her in. Once she took her juice and sat down on one of the chairs, she noticed a man in the corner of the room, clinging to a woman. Uncertainly, she began to go to them. _&quot;What are you doing?&quot;_ The man didn&#39;t do anything about it. The girl ran after the guards. After a while, the guards took the man, the girl stayed next to the woman. The woman whispered thanks to the girl and gave her - her necklace. &quot;Carry always help, we need such people.&quot;            

To this day, she proudly wears this necklace. It reminds her that she must fight and act. Does it work well? Yes. Nowadays, she flirts with other castle members, to find out who they really are. She repeats herself over and over again _&quot;Does it have to look like this?&quot;_. However, after a moment she answers the question herself. _&quot;Yes, I&#39;m only doing it for the Blue Dragon ... and for my father. I have to do this and I will do it until I get rid of the evil of this castle.&quot;_
