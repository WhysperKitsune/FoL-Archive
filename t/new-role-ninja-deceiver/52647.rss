            <p>I tested it on a cult leader converting a noble into an apostle.<br>
the visit is hidden from the princess. but I don’t think its hidden from observer.</p>
<p>Also, I already tested a fail convert on a princess, which showed both the CW and the mm as visitors.</p>

            <p>If you are bleeding as hunter has sent a wolf on you, you could use this on someone who claims poisoned so the physician would be redirected on you. If knight is on prince you could redirect knight onto you so unseen could get a kill, or to make sure you get a safe conversion. I should say it is everyone that targeted that player not everyone in game</p>

            <p>actually, they are not visiting person for a wisping princess if they convert her, but if they fail their convert. which can happen, they will appear as a visitor. This is fix to the princess abilitity, as she would have outted the one who converted her and herself.</p>
<p>If an observer follow the cult when he convert someone, he will see the cult leader visiting that person.<br>
To my opinion, your abilities are more like the observer then the princess’s.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it would be better to see who non-mm visited meaning you wouldn’t know who was converted, would that be better or would it still need a nerf?</p>

            <p>Well.</p>
<p>just as a criticism, the fact the ninja would lose his Ninja Steps passive, when converted to the unseen is dead give away, and its not needed.</p>
<p>Obs - Why you don’t visit anyone.<br>
me - ah, I’m an ninja dude, I don’t visit people</p>
<p>later<br>
Obs _ why did you visit x, you are not supposed to be a ninja<br>
me - Heum, wait, I can explain, you see<br>
Obs — hey everyone, I can see his visits, he’s converted.</p>
<p>Also, very op. you will see who the unseen visit, which, mean, that night 1, you could guess converted unseen with no effort, this would prevent the unseen from converting anyone. its even worst then sheriff scout, which is already op.</p>

            <p>Its to OP. Reason is it will use Night watch N1 and see who the unseen/cult tried to convert. Meaning basically you get a free unseen/cult kill…</p>
