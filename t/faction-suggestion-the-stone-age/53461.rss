    <title>[Faction Suggestion] The Stone Age</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/faction-suggestion-the-stone-age/53461</link>
    <description>~Probably very unbalanced, but I wanted to create a faction to see how well the idea would go. With that said, let&#39;s get into it.

[color=brown]_[b]The Stone Age[/b]_[/color]

[color=red]Killer &amp; Offensive Classes &gt; Mammoth
Support Classes &gt; Rhinoceros
Investigative Classes &gt; Dire Wolf
Social Classes &gt; Hyena[/color]

There can be a maximum of 4 players in the Stone Age Faction, including the Tribal Chief.

Games will always start with a Tribal Chief and a Smilodon. The order of promotion goes:

If Tribal Chief and Smilodon are both dead, classes will be promoted to Tribal Chief. After Day 6, classes will be promoted to Smilodon and the Tribal Chief will gain detection immunity.

----------------------

**[color=brown]Tribal Chief (Stone Age Special)[/color] (Unique)**

**Passive 1: Ancient - Immune to Occupation and Redirection at Night. You will gain Detection Immunity on Day 6.**

**Day Ability 1: Camouflage - All members of the Stone Age will be occupy and redirect immune at night if they are not already immune. (2 uses)**

**Day Ability 2: Piercing Pebble - Puncture a player&#39;s organs, causing their bodily functions to cease. Will kill after two nights unless extracted. (3 uses)**

**Night Ability 1: Diminish - Revert a player to their prehistoric mindset, converting them into the stone age. (Infinite Uses, One Night Cooldown)**

----------------------

**[color=brown]Smilodon (Stone Age Killer)[/color] (Unique)**

**Day Ability 1: Ingestion - Instantly kill a player during the daytime, bypassing all immunities. However, you will instantly be put up for treason. This can only be used once globally. (Meaning after a Smilodon uses it, it can&#39;t be used again by any Smilodons) (1 Use) [Bypasses Reaper Souls]**

**Night Ability 1: Devour - Consume a player at night, killing them. (Infinite Uses)**

----------------------

**[color=brown]Mammoth (Stone Age Offensive)[/color]**

**Passive 1: Beast - You cannot be Occupied or Redirected.**

**Night Ability 1: Blockade - Redirect someone to you tonight. (Infinite Uses)**

**Night Ability 2: Insurmountable - Everybody visiting you tonight will be occupied, bypassing immunity. (2 Uses)****

----------------------

**[color=brown]Rhinoceros (Stone Age Support)[/color]**

**Night Ability 1: Cannon Fodder - If any Stone Age member is attacked during the night, you will die instead. (Infinite Uses)**

**Night Ability 2: Disguise - All members of the Stone Age except for you will appear to be Blue Dragon tonight. (One Use)**

----------------------

**[color=brown]Dire Wolf (Stone Age Investigative)[/color]**

**Day Ability 1: Scent - Choose a player and track their scent. You will know who they visit tonight. (Infinite Uses)**

**Night Ability 1: Sniff - Learn what a player&#39;s converted class type will be.**

----------------------

**[color=brown]Hyena (Stone Age Social)[/color]**

**Day Ability 1: Howl - Prevent someone from voting today. (2 uses)**

**Day Ability 2: Your accusations and vote for execution/pardon will count as two. (2 uses)**

**Night Ability 1: Silence - Prevent someone from speaking tomorrow. (2 uses)**

----------------------

**[color=lighblue]Extractor (Blue Dragon Investigative)[/color]**

**Only spawns in Stone Age games.**

**Passive 1: Shielded - You cannot be punctured, poisoned, or bled.**

**Night Ability 1: Extract - Extract the piercing pebble from a player. (2 Uses)**

**Night Ability 2: Determination - Learn if someone is a member of the Stone Age Faction. (Infinite Uses)**

---

**--Ideas--**

Change the cooldown to 2 nights for conversion?

Please give feedback as to how this can be balanced better!</description>
