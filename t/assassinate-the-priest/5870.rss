    <title>Assassinate The Priest!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/assassinate-the-priest/5870</link>
    <description>#### What happened? The game allowed me to choose the name &quot;Assassin&quot; as a nickname.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? It say &quot;Name unavailable&quot; as Assassin is a class. All other classes, that I know of, are blocked already.

#### Steps to reproduce: Type &quot;Assassin&quot; in the Name field when the game starts.

#### Comments: Assassin the Priest ;)
