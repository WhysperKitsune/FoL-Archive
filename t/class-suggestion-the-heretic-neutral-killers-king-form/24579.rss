    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Heretic &gt; Neutral Killer&#39;s &#39;King&#39; Form</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-heretic-neutral-killers-king-form/24579</link>
    <description>Currently, there&#39;s a stupid meta to vote up the NK as a King so everyone wins as one big happy family. This meta is fucking terrible and needs to be fixed ASAP as it encourages an easy win for the Neutral Killer and pretty much negates him being in the game in the first place.

My suggestion is to turn the Neutral Killer into the Heretic once he is converted. He will still be shown as any other King normally does, thus preventing the Neutral Killer from taking the easy path of glory.

**The Heretic**
Win Condition: Eliminate the Blue Dragon and the Cult/Unseen 

**Passive 1: Twisted Following**
Gain Followers based on how many people you killed before you become the Heretic (3 kills = 3 followers, ect)
Followers act as charges for the Heretics abilities.
_^Promotes becoming the Heretic much later into the game_

**Passive 2: Human Shield**
If you are attacked at night, on of your followers will die instead. Occupy immune.

**Day Ability 1: Decide Fate** _2 Charges_
Same as all other kings but with an extra charge.

**Day Ability 2: The Corrupted Finger** _2 Charges_
The King&#39;s next vote for treason will count twice. If the player is not executed, they will be killed the next night and you will gain a Follower.

**Night Ability 1: Do My Bidding** _Charges based on follow amount_ _Can be used twice per night_
Send out on of your Followers to kill a player. The follow will also die. It will appear as if you did not visit your target.

**Night Ability 2: Shared Secrets** _2 charges_
Choose a target, you will be able to read their logs for that night.
_^Excellent for gaining information_</description>

            <p>How often do kings use their royal finger anyway?<br>
I doubt people would force every new king to royal finger EVERY day to prove it.</p>
