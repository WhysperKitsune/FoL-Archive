    <title>Alch Moral Dilemma</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/alch-moral-dilemma/75411</link>
    <description>I was just in a bizarre kingmaking scenario.  I was Alch with 1 bomb but 0 stoneskin against GK dying to bleed and Assassin.  The GK was my favorite player but the Assassin had left a touching plea in his deathnote for me, also starting King and especially Prince played rather terribly.  I was also never bled or attacked by Unseen.

I ended up killing the Assassin to be the only winner (with a sellsword who was executed D2 and probably left the game).  But it turned out he didn&#39;t actually attack me.  So I wish I had healed the King, but I was afraid of being attacked and missing my opportunity for peemptory revenge.

What would you have done?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The situation described above reminds me of so-called “nuclear close calls” - four cases when systems detecting a missile launch gave false signals and the world was close to a nuclear war. The governments had a short time to decide whether to initiate a counterattack toward the enemy (what Shrimp did) or to ignore the signal, potentially missing the opportunity for revenge. Hopefully for our planet, none of those 4 signals - 2 for the US and 2 for the USSR - were correct, and all of them were ignored.<br>
So this is not only how mafia works, it’s also something similar to real life.</p>
