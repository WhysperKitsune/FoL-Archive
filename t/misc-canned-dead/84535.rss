    <description># 𝔗𝔢𝔪𝔭𝔬𝔯𝔞𝔩
[details=&quot;Disclaimer&quot;]
This misc may have taken slight elements from other works, for inspiration, but the core story of it is all my own. As well, several noticeable elements may not have even been my decision, but those of another player. Elements may have been recycled from several of my personal works on the forums. In any case, don’t accuse me of plagiarism, unless you’re certain it’s not just a mistake and it’s entirely intentional.
I’ve intentionally delayed the beginning of this misc to increase hype by those who enjoy them. As well, I’ve worked hard on the story, so I sincerely hope more than a few players take interest this time.
Also, even though I’ve opened signups today, that doesn’t mean the game will actually begin today. Sorry about that.
&lt;small&gt;For those who understand the timeline somewhat, this misc takes place in the Third Reality.&lt;/small&gt;
[/details]

&gt;A long time ago, there were five objects, all similar in likeness, but vastly different. They were the Source of magic, but there was a darkness inside them, given as they were from the Dark Gods.
They weren’t easy for anybody to destroy, unfortunately. They weren’t immune to slight damage, but anything attempting to deal more permanent harm inevitably failed. Not to mention, those given the power of magic feared that if the Source Boxes were shattered, they would lose their own power. As such, a war rose.
Hundreds of years later, the war drew to a close. In the last conflict, four of the five Source Boxes were destroyed in the skirmish, when a volcano erupted and flowed over everyone and everything present. The last of them, *Infragilis*, was badly damaged and barely useable. As feared, everyone lost their magic.
&gt; Strangely, however, in the absence of magic, a new power arose in certain individuals; these were later named Validus, or Einherjar by those who hated them. In any case, the world changed - and not necessarily for the better.

(The above is intended as a bait for those who are wondering about whether or not they should join. If you’ve read down this far, you should by now know the correct answer. :upside_down_face:) 
___
All players have a Validus ability, regardless of their class. A Validus ability may potentially be unbalanced and unfair, but since every player can have one, it should automatically balance each other out. If not, well… sue me. Players can choose their own Validus. As such, *know thine enemy.*
Everyone can have up to three Names; True, Taken and Given. This is not just for flavour. The True Name would be a name of power, which nobody knows naturally (unless, you know, it’s a Validus). A Taken name is more or less an alias. A Given name needs no explanation.
There are eight default classes, as opposed to six when the Demo began. There may also be hybrid classes, up to a three-way.
There is an EXP chart, which determines your perks. That’s all it affects.
___
You didn’t miss the *Temporal* in the title, did you? Every human has a life clock, and this includes most players. Aside from the clock, everyone is practically immortal. *Time* is the currency. *Time* can be stolen from others. *Time* is visible on your arm in neon green writing.
Your money is your life. Guard it with your… well, with your life.
___
Also, you can post announcements on T.V. if you’re rich enough.

            <p>I guess I would probably be better off getting my first RP experience in an active misc rather than one which some of the participants thought was over.<br>
So I guess not.<br>
Maybe next time.<br>
Sorry.</p>

            <p>So, is this misc dead or something?<br>
I was just wondering if I could join if it wasn’t.<br>
I’ve never done a misc or other forum role-playing thing before so I’m not sure how it works and stuff.<br>
I wouldn’t choose a very powerful Validus, I probably wouldn’t have much of an impact on other players, probably.<br>
Who knows, maybe I’d get killed by a door within the first ten seconds, I don’t know.</p>
