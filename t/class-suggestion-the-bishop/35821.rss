    <title>{class suggestion} The Bishop</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-bishop/35821</link>
    <description>Name - Bishop or priest 
Class - BD support/investigative 

Passive 1 - Angel&#39;s Guidance - can&#39;t be converted after day 5

Day Ability 1 - Family Reunion - The Bishop Invites the King to join him in conference that night. {3 uses} (if the king denies the invitation then it will not count as a uses)

Day Ability 2 - Confession Meeting - invite a player with royal blood to confession tonight (Similar to a merc offering you a contract).
•  If the player has royal blood then they are given the option to accept or deny the invitation. The Bishop would know what decision the player has made.
• if the player does not have royal blood then the Bishop is given the message that &quot;[player name] is not worthy of a confession&quot;
• unlimited uses 
• only one time per day
• if prince picks the player that you want to go to confession with, then the prince brings that player to jail


Night ability 1 - Locked with your sins - The Bishop locks the player in the room with him. This occupy the player

Night ability 2 - Guardian Angel - The Bishop calls upon a living angle that helps keep the player alive tomorrow. Can only be used in the people you&#39;re having a confession with (the next day the player you casted the angle upon can not be voted up for treason and can not die that night.){2 uses}

What happens during confession: 
• Confession is similar to the prince jailing someone with a couple different mechanics 
• anyone who wants to do a night ability on one of the people in confession(healing,occu,killing, etc..) the night ability will effect both the Bishop and the other player visiting the Bishop for confession. 

Tell me what you think. Also if anyone can think of an idea for a converted Bishop please tell me.</description>
