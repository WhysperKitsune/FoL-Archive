    <title>The Framer(Neutral Killing)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-framer-neutral-killing/52811</link>
    <description>Don&#39;t know if anyone has made a class like this. Its also my first time trying SO DON&#39;T YELL AT ME IF ITS OVERPOWERED OR UNDERPOWERED. just leave nice suggestions. Also I have NO idea how to organize this so LETS AGOOOO

The Framer (Neutral Killing)
Passive 1:I totally didn&#39;t throw that wine out- Immune to occupation and redirection. Won&#39;t show up as immune/redirection immune.
Passive 2:Wrong guy he went that way-Immune to death at night

Day ability 1:Frame- Frame someone. Makes them show up as Killer/Offensive, Shows up as Cult/Unseen when checked. Also makes them show up as Occupy/Redirection immune. If they were to be occupied, they would still be occupied. Just the drunk would think they are immune.  3 uses(Can turn it down if its to OP)

Day ability 2:I know all your secrets-Hears all whispers for the day. 1 use (To help with the whisper meta)  

Night ability 1:Framed-Pick a person to kill. You will not be seen visiting this person. If the person is immune you gain a extra charge of all your day abilities.

Night ability 2:Your dead-Choose a person. They will die NO MATTER WHAT.
Bypasses everything. 1 use. (You will not die to a knights guard) (Can&#39;t be used till N3)

I thought of this class as a way to distrust unseen/cult checks. The only reason I gave the class the second night ability cause I felt as if it needed a way to deal with night immunity. The second one would also make prince think twice before outing himself

Thoughts on this?</description>

            <p>I fixed it instead of being a copy of possessor strings “Which Keep in mind this took me about 5 min to make because I CAN TYPE FAST and I thought after I posted it that it was the exact same thing” If your target is immune you gain a extra charge of both of your day abilities. Which I also added one to help with claiming to king meta.</p>
<p>So any extra comments will be appreciated</p>
<p>Also does anyone know how to make it look more organized?</p>

            <p>I think it is perfect. The 1 shot kill anything will certainly lower the amount of times prince will say “I AM PRINCE”. Cause then bam he is dead</p>
