    <description># Ok so like all you need is the rolelist

**Cop**
**Vanilla Town x6**
**Mafia Goon x2**

            <p>What if someone doesn’t claim  their n0 peek, and You knew in advance that they aren’t scum just because of it<br>
I.e. what happens If someone doesn’t claim n0, in such a way that it is NAI?</p>

</aside>
<p>everyone says their D0 and so everyone covers for the cop even if they are the cop<br>
they posted their N0 and then when I said their D0 makes me think they are town for claiming mafia role cop they said “yeah because a wolf can’t do that”</p>
<p>They voted their D0 then said that was an accident</p>

            <p>Another Strat is to “blow cover” as the real cop, voting your target realizing your mistake and then getting confirmed as not cop. However don’t make it too obvious, as I found the cop in a turbo because of how bad they were covering for the cop isn’t humanly possible</p>

            <p>Let’s add more strategic layer.</p>
<h2>Experienced cop strategy:</h2>
<p>Experienced player will most likely claim a FAKE day 0 peek as cop.<br>
If they claim it on mafia, they won’t be cop hunted. They will survive and chage a claim when outing  explaining this. And if they claim it on town, they still may die, but they claimed it on town, just other one.</p>
<p>You need to be extreamly sure to not slip and that people won’t kill you when you claim a peek on mafia, cause killing cop with fake peek on mafia is literaly game winning for scum. Happens very rarly tho, since people cop hunt instead.</p>
<p>To make sure people cop hunt you do posts like mine and FKs previous ones, bringing it up that if cop survives to day 2, they have half a game confirmed.</p>

<h2>Cop Cover</h2>
<p>Everyone when they get their role should claim a random N0 green on someone. That is you covering for the cop. The real cop should claim their real N0. You are not to vote this N0 or scumread them, that’s called dropping cover. It works since there’s no logs to leave checks in it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<h2>Cop Hunting</h2>
<p>Mafia after everyone claims a d0 peek have to analyse them.<br>
Of course any peek claim on one of them is false and that peraon can’t be a cop. Same if anyone drops a cover. If you cam’t guess who is a cop, kill one wich is possible cop AND in opposite case is likely that he was checked.</p>
<p>If you won’t kill check nor cop on n1, then game comes into 7 players alive, out of wich 3 are confirmed. That would be terrible scenario.<br>
If it happens, one mafia and real cop should claim cop. But only of they are sure they can pull it out in 1vs1 against the other one.</p>
