    <title>[Class Suggestion] Yet Another Necromancer (Neutral Killer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-yet-another-necromancer-neutral-killer/47369</link>
    <description>Might as well take a shot at a popular concept...

First things first. This class suggestion includes a class called the &quot;Zombie&quot;. **Zombies are like Death Knights.** They remain dead, but can do certain specific actions from the graveyard.

Players converted to Zombie win with the Necromancer. If the Necromancer dies in any way, however, all Zombies are returned to their original classes and win conditions. This means that it is not possible to lose as a Zombie and have your victory taken away. Either the Necromancer wins, or he dies and you go back to your original class.

Please keep this in mind when reading on...

----

[b]The Necromancer![/b] (Neutral Killer)

Passive 1:
**Mock Death** - Each time you are &quot;murdered&quot; or &quot;die&quot; from poison or bleeding, you will survive and your &quot;Vulture Eye&quot; ability will receive 1 additional charge/use.

Day Ability:
**Vulture Eye** - If the player you select dies that night, they will become a Zombie. (2 Uses. Recharged with &quot;Mock Death&quot; passive.)

Night Ability 1:
**Call the Horde** - Choose a player to kill. If you have at least two Zombies in play, you cannot be prevented/blocked from the attack. (Infinite Use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Newt&#39;s Innards** - Convert a dead Neutral player to a Zombie. (2 Uses.)

_^ Get it? Newt&#39;s Innards? Neuts In? Haaaa..._

----

So now let&#39;s explain...

**Zombie**

Passive:
**Undead** - You appear dead to all other players, and cannot talk to living players or vote. You will not appear in the court during the day.

Day Ability:
**Infectious Bite** - Cause a player to begin bleeding OR to be poisoned depending on which faction is in the round. (1 Use.)

_^ Lore-wise, it&#39;s a bite so it bleeds, but it&#39;s infectious so it also poisons. If it&#39;s an Unseen round you will poison your target, and if it&#39;s Cult you will cause your target to bleed._

Night Ability:
**Exhume** - Choose a living and a dead player to redirect the living player to the dead one that night. (3 uses.)

_^ Cause a Sheriff to check a dead person, make a Drunk debauch a corpse, whatever. Up to you guys what you think would or wouldn&#39;t work. ;)_</description>

<p>We add an extra dimension to this class?</p>
<p>Add another passive<br>
<strong>Necronomicon</strong>: The Necromancer can speak to his dead allies at night. Dead Neutrals can choose to become Zombies. [A dead Mercenary’s “contract” will be you, instead of any living contract there]</p>
<p>and replace that second night ability with this</p>

<p>Newt’s Innards - Take a zombie (that used to be a dead neutral) and cause him to possess a living player. (said zombie will meet in the Necromancer’s graveyard chat still)</p>

<p>///—/</p>
<p>Also, would it be overpowered for Zombies to be able to use a dead person’s ability on a living player as a second night ability?</p>
<p>Just wondering.</p>
<p>And/Or the Necromancer using a second day ability to (use a dead person’s day ability on a living player)</p>
<p><strong>Overall, a great class.</strong></p>

            <p>They can win with Necromancer if Necromancer wins – or if Necromancer dies, they get set back to their original class/goal. So they can choose if they want to help or not. Really, anyone can choose to be helpful or not already, though. XD</p>
<p>As the Necromancer, your best allies would be…</p>
<ul>
<li>A Neutral who lost. Now their only chance to win is as your Zombie.</li>
<li>An Unseen/Cult member whose team is doing badly. Best chance to win is with you.</li>
<li>A Blue Dragon who was executed by his own team. Now he’s a Zombie, time for revenge.</li>

            <p>To be fair it is a very well designed class and I do actually like it.It seems very fun to play as and it also   makes some amount of sense.<br>
My  one critique is  the zombie itself.Does it have to help you? Or can the zombie just not help you?</p>
