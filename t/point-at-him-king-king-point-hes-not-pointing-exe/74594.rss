            <p>this seems like a great idea, why has nobody thought of that yet?</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> on second thought, that would be worse because people would demand you blow both royal fingers D2 and D3 so you couldn’t use it to swing late game in your favor</p>

<p>Being in king as Poss in a 1v3 results in a win if there is no butler or other means to kill you because of mind control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah, with mind control now, being possessed king in that situation is actually better than psycho king</p>

            <p>I agree that it should be fixed, but having it be a passive would actually make it worse for possessor.  Instead, Royal Finger should be limited to 2 uses but changed so it instantly puts target player on trial.</p>

            <p>and the problem is? The point in time this is most often an issue is really late game, when there aren’t too many alternatives to jump into. Late game is when butlers are likely dead, and there’s reasonable chance to win before the game ends. I don’t think the goal is to make jump into the king a consistantly great idea, just not a suicidal one if there’s 3 people alive.</p>
