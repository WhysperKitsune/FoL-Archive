    <description>[details=&quot;Why reaper needs a rework&quot;]

* Gather Darkness is rarely useful.  Currently, it can only kill scorned, MM, and the king.  

[/details]

**PASSIVE (Master of Death)** - same as consume soul, just renamed.
**DAY ABILITY (Icy Touch)** - Consume 2 souls to force a player to talk only to the dead.  Also prevents voting and using day abilities.
**DAY ABILITY (Gather Darkness)** - Consume 2 souls to guarantee that reap kills its target.  Reap will not count as a visit.  
**NIGHT ABILITY (Reap)** - same as current. - Unlimited</description>

</aside>
<p>Sure, they have counter-play, but no direct counterplay.  All of the examples you listed are indirect counterplay.  Also, the wording should at least be changed then.  It says not count as a visit, which makes it seem as if it bypasses visit prevention.  Changing it to “this is a hidden visit” would be fine.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d directly disagree here with your premise. I do think that something should be able to prevent everything. However that does not mean it is ok for it to not have counter-play. For example the Merc can be occupied. Sure that’s not as easy as dealing with healing or guards but that’s the point. Jail also isn’t perfect because using it defensively is a huge risk for the prince because if that person is a high priority target then he both cannot do his action now and healers have now probably wasted their time.</p>
<p>Fool Hide is 2 use so it can be counter played with mind games by waiting or not. Sage also has only 2 uses and can be occupied. Poacher is currently the strongest preventer with 4 uses and being scum so no reason to use it defensively. However scum has less uses for it anyways so it doesn’t really matter enough and definitely isn’t impotent for things like frenzy.</p>

</aside>
<p>Winrates from the tests people have done.  Possessor reliably has a very poor showing, specifically because they lack any way of closing out games the way the Reaper can with Chill / Empower and the Sorcerer can by making a voting majority with the Cult / Unseen.  The Possessor has to kill every single opponent, which gets very difficult in the late game when there’s not much room to hide.  The Reaper can use Chill and Empower to win when the game is down to 4 people (or even 5 if one of those is reaped), letting them avoid situations where it’s obvious who they are due to the tiny number of people left alive.</p>

            <p>Possess and Gather Darkness should just be guaranteed kills I think. They only have a few uses, but it is disastrous to lose a use with no effect, since you’ve wasted a jump, or you’ve wasted 2 souls.</p>

<p>lol,  it’s evem easier to confirm poss games, D2 someone will say “I was possessed” and 2 kills at night signal Cult or Possessor. Reaper has an ability to pierce immunity. Possessor does not.</p>

<p>Yeah, but that’s one of the only reasons to use it.  Abilities shouldn’t have only a few uses.  And making it guarantee that reap kills it’s Target and not count as a visit wouldn’t be overpowered if no other buffs were added.</p>

<p>I agree that it’s strong, but it’s not the strongest, which is because it doesn’t have occupation immunity(which is why the gather darkness rework should be added.  I would be fine if that was the only buffs added), and reaper games are easily confirmable.</p>

<p>Gather Darkness is rarely useful.  Currently, it can only kill scorned, MM, and the king.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>…are you joking?  Killing the king is a <span class="bbcode-i">huge deal</span> (the inability of Possessors to do it is a major component in them being the weakest NK), while being able to kill the MM lets the Reaper beat them 1v1 rather than drawing.</p>
<p>Reaper is currently the strongest NK.  There’s room for improvement, but this is too much.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>NIGHT ABILITY (Reap) - Reap the soul of a player, killing them and leaving an empty body that will remain until they die again. - Unlimited</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s completely unworkable.  It would rapidly reach the point where lynching is nearly or even completely impossible.  Cult / Unseen have no reason to want to clear out reaped people, and BDs would have trouble killing them, so they’re going to accumulate until nobody can be voted up.</p>
<p>This suggestion is bad and your reasons for it don’t seem convincing to me.  Gather Darkness does what it’s supposed to, and…</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>It’s too easy to confirm reaper games. It shouldn’t be obvious which NK it is at first.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>…that’s not such a big deal (certainly not enough to demand the ridiculous, game-breaking changes you’re suggesting here - you’re trying to ‘fix’ a trivial, fairly minor issue with a drastic change that would severely damage gameplay.)  On top of this, it wouldn’t even accomplish what you want - by the time the second or third person is reaped, people would know it’s a reaper game.  Remember, it is <span class="bbcode-i">extremely</span> rare for people to abstain on votes in ToL when the king says how it should go.</p>
<p>If you want to fix it, the best suggestion is to give Reapers the ability to edit the logs of those they’ve reaped.  This would also be powerful, but I think that giving people a way to cast doubt on logs would be good for the game.</p>
