<p>I had 2 final 3 alliances, 1 with squid and waz and one with tele abd Isaac. Both were super loyal and its no coincedence the final 5 consisted of me and everyone in my final deals.</p>
<p>A big move was at final 10 having tele and isaac vote out you Simon, but i voted with squid u and waz even though I knew you were going home and wanted u gone. The second u were gone I made a group chat with waz and squid solidifying a final 3 and i had no blood on my hands cuz i never actually voted u out.</p>
<p>This meant at final 9 i had myself and 4 ppl who i was strong allies with. 5/9 is majority and everyone who wasnt in a final 3 with went home one by one.</p>
<p>(The reason i wanted u gone was cuz u were leading our alliance and i knew i didnt wanna go to the end with u anyway cuz you would win. Sorry)</p>

<p>Despite being labeled as a jury threat in the second post merge challenge where people voted on their opiniions about other players, I didnt recieve any votes in all the postmerge (apart from a cheeky selfvote).</p>
<p>In addition I knew who was going home every tribal council apart from this last one (i knew it was me or isaac but i thought itd go to 1 v 1). Tele was blindsided by the Jgoes vote and Waz by the first Simon vote and Squid vote. I knew and participated in all these votes (along with Isaac, my closest ally).</p>

<p>For the record the reason I voted squid out first was cuz I knew I wanted to sit with Waz and Isaac at the end based on the f10 questions challenge answers and I knew I could convince Isaac to yeet Tele at f4 but couldnt convince waz to yeet Squid at f4.</p>
<p>Squid is also very respected and is a mod and shit and im p sure theyd win in a f3 of me waz squid.</p>
<p>Sadly Tele is a challenge beast and won immunity and then waz found the idol so my plan was fucked.</p>

<p>In response I will say that at no point in the game did I ever need to win a challenge. Why make my threat level bigger (esp after opinion challenge when I was paranoid) by doing well in challenges.</p>
<p>We saw what happened to all the big threats at start of merge: eevee, pkr, marshall and Simon all went one by one. Mitigating threat level and staying under radar is p important.</p>

<p>I dont think you should vote me over tele because she wasnt loyal. At times I wasnt either, and thats the point of the game. Neither of us were ever disloyal to be a dick anyway, it was all strategy.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think you should vote me over tele because at several points in the game i had the chance to eliminate tele but I didnt. Realistically at no point could tele have voted me out.</p>

<p>Challenges is literally one small aspect of the game. There’s a bunch of other stuff going on with alliances and social stuff that is more important in my opinion.</p>
<p>I didn’t play to make the game interesting, I played the smartest game for me to get to the end with people I wanted to sit next to at the end. I do think I didn’t play that boring though - at final 7 I sent Jgoes home which he wasnt expecting, at final 6 I organised Simon going home which they weren’t expecting, at final 5 I voted out Squid which they weren’t expecting, and at final 4 I would have voted out Tele which they weren’t expecting. Saying “I didn’t see you guys try therefore you didn’t” is a fallacy.</p>
<p>Tele, me, and Waz all tried and all deserve to be here.</p>

            <p>I settled on my alliance as I felt like we could get to the final together, we all trusted each other entirely and we didn’t want to break that at first, I just kept with my team until I knew I had to go solo, I took priority for myself and then went for the team towards the end.</p>

            <p>Yeah I wouldn’t fault Hippo on that one I guess</p>
<p>But 1. I haven’t received any warnings, and have submitted something for every challenge and have voted every time<br>
2. I didn’t settle on my alliance and I tried to seek out people who I thought would be loyal and honest with me<br>
3. I’ve been really elaborate with my answers if you look at my first post. I am trying just trying unconventionally</p>

<p>What did you do to make game interesting? Convince me to vote for you.</p>

</aside>
<p>Mine’s more than likely going to be the worst to convince you. But it’s worth a shot.</p>
<p>I was honest the entire game about my actions (Yeah, cliche and not what a person wanting to win should do). I had a plan from the start, make people forget that I existed, I didn’t want to cause beef or drama, and I didn’t want to be seen as a threat, but I also didn’t want to be seen as a failure, I usually went towards the middle for challenges so I wasn’t an easy pick to go out. I also tried my hardest during the last few tribal’s to stay in, which was mostly just an act of desperation as I will admit. But I felt like I had a need to win at that point, in a challenge everyone said I would be least likely to win, and it really doesn’t seem like I’ll win at all to be honest, but I just wanted to prove myself I guess. I didn’t make the game interesting, all I did was play for myself, I know it’s not the answer you asked for but it’s the answer you got.</p>

            <p>Yes, I plaied to what I think was best way to make game more interesting, both for me and others.</p>
<p>I’m not after compliments or being salty.<br>
I’m after finally understanding what you were doing whole game.</p>
<p>Like I can still understand Tele did something.</p>
<p>But Wazza and Hippo should of been kicked long ago for strikes.<br>
That’s why I want to give all of you a chance to prove you actually did something, instead of just slanking.</p>

            <p>Sigh. That’s not what I’m after ffs.</p>
<p>I want to know what you did to make game more interesting. Alliances, stuff.<br>
How am I supposed to know what you did in shadows whole game?</p>
<p>It’s time to finally reveal, what you people did.</p>
<p>I can see only obvious stuff, and obvious is that none of you was idol hunting and that most of you didn’t bother to submit challanges.<br>
I wanted final 3 to prove to me that you deserve to win, not that you was just slanking all game.</p>
