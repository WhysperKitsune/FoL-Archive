    <description>&lt;big&gt;[color=blue]The Spy[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
**[color=grey]Blue Dragon Social[/color]**

**Mole (Passive) -** Will see the votes when a new King is elected, and if the new king is a royal. *You will keep this passive even if your class changes.*
**Connections (Day) -** Force the court to pardon the player on trial currently. They cannot be put on trial again for the rest of the day. *(1 use)*
**Snoop (Night) -** Read a player&#39;s journal. *(2 uses)*
**Bug (Night) -** Send a scout to a chosen player. At the beginning of each night, the scout alerts you if the target used a day ability, and if one was used, what it was. Regains uses upon the scouted player dying. *(2 uses)*
*Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

When converted, becomes...

&lt;big&gt;[color=indigo]Double Agent[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
**[color=grey]Unseen Offensive[/color]**

**Mole (Passive) -** Will see the classes of players who step up during the election of a new king. 

**Plant Evidence (Day) -** Frame a chosen player. They will appear suspicious to investigative classes during the next night. *(3 uses)*

**Blackmail (Night) -** Blackmail a player, preventing them from speaking during the next trial. *(3 uses)*
**Forge (Night) -** Choose a player and rewrite their Logs at night. If they die, their Logs are replaced with your rewritten ones. *(2 uses)*

*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*

-----

**Explanation of Design**

The idea behind the passive of the spy is to fill another role that a prior patch opened up (information on king election). 

The rest of their kit is to create a sort of reverse [color=blue]Noble[/color]. The **Bug** ability catches day abilities, which would want to be used to find Assassin/CL/Nk. This is the opposite of **Gossip**, which requires the noble to out themselves to be effective at finding fake-claims. In addition, bug can find classes that cannot be found with the Noble&#39;s gossip. The **Snoop** night action is subject to change, but functions in a way to dig up specific information and has internal synergy with **Bug**, albeit incredibly delayed. It&#39;s a flavor thing. The reason for having **Connections** is to be in line with the other easily confirmed BD social classes, with some other minor actual applications.

In regards to the [color=darkpurple]Double Agent[/color], the main inspirations were numerous mafia deception roles from ToS. The intention of this converted class is to, among other things, is to sow deception in a similar manner to Herbalist. Like the Illusionist, the Double Agent&#39;s ability to play the role of a Spy is extremely difficult, and will quickly lead to their death if suspicion of a Double Agent existing arises.</description>

            <p>Well unseen info is limited even though they are unseen<br>
Marshal can only find 1 Blue dragon a night and can’t find neuts,duchess can find 1 class type per night etc<br>
And any class finders are limited, Nightwatch only has 2 uses</p>
<p>I think the class type of the new king would be good<br>
Would allow small bits of info</p>

<p>As an ability of an unseen class, it wouldn’t be a mass confirm.<br>
However, it probably is a little on the strong side. What about it alerting the Agent of their class type?</p>

            <p>BD social is way too OP to actually be confirmable IMO. Evil players will almost always vote their partners so X Is unseen. X stepped up. 3 people voted X. Huh</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of Design</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the passive of the spy is to fill another role that a prior patch opened up (information on king election).</p>
<p>The rest of their kit is to create a sort of reverse <font color="blue">Noble</font>. The <strong>Bug</strong> ability catches day abilities, which would want to be used to find Assassin/CL/Nk. This is the opposite of <strong>Gossip</strong>, which requires the noble to out themselves to be effective at finding fake-claims. In addition, bug can find classes that cannot be found with the Noble’s gossip. The <strong>Snoop</strong> night action is subject to change, but functions in a way to dig up specific information and has internal synergy with <strong>Bug</strong>, albeit incredibly delayed. It’s a flavor thing. The reason for having <strong>Connections</strong> is to be in line with the other easily confirmed BD social classes, with some other minor actual applications.</p>
<p>In regards to the <font color="darkpurple">Double Agent</font>, the main inspirations were numerous mafia deception roles from ToS. The intention of this converted class is to, among other things, is to sow deception in a similar manner to Herbalist. Like the Illusionist, the Double Agent’s ability to play the role of a Spy is extremely difficult, and will quickly lead to their death if suspicion of a Double Agent existing arises.</p>
