    <title>What is the best class in the game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-is-the-best-class-in-the-game/76586</link>
    <description>So: I want to find out what is the Best Class or set of classes in the game.

I think some markers for a &quot;Best Class&quot; should do good in the following categories:

How helpful is it to its team?
How hurtful is it to other teams?
How little do you have to improve it to be more helpful to its team / hurtful to other teams?
How balanced is it?

The better a class does in all of the categories, the better the class is.</description>
