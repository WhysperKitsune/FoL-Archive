            <p>So basically if unseen has 1 enforcer/sage , there’s a reaper in game , there’s an inq and there’s 3 knights + 3 CWs , you reduce the people  you can heal to 9-10 from 16. Over than 1/2. But since there’s some sort of prevention , besides sage’s <strong>WoF</strong> , you can not heal anyone at all.</p>

            <p>I picked 8, since it gets boring always getting Physician(I once got a 6 round streak only getting phy)</p>
<p>But it’s still amazing. It can cure bleeds, poison, could say f u to OE, and even deletes possessor’s possess ability. Only down part is Reaper, which in that case you are as useless as a bug in modern days when dealing with him. You also can make a person immune to poison and bleeds, and back then, you could even make a person a DK.</p>
<p>I hate Physician, but I hate it with a passion.</p>
