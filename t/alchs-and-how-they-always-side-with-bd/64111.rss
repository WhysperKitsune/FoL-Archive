    <title>Alchs and How They Always Side With BD</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/alchs-and-how-they-always-side-with-bd/64111</link>
    <description>Alchemists are getting free pass by siding with BD as always, since there is literally no risk of dying at all. Evils do not want to waste a night, thinking if they actually ss&#39;ed or not and they heal targets evils attacking, so they directly count as an extra vote and an extra healer for BD. 

They should fear that evils attacking them if they dare to side with BD but unfortunately they dont. They have the luxury of openly claiming and siding with BD always...

Please nerf available stacks of SS to counteract this, so they wont be able to openly claim and 
side with BD, while getting away with it. Its already hard to win against them when they have healers, its extra hard when they have immune healers....

Neuts supposed to side with the best and fearing they will be attacked by both parties but in Alch case, its just ridiculous. They are already healing targets evil wants to kill, on top of that they are immune.... LOL</description>

            <p><strong>Hey sunbird!</strong></p>
<p>I see your point, and yes, Alchemist do mostly side with the Blue Dragon.<br>
And yeah, 3 or 4 Stone-Skins or 1 more Bomb (if they side with Evil) would be more balanced, as far as I’m concerned!<br>
Nonetheless, the siding Alchemists take is purely because of their choice. They can either side with Unseen, Cult or Blue Dragon or even go solo and be the only one(s) alive! Neutrals are generally made to be one of the last ones standing and, indeed, siding the the Blue Dragon is easier and that’s why most Alchemists side with them, so I don’t see why a change to them being more evil than good should be made, but balancing so that they can side with whoever they want.</p>
<p><strong>That’s what I wanted to say, thanks for your time!</strong></p>

            <p>We could make the ability’s interconnected. Like successful heals give EPots. Killing with EPot’s gives stoneskins and blocking an attack with stoneskin gives crimson potions. And you start with 2 stoneskins and 3 of each night ability</p>

            <p>Building from Sarun’s suggestion, how about limiting alchemist healing?</p>
<p>Passive: Same.<br>
Day Ability: None.<br>
Night Ability 1: Stoneskin Potion, grants Death Immunity. 3 uses.<br>
Night Ability 2: Crimson Potion, heals a target. 3 uses.<br>
Night Ability 3: Emerald Potion, attacks and attempts to kill a target. 3 uses.</p>
<p>Given how limited an alchemist’s potions are under this idea, it might be worth giving them either occupation immunity or a charge refund if occupied. But this basically gives an alchemist something to do every night for 9 nights.</p>

            <p>I’ve found that you can consistently get an Alch to side with you as scum simply be whispering them to do so early on. No need to even claim scum you can just say “work with me and I will make sure you win” and your golden.</p>

            <p>If he does nothing all game, then he’ll be at risk of being lynched by BD for not healing people. But if he does heal and bomb, then he’ll be vulnerable to evils at night. This reworked Alchemist fixes the problem of BD-aligned Alchemists being unconvertible and immortal Physicians without nerfing Stoneskin too hard, plus there is now an actual incentive for Alchemists to side with evils as they won’t have late-game immortality anymore.</p>

            <p>I think reducing SS to 3 uses is a good solution but Sarun’s solution is even better.  Actually this is a genius idea.  Infinite stoneskin passive but it’s only active on nights where Alch is not healing or bombing.</p>

            <p>I think what would be more interesting is rewarding the alch for using his abilities. Something along the lines of:<br>
Starts with 2 stone skins, infinite heals, and 2 emerald poisons.</p>
<p>If he successfully heals someone (be it nightshade, bleeding, or an attack) he gets a charge of emerald poison.</p>
<p>If he successfully kills someone with emerald poison, he gains a charge of stone skin.</p>
<p>This forces an alch to play more active if he wants to get more stone skin charges, which can be dangerous if he is seen by BD. If it is seen as too much killing with the emerald poison, it could even be that healing and killing grant a stone skin use. However, this could potentially lead to an immortal alch who is healing a BD and now has infinite stone skin uses.</p>

            <p>Frankly, I’d suggest giving him an infinite amount of Stoneskin Potions, or relegating it to a passive while also causing his night abilities to remove the Stoneskin effect for that night if they were used. This will require Alchemists to carefully balance how pro-BD or pro-Unseen/Cult they are and stop this unconvertible and unkillable BD-aligned player nonsense. An Alchemist who chooses to pocket heal the Prince the entire match will be vulnerable to evils now, but if an Alchemist spends the entire match just using Stoneskin then they will likely be suspicious in the eyes of BD and more likely to be executed during the day.</p>
<p>In short, the issue with the current Alchemist is that BD has too much leverage over them for no cost at all while evils can’t really do anything to stop them other than potentially waste a night due to SS.</p>

            <p>Enough that would get chance for Evils/NK if they got unlucky. I would say in game with only good players BD have like 70-80% winrate <strong>which</strong> is not good. Maybe we aren’t seeing this at typical game however it doesn’t mean BD shouldn’t be weaker.</p>

            <p>it is baseless…<br>
However, with BD win rate being roughly 50% with alchemists often siding with bd right now…<br>
and lessening the spawn rate of alchemist and increasing the spawn rate of anti-bd…<br>
Well, guess how strong the impact will be!</p>

            <p>lowering the spawn rate of alchemist increases the spawn rate of Fool/Scorned/Mercenary/Sellsword.<br>
Which is in itself lowering the BD win chance.</p>

<p>This is actually decent idea. Evils need a buff anyway i wouldn’t consider this as drawback.</p>

            <p>The problem is his win condition.<br>
If alchemist has… let’s say… a 50% win rate(and survival rate), and we assume that in 50% of these cases Alchemist had the final decision on who wins… then 25% of all games with alchemists are ending with an alchemist-related victory.<br>
The Alchemist has a very high chance to spawn.(one of the two healers, one is guranteed, not affected by any negative balancing effects…).<br>
How do you want to balance this?<br>
Lowering his win rate is removing balance in itself, and leads to complaints.<br>
Lowering the number of games where alch has a say is making lopsided gameplay with early steamrolls. This is not good either.<br>
The only remaining things are: lowering the spawn rate, but that has problems in itself(lower amount of healers= poison/bleed balance upset).<br>
… changing the win condition<br>
…replacing alchemist.</p>

            <p>Reducing number of the “Stoneskin Potions” is a right step to nerf Alch i think. Making him convertable it’s a very harsh move and i would say there are better options to solve this problem.</p>

            <p>well… the Alch without stoneskins was feared… to get.<br>
You had a very low chance of survival without.<br>
That is kinda the problem with Alch. Either Alch can defend themselves and evils will be not interested in attacking…<br>
or they can’t and their survival rate(and thus win rate) is abysmal.</p>

<p>This is why nerfing Alchemist is on point. The problem is his survivability not his swingyness.</p>

            <p>No it is not… strictly. And sometimes it does not side with BD. But that’s the problem - you can’t resolve its swingyness. Its win condition allows it to select a winner, yet the BD will not exe it if they can exe a MM/Assassin/CL/NK because they need their healing,<br>
and evils usually dont attack Alch because it has 4 stoneskin potions.</p>
