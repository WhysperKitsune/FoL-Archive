    <title>[Class suggestion] The Mortician</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-mortician/2805</link>
    <description>&gt;**The Mortician**
Neutral killing
**Passive: Corpse&#39;s vigor**
Immune to death at night
**Passive: Cadaver&#39;s suspicion** 
When ever you or a player you have stuffed a corpse into the room of is investigated, all the investigator sees is _&quot;You were too distracted by the dead bodies in your targets room to snoop around&quot;_
**Night ability: Abduct** 
Kill your target. You can choose to either stuff the corpse in someone else&#39;s room of your choosing, or dissect them and gain a use of *transplant*. -infinite uses
**Day ability: Transplant** 
Your target will lose immunity to death, if they have it, until they are healed by a physician or an alchemist, thanks to an infection you left in them. -0 uses

Notes: 
-Corpse&#39;s vigor makes attacks occupy you instead because you heal yourself instead of attacking.
-with abduct, you target the player you want to attack and then target a second player. If you target yourself, you gain a use of transplant. If you target someone else, you stuff the body in their room.
-Players you kill will be shown as &quot;missing&quot; rather than dead. Their class and journal is still shown, however.</description>
