<p>Priestess discredits us/nullreads us and PKR puts us as his top townread! Surely if they were a town hydra, they would have discussed their reads together before posting them, right? His clear on two strong wolf players based on one post seems like an attempt to pocket us and then nightkill us later. Additionally, Pkr just happens to claim self-confirming in a game where almost everything is NAI. Tinfoil time: PKR is a mafia role which is designed to ‘confirm’ itself as town.</p>

<p>Final thing to note: Priestess consistently forced the thread back onto Marshal, even when there was a natural transition off of him. This is beneficial from a scum perspective as there is a potential two mislynches there. Geyde noted that the thread warped around that interaction, meaning there was at least one scum involved, and we think it was Priestess.</p>

</aside>
<p>Okay this seems dishonest. I was the only person who is townreading Jgoes and that’s why I had to talk about it, right? Afaik I was asked for it<br>
Don’t you mind when I omgus you? I want to hardtunnel you to death, but it’s so hard with your post restriction. So… idk. Idk really.<br>
And yeah, I’m seeing your Luxy posts mostly as Geyde posts, I’m reading mostly his style. But just because you can’t post much, that doesn’t mean you’re just “locktown” like my “partner” thinks you are.<br>
Lul, heading to work, can’t write much, and haven’t yet read the whole thread, it’s just so hecking much. But I will. Wanna do some pushes, even when I can’t use my usual methods, because of hecking post restrictions.</p>
<p>Btw <a class="mention" href="../../u/pokemonkidryan.html">@PokemonKidRyan</a> , you can forget that. You can’t slap me. I’ve the higher post count, i can do what you want, and you should better be nicer to me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png!v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>

<p><em>cries in post restriction</em><br>
I do enjoy playing like this though.</p>
<p>Our chat is on the forums, we were also wondering what it meant that Jgoes/Chemist apparently have a Discord chat; in my opinion it’s because Chemist is new to our community and didn’t have an account, so a Discord server had to be created for the early game.</p>

<p>ARETE SCUM WEEEEH</p>
<p>I consistently get bad vibes from Arete’s posts. Not in a ‘this is scum 100% lynch’ way, in a ‘this has a high probability of being scum motivated.’ Unfortunately, I can’t really explain it very well. If I were to summarize it, I would say something like: “Arete talks a lot but does not get anywhere.” And it feels wrong to say that, because there <em>is</em> some progresison in their posts (like the flip on the Mercenary read)… in general though, I feel like Arete has been doing more talking than solving. It might just be my confbias rearing its ugly head, but I think I should put these concerns here.</p>
<p>The thread really is warping around Marshal and I agree with Arete in that sense. I feel like this makes Marshal more towny because considering the thread has been warping around him, it’s highly likely someone wants to lynch him (especially since he apparently doesn’t have a post restriction and that’s bad for scum if he’s town). The obvious answer would be Jgoes, but I’m still uncertain about his alignment. Marshal <em>could</em> still be scum here, and I do get bad vibes from some of his posts… I don’t know. I feel like I can’t really resolve Marshal’s alignment because of how many people have interacted with him, and I know for a fact I’m not great at analyzing interactions.</p>
<p>If I were to select a lynch today, I would probably choose someone who interacted with Marshal in a meaningful way, because there are people here who should be able to read into that person’s interactions much better than I will.</p>
<p>Priestess’ play completely puzzles me, because I don’t remember her ever trying to influence the thread as strongly as she does in this game.</p>

<p>Okay. You’re making me angry. You’re mean. Jake, let yourself time, post when you want to. Not when this fool is trying to force to.

You’re aggressive. Either calm down and stop being anti-town, or face the consequences.</p>

</aside>
<p>Considering she has been town in the last few games I saw her in, maybe this is actually scum indicative? I still have yet to read that FoL game where she was Mastermind, although that was plenty of time ago and she’s in a hydra, so things have probably changed. I know that saying ‘she is trying to influence the thread’ is a bit of a stretch and anyone who read her ISO could disagree with me, but in general I feel like she’s trying to manipulate the thread’s conclusion. She is hyperfocused on Marshal despite posting a full readlist, and that’s probably the scummiest thing about her right now (although that’s not very strongly AI in itself. erghhhhh.).</p>
<p>Yeah I wrote a lot of words about Priestess/PKR but I still don’t have a strong conclusion about their alignment. I did read Luxy/Geyde’s take on that slot, but I’m not sure if I agree with it.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<p>Squid thinks Priestess is scummy, and I kind of agree, but she is always scummy so fweh.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that Marshal is harddefending Nerbins, feels like TMI. If Marshal is town, probably the good kind of TMI (like a n0 greencheck or something, if that is even a thing in this setup). He immediately harddefended Nerbins as if I was pushing Nerbins or 100% scumreading him (which I wasn’t, and I even specified it). Relevant quote:</p>

<p>I think you are reaching on that one, not gonna lie.</p>
<p>What would you say if that post came from me? Would you still scumread the post? Because honestly, that would 100% be something i would say if I ended up noticing that. That comment is innocent and not AI, in my opinion. Don’t look for reads where there aren’t ones. it’s okay to have a lot of nullreads early.</p>

<p>I can easily see <em>anyone</em> doing it. There is a <em>slight</em> chance there’s scum motivation behind that post, but you can say that about anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>Feels like it came out of nowhere. I wasn’t even strongly scumreading Nerbins, just alarmed by his opener. The funnier thing is that Marshal completely dismisses talking about Nerbins from that point forward - when the discussion shifts away from him. It’s such a strong defense I have no idea where it’s coming from and I’m 99% sure it’s some form of TMI.</p>

<p>He does interact with Nerbins later, but the interactions are so lukewarm it’s jarring. Either Marshal has a N0 on Nerbins or at least one of them is scum because this doesn’t feel organic and TvT, especially since it’s day 1 and neither one of them should <em>know</em> the other is town.</p>

<p>Nerbins isn’t even that high on Marshal’s readlist. Marshal’s treatment of Nerbins doesn’t seem to match his behavior around Nerbins, and I think that’s scum AI because it indicates his readlist is very inaccurate / he does not care about it and posted it for the sake of generating content / gaining towncred maybe. In general I get bad vibes all over from this interaction. I know I already said I’m not very good at analyzing interactions but that one really stuck out to me.</p>
<p>My reads haven’t changed in a major way, but I think I’m going to do a lot of re-evaluating later. I keep swaying from townlean/scumlean when it comes to a few certain people.</p>
<p>I think FK’s opening post was great but not outside of his scumrange, the same goes for Luxy/Geyde, so I’m hesitant on both. <s>sorry guys</s></p>
<p>One more thing I would like to point out is that Maximus feels more and more town to me every time he posts - and that I like Jake this game but the content of his posts could be substantially better because he’s in a hydra with Alice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I’m hedging on a lot of reads here. This game is confusing to read because everybody is wallposting and I’m not used to analyzing predominantly wallposts. Taking us out of our comfort zone has really worked wonders.</p>
<p>Also I did like astand’s later posts, it feels like he is picking up steam and I like it.</p>

<p>I fully admit to that. I feel like everyone jumped way too fast on the <em>Jgoes failed in Marshal’s “reactiontest”</em>. Something is definitely wrong here in thread movement. Way too many people are scumreading Jgoes. This means for me: either Jgoes is getting bussed, or he’s just town. This all is unnatural. I don’t like the progression of Marshal on him at all.<br>
Yes, thats why I tried to influence thread movement. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png!v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"> good notice.<br>

<p>I understand where you are coming from due to Priestess forcing the discussion back and forth there however I believe she will explain why she had done so herself (I will ask her to do so) and from our reads being so different however there are multiple differences in our reads:<br>
1 - Priestess is the newer part of our hydra and has more posts.<br>
2 - Priestess posted their thing much earlier on than I had done so (Around 3hrs difference). Which meant I had access to more posts to consider. Not necessarily from your team but from other ones.<br>
3 - Just because we are working together, I do not believe it means our reads (At least until night) need to be the exact same. In fact it’s probably good that we do both post our own opinions here because then you can see progression from each part of our hydra rather than see us as a joint entity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe this is caused by a different approach to hydras, but Geyde and I are treating our class card as the thread and compiling our various thoughts into wallposts, we are playing like a single slot which it appears you two are not doing as you said. I still don’t believe that yourself and Priestess’ opinions can differ so much on our slot in only three hours. Can you point out what in my wallpost that makes us such a strong townlean and what posts made between Priestess’ post and your post that made us such a strong read, as you said?</p>

<p>This is perhaps the thing I take most from this. I am unsure if scum versions of this class do exist, there may be and I’ll search that up.

This theory might be off… but those with less posts may have stronger roles since I believe our role is huge power but also huge variance.</p>
<p>At this point I am willing to claim. I will of course check with priestess before doing so but if we do claim, I would like protection and for a general consensus to be made by town for our target. My personal choice at this time would be the Arete/Disquieted slot.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is so wishywashy it isn’t funny. The fact you were townreading Jgoes doesn’t matter, its the fact your repeatedly shifted the thread back to the Marshal/Jgoes interaction after you had townread him and after the thread had naturally shifted away from their interaction.</p>
<p>If you want to push us, push us: don’t shadethrow us by saying ‘I want to push you but I can’t because of post restrictions.’ This is a way to set up a mislynch in the future without actually exposing yourself to cross-examination.</p>
<p>My posts have mostly been my reads, sometimes expanded or critiqued by Geyde, since I have been slightly more active than Geyde, however, I have been using some of the words he uses as we have been discussing people’s posts in our class card and he used the terms which I added to my post to flesh out what we want to say. Why does it even matter if Geyde speaks through myself in the first place? We’re a hydra and the same slot so regardless of who’s mouth it comes from it still has the exact same meaning. This seems like a weird way of throwing shade on Geyde once again for almost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, it’s really interesting to me that you ignored our main point on you, which was where we called you out for discrediting Geyde, and by extension, myself, based upon previous performance when it was only I who had posted at the time.</strong> <strong>Your lack of interaction with my post (and hedging on our slot) was also telling that you wanted to find a way to scumread us without any actual reasoning thereby, avoiding cross-examination once again. Why are you so scared of meaningful interaction?</strong> Additionally, you’ve been extraordinarily aggressive towards Marshal, which is something I’ve never seen from you before, why are you like this this game?</p>
<p>Evidence for your shifting to Marshal:</p>

If I were to summarize it, I would say something like: “Arete talks a lot but does not get anywhere.” And it feels wrong to say that, because there <em>is</em> some progresison in their posts (like the flip on the Mercenary read)… in general though, I feel like Arete has been doing more talking than solving.

<p>The thread really is warping around Marshal and I agree with Arete in that sense. I feel like this makes Marshal more towny because considering the thread has been warping around him, it’s highly likely someone wants to lynch him (especially since he apparently doesn’t have a post restriction and that’s bad for scum if he’s town). The obvious answer would be Jgoes, but I’m still uncertain about his alignment. Marshal <em>could</em> still be scum here, and I do get bad vibes from some of his posts… I don’t know. I feel like I can’t really resolve Marshal’s alignment because of how many people have interacted with him, and I know for a fact I’m not great at analyzing interactions.</p>
<p>If I were to select a lynch today, I would probably choose someone who interacted with Marshal in a meaningful way, because there are people here who should be able to read into that person’s interactions much better than I will.</p>

<p>Before I get into reads and such, I want to clarify that Disquieted and I are in fact a hydra, since I’ve seen a couple people trying to read us as two separate slots? Anyways, we’re not two slots, we’re one slot.</p>
<p>As for reads:</p>
<p>Thinking Astand is very likely V here; his posts have felt very solvey and the thought process feels natural to me whereas W!Astand usually has a hard time producing content or interacting with the thread. He’s probably my strongest townread at the moment.</p>
<p>Luxy/Geyde are basically null for me right now ( <s>sidenote: this is such a hecking stacked hydra</s> ). I like the 1 post Luxy has made but I’m having a hard time trying to e.g. analyze his progression because, well, it’s one post, and they’re both strong enough players that I’m not going to put them in my townpile for a single good post.</p>
<p>Simon: you all who are scumreading Simon for focusing on mechanics here are pretty much ignoring his meta, mechanical talk is NAI for him. Aside from that, he’s a slight townlean at the moment based on his attempts to actually generate content (see: interactions with PKR).</p>
<p>Townreading Shurian for a couple reasons – one is the snap-vote at the start of the thread followed by an immediate warning to not do that, I think mafia would either realize you can’t vote in-thread and refrain from doing it, or if they did make that mistake they wouldn’t immediately warn people not to because if you warn people there’s no chance of them doing it again. The other, more significant reason is his wallpost; he’s taking a lot of stances and drawing a lot of conclusions in the post, which is a huge contrast to his scumgames which are basically non-stop hedging.</p>
<p>Datbird: Null.</p>
<p>Priestess/PKR is a townlean for the moment, I’m liking Priestess’s spicy anti-consensus read on the Marshal reactiontest; it feels town-motivated because as scum she … it’s complicated but she doesn’t like to call attention to herself in this specific way.</p>
<p>Marshal: Stop clearing him for doing reactiontests, as one of his LotR teammates I can confirm that he does them all the time, either to elicit reactions that help scum (as in the Derps case) or as fake reactiontests for towncred (there’s an example of this on D3, where he “reactiontests” me and uses it as an excuse to townread me). I’m getting weird gut feelings from how he keeps deferring to direct quotes from Klopps’s guide whenever people criticize his reads; he’s a slight scumlean for now.</p>
<p>Vulgard/Squid: This slot is one of my strongest townreads at the moment, mostly on the basis of Vul’s half; I’m not seeing LotR Vul at all here and his readwall just screams town!Vul to me.</p>
<p>Katze/Litten is a null.</p>
<p>Derps is a townlean mostly for meta reasons, but to be honest the whole ‘I’m ignoring my postcap’ thing gives me towny vibes for reasons I can’t really articulate.</p>
<p>Maxwell is a null.</p>
<p>Jake/Alice is a null.</p>
<p>Merc is a slight scumlean at the moment, the whole neut hunting thing with Jgoes is <em>weird</em> .</p>

<p>Judging my Marshal’s TMI I would say that scum knows everyone has a post restriction</p>

<p>This post kind of seems to be TMIing Marshal as scum as well. She barely interacts with nor attempts to read Marshal and then concludes from his reactiontest that scum know that post restrictions are a thing, when she doesn’t even express the conclusion that he’s scum at any point.</p>
<p>Jgoes/Chemist: Townlean on this slot, actually. I like his conviction and I’m basically inclined to read him as a L1 player, meaning his conviction is likely to be town-AI. The reasons for scumreading him seem to more or less be that he pushed on Marshal for his reaction test but the person who started that narrative <em>is Marshal</em> and Jgoes’s thought process here feels natural to me.</p>
<p>Maxi: Null, unless Astand turns out to not be FPSing.</p>
<p>Nerbins: Null.</p>
<p>I’m going to pull a Geyde here and do a threadread on the Jgoes/Marshal thing; the way the entire thread has been warping around it feels super unnatural given the triviality of the interaction and based on that unnaturalness I’m thinking there’s at least one scum involved in the continuing discussion of it.</p>

I’m also curious about you putting Marshal and Jgoes in the same high tier – can you tell me more about how you’re reading that interaction?</p>

<p>Disagree with your reasoning as expressed in your previous posts. Like, you’re basically accusing him of having an overly narrow look on the game and tunneling you just to look productive, right, if I’m reading your quotes from Klopps’s guide correctly – but he has <em>four posts total</em> , so concluding that his look on the game is excessively narrow (particularly when those posts aren’t even all about you) is kind of premature. If anything, your overfocusing on Jgoes is displaying a narrow look on the game, seeing as you’re still focusing on his read on you.</p>

<p>…I’m dumb. Don’t put <em>scum</em> in the towncore.</p>
<p>Also, reversing my previous read on Merc; her focus here on townhunting is a good look for her as when she’s scum she’s far more likely to just shadethrow at everyone else in the game, which is pretty much the exact opposite of what she’s doing here.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to shut down any form of early scumread whatsoever, I’m saying that your specific reasoning in this case is flawed. In particular, you’re scumreading him for an overly narrow focus, but since, you know, he literally has four posts total, it’s not surprising that those posts are mostly focused on one thing.</p>
<p>Also not a fan of how Marshal keeps OMGUSing people who scumread him <s>even if he does it as town too</s> .</p>

<p>They are slightly townread, it looks as if they were high because most people are null (the people on the giant block) since I don’t have foccused on them in particular.<br>
I’m trying to go slower on that game and making few strong reads rather than a lot of shitty ones, so I plan on getting the nulls later.<br>
Marshal is literally only gut town, Jgoes because of his L1ness confidence.</p>

<p>I still want more details on how you’re looking at that interaction. Are you seeing it as TvT, and if so why?</p>

<p>Except that you aren’t looking at people’s reasons for reading you as scum or him as town, you’re just attacking everyone who does and acting like the only reason they could have for doing that is being scum, which isn’t true <em>even if you’re town and Jgoes is scum</em> .

Loving Jake’s wallpost, this is basically the best thing I’ve seen from him in a game of forum mafia ever.

<p>As you can see she hasn’t made a single push all game. She scumreads Marshal and asks a few questions but she hasn’t pushed for his lynch or tried to pressure him at all. She also had only 1 scumread and everything else null/townreads which gives her a lot of space to shift her reads in the future if one of her mislynches makes themselves unlynchable. (If she is scum.)</p>
<p>I don’t know who was accusing her of having a cyclical thoughtstate, she’s just underwhelming at this point.</p>
<p>Again, Arete is null for us she hasn’t done anything that suggests town or scum to us, and thats why shes in the PoE.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mafia is too scared to contest it and won’t do anything until it presses on a scum member</li>

<p>We’ve already pointed out that people townreading us off of one post was particularly scummy because it appears that scum do not know how to treat out slot and will just nightkill us to get rid of us.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/mercenary.html">@Mercenary</a> is there anything we have posted that you disagree with?</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway, the main point of this post is that PKR’s response to our scumread of them was ok, but Priestess’ was particularly bad and their interactions as a hydra don’t really make sense as a hydra unless they aren’t communicating as they claim. Priestess completely ignored our main point, and shadethrew whilst simultaneously making an excuse not to push us. Therefore, I still think the slot is particularly scummy.</p>

          <p>I feel like my post made a culture clash of sort, or maybe people had a misconception of my position in the game.</p>
<p>My primary position here is to advise Arete in reads and other non-obvious ways to be a good townie. I’m not really here to do conventional hunting of mafia; this excludes making reads, pushes, and the like, though I may do it publicly for example purposes or maybe I’ll get bored. Usually that’s not what I do anyways even if I wasn’t in a mentor role, and to be perfectly honest I wasn’t expecting to post this game, but since eevee gave me the posts I might as well use them. And either way I find the, um, meta here curious now that I’m viewing it while in the moment, so to speak. You’re gonna find a lot more questions from me this game with no clear shading in of alignments, but maybe you’ll find the implied conclusions thought provoking yourself.</p>
<p>Not current at all, but I saw that being questioned and thought it deserved a response. I can already see my presence being kind of flaky, barely had the interest to come back to the thread after being busy in RL, I guess I just hope I don’t abandon my partner here. That would be embarrassing.</p>

          <p>Shrug, FK is busy with school and stuff so I’ll just post this without running my opinions by him. Let’s see how I do!</p>
<p>Not gonna make an entire readlist as half of it would be null reads anyway.</p>
<p>In my eyes, there’s a high chance that the Marshal vs PKRiestess posting earlier is TvS - and I’m leaning more towards Priestess here. <em>However</em>, I do think the odds of this being SvS aren’t unreasonably high either.</p>

<p>I fully admit to that. I feel like everyone jumped way too fast on the <em>Jgoes failed in Marshal’s “reactiontest”</em> . Something is definitely wrong here in thread movement. Way too many people are scumreading Jgoes. This means for me: either Jgoes is getting bussed, or he’s just town. This all is unnatural. I don’t like the progression of Marshal on him at all.</p>

<p>But really, <em><strong>150 posts later</strong></em> she brings this up again? Perhaps I’m looking too much into her ISO, because I know Vulgard mentioned the Priestess/Marshal dynamic, but this really doesn’t feel right to me. I also do agree with Luxy/Geyde here, her “push” on them is… lacking.</p>

<p>With that said, I don’t know how to feel about Marshal either. His ISO fluctuates in my mind all over the town to scum scale. <strong>In my eyes, he’s either scum or VT.</strong> And I’m leaning slightly towards the latter.</p>
<p>Besides Marshal/PKRiestess:</p>
<p>Luxy/Geyde: Most likely town, I don’t think a scum would put this much effort without pushing on people harder.</p>
<p>Kai: Scumlean or very bored town. Will go into this in a bit.</p>
<p>Arete/Disquieted: Sort of leaning scum, but this is just a hunch really. I don’t really like any of their posts though. And they seem kind of eager to clear Kai…</p>

          <p>Hm.</p>
<p>So here’s my contribution for this little segment of time I guess. I’ll abstain from talking about the main topic of PKR/Priestess, and given what people have been saying about it I don’t really want to offer this as a lynch option so to speak but I’d like to know what’s going on here. Maybe you’ll find my opinion about them later when I talk to Arete about it.</p>
<p>As the person above me accurately notes, Kai has been aggressively fluffposting and people I think have taken note. Or Kai wants it to be taken note of. Whatever, my point is that it’s a control subject of how someone can act in this position. I’d lean townie over it given he would rationally have made himself a target over it, which no real scummer would have done. But hey, it could be a personality quirk, I don’t know many of you.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I’d draw attention to is SirDerpsALot. He has a significant amount of posts, third highest, even. He has given some reads, they aren’t very well formed, which is, sure, people are allowed to say what they want in 2019 and have it not be alignment indicative.</p>
<p>There has been a significantly less amount of attention on SirDerpsALot’s lack of content. Maybe I’m skimming way too hard but he’s not been mentioned much, nobody’s asking him for his opinion.</p>
<p>Am I missing a meta characteristic? Is this normal? Because I find people who slip under the radar in this respect are quite worrying. Sometimes it happens by design of the player, they kinda try and avoid confrontation cause they’re a mafia member. Sometimes they’re just ignored by a significant informed minority because they’re their teammate. Or maybe it’s just a quirk of the gamestate. Either way this post was designed to poke around and see what people are thinking there.</p>
<p>I don’t really seek to control conversation or a push here, just want to see what happens when I make this post. Might as well make one, it could likely be the last one I make for the day. I’ll try and rendezvous with Arete later… sigh.</p>

<p>Maybe this is caused by a different approach to hydras, but Geyde and I are treating our class card as the thread and compiling our various thoughts into wallposts, we are playing like a single slot which it appears you two are not doing as you said. I still don’t believe that yourself and Priestess’ opinions can differ so much on our slot in only three hours. Can you point out what in my wallpost that makes us such a strong townlean and what posts made between Priestess’ post and your post that made us such a strong read, as you said?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Absolutely! Let me address this into multiple parts:<br>
1 - Since reading up on your post and Arete’s I’ve spoken to Eevee and posting in our classcard will not cause me to lose posts I can be using here. This means that myself and <a class="mention" href="../../u/anon97870008.html">@anon97870008</a> will be communicating more often now that we know it’s a viable option.<br>
2 - What in your wallpost made you such a townlean?</p>

<p>Geyde pointed out her second post to me, and how she actually made conclusions in this post which were completely lacking in her Marson game. Shurian was very wishywashy and ‘off with the fairies’ during Marson and from my informed perspective of that game I believe she was trying to imitate how confused she was in SFoL 53. Here she’s a lot more direct and makes conclusions off of her second post (even if she didn’t read the OP).</p>

<p><em>Lotsa Fluff Incoming</em></p>
<p>Havent seen one of Vul’s beautiful scum games yet, but the meta here is very, very strikingly similar to Looming Thread, just the difference of keeping an open mind (Well that went to shit pretty quickly, rip Vul’s emotions). That’s pretty good, but we’ll get to that, continue this in my last paragraph.</p>
<p>People voting Maxi-<br>
Meta… Hmm… Yes Joke No Joke, all the same to me.</p>
<p>I like memes. Language is an international tool of communication.</p>
<p>Eevee and Luxy (Especially Luxy) - Discussing Forum Matters here is absolutely not the choice here. Like why would you do that?<br>
Ah, yes this is mountainous. I suspect either Luxy and Eevee OR just Luxy to be scum here. I think Luxy is intentionally attempting a sway of emotions of Eevee… wait but that doesn’t make sense does it? Am I going crazy? I really think Eevee and Luxy staged that, as minor as that seems to better fade among everyone else after that.</p>
<p>Vulgard is hot and angery~<br>
I see many of their posts, and oh boy. He’s definitely bothered. HE CALMED HIMSELF WOOO.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/maximusprime.html">@MaximusPrime</a> Remember that Triple Threat when I claimed ‘maid’? That sure was fun.

<p>At Post 1074<br>
Okay…<br>
Vulgard is either playing really exceptionally as scum here…<br>
Or just tombstone town.</p>
<p>I’ll stop commenting on the Vul situation here. (Post 1076)<br>
Fuck when did this whole Vul vs the world start again? I’m sure it’s like after I left for my camp but when really was it?</p>
<p>Midnight, gotta sleep, but I’ll lean towards a Luxy lynch here. <strong>/vote Luxy</strong> based on the weird af interaction between the two listed like way above.<br>

<p>Overall, we came to the conclusion that Shurian is probably town from how conclusive her opening post was (disregarding the Marshal vote). We noted that Shurian is her usual bubbly self but she isn’t using the bubbliness as an excuse to not contribute like she did in Marson as another reason for being town.</p>

<p>More discussion and in depth analysis which shows that everything <em>has</em> been considered. These are just 2 examples (So I don’t end up quoting the entire thing) but you analysed things meticulously which to me suggests you’re both confident in your role and that you’re town</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Marshal’s post <span class="hashtag">#58</span> felt off. Can’t tell if it was just tonally defensive or if I just felt there was no point to it at the time. Yes, I know it could be interpreted as “It was just Marshal saying how to vote” but it felt weak pockety.<br>
Marshal’s post <span class="hashtag">#68</span> felt off too as well. I liked the post itself because it’s a simple truth. But then I thought about the intentions behind it and it felt somewhat pockety again <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png!v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
Squid’s <span class="hashtag">#70</span> I disliked due to it basically feeling either pockety (If Squid hydra is scum and I’m misreading Marsh) or like a scumbuddy defending their scummate. It felt like they were doubling down on earlier to post an easier mislynch.<br>
Derps’ <span class="hashtag">#74</span> was just… fluff, nothing more, nothing less. A waste. And <span class="hashtag">#77</span> again was just nothing, no analysis just a passing comment.<br>
Marsh <span class="hashtag">#79</span> shortly followed in reply to Derps’ <span class="hashtag">#77</span> and it again felt pockety somewhat “I know you can do it, so do it” and it kept feeling like Marsh has been going for cheap easy towncred anyone could go for.<br>
Nerbins’ <span class="hashtag">#93</span> was just… ridiculous tbh. And did not feel townie at the time but also felt somewhat twtbaw.</li>

<p>My role <strong>is about reads</strong> though. And if my reads are incorrect it can cause us to lose. If Eevee like you said designed the game to be reads over mechanics then a role (Mechanic) that is based off reads and read skill would make perfect sense I would think.</p>

Priestess completely ignored our main point, and shadethrew whilst simultaneously making an excuse not to push us. Therefore, I still think the slot is particularly scummy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again we had not communicated before this, but we do plan to do so from now on.</p>
</details>
<p>Also I pinged Priestess inside this spoiler because I want her to read it. I hope it will be useful for discussion from now on.</p>

<p>Not a Wall I Swear</p>
<p>So catching up, and I noticed two people scumreading/shading PKR for saying pr. When I think he means post restriction and from how I read their statements it seems like they are thinking power role. Thats a problem with acronyms so I want to ask the three of them to make sure Im reading this right, and dont worry I know we all have post restrictions so when you guys do your next post I want to ask, What did you all mean by PR in these three posts <a class="mention" href="../../u/pokemonkidryan.html">@PokemonKidRyan</a> , <a class="mention" href="../../u/simon.html">@Simon</a> , <a class="mention" href="../../u/katze.html">@katze</a></p>

<p>Honestly dont like this interaction with Marshal. He did something obviously wrong (basically a Meteoro I have a redcheck on you, or HTM why are you scum) and wasted people who have post restriction (or at least imma assume they do, cause everyone else but Marshal claimed they did) posts by saying oh its a reaction test, and the most he was going to get was</p>

<p>Just a nice thing to notice. I think scumreads per association are pretty important here. Not sure tho if we have conversion or not.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on the whole Marshal/Jgoes situation:</p>
<p>At some times, it feels like Marshal is scum.<br>
At other times, the inverse seems true.</p>
<p>Could it be that Marshal v Jgoes is TvT?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly theres been so much discussion on it, but honestly everyones pretty much said this has been TvS. I would love for people to reread it now and see if their opinions have changed. Atm I think im the same situation as you, where they both have been scummy and both have been town in other aspects, and I havent placed one into either scum or town yet.</p>

          <p>Scum wants to control the thread. Scum doesn’t want attention on them.</p>
<p>Conveniently Marshal’s “reactiontest” made him unable to do that, and he said he expected people to ignore him.</p>
<p>I’ve already said that It was obviously fake. So either scum was faking it or to was doing a reactiontest (But iirc Marshal’s reactiontests weren’t as obvious, and actually had a point, so I said that option was unlikely.) It’s not impossible, since I have seen bad reactiontests come from town (Like Derps in Old Ruins).</p>
<p>I’m assuming you’re going to ask me why he would make it so obviously fake as scum, and I think he did that so he could fall back on it being a reactiontest.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what he did, and he used that as an excuse to try to steer the thread towards a lynch on his accuser.</p>
<p>I hope I’ll have enough time to do my meta-read on him before EoD, but I’ve been very busy all day, and I can’t do it right now, since I’m at a restaurant with my parents.</p>
