<p>Like I said, I’m waiting until I can talk to FK some more. We haven’t talked very much about <em>this</em> game, as much as FK has been prioritizing teaching me how the entire game of forum mafia works. So I’ll probably still be pretty slow on my posts until tomorrow at least.</p>

<p>When I think he means post restriction and from how I read their statements it seems like they are thinking power role. Thats a problem with acronyms so I want to ask the three of them to make sure Im reading this right, and dont worry I know we all have post restrictions so when you guys do your next post I want to ask, What did you all mean by PR in these three posts</p>

</aside>
<p>I definitely thought he meant Power Role - but rereading the post Post Restriction definitely looks like what he meant. Thanks for making me rethink that.</p>

<p>Geyde pointed out that astand’s ISO was entirely shading and an attempt to establish authority. None of their posts further the gamestate at all.</p>
<p>I thought that all of astand’s posts so far are extremely reactive and lack focus, and the fact that he only slank covered after everyone else suggests to me that he is scum wanting to stay under the radar, by not drawing attention to himself for his slank cover (‘others have done it as well why are you singling me out’ would be his defence).</p>
<p>The shadethrow on Kai for talking about his Post Restriction (he just ‘happened’ to interpret it as Power Role even though it wa obvious Kai was talk about his Post Limit), was particularly bad in my eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I was posting from phone while still lying on the bed, so I sure as hell didn’t have time or will to do anything significant at the time. I won’t even deny the claim that my posts were reactionary.<br>
As for Kai’s post, It didn’t occur to me at the moment that PR could refer to post restrictions as well. I didn’t comprehend his post in full. You can blame me being still sleepy if you want.<br>
I got frustrated because it looked to me like people were already starting to talk about their roles.<br>
If I were scum and had an intent to shade Kai or anything, I’d have chosen a reason that would at least hold water on surface level, and implying that I “misinterpreted” the abbreviation of PR on purpose is just silly.</p>
<p>That said, disregarding the actual content Luxy posted (which I find mostly reasonable enough), there is one villagery indicator that they made in that post, which I have a reason not to explain for now.<br>
So Luxy &amp; Geyde are a mild village lean.</p>

<p>I personally really like astand’s defence, it made sense and it explained his reactionary posts. He has since been much more engaged with the thread, and his town conviction is there which his scumgame struggles to emulate. This is especially pertinent as astand dislikes playing scum, so from our perspective, we’re leaning town on him.</p>

<p>I have. Multiple times.</p>
<p>And what’s wrong with gettng agressive? even on LHF’s?</p>
<p>A direct quote from the article in which i have been basing my play</p>
<p>After playing mafia for some time I came to the conclusion that <strong>chaos is good for the village.</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion there is nothing else wolves would like to do more the whole game than to be involved in a long, peaceful discussion with other players. This is the easiest way for them to hide simply because any competent wolf is going to be able to fabricate solid reads, answer questions and ask some good ones himself. What causes good wolves to make mistakes is pressure and emotions. There is very little emotion in a debate that lasts for 20 hours.</p>
<p>A very effective way of learning someone’s alignment is placing a player in a position they weren’t expecting to be in and which they were not ready for. Wolves can crumble under pressure and that mostly happens during two stages of the game, openings and EODs.</p>
<p>I am gonna play strong this game. I don’t have a PR, and so i am gonna use my ability to post and lead this game. I am gonna powervillage. Things are gonna get out of the confort zone. That’s where you catch wolves.</p>

</aside>
<p>Marshal’s posts aren’t careful, and completely disregard his self-image. This indicates that he’s more likely to be town. Given how this game is dominated by wallposts, his provacative play sticks out makes it easy to push. Both Geyde and I agree that his conviction is towny as he’s ‘all there’ and not partially in the game like in SFoL 53.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Firekitten/Katze</strong></p>
<p>We’re slightly townleaning this slot because katze feels very pure and Firekitten’s post on Marshal hit the nail on the head:</p>

<p>I’m depressed and I only can post ten times this game. This makes it even worse because it’s a pain to try to quote posts and make wall posts here compared to MafiaUniverse.</p>
<p>First thing I wanted to talk about this game is this game. I think it’s pretty obvious at its base that it was built around improving people’s play and that Eevee put a lot of time into this game considering that he worked for three months on this. However this setup isn’t just based on trying to improve people’s play by making them post more content, there’s a lot of lessons Eevee will be putting in this game if he spent more then three months working on this game.</p>
<p>People don’t want to listen to this. People are going to call me scum for trying to appear to be doing something when I’m not, however this is absolutely needed because if we actually want to improve as a community we need to people to actually listen to the lessons that he tries to tell people here.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think that Eevee will be stressing this game is Reads&gt;Mechanics. Eevee is an absolute believer in Reads&gt;Mechanics that there is likely a lot of mechanics that are designed to trick town into thinking the wrong thing. If you read someone as scum push them, don’t be afraid to push them because someone claimed a green check on them. This lesson is crucial in forum mafia, because there’s a lot of times where mechanics will agree you. For example, a game I was recently in I used mechanics to my advantage. The mechanics made me “confirmed as town” when I was scum. Some people scumread me but were too afraid to push me until it was too late.</p>
<p>Something else is the post restrictions, and this is important for everyone to listen to. One of the things that’s been bothering me this game is how Marshal is playing this game. He’s not thinking through his points rationally, there’s a lot of flaw with his logic. If you compare to this to other people with post restrictions, they have more content in their posts and less flaws then him, even though they have flaws in their posts.</p>
<p>Marshal, a person who has no post restriction, has more flaws in their argument then someone with a post restriction. That’s the important part here, because Marshal doesn’t feel the need to save their posts, they will post whatever is on their mind regardless of how flawed it is because they aren’t looking that closely at it as would someone who needs to decide what to say and how important he is.</p>
<p>Now that I said that, I’m going to work with Katze on getting them to improve at reading people and teaching them how to be convincing. I know that I was given ten posts so I can work on how to convince people in fewer posts, but I would rather work on that where it’s easier to actually ISO people and wall post.</p>

<p><strong>Disquieted.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like the aspects of Disquieted’s opening post flew under the radar of multiple players.</p>
<p>I personally get bad vibes from Disquieted, because their opening post feels incredibly performative for my tastes. The amount of questions they ask there feels like they are trying way too hard to kick the game off and move things along. Besides, they are hyperfocused on a single player and I think that’s a bad thing, it shows a narrow perspective on the game (as bold as it is to say that this early, based on just one post). Several people have posted, but Disquieted only picked one of them to tunnel and ask a bajillion of questions.</p>

<p>Hi. I’m a bit disquieted right now.</p>
<p>Jgg, I’m reading through your posts. What are you going for here? Are you saying Marshal is scummy or not? And why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, from my PoV it was either scum looking to appear towny, or town with a pointless, obvious reactiontest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So walk me through this. You drag Marshal’s reaction test out in the open because… if it was town, you found it stupid? But it also could be mafia? Like what I’m getting here is that you’re not really scumreading Marshal here but you decided to make a large post anyways to call it out, why?</p>
<p>Also why are you asking about your own hydra partner…? Chemist is gonna come along eventually, you guys can get to know exactly who each other are in private, when there’s other players in this game that I don’t think you know?</p>
<p>Marshal, what exactly were you hoping to accomplish out of this reaction test? Like obviously you got some reads out of it, but your thought process was, “I’m gonna just drop that I accidentally passed my post restriction, and…?” Like what are some standard mafia/town reactions that you were expecting? Were you just not gonna say anything for the rest of the day? What’s the deal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disquieted asked <em>thirteen questions</em> in a single post and only two out of fifteen statements there were not questions.<br>
I honestly don’t understand why their post has garnered so many likes. The post is utterly bizarre to me, and I feel like it never comes from town because you can’t reasonably expect someone to answer so many questions this early. Asking them thirteen questions hardly helps solve the game or that player’s alignment - they are automatically given an excuse not to answer all of them, especially the inconvenient ones, because <em>nobody will respond to thirteen questions at this stage of the game, within a single post, and give genuine/elaborate thought on all of them.</em><br>
I feel like Disquieted is trying way too hard to seem like they know nothing and want to gather information. But that’s my take on it.<br>
I want to wait for a bit to see how Disquieted follows up on all these questions. If there <em>is</em> followup and I like it, they are going to become townier in my eyes. Or if it was a lolreactiontest on Jgoes, but I’m not sure if asking a metric ton of questions is a good reactiontest. Ugh, I just don’t like that play (if it was even a play) on so many levels and I feel like scum motivation is written all over it. That said, it’s only one post and Arete still hasn’t posted… If anyone can redeem that opening slot in my eyes, it’s Arete. I’m totally unbiased. What Disquieted wrote is not 100% damning but it’s pretty damn suspicious to me and I want to make it known</p>

<p>Now <strong>Marshal</strong> and <strong>Jgoesgaming</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know what to think about Marshal’s reaction test, it seemed pretty reachy. Jgoes’ reaction to it was interesting as my initial reaction to Marshal’s test was ‘Marshal has a 10 post limit he just used up <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/man_facepalming.png!v=9" title=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":man_facepalming:">.’ On the other hand, Jgoes decides to scumread Marshal for it? I don’t really understand the mindset Jgoes was in, and he hedges on it as well:</p>

<p>No, from my PoV it was either scum looking to appear towny, or town with a pointless, obvious reactiontest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t really see how scum try to look towny from that post, the only way it would’ve been scum indicative for myself is if Marshal was just trying to pretend he couldn’t post anymore so he didn’t have to generate anymore content.</p>
<p>However, I do believe this was a valid point:</p>

<p><em>Then</em> you check your classcard, see that you only have one post left, and decide that you should waste it immediatly on telling us that.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting, producing content like you’ve been asking Jake to do, putting that all in one wallpost, and then telling us that was your last post?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>From the perspective of a player who thinks Marshal is out of posts, this would make sense right? Yet Jgoes himself admitted he saw it as a reaction test or scum trying to get towncred. Neither of these scenarios make sense with the above post which indicates Jgoes was probably trying to shadethrow Marshal for it, rather than think about what Marshal was doing.</strong></p>
<p>If Jgoes thought it was a reaction test (from town), why call out Marshal with so much shade?<br>
If Jgoes thought it was scum trying to get towncred, why wouldn’t he actually state that he thinks Marshal is lying about his PR and therefore, is actually scum?</p>
<p>Also I don’t really see how scum!Marshal could’ve gained towncred from this, by the looks of it, everyone has a posting limit.</p>
<p>Overall I’m leaning scum on Jgoes.</p>

<p>This readlist is objectively awful, however, the main thing to note is her read on us. <strong>She instantly starts discrediting what we say</strong> by saying ‘Geyde has bad Day 1 reads’ (Something I don’t remember at all btw) thereby, removing us as a threat. Furthermore, she basically ignores me and focuses on Geyde, despite only myself having posted, and most of the reads in my wallpost being my own. Priestess absolutely refuses to engage with anything I actually said, and instead basically attack’s Geyde when he hadn’t posted yet</p>

<p>She’s extremely aggressive this game, which is unlike anything I’ve ever seen from her. She accuses Marshal of OMGUSing for defending himself like what? She also pushes him for pushing a newbie in a hydra when newbies are often the easiest way to read a high skill/low skill hydra pair. More agression:</p>

<p>This reaction by astand to the RVS vote was quite confusing. Tonally something is off because I feel that Town!Astand would’ve realised it’s a RVS vote instead of being so serious this early on in the game. However since astand has not done this in any previous games it makes it hard to tell what exactly went on here.</p>
<p>Marshal wasted 4 posts, 3 of which literally pinged everyone and then one other which claimed to have softed. I do not understand why this happened but it either tells me Marshal has a small restriction to his posts or none at all (I guess it is the former)</p>

<p>Basic intro post. Doesn’t really say too much, but it does suggest Noz has a PR of 50 posts (Lucky fuck getting 2.5 x the amount than me) and that his class is unusual but interesting to him which may become relevant later -This is more of a note for the future than anything particularly read wise since this post was NAI mostly-</p>

<p>I don’t think there was even really a randomization because of the restriction I got (I’m not putting it further in details because OP tells me there are anti-claim mechanics, but my posts will make it really explicit). This might sound early-ish but I don’t really believe Marshal would “soft” their class when we have no idea of which kind of claimvig (most likely, since there are no flavors) was put in the thread as scum, so it gives me a small townlean edge over him.</p>
<p>I’ll further analyze the posts tomorrow, but now I should go to sleep. Anyway this game seems interesting and I’m quite curious on how it will turn out.</p>

<p>Astand is right tbh, but no one has given the initial push for the game to become content <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/copyright.png!v=9" title=":copyright:" class="emoji" alt=":copyright:">. So here is my initial push. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wave.png!v=9" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This post reads really well for Mercenary’s slot. I personally agree on the restriction thing seeming to not be random and more which I think is a note which scum wouldn’t have wanted to out. Mine’s a challenge because of the fact I usually post so much and get annoyed but Eevee’s forcing me to post a maximum amount of times and then just… let what happens happen.</p>
<p>The claimvig comment was a bit unusual, however it is typically best to assume the worst when there are anti-claim mechanics unless everyone decides to claim for some reason. That way it would encourage caution which once again I don’t think scum would want to do.</p>
<p>Then we go to Merc’s response to Noz’s post which again, I agree with. This doesn’t necessarily mean I read it in any way, but it’s something to note.</p>
<p>Finally comes Merc’s response to Astand I believe is at least decent. That one post by astand probably was the best one they made up until this point, it hints at them having a PR (And Merc too) however other than that it helps to see if people stay on the same page.</p>

<p>Jake’s entrance post is here, I find it to be rather lacklustre but I typically do expect this from Jake. He’s quite cryptic and is avoiding discussing in thread without discussing it with others.

<p>I… don’t know how to feel about this. Marshal typically is a clever person who reads everything carefully and critically analyses every last detail so it almost makes it… hard to believe that he’d make such a crucial mistake which prevents him from being able to speak. I certainly think if this is true, then Town!Marshal would’ve known from the start what exactly to do and like I’ve done it, calculate how many posts they can make within (x) time. It doesn’t read well whatsoever, it’s either a lie or a screwup and either of these I don’t think would come from Town!Marshal.</p>

<p>This is probably one of my favourite posts of the game thus far. I feel like this annoyance that Jgoes posts in after the final quote is real and comes from a town perspective. I like the analysis of Marshal too, since I feel a similar way (As I’ve put earlier on in this wallpost).</p>
<p>I know Chemist (If Chemist is Chemist1422). They’re a player from my home forums Town of Salem. They’ve apparently according to other players played on Mafia Universe too. They’re a nice person, doesn’t really play in a “OMG this is amazing” way but consistent, doesn’t change things up much from what I know.</p>

<p>I think all this today shows is that Marshal has so little reliability. It’s as if he lied, then waited in order to fake a reaction test and motivationally feels scummy as heck since I have not seen this from Town!Marshal before.</p>
<p>If Marshal has done this before I would appreciate if someone would quote it because I don’t remember it and it just oozes scum to me.</p>

<p>Hi. I’m a bit disquieted right now.</p>
<p>Jgg, I’m reading through your posts. What are you going for here? Are you saying Marshal is scummy or not? And why?</p>

<p>No, from my PoV it was either scum looking to appear towny, or town with a pointless, obvious reactiontest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So walk me through this. You drag Marshal’s reaction test out in the open because… if it was town, you found it stupid? But it also could be mafia? Like what I’m getting here is that you’re not really scumreading Marshal here but you decided to make a large post anyways to call it out, why?</p>
<p>Also why are you asking about your own hydra partner…? Chemist is gonna come along eventually, you guys can get to know exactly who each other are in private, when there’s other players in this game that I don’t think you know?</p>
<p>Marshal, what exactly were you hoping to accomplish out of this reaction test? Like obviously you got some reads out of it, but your thought process was, “I’m gonna just drop that I accidentally passed my post restriction, and…?” Like what are some standard mafia/town reactions that you were expecting? Were you just not gonna say anything for the rest of the day? What’s the deal?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I love disquieted’s opening. Despite it being quite slow, they question Jgoesgaming which is a good thing to do at that point and at the same time question Marshal when they’re the two who the main focus would probably be on due to the whole ‘reaction test’ and reaction due to that.</p>
<p>I’ve already commented on Luxy not long after this post so look at my ISO to find out my reaction to it. TL;DR Luxy seems pretty townie from their actions there. And I’mma skip some other posts from around then since I was around at that time and commented on anything I thought was important.</p>

<p>I can somewhat understand diquieted’s last paragraph.</p>
<p>Most of my reaction tests aren’t… great. And scum reaction tests are a thing(look at how i got derps to slip a claim in LOTRFM) so i can understand the concern.</p>
<p>however, taking a wider stance, this <em>does</em> seem a little hedgey from disq. Pushing on both me and jgoes could very well come from scum.</p>
<p>I’m null on them right now, as one can only glean so much from an opener.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This again serves to further worry me about Marshal being scum. Marshal does not usually post like this. I feel like Marshal’s trying to fencesit all about Disquieted and that again is something I don’t often see from Town!Marshal. The self meta also is something that is not normal or good <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png!v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>A bit after this comes the return of Astand, but this is where I feel my read slowly changing. Astand’s content improves drastically and they’re actively discussing things which went on instead of trying to fly under the radar which is more townie than before.</p>
<p>Priestess had interactions with Marshal. Didn’t like them and Squid sticking up for Marshal as well just felt weird motivation wise, I don’t understand why Squid did it. Either attempting to pocket Marshal or just defend a teammate. Will quote if needed but I really cannot waste this post on having to split it into 2.</p>

<p>Chemist… you do remember my style in literally all of the FM games we’ve played together, right?</p>
<p>I’ll take control as much as I can (Can’t do that easily due to my shitty PR here) then claim when I’ve got enough townreads and work from there with my reads since I know there I’ll have protection on me. Here, me asking for protection is just a meme T-T</p>
<p>As a result, I find this to be a confusing post and I’d like more elaboration for why me claiming PR is scummy. People here know that it’s something I do a lot (I claimed Doc/Retri in a game with a claimvig and died due to it)</p>

</aside>
<p>This readlist is just bad, but again, we just can’t seem to understand his read on ourselves. It seems as if the scum know our slot is strong so don’t know how to deal with it so they’re just going to kill us night.  Note how we’re somehow Pkr’s highest townread despite us only having one post at the time, with that post being one he didn’t engage with at all. His reads on Vulgard and Jake don’t make sense at all. Also look at this blatant contradiction between their reads, again centred on our slot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luxy &amp; Geyde (1) - Holy shit. Both good players, on the same spot? On the first glance the reads sound okay, but Geyde is known for his bad reads on D1. I’ll come back to this later. I think I have to read this slot by associations + intentions. Being solvey is definitely NAI for Geyde, and I guess for Luxy too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Luxy/Geyde</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestess discredits us/nullreads us and PKR puts us as his top townread! Surely if they were a town hydra, they would have discussed their reads together before posting them, right? His clear on two strong wolf players based on one post seems like an attempt to pocket us and then nightkill us later. Additionally, Pkr just happens to claim self-confirming in a game where almost everything is NAI. Tinfoil time: PKR is a mafia role which is designed to ‘confirm’ itself as town.</p>
<p>Final thing to note: Priestess consistently forced the thread back onto Marshal, even when there was a natural transition off of him. This is beneficial from a scum perspective as there is a potential two mislynches there. Geyde noted that the thread warped around that interaction, meaning there was at least one scum involved, and we think it was Priestess.</p>
<p>Arete also picks up on this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Arete" data-post="156" data-topic="78994">

<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to pull a Geyde here and do a threadread on the Jgoes/Marshal thing; the way the entire thread has been warping around it feels super unnatural given the triviality of the interaction and based on that unnaturalness I’m thinking there’s at least one scum involved in the continuing discussion of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This strongly condemns Priestess in our minds.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, Priestess/PokemonKidRyan’s slot is probably the best lynch for today followed by Jgoes’s slot in our opinion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Here is our current PoE</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arete &amp; Disquieted - Null</li>
<li>Astand - Townlean</li>
<li>Luxy &amp; Geyde</li>
<li>Simon - Slight Town</li>
<li>Kai - Slight Town</li>
<li>Shurian - Townlean</li>
<li>DatBird - Null</li>
<li>Priestess &amp; PKR - Scumlean</li>
<li>Marshal - Townlean</li>
<li>Vulgard &amp; Squid - Townlean</li>
<li>Katze &amp; Firekitten - Slight Townlean</li>
<li>Derps - Townlean</li>
<li>Maxwell - Null/Slight Scumlean</li>
<li>Jake &amp; Alice - Townlean</li>
<li>Merc - Null</li>
<li>Jgoes &amp; Mist1422 - Scumlean</li>
<li>Maximus - Greenchecked by astand/Townlean</li>
<li>Nerbins - Slight Scumlean</li>
</ol>
<p>This leaves PoE as Arete+Disquieted/DatBird/Priestess+PKR/Maxwell/Mercenary/Jgoes+Mist/Nerbins</p>
<p>Given there are probably 4 or 5 scum in this setup. This PoE is very tight.</p>
<p>Simon and Kai can possibly be in the PoE but gut says town for both at this point in time.</p>
<hr>
<p>To conclude, we should only lynch in the above PoE today, and we believe Priestess/PKR are most likely to flip scum out of the entire PoE.</p>

Overall I have had more reasons to scumread other slots. I do not understand why Priestess scumread you at the time as that was quite early in the day iirc.</p>

<p>Surely if they were a town hydra, they would have discussed their reads together before posting them, right? His clear on two strong wolf players based on one post seems like an attempt to pocket us and then nightkill us later.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I understand where you are coming from due to Priestess forcing the discussion back and forth there however I believe she will explain why she had done so herself (I will ask her to do so) and from our reads being so different however there are multiple differences in our reads:<br>
1 - Priestess is the newer part of our hydra and has more posts.<br>
2 - Priestess posted their thing much earlier on than I had done so (Around 3hrs difference). Which meant I had access to more posts to consider. Not necessarily from your team but from other ones.<br>
3 - Just because we are working together, I do not believe it means our reads (At least until night) need to be the exact same. In fact it’s probably good that we do both post our own opinions here because then you can see progression from each part of our hydra rather than see us as a joint entity.</p>
<p>I’d like to further point out this. You were not my only moderate town read at the time. Arete/Disquieted and Mercenary were in that category with you. So while I understand your concern due to the 1 post thing, the fact it was good meant you deserve moderate town along with 2 other slots I found were overall quite good.</p>

<p>His reads on Vulgard and Jake don’t make sense at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I explained Jake part way down with his opening and in his attitude which I did not believe town would have due to it being “dangerous”. Vulgard’s slot is mostly due to Squid since they are a hydra and I thought the way which they defended Marshal could be a pocket attempt if Marshal is town or could be an attempt to defend their buddy should they be a scumteam. I had mentioned this in my big post.</p>

<p>Additionally, Pkr just happens to claim self-confirming in a game where almost everything is NAI. Tinfoil time: PKR is a mafia role which is designed to ‘confirm’ itself as town.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is perhaps the thing I take most from this. I am unsure if scum versions of this class do exist, there may be and I’ll search that up. I want to point this out, I have been limited to 20 posts, as I have stated multiple times. This theory might be off… but those with less posts may have stronger roles since I believe our role is huge power but also huge variance.</p>
<p>At this point I am willing to claim. I will of course check with priestess before doing so but if we do claim, I would like protection and for a general consensus to be made by town for our target. My personal choice at this time would be the Arete/Disquieted slot.</p>

          <p>Yes, we do. By Luxy seemingly always discussing with their partner I would presume we can chat but we just haven’t really hence why we keep @ ing each other in the thread. This is kinda because I’ve never played hydra before. I also have avoided discussing there because I’ve been paranoid it’ll count towards my 20 limit per day. Probably should’ve asked eevee but <em>shrug</em> will do when he’s back.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a further thing to point out that was not addressed.<br>
While I was offline, Priestess posted her own reads. As proven by this quote:</p>

</aside>
<p>Luxy had mentioned how we had not discussed our reads.<br>
This of course is true, since we couldn’t discuss anyway if I was not around.</p>
<p>However I do not see exactly why that contributed to the read on our slot. I mentioned above why it might be different and I’m bringing this up again because I’ve expanded on reasoning here.</p>
<p>Post <span class="hashtag">#7</span> most people’s lucky one… But means I have the unlucky 13 posts to go if I want to use my maximum possible.</p>

          <p>This is the final post I’m gonna use tonight (Just because a: It’s 5:50 AM and b: I want to save up more for when I’m awake and after more discussions exists)</p>
<p>I did not get a link to a discord server, or at least I don’t remember getting one - -I woke up, saw our card, posted in the signups, then went on with my day. Game started, then I started calculating my stuff- - I do not know if this is an error or not. But at this point I will presume it may be since I townread Jgoes and do not think he’d lie.</p>
<p>I use forums mostly for discussion (Since this place is where the game takes place) so either:</p>
<ol>
<li>There actually is one, I’ve totally ignored it and now I’m going to look like an idiot</li>
<li>There was only one for Jgoes because Chem’s account here is new. So it was how they first were able to discuss pre-game start. Day start was 24 hours ago iirc but Chem’s account is like only 18 hours old</li>
<li>We are supposed to use PMs as our chat (And I just didn’t realise and was paranoid due to the 20 posts anyway thing)</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result I’d like to check with others how they communicate too since Jgoes’ team is probably the worst one to pick for comparison due to these facts I pointed out in <span class="hashtag">#2</span></p>
