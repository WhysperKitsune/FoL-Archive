</aside>
<p>Fun Aretefact of the day: I’ve been fake redchecked as town before (it was a reaction test that the reaction tester kept up for like half the day, in SFoL 52.) You aren’t acting like a townie that’s been redchecked because both of you are giving up completely on actually making reads or trying to solve the game, you’re just complaining about how sad you are that your poor innocent slot is being falsely accused by Astand, how horrible. This is more consistent with scum motivation because if you were town you would still want to solve the game so that we could actually make use of your reads once you were dead, while if you were scum you would want to minimize the extent to which you actually are trying to solve the game so as to avoid giving associatives.</p>

<p>So you’re just a wolf, then. Astand’s check <em>really</em> didn’t feel like a reactiontest, and I think he would have retracted by now if it was.</p>

<p>Correct. But if reads are greater than mechanics, do you trust the merit of a D2 red check so much more than your own reads? If so, I don’t really know what to tell you.</p>

<p>I don’t think there was even really a randomization because of the restriction I got (I’m not putting it further in details because OP tells me there are anti-claim mechanics, but my posts will make it really explicit). This might sound early-ish but I don’t really believe Marshal would “soft” their class when we have no idea of which kind of claimvig (most likely, since there are no flavors) was put in the thread as scum, so it gives me a small townlean edge over him.<br>
I’ll further analyze the posts tomorrow, but now I should go to sleep. Anyway this game seems interesting and I’m quite curious on how it will turn out.</p>

Since “the ability similar to mines” was the post restriction, I don’t have quite a reason anymore to have a town impression of you. Rather… how did you know everyone has a posting restriction when you rn claim not to have one?<br>
Anyway, I agree that Jgoes’s opening is purely scummy behavior. He won’t even read Marshal. Since you are now both scummy to my eyes, it may all be shallow basicass distancing since of how senseless the reaction test and the push are anyway (as Disqueted pointed out).</p>

<p>Then backtracks her townread on Marshal just two posts later and shadethrws Jgoes. Then she makes her pre-flip association from which we now know would flip two town. Merc is already setting up chain mislynches using her TMI, just like in JOAT9.</p>

<p>I disagree slightly with it. Disquieted seems more the kind of person who wished to know what was going on (having Jgoes answer their post) before reading. The questions for me pretty much look legit as if they were asking for more information and not shadowing imo.<br>
But yeah, it will be interesting to read them further in the day as it is a fresh experienced player <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/tm.png!v=9" title=":tm:" class="emoji" alt=":tm:"> Currently neutral on Disquieted because they haven’t made any reads and asking questions is not hard to do as either alignment.</p>
<p>Also by how Astand posts I believe they either have a very high post restriction or don’t know they got one (since his 4 posts were useless one-liners). Judging my Marshal’s TMI I would say that scum knows everyone has a post restriction, and Astand’s posting style is pretty much very relaxed to reflect the pressure to wallpost = locktown like I expect from scum that game.</p>
<p>I see now I have misinterpreted the last post as mechanics talking, lol. I follow up with that Astand’s tone and content are pretty wolfy, but in the context of this setup he has a chance to be town just for how little effort he has put in.</p>

<p>Also since I was wrong in Marshal’s case, I’ll change him back to a nullread. I think Jgoes is not mafia but some sort of neutral evil (and hopefully Eevee would not put a Jester in a setup for people to improve ther playstyle), just because on even if they are blatantly scummy, no one auxiliated him on his push or townreads him.<br>
If Jgoes is mafia, I would say that his team are the ones ignoring him instead of making a comment scumreading him. But honestly that’s the least likely thing imo.</p>

<p>It depends on how experienced Jgoes is.<br>
If he is L1, I say it is a T/??? because Jgoes shows typical townish confidence even if he ends expressing himself poorly because newbie town often tunnelvision.<br>
If he is L2, I think that he is being either a solo wolf or a bus target (less likely since of how vivid that interaction was), because the confidence trait in L2s is typical of scum who have trouble faking emotions, and thus usually fake anger and end up tunneling as mafia instead of the mafia L1 profile to sit back and not progress the game at all. I believe it points to “solo wolf” because the attack wasn’t followed by anyone and everyone afterwards scumread Jgoes for it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mafia is too scared to contest it and won’t do anything until it presses on a scum member</li>

I honestly dislike that reasoning in particular to scumread them, not taking in consideration the other accusations on Priestess because that would take too much time on a slot everyone is already discussing anyway. They are expecting everyone to play as them, disregarding completely that some players may simply act as if they did not had a hydra at all. Iirc this happened earlier with another hydra (Jgoes/Chemist I think) and Marshal handwaved it as “hydras are different people”.

<p>I’m not reading the 500 wallposts relating to PKRriestess. It gives me a headache just to look at.<br>
But my suspicion is that the scum invested in the Nerbins counterwagon, although not completely. I would call here that there are approximatedly 4 scum due to the size of the setup, so I would invest in 2 (including PKRiestess) of them being in the counterwagon. Since Astand is the cop it points specially to Maxwell/ATW. I’m not currently inclined to any of them since they were both slankers.<br>
For the other scums, I think that they would do what “town them” would. So I think one more should be in PKRiestess (I’m already heavily inclined to Nerbins since he could have tried to bus for towncred as his position was kind of fucked up) and another not voting or in a yolo wagon.</p>

<p>Luxy’s wall uses so many fallacies and ignore so many points on me I’m not taking it seriously anymore.<br>
Either this is a coordinated push by both Poisoned/Vulgard and them (they have the exact same point on DatBird whilst completely ignoring my read on Simon for unknown motives) or LuxyGey are blind by confirmation bias. Anyway in the next post or so I should have a formed opinion on this hydra but I’m not thinking it is good-aligned already.<br>
VCA is easy to fake that early on the game because most of it is inductive, so their post is more worldbuilding than anything.<br>
I’m not inherently accusing Poisoned/Vulgard here, they are just associative. If Luxy manages to be scum, P/V also likely are. P/V remains null until otherwise noted.</p>

</aside>
<p><strong>This is just so bad. You call us fallcious when Disquieted said practically all of our points are valid. What fallacy are we employing? Or did you just make that up to discredit us? Then you proceed to worldbuild around Vulgard and I being scum makin a joint push on you. Pray tell why would we try to get you lynched this game when you haven’t been pushing anyone all game and if we were mafia you aren’t a threat. Then you try and discredit VCA which is actually a very potent scumreading technique just because it looks bad for you. And you conclude with a hedge on Vulgard, nice gamesolving you’re doing here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not to mention you literally contradict yourself in the same post. First you say we have confirmation bias, which indicates you think we are town, and then you say we aren’t good-aligned.</strong> The fact that you say we have conf!bias indicates you TMI us as town.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Mercenary is scum and I have gone through her <strong>Entire</strong> ISO once again to make sure she can’t accuse me of cherrypicking because thats all she can do to defend herself because what I’m saying because completely true judging by her reaction to it. She constantly reduces what we say in order to discredit stuff and is throwing around buzzwords like fallacious in order to make herself look better. Her ISO is entirely shade and stopping people from being towncleared while also pushing back on anyone who even has the audacity to scumread them, how dare they! Her behaviour has many similarities with that in JOAT9 including pre-flip association chain mislynches and shdaethrowing everyone.</strong></p>

          <p>Seems insane tbh but I have come to an end of my to TWTBW or not to TWTBW dilemma on FK which I couldn’t put up properly in the paper as all evidence pointed towards one thing and my gut still told me that something was not right — and I only understood why my gut was ticking when I lost WiM on my case myself, it is something I empathized at a personal level.<br>
FK’s fluff is exactly the same thing I do when I lose WiM as town: I start to fluff but I also give a little nudges here and there because even if I gave up on my case, I have already invested myself in the game enough to still pursue the wincon somehow. If anyone asks me I will still give my opinions and answers, I just lose the steem to do it naturally since they don’t seem to matter.<br>
So I’m NAI since I’m self-aware of that but FK is, like, town.</p>
