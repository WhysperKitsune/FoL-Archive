    <description>That would allow us to actually treat new players with patience and respect when they have bad logs or don&#39;t explain themselves too well in jail, instead of going &quot;Well, you probably pretend to be new, exe, sorry if you are really new&quot;.</description>

<p>Lets be honest, the new title is not a real problem, a new one can be created for people who just finished those 30 games.</p>
<p>Also, I agree its not fun to pretend to be new, personally I don’t do it, but allot of people still do.</p>

            <p>I’d assume a suggestion like this would also include a new, free title.</p>

            <p>The issue with that is Squire is the only free title available that isn’t event-exclusive. After 30 games, one might not have a new title yet (I know I didn’t for a while).</p>
<p>I mean, to be fair, by pretending to be new, you are sacrificing one of the advantages that comes with experience. When you know what’s going on, it’s easy to become one of the more influential members of the court. And personally, it isn’t very fun for me to just pretend I don’t have a clue what’s going on.</p>
