    <title>[Outdated] Bodyguards were bypassed</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/outdated-bodyguards-were-bypassed/1157</link>
    <description>####What happened? as a neutral king my job was to survive the game. during the 6th night I attempted to use my last bodyguard only for it to fail. there was no explanation that the attacker was able to bypass my guards using night immunity. 



####Comments: as malchior recommended I&#39;m bringing up this issue. while I understand there are classes that are able to bypass night immunity having the game tell the player what happened example  &quot;someone bypassed your guards/immunity/whatever&quot; this will make it easy for beginners and those not class savvy just yet.  I could also advise this same system be put in for death by poison, possession, reaped whatever. 

(This cause of death would only be displayed for the player killed)

            <p>We actually believe it was a Sellsword that caused this to occur in kitsune’s game.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think it would be nice for the game to give a text notification when you have night immunity of some kind.</p>
<p>“A killer bypassed your night immunity” appearing in chat.  Still giving no details as to what or how the immunity was bypassed, thus not giving out free information in games without a physician.</p>

            <p>both the Ritualist and Enforcer have the ability to make their respective factions’ kill pierce night immunity, judging as there was a Sheriff in your game, this suggests an Enforcer</p>
