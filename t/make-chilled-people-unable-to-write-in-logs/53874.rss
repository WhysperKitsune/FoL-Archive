    <description>I know this might seem like a situational change but it could help a lot, for example when someone is up to you (a drunk that debs you, for example) and you chill them and manage to convince people to hang them, only to have &quot;GET X HE IS THE REAPER, I WAS CHILLED&quot; in their logs.</description>

            <p>Btw the current Reaper rework we had been pushing can deal with the problem just fine by throwing souls at it.</p>
<p>N3: Debed<br>
D4: Chill Drunk<br>
N4: Gather Darkness reap Drunk<br>
D5: Edit yourself out of the drunks logs.</p>

            <p>We really do need to solve the Reaper-Drunk problem. I think there’s 2 solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make Reaper occupy immune</li>
<li>Make Reaper not notify people when they are attacked.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think <span class="hashtag">#2</span> is more interesting.</p>
