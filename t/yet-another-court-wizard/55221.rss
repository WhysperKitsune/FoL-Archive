    <title>Yet another Court Wizard</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/yet-another-court-wizard/55221</link>
    <description>So, what’s core to the CW to me is that they want to die without being accused of game throwing. As such, I present my idea.

The Court Wizard:

Passive - 
Forbidden Magic: When you are attacked, you suicide to kill your attacker, bypassing night immunity.

Night Abilities - 

Room of mirrors: Everyone targetting the player will be redirected to target themselves. The target will be redirected to target himself as well. (can&#39;t be used on self)

Mind Shield (three uses): protect yourself and another player from all negative effects and misinformation.

Sage: unchanged except the following passive is added:

Unlimitted Power: Kill yourslef and the Prince after you are jailed - bypasses all night immunity, heals, etc</description>

            <p>I can’t find any information on it being patched out unless it was a ninja edit. I obviously can be wrong, but I can’t find any information on it ever being changed in the first place.</p>

            <p>Barrier is boring because of lack of feedback and tornado is intimidating for newer players, as it is seen as a troll ability. What you’re proposing is much more powerful than barrier, infinite charges, and is just about as frustrating as tornado for bd.</p>
<p>You can make a class fun without making them overpowered.</p>

            <p>So, what’s core to the CW to me is that they want to die without being accused of game throwing. As such, I present my idea.</p>
<p>The Court Wizard:</p>
<p>Passive -<br>
Forbidden Magic: When you are attacked, you suicide to kill your attacker, bypassing night immunity.</p>
<p>Night Abilities -</p>
<p>Room of mirrors: Everyone targetting the player will be redirected to target themselves. The target will be redirected to target himself as well. (can’t be used on self)</p>
<p>Mind Shield (three uses): protect yourself and another player from all negative effects and misinformation.</p>
<p>Sage: unchanged except the following passive is added:</p>
<p>Unlimitted Power: Kill yourslef and the Prince after you are jailed - bypasses all night immunity, heals, etc</p>
