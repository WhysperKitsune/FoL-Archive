    <title>What qualifies as prohibited meta-gaming?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-qualifies-as-prohibited-meta-gaming/52595</link>
    <description>Some people write in their logs, &quot;If I leave game immediately, my last check was NS.&quot;  Is this allowed?  I&#39;ve been told the Devs said it&#39;s not, on Discord.

Some people write in their deathnote, &quot;X is Possessor&quot; (where X is their own number) if they aren&#39;t a killer class, in order to out Poss when he jumps to them.  Is this allowed?

Is it allowed to target people in-game based on the player?  For example I once said I&#39;m going to kill Fauker when I find him (because he has easily identifiable logs).  A ton of people jumped on me saying they are going to report me for meta-gaming but nobody could tell me where and when this was prohibited.

I think the first 2 things should be prohibited, but I&#39;ve been doing the second because I wanted to get everyone doing it so it could become a top priority to get fixed :blush: (I guess that strategy isn&#39;t working)  But the 3rd I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it, I mean if I&#39;m Reaper and I know who Fauker is why should I be punished for reaping him?  :face_with_raised_eyebrow:  It&#39;s not like it&#39;s going against my objective.

I wish there was a list of meta-gaming techniques that are explicitly not allowed.</description>

            <p>It shouldn’t be. You just shouldn’t see when dead players disconnect.</p>

            <p>meta gaming is never “prohibited”, it’s generally frowned upon, and when the dev’s find a way it’s being abused too far, they fix it mechanically. IE they didn’t suspend or punish anyone over asking for room descriptions as psychic or prince, they added the room pics to class cards, people leaving after reaped, they removed the left game notification for reaped people etc…</p>

            <p>I remember Prince/Psychic asking for rooms. That was circumvented by Boslof by adding a snapshot of each class’s room to the ingame guide. As far as I know, it never was against the rules, but should be avoided.</p>
<p>If you are unsure, submit a report with a reasonable explanation, with timestamps. The mods will let you know if something gets added to the rules.</p>

            <p>Nothing should be prohibited. If we don’t like the meta the answer is using mechanics.</p>
<p>Not showing when dead people leave, keeping your death note as Possessor, etc.</p>
<p>I don’t think any meta game is prohibited, but if it it shouldn’t be. There are more clever solutions to this.</p>

            <p>I know for sure that things like Prince/Psy asking jailed/linked people for things like Room details, Ability descriptions etc. Are forbidden, but i dunno about things that you mentioned.</p>
