<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Archer</h2>
<p><strong>Tracking Shot</strong> seems extremely unfun to be caught by - unlike Hunter, you can’t really bait with it, as you still die and can’t really control who visits your killer the next night. This also harshly punishes undercover killers who successfully draw healers to them. I am not a fan of this ability at all.</p>
<p><strong>Decoy Trap</strong> seems significantly more protective than killer-y, and I’m not sure I want to stack half of the game’s protectives onto Killer-type roles, especially when this ability doesn’t even really kill.</p>
<p><strong>Enchanted Arrow</strong> is the kind of ability I would generally like - one that plays into the other abilities of a class to give it self-synergy and a higher skill ceiling. However, I can’t see how this isn’t just a slightly-tweaked Chronomancer. It stops kills and then redirects them. However, it is lower-skill than the Chronomancer, as it autotargets those who attacked the decoy, making this an ability I thoroughly dislike.</p>
<h2>Sharpshooter</h2>
<p><strong>Track Prey</strong> is a decent ability. Nothing special but also not problematic.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Feet</strong> is, unless I’m forgetting something, a unique skill, which I appreciate - however, the Mastermind barely benefits from this at all, and the Assassin would be better off with an Enforcer’s Frenzy, so I question how useful it will actually be.</p>
<p><strong>Exsanguinate</strong> is an interesting skill, putting risk into a stacked visit to pay off with a potential extra bleed. However, I think the Poacher already fills this “extra bleed” niche in a way that is overall stronger, so I get the impression that this ability isn’t strong enough to make the Sharpshooter a desirable convert.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Given a poor passive and no daytime abilities, the Archer needs strong (design-wise) night abilities to recover. Unfortunately, I don’t like either. It acts extremely similarly to the Chronomancer and doesn’t really bring anything new or different to the table. I don’t think it would be underpowered, but it would definitely be a pain to play against.</p>
<p>On almost the opposite end of the spectrum, I have no mechanical issues with the Sharpshooter, but I don’t think it does enough to make a place for itself in the game. It’s a weak convert, taking the “Jack of all trades, master of none” approach a bit <em>too</em> literally. An Enforcer or Poacher would both be better.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Crusader</h2>
<p><strong>Providence</strong> is another bait skill. We already have Hunter. Please no more bait skills. Especially when <em>both</em> are autotargeting.</p>
<p><strong>Hand of God</strong> is weird because it’s weaker than a Knight guard in every way <em>except</em> it can also target the Mastermind or an Unseen convert. Whether this is a good trade-off for the delay and inability to actually <em>protect</em> is up for debate. In general, however, I dislike skills that automatically target opposing players only, and that holds true here. A bleed-based Veteran could be interesting - one with no drawbacks is significantly less so.</p>
<p><strong>Deus Vult</strong> is a nice enough suicide-bomber-like ability that I don’t have any significant problem with. Added firepower for significantly reduced carry potential over a Knight or similar. I do think it’ll suck to see a double teamkill though.</p>
<h2>Zealot</h2>
<p><strong>Piety</strong> seems a bit too selfish for my liking - I’m not the biggest fan of tailors, and being able to essentially be tailored the entire time you are the Zealot is questionable. Wide-ranging, stronger abilities with less uses (such as Dark Dimension [which should really be one use btw]) generally lead to more tactical gameplay than self-targeting ones.</p>
<p><strong>Martyrdom</strong> is so situational I question why it even exists? It really <em>only</em> works in MyLo, and if you’re in that situation I’m not sure I want the Zealot to be able to clutch it out even if the vote is correct and would lead the BD much closer to victory. Definitely not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Malleus Maleficarum</strong> is extremely strong at three uses. I’d almost argue that it should be one use, given the fact that the class is basically immune to investigations. If Piety is nerfed, I’d be okay with this being two uses. Can lead to significantly more Unseen kills and is extremely effective at drawing healers off of high-priority targets. Definitely too good as-is.</p>
<p><strong>Regicide</strong> is the Servant’s Chaotic Wine, but way weaker. However, given the strength of Malleus Maleficarum, I can see why it is so much weaker, and as such would not look into buffing it.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Blood Providence</strong> is the easiest way to out yourself. And a bait skill on scum, which I really dislike.</p>
<p><strong>Hand of Mithras</strong> sounds really painful to deal with, as you can just go for the obvious guard/investigate targets and net free bleeds, then drawing healers off of other targets. This is worth taking Blood Providence for, because the extra bleeds are way better than the extra kill from Incarnation of Mithras.</p>
<p><strong>Incarnation of Mithras</strong> is fine - it’s good, but probably not <em>too</em> good. Then again, I don’t really think about the Cult, so maybe I’m wrong.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m not a fan of the Crusader. Too many skills that autotarget scum-only, making it a really safe BD Killer for anyone who doesn’t decide to suicide bomb. It’s not focused enough on the suicide aspect to make it stand out there either though.</p>
<p>The Zealot is <em>extremely</em> powerful. Bleeds for days, and immune to investigations the entire time it exists (it’s either Assassin by N4 or has suicided on a Good King most of the time). Also not really a fan here.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Duelist</h2>
<p><strong>Royal Blood</strong> is something I do think should be on at least one non-unique Killer class, but I’d honestly put it on a Support class first. If the rest of the class makes use of it, however, I think RB on a Killer has potential.</p>
<p><strong>Schuld</strong> is a good sign - seeing another ability play along with Royal Blood is reassuring. However, this should really be that votes for you don’t count - being unable to be voted at all confirms you. Additionally, it doesn’t really mesh <em>enough</em> with Royal Blood in my opinion, and means that, if you accidentially kill a BD player, you are literally just a Citizen now. Better than suicide, maybe, but still not very rewarding, and will likely promote much more passive gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Versetzen</strong> obviously pairs with Zornhau, so I’ll look at this combo there. However, I still dislike bait abilities, and this is the third one thus far. That’s not a good sign for the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Mittelhau</strong> is a Final Girl, so obviously this is now a Final Girl. The class name probably should have clued me in. The addition of a kill on the target is interesting, but I can’t tell if your inability to kill a roleblocker is intended or not, but does mean that you can test roleblocker claims basically for free. However, I’m more concerned that a kill skill gives you a use of Zornhau, <em>another</em> kill skill. That seems weird.</p>
<p><strong>Zornhau</strong> works with both Versetzen and Mittelhau, which I like - however, as noted above, killing somebody to gain a kill is a bit of a weird way to approach the Final Girl archetype. This leaves you using no night actions for most of the game, and greatly reduces the usual prediction-heavy aspects of such classes. Plus, baiting people to you to get a revenge kill is arguably what the Hunter <em>should</em> be changed to, in order to remove its autotargeting aspect. I wouldn’t want a new class to take that instead.</p>
<h2>Baronet</h2>
<p><strong>Royal Blood</strong> was discussed above. I think it makes more sense here than on Duelist though, as the other abilities focus on it much more heavily.</p>
<p><strong>Gerissen</strong> is clearly outdated - Scheme no longer exists, and giving them a use of Cast Shadow would be way too powerful. This probably needs to be replaced with something else.</p>
<p><strong>Vom Tach</strong> sounds like a skill I very much do not want to play against. It’s a button you can push to instantly <em>kill</em> anybody who is scumreading <em>any</em> Unseen member enough to go for a kill on them. Not just block the killer - <em>kill</em> the killer. That sounds awful to play against on every level. I’d rework this entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Missgunst</strong> is a good skill, but without a replacement for Vom Tach is obviously not strong enough on its own to carry the Baronet. If Vom Tach was replaced with something that played into this class having Royal Blood, I could see this skill being situationally useful.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Grausamkeit</strong> is a great ability. No complaint, except maybe it should be 2 points? Again, I don’t pretend to know how to balance the Cult.</p>
<p><strong>Opfern</strong> is another bait-type ability. Yay. And it’s on scum. Yay-er. Definitely not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Vergeltung</strong> is at least prediction-based, but like, why does scum need the ability to prevent kills on them by killing the killer? It’s not even a trade, it’s just snapshotting the poor Knight or whatever. I’d definitely change this too.</p>
<p><strong>Königsmord</strong> is now a <em>different</em> Chaotic Wine instead of a weaker one, trading day activation for the ability to bypass heals. I don’t know how many converts I want to be able to just gib the King, so I’d probably change this too. Not awful though?</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Duelist is an awkward twist on the Final Girl archetype that fails to capitalize on what makes that archetype great (funnily enough, falling in line with the actual Final Girl in that fastion). It doesn’t make good use of its Royal Blood, and ends up being a bit of a one-trick pony.</p>
<p>The Baronet is definitely better, but the night abilities waste the promise the day abilities brought to the table, and even Gerissen is entirely outdated.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Thaumaturge</h2>
<p><strong>Thaumaturgic Focus</strong> is very strong on a Killer - I’m interested to see how the class works with that freedom to act.</p>
<p>I cannot tell if <strong>Sigil of Thunder</strong> kills the player that would be converted, or kills the player attempting to convert. If the former, interesting skill! If the latter, a massive pain in the ass for the scum, and one I would drop immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Sigil of Fire</strong>, on the other hand, is too similar to Knight’s guard for my taste. It’s just a Scout-deployed guard that doesn’t actually save a life. Not bad, nor something I’d dock points for, but not what I want out of the second non-unique BD Killer.</p>
<h2>Arcanist</h2>
<p><strong>Arcane Focus</strong> is the same as Thaumaturgic Focus, but is definitely stronger on Unseen than BD.</p>
<p><strong>Sigil of Illusion</strong> is an interesting buff to the tailoring role this class takes. Personally, given Arcane Focus, I’d make it so that the sigil is not set-and-forget. It doesn’t need that.</p>
<p><strong>Sigil of Madness</strong> is really realy strong, assuming it does what I think it does (this is also out of date, as Mind Warp is now gone). Definitely make the above nerf to Sigil of Illusion if this acts like Construct Reality does.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Thunderbolt of Corax</strong> is a great skill. Sacrificing a conversion for a kill is a net loss most of the time, but I can think of several circumstances where that would be useful. If it needs to be buffed, just extend the cooldown by one day (prevent conversion on the same night as this skill is used if it is charged and the night after if it isn’t), rather than requiring it to not be on cooldown before it can be used. Again, that’s only if this needs a buff later.</p>
<p><strong>Inferno of Mithras</strong> is <em>another</em> bait skill. I’m more okay with the suicide bomb aspect (especially because you need to net three kills to make this stronger than a normal sacrifice), so I guess I don’t hate it, but what is the focus on bait skills here???</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Thaumaturge isn’t bad, but I need some clarification on how Sigil of Thunder works (I’m assuming it kills the player that would be converted from here on out in my analysis). Additionally, I’d prefer Sigil of Fire be replaced with something less similar to Knight’s guard, especially as it will be the only other non-unique BD Killer if it is adopted now.</p>
<p>The Arcanist is a class I want to really like, but can’t, because a class focused mostly on tailoring is not something I really want. However, I think it could be fine with only a slight change to Sigil of Illusion, and would not be opposed to its introdution. Also, it’s Support, not Social.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Warrior</h2>
<p><strong>Combat Ready</strong> is a skill I’m not a fan of whatsoever. It’s like the oft-disparaged “first-night immunity” but also can just straight end a NK with no effort at all.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodlust</strong> builds on Combat Ready. Combat Ready takes no skill. Guess how I feel about this?</p>
<p><strong>Raging Axes</strong> provides an interesting frame punishment, and is otherwise a standard kill. The only ability here I like.</p>
<p><strong>Taunt</strong> is different from the Duelist… how? Also it just plays into Combat Ready. Again, not at all a fan.</p>
<h2>Marauder</h2>
<p><strong>Massacre</strong> is straight stupid. Why do we need so many immunities <em>and</em> the ability to kill those who kill you? Why do you think this mechanic is fun enough to put it on so many classes??? I don’t get it at all.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Dread</strong> is cool in that it helps proc Massacre in an interesting way. I could see a variation of this being cool somewhere else, but not here and not with Massacre.</p>
<p><strong>Boast</strong> is, again, the Duelist. Which is interesting, given a converted Duelist was not a Duelist. However, it is also literally an Alcoholic. Why do we need another Alcoholic?</p>
<p><strong>Glare</strong> is really strong, and could probably carry this role on itself. A roleblock/heal prevention combo is pretty strong. One use limits it enough, so all in all, it’s the only skill here I like.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Blood for Blood</strong> is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Anstreim’s Paranoia</strong> is kinda self-defeating (see final thoughts on Marauder below).</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Warrior is awful. It just instakills anything that attacks it early on, which is hardly different from RNG and leads into, you guessed it, more baiting. Sure, there’s <em>some</em> prediction with Taunt, but then it just ends up being omniscent anyways.</p>
<p>The Marauder is not any better. Massacre is just excessive, but the entire class also loses almost all funcitonality if there are no remaining Killers. Which is not that unlikely, especially because, in order to have a Marauder, the BD are already down one Killer, making this class significantly less likely to have any real impact.</p>
<p>Either way, rip NK.</p>

<p>I’m not actually sure what <strong>Trained</strong> does - it reads like you won’t kill if two or more others are using Tarnish. However, that is impossible, as there is a maximum of two Warriors per game.</p>

<p><strong>Backstab</strong> is a familiar skill. I like that you also die, unlike some classes above, and therefore pairs well with Rusted Armor to lean into action prediction. It is also definitively not the same as Alcoholic. Best self-redirect suggestion yet.</p>
<p><strong>Tarnish</strong>, if it works as I’m reading it (see Town of Salem’s Crusader), is entirely reliant on RNG, and straight-up needs to be replaced. I may be misreading it though?</p>
<h2>Crusader</h2>
<p><strong>Light Armor</strong> is selfish, but not egregious.</p>
<p><strong>Second Plot</strong> is great. I use the same exact mechanic on my own submission. The complete lack of a Mafioso-type mechanic in this game thus far is extremely puzzling.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Rage</strong>, however, just seems like a less useful Second Plot most of the time. I’m assuming this is meant to bypass whatever is blocking the Assassin’s kill, but it’s only ever useful if the thing preventing the kill from failing was either something preventing visits on the Assassin’s target or a Knight. Either way, I’d argue that Second Plot is better in almost every circumstance.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Rusted Armor</strong> is fine, as long as it doesn’t protect you from being sacrificed for free.</p>
<p><strong>Cult Rage</strong> is an interesting way to go for an extra bleed.</p>
<p><strong>Second Plot</strong> is strong, especially at two uses, but how does it blend with sacrifice? What if the Cult Leader is attempting to sacrifice the converted Warrior?</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Warrior needs to lose Tarnish (unless I’m wrong on how it works), but otherwise is probably okay. Just giving it a one-shot, guilt-free, generic kill instead probably makes it good enough as a kill-focused Final Girl-type class.</p>
<p>The Crusader is nice for its tactical kill skill, but probably needs more work on its other abilities to be more than just a slighly better Mafioso.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Duelist</h2>
<p><strong>Competitive</strong> has the potential to be quite strong, especially on the converted Gladiator.</p>
<p><strong>Last Stand</strong> gives it clutch potential. I’m not a fan of clutch abilities, but putting one on another Killer is less bad then putting one on a non-Killer, given Hunter exists.</p>
<p><strong>Parry</strong> is kinda like a bait skill, but doesn’t do anything without prediction and only forces a self-redirect on another player, so it’s better than a true bait kill.</p>
<p><strong>Strike</strong> is a guiltless kill, and it has three. That’s really strong, especially compared to most of the other suggestions. If you ask me, Strike should start with two uses, using Strike on a BD should drop its remaining uses to zero, but successfully Parrying somebody should give you an extra use of Strike if you have less than two uses left. Is this similar to my Gladiator version of this class? Yes. But I think making abilities interact with each other is generally better than not.</p>
<h2>Gladiator</h2>
<p><strong>Competitive</strong> is stronger on Unseen than on BD.</p>
<p><strong>Berserk</strong> is again a clutch ability. I, again, am not a huge fan of these. But it’s not inherently awful to have.</p>
<p><strong>En Guard</strong> is cool, although it’s really strong as a two-use day ability. Also, things don’t really bypass occupy/redirect immunity any more, so I’d be sure to drop that here (it really doesn’t need it to be great).</p>
<p><strong>Counter</strong> is a super unique skill that I like a lot. It allows you to pierce immunity of anybody you can get to target you the night before. A unique twist on this apparently common formula.</p>
<p><strong>Stagger</strong> is a unique and interesting skill that I don’t like on this class. It’s already pretty darn strong, and I’d rather give passive disabling to somebody else later.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Last Stand</strong> is incredibly strong. It effectively negates the Cult’s main weakness as long as the converted Duelist is alive. This is probably too strong, and you should certainly not be able to pick it <em>and</em> another ability.</p>
<p><strong>Expose</strong> is also really strong. Why are these both available at the same time? Am I suddenly undervaluing every single class in the game? Because all three of these seem <em>really</em> strong, but <em>especially</em> the Cult convert.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Duelist is a unique variant of the Final Girl archetype that functions quite differently.</p>
<p>Gladiator is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Both are extremely strong, and although I like both, I have a problem - I’d rather see these types of classes added as a new Offensive, with a focus on predicting and redirecting things to build up strength, as opposed to a Killer class like they are here. This shouldn’t surprise you, given I already made my own version of these that is just that. Still, I like these well enough and would be okay with seeing their inclusion, even if I would be sad they can’t be a self-interacting Offensive class instead.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Archer</h2>
<p><strong>Bag of Arrows</strong> obviously works with other abilities. However, I think we end up giving this class <em>too</em> many arrows. I think the main fix for that comes later, but it should also only start with one and have a cap of probably four.</p>
<p><strong>Make Arrow</strong> is nice, because you can’t just keep guarding yourself if you want to get more arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepiness Night</strong> (Sleepless?) is a unique way to build some amount of reading into what is normally a passive ability. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Steady Aim</strong> is <em>almost</em> good. I like that it’s free if you successfully predict a kill. However, I dislike how it only allows the class to kill other killers. This leads into the last ability.</p>
<p><strong>Loyal Guard</strong> is the ability that I think could make this class really shine if it was completely reworked. Why does this class need two skills that can only kill killers? Instead, this should be replaced with something else, that also costs two arrows. Maybe a straight kill, maybe a multikill that’s more expensive. Up to you. Either way, though, this skill should <strong>not</strong> give you arrows back, ever. Make the play build into it and commit. Starting with two arrows and getting them back if you guard incorrectly is not the way to go, not at all.</p>
<h2>TrapShooter</h2>
<p><strong>Cup of Coffee</strong> is a weirdly-named ability on a weirdly-named class. It is basically necessary for this class to work as-is, but I wouldn’t mind dropping it or replacing it or editing it.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Trap</strong> is odd - it encourages occupying occupy immune players, which sure, wastes your time, but it also wastes your time. I’m not sure how to feel about it, but I’m leaning towards disliking it.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Piercing</strong> is, as written, not good. It should probably just pierce immunity and guards alongside healing, but not occupy visitors to the kill target.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Blood Arrow</strong> - Too specific, not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Pressure</strong> - Oddly specific Investigative ability. Not bad but not really fitting in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Cult Eyes</strong> - The extra attacks are definitely too strong. Needs less kill power.</p>
<p><strong>Mithras’s Will</strong> - Suicide if the attack <em>doesn’t</em> kill them, regain it if it does? That’s backwards, and way too strong. It’s a base +1 KPN until you get prevented.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think the Archer is really nice, as long as Loyal Guard is replaced with an ability like I described above. 7/10</p>
<p>The Trapshooter is just weird and odd, and could definitely afford to take notes from other suggestions here. 4/10</p>
<p>The Cult Alts all need work. 2/10</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Watch</h2>
<p><strong>Careful Planning</strong> is an interesting skill, but I question how often it’ll actually be used. After all, how often can a BD member actually predict when an attack they’re making is going to be redirected to a place they don’t want to go? Especially when that class can’t actually control their own attack in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Reckless Preparations</strong>, on the other hand, is just added pierce. That’s fine I guess, but considering you don’t have any straight attacks, I question how useful this actually is.</p>
<p><strong>No Access</strong> is another twist on the Final Girl idea. I worry, however, this may prove to be <em>too</em> difficult to pull off, especially with only two uses. At least it isn’t only able to hit attackers?</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Attack</strong> is, drumroll please… <em>another</em> bait skill! Why does anybody want this? Why does <em>anybody</em> want <em>more</em> of this? How is this different from Hunter? The world may never know.</p>
<h2>Accomplice</h2>
<p><strong>Murder Plans</strong> has the same issue as things that only bypass healing. Either make something that bypasses both or drop it, and balance from there. Trying to take the 50/50 on which type of guard will be on your target is not good gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Off</strong> is some weird mishmash, and I can’t tell if this will actually lead to baiting or not. But I suspect it will, and either way am not a fan of this activation method at all.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Watch is some weird combination of useless and low-skill baiting.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Lancer</h2>
<p><strong>Outmatched</strong> is immediately way better than any of the previous skills that just autokill attackers. Forcing you to mark people in order to gain this power against them actually rewards scumreading and scum staying undetected. If only you could actually choose who to mark, this skill would be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Knock Off</strong> is stupid strong. 65 base power with the ability to increase to almost 100 <em>and</em> remove an enemy’s item simultaneously is just ridiculous. I would not be at all surprised to see this get nerfed. As for the Lancer’s ability, I like day ability prevention, but I do think it will be problematic to restrict people to their first night ability. It has literally no effect on classes without multiple night abilities, and I’m not sure how many past classes have their abilities in the right order for this to exist. Additionally, this affects how every new class suggestion has to be set up. I’d drop that part and just prevent day abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Pointed Lance</strong> is an interesting way to bring deathmarks into the game, but I’m not sure I want a killer that can only kill players that visit its target multiple times. This feels weak. It’s also super confirmable.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Break</strong> should, for the same reasons as my change to Knock Off, just nullify all passives, not just the first.</p>
<h2>Horseman</h2>
<p><strong>Trample</strong> is really strong on an early-game convert, however it does definitely lose power as a late-game convert (which is probably fine). Is it one use?</p>
<p><strong>Selfless Oath</strong> is actually super weak imo - it tells whoever was trying to kill the other Unseen members that they were correct, <em>and</em> nets you in the process. This is only a positive in oddball scenarios, and the Horseman would be much better served by an ability to place fake marks.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Steed</strong> should also bypass healing, especially because the chances of hitting a Knight or Hunter are significantly lowered if you have already converted a BD Killer. As such, just make it a ninja that also bypasses heals, but let immunity keep blocking the kill to seperate it from Enforcer.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Overwhelm</strong> is quite good if paired with an Invoker. Possibly too good, if it wasn’t for the fact that Acolyte can only visit one player per game. Not sure if that was intentional or not.</p>
<p><strong>Madness</strong> is a Mafioso for the Cult, but replacing a conversion attempt with a kill. That’s probably fine, but I think actually making use of this would be pretty rare, and it might be better served by an ability to fake marks.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Lancer is a unique deathmarking class that isn’t bad, but suffers from weak type coverage, low attack stats, and an inability to control its marks. It’s an idea I like, but still has large deficiencies in its execution.</p>
<p>The Horseman ends up falling back on its two one-shot abilities, and as such is overreliant on getting a trample off on a healer or investigative class in the early game. It also can no longer mark, so it’s probably just dead.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Firebrand</h2>
<p><strong>Cuts and Scars</strong> is probably not necessary, but also not bad. Meh.</p>
<p><strong>Feet of Fire</strong> is cool. We don’t have enough day ability-affecting abilities, or at least we haven’t in like a year and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Thrower</strong> is basically a reskinned, buffed bleed. Not good, not bad.</p>
<p><strong>Deathmark</strong> and <strong>Final Burn Out</strong> are a pair, so I’ll discuss them together. As long as we have an Arsonist-type class, I think this is a decent way of doing it. However, I wouldn’t limit Deathmark. The risk-reward dynamic is already really strong, no need to limit the risk and the reward arbitrarily. Plus, if your marks die before you can ignite, you can’t do anything else for the rest of the game.</p>
<h2>Killer Firebreather</h2>
<p><strong>Cuts and Scars</strong> is probably almost entirely pointless. How many things are going to bleed you? (One.) Plus, even if a Hunter does bleed you, you deserve it. I’d ditch this.</p>
<p><strong>Feet of Fire</strong> is still cool. Or hot, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Thrower</strong> is just a free kill. That’s pretty darn powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Marksman</strong> and <strong>Final Burn Out</strong> on a Killer are stupid broken. I would replace these with a passive that when you become Assassin you gain Marksman and Final Burn Out instead of Assassinate and 2-for-1. That would be neat.</p>
<h2>Support Firebreather</h2>
<p><strong>Cuts and Scars</strong> should still go.</p>
<p><strong>Arsonist Flames</strong> is almost what I suggested above, but it’s not. Extra bleed is alright though.</p>
<p><strong>Feet of Fire</strong> is, well, you know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>Marksman</strong> is super weak. How many BD are death immune? At best you hit the NK.</p>
<p><strong>Flame Gas</strong> is also kinda weak, insofar as they can just check you again tomorrow, and it may be suspected that you’ve been converted should this occur. Wasting a day of investigations is great, don’t get me wrong, but this is traceable while it does it, and that could prove problematic.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Mithras Burn</strong> is, again, quite strong, especially given Acolyte’s Spirit of Mithras.</p>
<p><strong>Mithras’ Targets</strong>, however, is way <em>too</em> strong if the Firebrand was a bad reader, and extremely weak if they were a good reader or just didn’t act. I’d ditch this combo.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Firebrand isn’t half bad, and could work just find with only a tweak here or there.</p>
<p>I prefer the Support Firebrand as-is, but that’s because it’s a choice between weak and insanely powerful. Both need changes. Would like to see ArsoAssassin if possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Court Jester</h2>
<p><strong>Musical Entertainment</strong> relies on RNG. Ew. I’d say to let them pick, but it’s hard to determine how many cases we should account for. If you try to disable a second day ability, but they only have one, do you disable the first or no? What if they don’t have any day abilities? Plus, couldn’t this lead to ability order being important on every class? All in all, I’d just ditch this skill, maybe find a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Rhapsody</strong> shouldn’t bypass occupy/redirect immunity, as we’ve been moving towards not bypassing these immunities recently, a change I think is for the better. At that point, though, I ask - why bother? If it were a Transporter swap, I could see this working out, but it’s another bait-skill, really. Come to think of it, we don’t have a Transporter either. That’s a damn shame.</p>
<p><strong>Rope Trap</strong> is an ability I don’t really get, and it also bypasses immunity, which isn’t good. But really, why occupy the killer the night after? Or especially the <em>converter</em> the night after? It’s not protective, but it’s also kinda nonsensical. Not a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Circus Accident</strong> is weird. Why not just bleed everybody, if the effect is the same (death two nights later)? Why the weird “if they visit you” thing? For a killer, this has pretty low kill power.</p>
<h2>Clown</h2>
<p><strong>Nightmarish Laugh</strong> is really strong, especially in the endgame.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight</strong> is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Tightrope Walk</strong> is just weird. I can’t think of many uses where the highly specific combination of occupy-&gt;force to visit who they were going to anyways is useful. Straight occupation would be cleaner, if you ask me, especially given the other abilities on this class are already quite strong.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Blood Ode</strong> is actually a nice skill if you’re gonna be sacrificed anyways. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Aura</strong> is pretty strong and a weird pick for an Acolyte. I’d change this.</p>
<p><strong>Rage of Mithras</strong> makes no sense to me at all.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Court Jester is a weird mish-mash of ideas and concepts that pierces occupy/redirect immunity way too much, and also doesn’t really kill. Solid improvement over the original suggestion, but could still use more work in my opinion.</p>
<p>I do actually really like the Clown, though it has one Social skill, one Support skill, and one Offensive skill, leaving it without a single niche to fill. Still, could be good with a different base class.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Royal Guard</h2>
<p><strong>Public Execution</strong> is a very weak dayvig, considering you kill yourself. Probably too weak. A gladiator would almost be better.</p>
<p><strong>Escort</strong> is interesting, but I’m not sure exactly what the use case for this is? Would be helpful on a Support class, but the killer is the one who really doesn’t want to get redirected, no?</p>
<p><strong>Coup</strong> takes the control entirely out of your hands for a pierce kill. Not a fan of this at all.</p>
<h2>Warden</h2>
<p><strong>Veteran Killer</strong> is pretty nice. For the converted Royal Guard.</p>
<p><strong>Public Execution</strong> has a problem, however - I’m not a fan of a scum who’s been caught being able to just take somebody down with them for free. Ergo, I dislike these two abilities. They go from kinda weak on BD to really strong on scum.</p>
<p><strong>Second Chance</strong> is just a Mafioso. That’s cool.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Portal of Blood</strong> is probably fine.</p>
<p><strong>Mithras’ Crown</strong> is unique, and again, probably fine.</p>
<p><strong>Public Sacrifice</strong> suffers from the same issues as Public Execution, except now you just do it on a conversion night to avoid the restriction on the Cult Leader.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Royal Guard is too weak and lacks control.</p>
<p>The Warder isn’t necessarily too strong, but its only purpose is to hit an eject button and kill somebody that would normally be protected at night. That’s not my favorite game mechanic.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Martyr</h2>
<p><strong>Divine Power</strong> is interesting, and I could see it being useful. However, I’m not sure this really sees more use than killing and preventing visits to yourself, as other combos are just weird or result in your death, which is only really worth it if you read into a 2-for-1.</p>
<p><strong>Penitence</strong> is nice in that, rather than restricting a kill to an arbitrary start date, it locks it behind other abilities. However, it also multiplies this lead-up into every kill. In particular, I don’t know why you would want to prevent visits to someone you wish to kill, or why you would kill someone you wish to prevent visits to. While you might argue that grants “depth” to the class, as it can target people it wants to protect and those it wants to harm, I’d argue it would be much better if it wasn’t so confusing in the process and just had two seperate abilities instead.</p>
<p><strong>Absolution</strong> might as well be a one-shot visit prevention. Seeing your visitors is probably just filler you do on N3 if you don’t have anyone to kill, and the amount of times healing everybody and dying is useful is highly dependent on there being no healers and multiple bleed targets. Not sure how often that happens, and I think another healer would be a better solution.</p>
<h2>Sacrifice</h2>
<p><strong>Divine Power</strong> is actually really strong on a scum role that knows a lot more about the gamestate than its BD counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>Penitence</strong> suffers the same problem, except it’s now just a blank extra 0.33 KPN, plus some visit prevention, once per player. That’s a strong combo on scum, especially if you can prevent visits to other Unseen. Again, however, it’s too complex. Two abilities would work better.</p>
<p><strong>Absolution</strong> is pretty much just the work-up to a one-for-one by recharging 2-for-1, but with two added abilities while getting there. Again, this is really strong on scum.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Divine Power</strong> literally only exists to let you get off a one-night bleed without reducing the KPN bonus from 0.33.</p>
<p><strong>Mithras’ Crown</strong> suffers from the same problems as Penitence.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Communion</strong> is actually really nice with Spirit of Mithras, as you can prevent all Cult deaths on one kill night. Probably not super strong, but nice nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Martyr honestly just needs to be simplified down to a class with one vision, not six.</p>
<p>The Sacrifice needs the same, and is also super powerful as-is.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Enchanter</h2>
<p><strong>Enchant</strong> is actually a really nice double-edged ability. I like this a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Spell</strong>, however, I don’t really like. It’s semi-prediction based, yet also results in bleeds you don’t fully control. Plus, the “bleed sometime the next day” is reliant on the host, yet another reason to replace this particular ability.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Spell</strong>, despite my liking of abilities that play into each other, is not an ability I enjoy. I guess it comes down to the fact that you’re a killer without real control - sure, you can enchant all of your scumreads, but this confers a benefit to them and won’t necessarily result in them dying when you try to kill them with Fire Spell.</p>
<h2>Hex Master</h2>
<p><strong>Hex</strong> is decent. I don’t think the frame is necessary, but I do suppose good timing could be used to make it more effective, so that’s a positive aspect of its inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotize</strong> is probably fine without the host-dependant bleed. It’s great for keeping an investigative off your back for a bit, but is liable to be given away if they realize what’s going on (especially if it keeps happening). The bleed makes that even easier to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Box</strong> is pretty neat, and I do like the idea of prepping a target without expressly strongmanning the visitor.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Blood Mark</strong> and <strong>Circle of Blood</strong> are similar to hypnotize, and honestly I’d just make them work exactly like it and ditch the bleed.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Sacrifice</strong>, however, is pretty useless without Blood Mark, as you are liable to want to kill people very different from those you’d enchant (especially if you were working on enchanting scum, as the Enchanter seems to want to do). Not a fan of this one.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Enchanter has a great gimmick, but both of its night abilities fail to capitalize on it in a satisfying way, instead leaving most of the control out of the player’s hands.</p>
<p>The Hex Master is probably fine if you ditch the bleed.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Spiritual Warrior</h2>
<p><strong>Harmonic Combo</strong> - I can’t tell if this is only night immunity, or also occupation/redirection immunity. If the former, it’s alright in conjunction with Critical Strike. If the latter, it’s really good - but given the relative simplicity of the class, that might not be bad.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Strike</strong> - I have no clue what this is trying to say by “and disrupts your target that is attempting to attack or use other negative effect otherwise it’s normal attack”, but I like that chaining Harmonic Combos into Critical Strikes is a thing. Even if this is just a normal kill, which is what I’m treating it as because I can’t understand what you were trying to say, it’s still really nice in conjunction with the day ability.</p>
<h2>Essence Warrior</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose of Discord</strong> is a cool concept, except I don’t think it should be able to kill while the Assassin still lives, and I’m really not sure what would happen to future converts. The entire faction is built around the Assassin/Mastermind duology - anything that plans to disrupt that needs to have a plan to deal with the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Pendulum</strong>’s “kill the killer” dynamic is one I don’t at all like, if that wasn’t clear from the above classes. It’s unrewarding to be right and die because they converted another Killer, and if we can avoid that scenario in the game design phase we should.</p>
<p><strong>Power Attack</strong> - why those specific classes? And can this and Assassin kill at the same time? Because if so, the Unseen’s KPN doubles with a Essence Warrior, making it objectively the best convert in the game. That’s just <em>too</em> strong.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Combo of Corax</strong> should probably be 1 use, as two extra bleeds is probably too strong. Otherwise, not bad, and although I think double disguise will largely go unrealized, I love the potential for a high-skill play there, such as swapping the identities of two players, should they both die.</p>
<p><strong>Climax of Mithras</strong> is definitely too strong. Turning a bleeding victim into a PGO is gonna lead to healers just letting people die from fear, or getting gibbed due to playing their part. Even one use is probably too much, as it completely changes how healers approach bleeds.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Spiritual Warrior is probably a pretty good and pretty simple Killer. That’s a great place to be. I just hope I’m not too far off by assuming what I need to about how the abilities are worded.</p>
<p>The Essence Warrior is probably really overpowered, and leads to a bunch of weird scenarios we would need to seriously consider before adding such a class. Definitely needs more work.</p>

If the latter, it’s really good - but given the relative simplicity of the class, that might not be bad.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Strike</strong> - I guess it’s cool that you prevent your target from harming others while you kill them. Definitely unique.</p>
<h2>Essence Warrior</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose of Discord</strong>, along with its other abilities, basically make this the Assassin’s best friend and the world’s best Mafioso. It will basically never fail unless it hits a guarded/healed target.</p>
<p><strong>Pendulum</strong> is a neat way to save the Assassin from a kill or occupation or whatever, but I think this ability to could stand to be stronger, especially given Mastermind is night immune.</p>
<p><strong>Power Attack</strong>’s bonus is now kinda useless, unless I’m reading Purpose of Discord wrong. After all, if you can <em>only</em> kill if the Assassin’s kill fails, then what are the chances that you get to kill a unique class on one fail, and then have the Assassin fail again for you to get another kill through healing? I think this works well as a counter to an Assassin getting perma-occupied, but not much else. Still, a Mafioso-type interaction is never bad.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Combo of Corax</strong> is now much weaker, but that probably works out fine. After all, Disguise will actually be use much more often now, and that alone is a good thing. Funnily enough, I’d make it two uses now.</p>
<p><strong>Climax of Mithras</strong> - how do you determine “at least one”? Does that mean one is picked randomly? Because I don’t like RNG. Does that mean it pierces immunity if only immune people visit? Because that is even stronger. Without a real change to how this funcitons, it is either still too strong or too random.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Spiritual Warrior is probably a pretty good and pretty simple Killer. That’s a great place to be.</p>
<p>The Essence Warrior is literally the Assassin’s best friend. It leans hard into the Mafioso aspect, with pretty much all of its abilities focused on letting the Assassin kill, or killing on its own if the Assassin can’t. Not a bad spot, but I could see giving it a bit more power being a good idea.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Warlord</h2>
<p><strong>Adiart Empire</strong> is not a skill I am ever likely to support in any capacity. It just needs to go. Make it one-shot bulletproof if you really want to, but not this.</p>
<p><strong>Protectorate</strong>, I assume, gives you bonus uses of Protectorate when a member of the BD dies, as opposed to bonus uses of Casus Belli (it is written confusingly). If this is true, I like this setup. If this assumption is false, why bother with the stacks? You’ll have way too many.</p>
<p><strong>Peace Treaty</strong> is quite strong - I don’t know that I like it lasting an additional night. Additionally, I can see trying to convert a Warlord being a right pain. Still, not broken.</p>
<p><strong>Warmongerer</strong> is an interesting skill. Why does it get more uses as more scum die? That seems kind of backwards, although it also means that you can chain kills together insanely well. Negative uses is also an interesting concept. I like the guiltless kill and the ability to re-attack a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Casus Belli</strong> is also pretty interesting. Did you mean for it to encourage two attacks? Because attacking one BD incorrectly is awful, but attacking two people <em>always</em> makes it less likely that you’ll hit two Blue Dragon than if you just go for one. I can’t see any use-case where you don’t go for two kills here, especially because the punishment is so harsh.</p>
<h2>Revolutionary</h2>
<p><strong>Secret Spies</strong> is, in my personaly opinion, not as useful on a scum class as it is on BD, although I do realize that makes the BD class somewhat confirmable. In short, I’m not convinced it really does all that much for this class, but sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Adiart</strong> would probably be better served just giving the Assassin an extra use of 2-for-1.</p>
<p><strong>Replacment</strong> is actually crazy strong - Mastermind about to get lynched? Not any more! At least it has a huge Achilles’ heel in that if you’ve already claimed Warlord, you’re immediately suspect. I might look into making this a night ability though - daytime role swapping is a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Traitors</strong> is another self-deafeating skill. Why do so many people want to kill people who are rightfully killing the Unseen? I don’t get it. Just remove this and make Replacment a night ability and you’re set.</p>
<p><strong>Break In</strong> is neat because it doesn’t bypass heals or guards, giving it a seperate niche from Enforcer and letting it help the Mastermind as well. Solid.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Last Battle</strong> is actually a really interesting ability, and as long as it doesn’t heal the Cult Leader’s Sacrifice, I think it’s really unique to let them just buy time. Normally, I’d want it to be a day ability instead of a passive, but given you have to have converted one of your killers and used a Cult Point on this, I think a passive activation method is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Branding Ritual</strong> is probably fine as long as you can’t just use it on the Cult Leader’s kill targets. Otherwise, this gives you three extra free kill nights (four total free kills, incluiding Acolyte’s innate ability and Blood of Mithras’ first free kill), which is probably too much.</p>
<p><strong>Open Wound</strong> is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Banishment</strong> is weird - is this known to them, or will they just be prevented if they try? I can think of so many uses of this, and I’m afraid it could be a bit much if it’s silent. In that case, however, the obvious fix is just to make it last as long as you yourself live.</p>
<p><strong>Corax’s Vengeance</strong> looks like it just gives you free kills if you can predict which Cult member dies? Not a fan of this being infinite uses, at most it should be like two. Even then, though, the strat will be just outing yourself if you’ve been suspicious to proc this via lynch. Not the best, but at two uses I think it’ll be fine.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Warlord is a great base, but I think Casus Belli and Warmongerer are a <em>tad</em> redundant. Getting a kill with Casus Belli gives you a new attack with Warlord, and Casus Belli provides huge incentive to go for two kills every time already. Plus, the punishment for missing a Casus Belli is extremely harsh, preventing you from doing anything until another non-BD dies (which may well be entirely out of your control). I like this class, but I’d probably change Casus Belli - I just don’t know how, at least not yet.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary just needs to drop Traitors and make Replacement a night ability, and it’s basically great. I really like this submission.</p>

<p><strong>Witness Protection</strong> also seems good, but I’m afraid that you’ll end up protecting someone with this you might want to kill if they’re converted. The once-per-game nature of Death Sentence makes this impossible.</p>
<h2>Hangman</h2>
<p><strong>Death Sentence</strong>, again, should just be a day ability. I don’t know why it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Tight Noose</strong> is quite strong, beating out the Servant at occupying people. Whether this is too much or not depends largely on how strong the Executioner ends up being. I would, however, be tempted to make this activate if they try to use a <em>different</em> ability, should it require a change.</p>
<p><strong>Forged Records</strong> is also strong, beating out the Aristocrat at framing people. I don’t think the Executioner is weak enough to deserve the Hangman being straight-up better at these tasks than other Unseen classes. I’d probably tone it down a bit.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Veil of Blood</strong> is cool and unique. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>Forbidden Seal</strong> is probably fine due to the requirement that you still live.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Executioner is not bad, although I worry that conversions really screw with it, given it can only deathmark a player once.</p>
<p>The Hangman is probably too strong for being an Executioner convert, but nerfing both of its abilities a bit shouldn’t be hard. Granted, I’d probably replace the frame with a more offensive skill, such as a teleport/swap.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Headhunter</h2>
<p><strong>Focused on the Target</strong> is a good skill for a Killer.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating Failure</strong> is a weak punishment. I’m always okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>Punishment</strong> is a unique kill setup that prioritizes not mislynching people. I’m not sure that’s that great, but I suppose it does fit the theme by basically guaranteeing you can always kill the daytime leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Determine Habits</strong> is weird. It looks like it’s primarily meant for the Assassin, but can also be used outside of that to go for other converts - with a risk. I think I like forcing them to choose “Observer” instead of “Seeker” when taking the plunge on somebody they think was converted, so I guess this isn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>Hunt Accomplices</strong> is pretty lackluster, but given the ability to power it up on a whim, that’s probably intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Decapitation</strong> is pretty unique, but I’m worried that the ability to gib the Mastermind through his immunity is so much stronger than the ability to gib the Cult Leader that this role’s power will vary too much between the two factions. Still, I like the double-edged sword approach.</p>
<h2>Bribed</h2>
<p><strong>Distracted By Wealth</strong> is an interesting downside, but I’m not sure this is strong enough on its own to need it, especially because, after the Prince is dead, this class is almost entirely useless.</p>
<p><strong>I Am No Assassin</strong> is definitely significantly more manageable than trying to replace the Assassin with a new killer, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Escort</strong> is gonna just lead to MM baiting Prince into jailing them. Not sure I like that at all.</p>
<p><strong>Urgency</strong> is cool for the extra likelihood of getting a kill off in a dire situation, I guess, but I just don’t know that this is strong enough to make up for missing an Assassin post-Prince.</p>
<p><strong>Decapitation</strong> is literally useless once Prince is dead. That isn’t great. Sure, you can kill the Prince if they weren’t already dead, but still.</p>
<p><strong>Death To The Blue Dragon!</strong> should probably just be a Mafioso-style ability instead, honestly.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Bloody Punishment</strong> is really strong, being just a free kill. This is on top of Hunt Associates, which is more kills.</p>
<p><strong>Determine Habits</strong> is significantly stronger on a scum class that wants to go after unconverted people.</p>
<p><strong>Hunt Associates</strong> is not weak, as any BDI that outs their check for any reason has just sentenced them to death. Not sure if I’m okay with this or not. However, the other two Cult Alts are, in my opinon, too much on top of this for sure.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Headhunter is probably okay. The Cult Leader and Mastermind are both replaceable, so you’re not out of a job until the endgame, and even then you can go for anybody who votes against BD, or with a correct guess.</p>
<p>The Bribed probably needs to be completely reworked. I think the idea of a class that can’t be the Assassin is neat, but one whose literal only purpose is to kill the Prince is definitely not the way to go. I’d lean into the Mafioso aspect much harder, personally. Removing most of the Prince-focused abilities and giving it some extra (and generally applicable) powers would be the way to go.</p>

</aside>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Highwayman</h2>
<p><strong>Guilty Conscience</strong> is probably fine, not really acting as a punishment, just a limitation.</p>
<p><strong>Anemic</strong> is a cool passive that I think I’ve suggested on something else before, but I don’t remember. I’m not convinced that a Killer is the best place for it, though, given your abilities are kind of… loud. Also, outing means you’re dead in two days.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Shot</strong> basically just refills Riposte any time you make a kill, plus any kills you correctly predict. Not sure the class really synergizes with this ability all that well - it obviously makes it stronger, but making other skills start with zero uses might be a better way to build this into the kit. An extra use would also be more forgiving to missing one call, although I don’t know that’s really necessary as long as you can track your own target.</p>
<p><strong>Crippling Shot</strong> is actually kinda weak? Not sure when you’d really want to attack somebody you know won’t die, and if you don’t know they won’t die, why aren’t you using Tracking Shot? Lastly, how often are you going to attack somebody evil who survives that isn’t also immune to occupation? I think this ability could stand to be replaced with a stronger one, such as making your Pistol Shot tonight pierce immunity, but starting with zero uses.</p>
<p><strong>Pistol Shot</strong>’s bleed punishment is something I immediately dislike, especially when paired with Guilty Conscience. Maybe if Guilty Conscience was disabled while you were bleeding, I’d be more okay with this.</p>
<p><strong>Riposte</strong>, as discussed above, would probably be better off if it started at zero uses. Given the changes I suggested to Guilty Conscience and Crippling Shot, I think a zero-use Riposte could be fine, especially if using Crippling Shot could also power it up into attacking <em>all</em> visitors.</p>
<h2>Brigand</h2>
<p><strong>Anemic</strong> is obviously much less of a drawback on an Unseen Killer than just about anything else in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Ambush</strong> is really strong, if you can predict a Prince jail (i.e. bait a Prince jail). Not sure I’m a big fan of this.</p>
<p><strong>Blanket Fire</strong> is also something I’m not sure I’m a fan of, although at least it’s liable to be traced back to you if people catch on?</p>
<p><strong>Clean Guns</strong> is basically just a free kill (2-for-1), free bleed (Hidden Blade), and free Prince kill attempt (Ambush), all at once (the only other limited use skill that could be used during this time is Foresight, but who cares about that?). I think this kind of skill would work better on the Cult.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I like the direction the Highwayman is going, and I think with some of the tweaks I suggested above it could really come into its own as a sort of Vigilante/Veteran combo, but one who is significantly more of a glass cannon, a cool archetype no Killer role yet fills.</p>
<p>I’m much less a fan of the Brigand as is - getting the Prince without having to determine who they are isn’t very skillful, Clean Guns can basically give two free kills, one guaranteed to be on Prince, and a bleed, and Blanket Fire is a bit too general to be all that, well, tactical. I’d work on replacing some or all of these active abilities.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>orange’s analysis:</h1>
<h2>Cavalry</h2>
<p><strong>Marching</strong> is a good skill for a Killer.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Attack</strong> is not a skill I like at all. Bait votes, use this, be instantly confirmed. Nothing about this is sneaky at all.</p>
<p><strong>Veteran</strong> is an odd skill but okay. At least it’s not the usual “kill the people trying to kill you” that’s been in like half of these suggestions and the Hunter already has.</p>
<p><strong>Spear Attack</strong> would probably be better off able to kill members of the Blue Dragon, but with more uses. Not a fan of a Killer with one kill, even if it is forgiving on a miskill.</p>
<h2>Horseback</h2>
<p><strong>Riding Along</strong> is a good skill, but this class literally does not visit, so what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>Charge!</strong> is a free kill. Nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>Bang</strong> is a weird way to work in a dayvig, but I guess I kinda like that approach to it.</p>
<p><strong>No Entry</strong> is weird - does the mark last more than one night? That’s unclear. Either way, I don’t think this is really all that useful, which I guess explains the stronger day ability/passive.</p>
<h2>Cult Alts</h2>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> is probably strong? Not sure how delaying the kill night like this really works out.</p>
<p><strong>Whisper</strong> is just stupid to have. The Acolyte literally already innately does this. Don’t give it a second one.</p>
<p><strong>Leader Protection</strong> is not a skill I love, but it’s probably not super overpowered. Still, bait skill.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Cavalry as-is is basically just a free confirm and then a sentient kill. That’s not great gameplay, and plus is just kinda bland. Marching doesn’t fit on the class at all either, at least not as-is. This class is just a mess. Would definitely rework both Sneak Attack and Spear Attack entirely.</p>
<p>The Horseback is basically just a free kill and a bleed upgrade to a dayvig. That’s cool, except now you’re kinda just there with not much to do, given you’ve already given the Unseen a great boost. The strat at this point is probably a suicide accusation so the Unseen can just convert someone else. And if your class’s ideal strategy is to just sacrifice itself immediately, that’s probably not great.</p>

<h1>orange’s analysis</h1>
<h2>Ranger</h2>
<p><strong>Guilt</strong> is a decently harsh punishment. Not my favorite, but it’s also not causing you to kill yourself or anything (<em>cough</em> Knight <em>cough</em>), so as long as the rest of the class can build around dealing with Guilt, either through a non-Archery ability or a way to make it matter less, this should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Bullseye</strong> is a good skill for a Killer.</p>
<p><strong>Broadhead</strong> is powerful, allowing you to take out a Mastermind or the NK if you can hit them. However, messing up will kill your target even through a heal, giving this ability a bit of a double edge.</p>
<p><strong>Gather Arrows</strong> is nice, because it allows you to minimize the effects of Guilt by unleashing several kills at once. As such, this class acts more like a Firebrand than a typical Vigilante, but can snapshot, even through immunity, when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Archery</strong> is a simple yet solid killing skill, with no immediate drawbacks for misfiring and with no autotargeting/avoiding killing BD if you mess up. Sometimes, simple is best.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong> is stronger than a typical Firebrand, as you can actually remove marks should new info come to light. This, again, helps you avoid Guilt. Plus, you can still kill, even if you’ve used Gather Arrows to shoot all your marks (provided none were BD).</p>
<h2>Bandit</h2>
<p><strong>Bullseye</strong> is really nice for an Unseen Killer to have.</p>
<p><strong>Explosive Bolt</strong> is really nice, allowing you to pierce a heal to guarantee a kill.</p>
<p><strong>Blackmail</strong> is pretty strong, allowing you to shut down the day abilities of anybody you wish, including ones that affect the next night. Useful against a variety of threats, if you can predict them.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow</strong> truly capitalizes on not counting on a visit when combined with Bullseye, making the Bandit a much more reliable killer than the Assassin. Additionally, the fact that you have kill priority instead of being the backup means that Explosive Bolt will never be unused due to the Assassin succeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Swipe</strong> is an extremely powerful skill to have, which is probably good since most of the time this class is just carrying out the kill.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Ranger is simple yet effective, with many ways to help minimize its Guilt passive and a very high skill ceiling. As a pure killer, it fills a niche neither Hunter nor Knight currently do.</p>
<p>The Bandit is a decent Mafioso-type role, with a few strong abilities in its back pocket to allow some really strong tactical plays without having anything too flamboyant.</p>
<h1>Score: 9/10</h1>

<p>Again yes I’m biased because my own suggestion is what I like but meh</p>
