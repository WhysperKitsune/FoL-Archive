    <title>Forum of Lies Blue Dragon Killer Competition</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/forum-of-lies-blue-dragon-killer-competition/76061</link>
    <description># Forum of Lies is in need of a new Blue Dragon Killer!
# And you can help! 

Starting immediately and going on until April 7th - We&#39;re accepting ideas for a new Blue Dragon killer to be added into Forum of Lies. 

# Prize -

The winner of this competition will have their class added into the official version of Forum of Lies. (barring balance modifications)

In addition to this, the winner will recieve a game on steam up to 20 dollars of their choice from me. 

# Competition Rules.
* The Win condition for the class must be:
 &quot;*Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*&quot;

* The Class must have the ability to directly or indirectly kill other players. It must be convertible and have both the Unseen version and Cult Alts available.

* The class&#39; type must be &#39;Killer.&#39;, and it&#39;s faction must be &#39;Blue Dragon&quot;.... Yeah, go figure. 

* The format for the class card must be the same as all the other Forum of Lies cards. If you aren&#39;t comfortable formatting it manually, you may use [this class card creator.](http://puu.sh/Ax2nE/391a6a63ea.html)

* You must have previously participated in at least one Forum of Lies, Special Forum of Lies, Newbie Forum of Lies, or Experimental Forum of Lies. 

* Winners will be chosen by the Forum of Lies Team ( Myself, @Icibalus, @Solic ) on April 7th, and the winner will be announced shortly after. 

* No cheating! Don&#39;t copy other player&#39;s ideas. Don&#39;t steal other people&#39;s custom classes from elsewhere on the forum. All the obvious stuff. 

* You may submit any number of classes - however, you can only win once. Quality &gt; Quantity.

## Bonus Points. 

* Try to keep the theme fitting with Forum of Lies. Make it something unique and special, but don&#39;t break the theme too hard!  

* Make it powerful, but try to keep it at a fair level. If necessary, we can nerf it after the fact - but start strong to leave a good impression. 

# The competition begins... now! You may post your submissions in a class card format in response to this post.
