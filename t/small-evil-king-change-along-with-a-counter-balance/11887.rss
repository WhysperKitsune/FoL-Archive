    <title>Small evil king change (along with a counter balance)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/small-evil-king-change-along-with-a-counter-balance/11887</link>
    <description>Evil king needs the following things:

- Alert when all his allies have died (original king only)
- once all his allies are dead, the evil king may use any remaining uses of &quot;guards!&quot; to kill people at night

Because this might be too good, I suggest the following counter-measure:

- Once there are 5 or fewer people alive, use of &quot;Allies&quot; by good or neutral king will kill target instead of guarding them</description>
