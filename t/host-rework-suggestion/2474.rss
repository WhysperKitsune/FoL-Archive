    <title>Host rework suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/host-rework-suggestion/2474</link>
    <description>I am making this as we have an AFK host in my lobby.

My rework would partially saves this problem: moderators and developers become host whenever they join a lobby (devs would take it from moderators). I assume devs and mods are more responsive then to just go afk.</description>

            <p>my main point is that you can’t always vote to repick for some reason, it just won’t let you.</p>

            <p>or just add a function to repick the host, i.e. if some percentage (like, say, 62%, or 5/8) of players type a certain command, then the host is randomly reassigned, of course mods and devs might also be able to force themselves to become host if they wish, but they probably wouldnt always want to be host</p>
