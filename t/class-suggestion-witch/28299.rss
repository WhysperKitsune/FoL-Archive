    <title>[Class Suggestion] Witch</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-witch/28299</link>
    <description>&gt;Witch - Neutral Offensive
Passive 1: Hex barrier - Occupy immune and Jinx immune
Passive 2: Spell Sense - You will know if an effect you caused was resisted or removed for any reason and you will know what that reason was.
.
Day ability 1: Jinx - Choose to targets. The first target is poisoned and will die at the end of next night unless he visits the other player by the end of the night. They know who they must visit to live.(Unlimited. 1 day cooldown)
.
Night ability 1: Seal fate - Occupy the target. (2 uses)
Night ability 2: Non-Interference - Prevent anyone from visiting the jinxed player. (3 uses)
.
Goal: Kill 4 people with Jinx

Note: For the purposes of Jinx the Jinxed player just needs to successfully use an ability on the other target during the night. This means that jail and Psychic link will prevent the Jinx death. The poison can be healed and resisted like any other similar status. You may Jinx the king. If the Jinxed player can&#39;t visit then sucks to be them. You cannot try and force someone to visit the king with jinx.</description>

            <p>I gave the witch poison and bleed immune so that they can’t kill each other. The Alch is a non issue as he is poison immune as is the phys and Herbalist.</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>After reading your whole response, I agree that the Witch should be maintained as Neutral Offensive. I love the idea of her having the possibility of siding with BD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok so, Witch totally needs to be Occupy Immune. I think we could get her to be Occupy and Death immune at night (could be axed in jail, of course). But let her be killed by poison and bleeding, in a way that alchemists can “strike back” as part of the frustrated healer’s group who sadly fell in a Witch’s match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the idea of that message. It’s really an awesome work you did there! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I worry about with Non-Interference is that 3 uses will most often guarantee 3 kills. That’s why I suggested losing one use. Two almost guaranteed kills, two kills you really have to work for to get. It makes the Witch more balanced and more challenging (in a good way).</p>

            <p>1: I don’t want the witch to be NK. The core mechanic wouldn’t really work as poison is unreliable for kills and even if it wasn’t it isn’t hard to visit a specific player</p>
<p>2: Ok then what part of it needs removing?</p>
<p>4: The first target gets the message “You have been jinxed! You will die unless you target # next night!”. The second target gets nothing.</p>
<p>5: Remember what the purpose of Non-interference is. Poison is healible and if the phys stopped every kill then the class would be impossible. That way if you figure out someone they can’t target then you can secure a kill (that on it’s own is a challange).</p>
<p>6: Remember. The NK is not neutral like the Alch is (side with anyone). If the alch is +1 -1 = 0 then the NK is 0 + 0 = 0. The NK sides with no one because the NK is a faction on their own. Because of that I do not consider the sorc a true NK of any sort. The Witch here is not a replacement for 3 factions.</p>

            <p>Hey Nuclear!! So, I actually don’t really like it in the current state and I’ll try to show you why…</p>
<ol>
<li>The Witch seems more like a Neutral Killer than a Neutral Offensive. Having her alongside NK would be a nightmare!</li>
<li>I think Hex Barrier needs some toning down. Unless you embrace the idea that she is a suggestion for NK.</li>
<li>Spell Sense is great and really matches the whole idea.</li>
<li>About Jinx, do both targets receive the message “You have been jinxed”? If so, it’s cool, if not, not cool.</li>
<li>Her night abilities are also ok since they match the whole idea. Non-interference could perhaps have one less use?</li>
<li>Even if you decide she’s NK, it would be awesome if she kept that goal. I’d like to see a NK that didn’t need to be the sole survivor at the end of the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, that’s my feedback to you. Good work on getting another suggestion here! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
