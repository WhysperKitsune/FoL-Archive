    <title>[2 Suggestions] Advanced Voting Design &amp; Match History</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/2-suggestions-advanced-voting-design-match-history/7397</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

I&#39;d like to start with my **Advanced Voting Design** suggestion:

Everytime we have to decide someone&#39;s faith, I have to count how many voted for &quot;execution&quot; or &quot;pardon&quot; or abstained. In addition you have to read who voted for what. It&#39;s clearly not a big deal, but there is an easy way to make this more comfortable for everyone: 

- After the voting is finished a notification will appear mid-screen like this for example:

**4** _[red]_ votes for execution 
**6** _[green]_ votes for pardon
**2**  _[white]_ abstained

On top of that you will be able to see who voted for what, not only in the chat but also on the right side where the players are listed. Each player who voted pardon will glow green or have some sort of symbol indicating that, each player who voted execution will glow red etc. for a limited time. 
It&#39;s a small thing that could make the experience better in my humble opinion.

The second point is pretty much self-explaining. Match History!
There are so many awesome games that I&#39;d like to &quot;save&quot; somehow or store somewhere.

So what do you guys think? :slight_smile: My **primary** suggestion is obviously the **&quot;Advanced Voting Design&quot;** 

Cheers,
Peachly</description>
