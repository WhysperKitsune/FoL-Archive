    <title>[Outdated] BUG: Possessor could not control Reaper into himself</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/outdated-bug-possessor-could-not-control-reaper-into-himself/1291</link>
    <description>**What Happened?**

Reaper and Possessor were the only characters left alive.  I was Possessor, and I tried to control a Reaper to attack himself in order to prevent me from dieing that night.  As the night ended, the Reaper killed me and it seems like my Possession didn&#39;t even take hold on the Reaper.  The Reaper confirmed he used his Gather Darkness ability to bypass my nighttime immunity to deaths as Possessor. 

**What SHOULD have Happened?  Expected Results from my point of view**

Nothing in the Reaper&#39;s rolecard or description, both in-game and on the wiki, mention him being immune to occupy or Possession.  In fact, I possessed the Reaper on the PREVIOUS day to successfully kill a target, so I know I can possess him.  I should have been able to control him into himself, forcing him to KILL HIMSELF because he used his Gather Darkness ability.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Have a Reaper with 2 souls and a Possessor alive at the end of the game.
2. Have the Possessor use his Possess ability to control the Reaper to attack himself.
3. Have the Reaper use his Gather Darkness ability on the same night.


**Comments**

My current thoughts is that the Gather Darkness ability might also be making the Reaper **IMMUNE TO OCCUPY** even though it&#39;s not documented anywhere in-game or on the wiki.&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/c988ea08f1761984143512e943111eb45ed4e664.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot;&gt;</description>

            <p>It’s not about killing himself guys…</p>
<p>He wasn’t even occupied by my Posession.</p>
<p>My guess is that in the nighttime visit priority,  Reaper is above Posessor.  Thus functionally, he killed me before my Possession ability could activate.  Of course, things like visit priority isn’t displayed to the user in-game.</p>
