    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Scholar (Neutral Investigative)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-scholar-neutral-investigative/2941</link>
    <description>The Scholar class is designed to be a Neutral class that is supposed to stay hidden as long as possible to avoid being executed by BD or killed at night by the Unseen. The Scholar obtains a lot of information in order to create a believable fake claim. The Scholar should be able to successfully fool others into believing they are BD. Fakeclaiming _as_ a Scholar could work situationally.  

Claiming Scholar is a death sentence because of the sheer amount of information the Scholar possesses. With the Full Disclosure passive, BD may want to execute in order to learn the classes of whom the Scholar investigated as it is revealed to all after the execution. If BD doesn’t execute a Scholar claim, Unseen or Cult may simply convert the Scholar to learn a lot of class types, or the Unseen/Cult may kill the Scholar, giving them the exact classes of whoever the Scholar investigated. 

It is almost impossible to prove yourself as a Scholar, so BD will be very suspicious of any Scholar claims. This makes it almost necessary for Scholars to fakeclaim.

The research paper doesn’t have to be complete at the end of the game -- only the players alive at the end of the game need to be checked off. Dead players do not add to the objective in any way. Choosing players who you believe will survive until the end of the game can be imperative.

The converted version, the Highbrow, is slightly stronger than the Marshall in order to offset the fact Unseen converted a Neutral class over a BD class. 

----------


_The Scholar (Neutral Investigative)_

**Passive: Full Disclosure**

If you are killed, the killer will learn the exact classes of all of the players in your research paper. If you are executed, this information is announced publicly immediately afterwards.


**Day Ability 1: Biography, 2 uses**

Learn the exact class of somebody in your research paper.

**Day Ability 2: Emergency Medkit, 1 use**

Heal yourself of poison or bleeding.

**Night Ability 1: Case Study, unlimited**

Choose two targets to discover both of their class types. If they are the same class type, you will read the journal of your first target at the beginning of the next day. Their names are entered into your research paper (a green check appears next to their name in the player list.)

**Night Ability 2: Hide and Watch, 3 uses**

Conceal yourself in your room and prevent anyone from visiting you. You will learn the name and class types of each player who visited you. Their names are entered into your research paper (a green check appears next to their name in the player list.)

**Objective**: Survive to enter each other surviving player at the end of the game into your research paper. 
 


----------

_The Highbrow (Unseen Investigative)_


**Night Ability 1: Profile, unlimited**

Choose a target to discover their faction and read their journal the following day. 

**Night Ability 2: Diversion, 1 use**

If an investigative class targeted an Unseen tonight, they will be occupied instead and their name revealed to you. 

**Objective:** Wins with the Unseen.

**Lore:** Some social psychologist who wants to study this crazy castle and figure out why so many murders occur here.</description>

            <p>Oh, interesting. Thought it was one time…</p>
<p>Then the Highbrow feels on par with the Marshall, but maybe slightly better with the secondary defensive ability. I doubt a Marshall is going to pull off more than 3 journal reads anyway, and if he does, Unseen are probably dominating the game.</p>

            <p>Indeed. Princess would be an excellent claim for the Scholar. Reading journals can also give you enough info to fake Observer wills, CW wills, anything else really.</p>
<p>I’m aware the Marshall can only read a journal once, but I’m in the belief that if scum convert a neutral role that might’ve sided with them anyway, then that converted neutral role should be powerful to make up for that fact.</p>

            <p>Marshall only gets to journal read once.</p>
<p>This does it unlimited times…</p>
<p>I am currently thinking scholar would just claim princess and wait the game out.</p>

            <p>Way better. Now it’s more situational, but still powerful. Journal-reading is pretty huge.</p>

            <p>I’m loving this role idea, and while it might seem overpowered on the outside, keep in mind this is a neutral role that ONLY wins by researching everyone.</p>
<p>The Highbrow might be a bit over the top though. Hearing all whispers should be one use, or made a night ability. If you want to hear whispers, you need an Aristocrat.</p>
