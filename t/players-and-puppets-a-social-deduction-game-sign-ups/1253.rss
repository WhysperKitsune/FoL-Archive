    <title>Players and puppets: a social deduction game (sign-ups)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/players-and-puppets-a-social-deduction-game-sign-ups/1253</link>
    <description>This game is played in a series of rounds. Each round begins at 12:00 AM Pacific time and lasts for 24 hours.

two important meanings:

Master- slave owner
Teamer- free, non-slave owner. all players start as teamers.

During each round, every player (except the sheriff) selects a player to target and one of three actions, which are private messaged to the host:

1. **/enslave**

         selecting this option will make the targeted player your slave in the next round. You control the actions of your 
         slaves by typing **(slave&#39;s name): /investigate (player name)**. The host will tell you at the start of the new 
         round the players you&#39;ve sucessfully enslaved that round . You can enslave a player through another slave. 
         Slaves will not be told by the host that they are slaves, and any actions they attempt to take will not have any 
         effect. Masters can not be enslaved.

2. **/free**

        frees an enslaved player in the next round. Masters can only free one of their own slaves each round. If a master attempts to free more than one of his slaves, the slave that actually is freed will be chosen randomly.

3. **/investigate**

        players who investigate are told which action their target is taking that round. Note that if a player investigates a 
        slave, they will be told the action that the master made the slave do, not the action the slave attempted to do. 
        Slaves who attempt to investigate are told they are slaves.

Once all actions are processed, the host will give a public message which states how many times each player was targeted, as well as how many times each action was used. This message does not include actions that slaves attempt to make, but it does include actions that masters make their slaves perform. The player who was targeted most in the previous round becomes the sheriff in the current round. Ties will be settled randomly via random.org.

The sheriff is unique in that he does not choose one of the three normal actions. Instead, the sheriff chooses a person to execute. he gives the command by typing **/execute (player name)**. Note that the sheriff may be enslaved, in which case the master of the sheriff may choose who is executed by typing **(sheriff&#39;s name): /execute (player name)**
If a Master is executed, all his slaves are freed. the master loses the game. There is no sheriff the first round.

If two competing Masters attempt to enslave the same player, the player is enslaved by the master that targeted him with all of players in his control, himself included.

If a player is both freed and enslaved, the number of enslave actions are tallied from each master, and compared to the number of free actions. 

In either situation, no change occurs to the targeted player during a tie.

Example:
a teamer is targeted by several players.
master 1: 2 enslave actions
master 2: 2 enslave actions
collective free actions: 2
The teamer remains a teamer because of the three-way tie. If the targeted teamer had been a slave, he would have remained a slave, owned by the same master.

all players are welcome to talk either privately and publicly to organize themselves.

Teamers (including players who died as teamers) all win if nobody is enslaved at the start of a round.

a Master wins if he owns half of the living players.

1st round begins at 12:00 A.M Monday the 17th pacific time.

join by typing **/join** in the thread.

players:

1. PokemonKidRyan
2. CaptainNerbins
3. Rogue
4. NumberFTW
5. polikshadowbliss
6. orangeandblack5
7. NozBugz
8. insanity

**edit**: due to a lack of players, the start of the game will be postponed. If nobody else has joined after a week, I&#39;ll shut it down. I&#39;m hoping we&#39;re short on people because of Easter weekend. Hoping we can get at least 8 players.

**edit 2** : I&#39;ve changed what I think could be a gamebreaking mechanic by changing the results a player gets when he attempts to enslave a master. Rather than getting one of that master&#39;s slaves, the player will instead simply get a message that the enslavement was unsuccessful. Also, Masters that wish to free their own slaves may only do so one at a time. This is to prevent masters from simply freeing all their slaves and winning the game with the teamers if things aren&#39;t going well for them. They still can, but only if the teamers are patient and willing to forgive the master.

Also, I&#39;d like to clarify that teamers win when a round begins without slaves, but this does not include the first round, of course.</description>
