    <title>People on trial deleting their logs</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/people-on-trial-deleting-their-logs/28360</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people delete their logs when it&#39;s clear they&#39;re gonna get executed in a trial. Would it be possible to prevent this, devs? I&#39;ve seen them threatening to delete logs to avoid getting executed as well, I really don&#39;t like that line of thought.
Say that someone who&#39;s princess and has flirted a bunch of players and she&#39;s executed cuz the MM is still alive, but the player gets salty and deletes his/her logs, thus preventing BD from deducing using the acquired information. 
The player still gets a win even if they&#39;re dead so it really shouldn&#39;t matter. Feels kinda like throwing to me

Also posted this in the discord but was afraid it&#39;d get lost in all the messages.</description>

<p>The princesses information is more likely far more useful to someone other than the princess. There’s no only evil results, but there’s a lot of potentially damning results when combined with a claim to a prince or psychic.</p>

            <p>I agree that this is just a moderation issue, rather than something that should be changed mechanically. If someone is deleting their logs out of spite for their actual side… then yes report them, point out that it is gamethrowing to them and let them get a suspension.</p>
<p>As far as unseen etc… honestly I don’t really agree that they should be deleting their logs… in the sense that there’s a private notes for a reason. You should put be putting misleading info in your logbook, and your fake logs  for avoiding execution in your private notes.</p>

            <p>… I don’t see the need for this at all. People shouldn’t be prevented from deleting their logs simply because someone dislikes it. It’s honestly a valid thing to do for Unseen/Cult.</p>
<p>It’s also still valid to do for BD in some cases. If they have someone like the Prince listed in their logs then in that case it’s perfectly fine to remove that little bit of info. before they die and it is made public.</p>
