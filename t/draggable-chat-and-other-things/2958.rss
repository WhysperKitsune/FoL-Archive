    <title>Draggable Chat and other things</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/draggable-chat-and-other-things/2958</link>
    <description>I very much dislike having to quickly scroll up to see previous events or chat spams so much I cannot see what I want to see.

Can we please have the ability to have either draggable windows with options like Events/Psychic/Chat/Whispers or more tabs that we can see different information?

Court Wizard needs some life breathed into it, dull and boring class.  Maybe give him an aura for the 2 next to him that does something ie if he is number 5 then 4 and 6 get an aura for something...

Death is still dull, gambling is boring.  Something needs to be done here to avoid people logging out and higher rewards for those that stay for full game.

In addition can we have on the right side of the Journal listed 1-16 already done as I have to copy n paste each game and would be appreciated to save time.

Regards
