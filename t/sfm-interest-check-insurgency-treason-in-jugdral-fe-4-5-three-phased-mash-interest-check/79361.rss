Hey everyone,

For those who are unaware, DatBird and I are working on designing a Fire Emblem 4/5 Mash. We&#39;re aiming for around 35 or so players and the setup won&#39;t be 100% closed but our aim is to make it as closed as possible while also being decisively not bastard.

If it wasn&#39;t already entirely obvious, this game will spoil the entirety of Fire Emblem 4 and 5, just as a warning.

The game will take place across three phases; the first phase is Fire Emblem 4 Generation 1, the second phase is Fire Emblem 5, and the third phase is Fire Emblem 4 Generation 2. It is yet to determine what will trigger change of phases and if the conditions that lead to a phase change will be revealed, but what we do know is that when the phases change, for those alive, your alignment will stay the same, but you will get a new classcard and your class type and some or all of your abilities could be entirely different. We will ensure that the game ends in the third phase though as this is going to be a very lore loyal game (in which the conflict doesn&#39;t end until the end of FE4).

Even though DatBird and I would like around 35 players, we&#39;re unsure if we&#39;ll be able to get that many. If we&#39;re not going to get that many, we&#39;ll need to plan for a game with less.

This game should be completed in design phase by Christmas and set to run by late January or early February. If you&#39;re interested in playing and will be free around that time to start, please notify us as such in a reply in this thread.

Thanks,
Max and Dat</description>

            <p>Fair yeah<br>
When you’ve already spent 30-40 hours playing through fe 4 and 5 twice each<br>
It should be feasible to make this setup effectively in a good deal less than 100 hours</p>

            <p>Don’t confuse effort with time spent</p>
<p>You are doing something wrong if you are working multiple part time minimum wage jobs instead of a full time well paying job</p>
<p>This isn’t saying don’t put effort into it, it’s saying plan it better so you don’t waste 100 hours of your life</p>

I put around 50 hours into making SFoL 57<br>
I plan to put at least 100 into making this one and I know datbird plans to put in at least a few dozen</p>

            <p>You don’t need to host 2-3 other games each in order to get this to fill. You don’t need to wait a month to review a setup, because most of the times if you know what you are doing when you are creating it you will have a rough sense of balance. There are some exceptions to this, but I don’t think you are going to need to review for a month to make it a good game.</p>
<p>To be honest, half the battle in making a setup is making it balanced and fun. The other part is convincing others to join. It’s not hard to do this, if you can reach out to others and convince them that it’s worth it. You won’t have trouble filling a game if you can persuade others, host reputation can be substituted with saying how much effort you put into this game, instead of saying look at these other balanced games I made you should join mine.</p>

<p>True lol but it is honestly worth the risk if we want to fill a game with this grand a scale</p>

<p>You don’t need to convince me much, since I care more about personal circumstances whether to join or not join a game. (Although I do think about pending playerlist/game itself/host before I’d join something)</p>
