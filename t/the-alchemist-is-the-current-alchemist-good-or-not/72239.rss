    <title>The Alchemist- Is the current Alchemist good or not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-alchemist-is-the-current-alchemist-good-or-not/72239</link>
    <description>I liked playing as alchemist. 
And... nothing of that changed. 
It is very powerful, and fun. 
If I have it.

...

If it supports my enemies with its very powerful abilities...
and it turns the neutral slot into a very powerful BD(or, much more rarely, Unseen/Cult) slot.
I don&#39;t like it these times.
And now guess what happens more often.

I don&#39;t think that making Alchemist more powerful was a good idea.
In beta we had no survivability. That turned out to be horrible for Alch.
In beta we had provability. That turned out to be bad.
Now we have survivability and high power. This doesn&#39;t look good for me. It decides games on a whim while being strongly discouraged to kill.
Survivability and zero other powers has also been tried in a different game and turned out to be one of the most boring classes ever.

With the surviving wincondition, I unfortunately see no alternative, save for changing the win condition.
If the current player base likes the alch regardless of these flaws - then fine. 
Does it?</description>

            <p>Exactly this. It has flexibility, better ways to side with whatever he wants, is more agressive and equally needed for either evils and BD, not only BD like before.</p>

<p>Burrito: If we are really calling a 39% winrate class OP then what about Fool and Sellsword?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The problem about Alchemist is not so it’s OP’ness on its own(mind you that it has a difficult wincon) but rather the difficulty of getting rid of it for evils when it sides against them. If they hit it and it protects itself then they waste a kill. And that can only be prevented by the Unseen with the Enforcer.<br>
Poison and Bleed is a possibility, but if there is another healer then this does harm the Unseen or cult.<br>
And at some point bleeding or poisoning the Alchemist doesnt help if the game is over before that(especially when Alch has a bomb left).</p>
<p>Giving the alch no survivability is asking for an underpowered win rate.</p>
