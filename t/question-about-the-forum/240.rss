    <title>Question about the forum</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/question-about-the-forum/240</link>
    <description>Will more categories be added? Like for example an area for forum mafia players, or forum games makers, just a place to have some forum fun if they happen to not be able to play the game but still wanna interact withthe community.
I&#39;m just curious about this,</description>

            <p>I haven’t been here for long, but, I came to this thread because I agree that later on, having sections such as forum games and forum mafia will be useful.</p>
<p>As someone who has played a quite a few forum games on other websites, I can say that it can become quite big and difficult to manage. Although the games themselves are quite small and often fun. There can be such a variety of games that can hopefully cater to most people overall.</p>
<p>Forum mafia too, is popular. Often being played on multiple different forums, as the name suggests. It’s quite interesting and can be fun sometimes and serious too. It allows people to be slightly competitive and it’s liked by some, others are sometimes shy to start or not fully interested, but on the whole, both of these sections would be useful, I believe.</p>

            <p>This is a good answer - we’ll likely add one later <img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> for now, off topic works. Or better, we have a very active <span class="hashtag">#roleplay</span> channel on Discord : <a href="https://discord.gg/rFAXXQB">https://discord.gg/rFAXXQB</a></p>
<p>BTW <a class="mention" href="/u/yauaustin202">@yauaustin202</a> if you can’t play because of money, ping me on Discord (i42-Xblade) - I have multiple ways for you to play without paying.</p>
