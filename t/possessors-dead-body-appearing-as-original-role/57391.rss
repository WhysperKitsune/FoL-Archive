    <title>Possessor&#39;s Dead Body Appearing as Original Role</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessors-dead-body-appearing-as-original-role/57391</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Player 8 reconnected into the game and saw that 13 (Possessor that took over the previous CL&#39;s body) shown up as a CL. 13 (Possessor) was executed. To only 8&#39;s knowledge, he claims that both CL&#39;s were dead.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Player 13 should have been seen to be Possessor to all players. 

#### Steps to reproduce:
Reconnect after the Possessor has been executed? Maybe?

#### Comments:
