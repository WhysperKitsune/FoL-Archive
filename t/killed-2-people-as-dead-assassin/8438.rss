    <title>Killed 2 people as dead assassin</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/killed-2-people-as-dead-assassin/8438</link>
    <description>Just wanted to share this strategy i did which has done really well.

I got killed as assassin night 2. BUT i left a will that looked like this:

1 
2 King
3 
4 me
5 
6 MM
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 

BD instantly executed the poor 6, no question asked (he was noble).

Then, from the dead, i convinced people the real MM is actually 12 (which he wasn&#39;t). At night, they all told priest to get 12 :P</description>

            <p>The day before I got someone exed by giving false evidence, so I knew they where coming for me .<br>
In the night the king died .  I then very vocally supported one of the guys who stepped up to be king , they made the other guy king and then exed me .<br>
The turn after they hung the good king that I had supported so passionately .</p>

<p>Salty Assassins, right? They think they do the hard work.</p>
<p>Randomly killing and randomly converting while key BD classes are still alive is disadvantage to their goal while this causes chaos with little impact, you want to cause chaos sufficiently enough to make them panic and accuse each other.</p>

            <p>Noble is only listening to King 99% of the time, but yeah it’s probably better to whisper something plausible. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Oh wow never thought of this. Smart.</p>
<p>I would take this further and actually wisper something that makes sense. like “8 was immune to conversion”. Then if there is a noble, he is super damn likely to hang him.</p>

            <p>When I’m evil in a bad situation I like to do this and it’s also fun to randomly whisper nonsense to a person a few times.</p>
<p>I had a game the other day where I was Assassin and sent 3-4 whispers the day I died to a random person wishing them a very Happy Halloween.</p>
<p>He was a Knight that they hung the next day.</p>

            <p>The will thing, i’m not sure it would work 100% of the time, but it sure as hell worked this one time. It cost nothing to do a will like this and it will work sometimes.</p>
<p>To convince the priest of who MM is, just do something like this during the day in dead chat</p>
<p>“holy shit im so pissed at 12. He didnt even brainwash night 1, he peeked instead. Report him please”<br>
Then often they will tell priest this. Then the priest will often literally out himself to get a BD lynched.</p>

            <p>I blame luck of trust on all my losses as BD, and here you come telling me they trusted you 2 times after being revealed as the Assassin.</p>
<p>I liked this fake log strategy by the way, can potentially get a good guy executed out of nowhere.</p>
