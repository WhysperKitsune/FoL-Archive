    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-ferryman-neutral-killer/50512</link>
    <description>**Ferryman** (Neutral Killing) - The famed boatman who ushers the dead to the afterlife.

Passive 1:
**Spectral Heart** - You are immune to murder at night, except for the attack of a Death Knight.

Passive 2:
**Hanging Lantern** - You can anonymously communicate with the players you&#39;ve killed at night. They can hear other ghosts, but you will only hear your victims.

Day Ability:
**Vengeful Spirit** - Select a dead player to let them choose to kill someone that night, bypassing the target&#39;s murder immunity. If they happen to select to kill you, it won&#39;t work and your &quot;Beyond the Grave&quot; ability gains the murder immunity bypass that night. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Beyond the Grave** - Select a player to kill, adding them to the list of ghosts you can hear at night. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**River Styx** - Bathe in spiritual energy, preventing yourself from being visited and healing any negative effects such as bleeding or poison. (3 uses.)</description>

            <p>Ideally, if you can speak to the dead, you’ll have opportunities to let ghosts have vengeance on someone specific. It’d be something a smart player would clear with a ghost before giving it to them.</p>
<p>Like: “FERRYMAN!! I found an Unseen before I died. PLEASE let me kill them!!”</p>
<p>Dead player gets to kill an enemy, and you get an enemy cleared for you as well. Alternately, you could just ask a dead Neutral to help you out by killing someone you specifically tell them to kill. Never know, they might agree. XD</p>
<p>Remember the Ferryman is anonymous to the dead, so there may be times a ghost will select to kill the Ferryman because they don’t know who it is. To prevent it just being wasted, I added that buff to “Beyond the Grave”.</p>

<p>Why would anyone want to kill you then. Actually , they’d all try and hinder you as much as possible with this ability , unless being killed by ferryman caused a win con change.</p>
