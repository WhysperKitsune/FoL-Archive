          <ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Picture :</strong><br>
It can be a brother and a sister that look alike.<br>
It can be simply two identical person like brothers/sisters.<br>
It can also work with the idea of bride/groom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concept :</strong><br>
It’s a class that uniqueness comes from the way on how the 2 random player (that will get the class) will manage the party until the end.<br>
They begin together as a Blue Dragon member (instead of having in some specific cases a doble class of physician or observer). That class can be converted into the evil one but the conversion is pretty different &amp; works separately for both players because it affects both (in the sense that if one is becoming Unseen/Cult, the other will be automatically Neutral and will know at this moment that his other half took the dark side).<br>
The class will be mainly Social and a little bit support, on my point of view as it will be centered into twins actions, their actions, their arguments and their communication is what will make them survive or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
When they’re with the Blue Dragon, of course winning with them.<br>
If one is Unseen/Cult, he has to win with Unseen/Cult with keeping his half alive, while the other who becomes Neutral got his objective changed and has to survive with his other half alive. It may not make sense as twins to be confronting each other but they’re still a family and no matter mistakes they do, they’re still together (but less than before).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passive:</strong><br>
Shared Destiny : I was thinking if one dies for any reason, the other will commit suicide automatically the night after (like the butler who poisoned a good king). If the idea of “suicide” may be too much, we can aim the other idea of reconverting the lonely twin into an other existent class in BD/Neutral and make them total strangers with a small advantage of knowing each other roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills 1/3 :</strong> That’s the beginning point for twins.<br>
As Blue Dragon<br>
<em>Day Ability 1: Little Secrets</em> - (2 Uses): They can communicate privately on whispers between them without letting others know (like the Mystic with whispers hidden).<br>
<em>Day Ability 2: Perfect Timing</em> - (2 Uses): In whatever action one twin does/need the help of the other one in the day, he can ask him through this skill to automatically follow (it can be special because i’m thinking in the case that the other twin got reaped or is afk). It can be for example a voting action.<br>
<em>Night Ability 1: Mystical Link</em> (Infinite Uses): Like the mystic, he can link directly to his twin every night.<br>
<em>Night Ability 2: Same Education</em> (2 Uses): A mutual cover at night (like a guard) or when one is attacked the other one protect him and it takes one use?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills 2/3 :</strong> If one of the twin got converted.<br>
As Unseen/Cult : We keep the passive. But they change skills.<br>
<em>Day Ability 1: Bad Jokes</em> - (2 Uses): He can distract his other twin for few seconds to mute him like the assassin (as he becomes evil and need to win as an evil, if the other twin decide to betray him or out some information, that skill can be useful for him).<br>
<em>Day Ability 2: This is my choice</em> - (2 Uses): He can force him to vote someone like the noble.<br>
<em>Night Ability 1: Stalking you (Infinite Uses)</em>: He can see who his twin visited this night.<br>
<em>Night Ability 2: Faking it (2 Uses)</em>: He can give wrong informations to his twin during the night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills 3/3 :</strong> What happens to the other twin ?<br>
As Neutral : We keep the passive. But they change skills.<br>
<em>Day Ability 1: Become Stronger</em> - (3 Uses): Acts like the Stoneskin of Alchemist in the case of the other twin partners wishing to kill him.<br>
<em>Night Ability 1: Saving myself</em> (2 Uses): He earns the ability of leaving his spot to go visit someone else and will occupy all people that will visit him (like the Butler with party tonight).<br>
<em>Night Ability 2: Catch me if you can</em> (2 Uses): He can give wrong informations to his twin during the night.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>PS : The inspiration of this class came by the strong relationship between Sorcerer/Inquisitor.</h2>
<p>Any suggestions/queries are welcome.</p>

</aside>
<p>This always means that the neutral twin just wins with unseen/cult, so it is not really neutral, since unseen/cult win if they survive just the same.</p>
<p>Also do not get how an unseen/cult twin has abilities against their other half. They have to win together. Why would they work against each other?</p>

          <p>Well i  went with the idea that even if one of the twins went to the dark side, the other twin will not let him down so he can’t really stay in the opposite side to become pure enemies. The neutral twin will act kinda like an alchemist but with the advantage that he can understand/predict his twin moves and decide (or not) to help BD, as the evil twin can try to convince his cult/unseen members to target other people to save his other twin. Even if they have different paths, they’re still a family.</p>
<p>But they work against each other to put that dilemma in the “romeo/juliet” mode so it could be fun to finish the game through difficulties.</p>

          <p>Let me ask you this. What is the incentive for the neutral twin not to work together with his evil twin and the other way around? Why would he ever try to derail his fellow twin’s result with an ability. A neutral twin has zero reason to help BD. He will just become like the old contracted mercenary to an unseen member. It is like you gave that Mercenary abilities that harm his target. They would never get used and do not fit the flavor of the class.</p>

          <p>I get the point you’re trying to show me, the neutral twin will always “lose” whatever situation we pick (if he get killed, if he kills himself (and his evil twin too) or he helps BD to kill his twin, he’ll never win). The neutral twin has to survive in all case, like the alchemist, the only thing that changes is that his survival depends not only on his life but on his twin life too. To win, he have to stay BD, or survive in 2 situations (not being killed + unseen/cult victory or evil twin is the last survivor not exe and it’s a BD victory). As i said in the concept, i really want to center the class into the link between those two twins. What do you suggest about the neutral one, that i change their passive and he plays whatever he wants ?</p>

          <p>I just do not see the twin mechanic working for anything other than a small NK faction in this game with conversion. Either the convert will be too strong or the conversion will be hidden from the other twin making the dynamic impossible. You just made it a pseudo-extra convert with that neutral twist. 4 members on the unseen is insanely strong, when you factor in possibilities like evil king/Sellsword/Sorcerer.</p>
<p>In your scenario the evil twin literally wins with the neutral twin who has to keep him alive at all costs. It just makes zero sense. It is like the unseen going after the sorcerer or the old contracted mercenary who is contracted to the unseen. Only in super fringe scenario’s is that optimal play and you give them abilities related to it as well.</p>
<p>The fact that the evil/neutral twins will have to act BD is just like every other scum class that wants to survive the court. You do not have to deliberately bus/make it difficult for your teammates. Especially if some of this sabotage is not even visible to BD.</p>
<p>You could make 2 neutral survivors that need to keep each other alive, but even that is typically too strong as seen by the old alchemist and mercenary combo’s.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2><strong><font color="Lilblue">The Twin</font></strong></h2>
<p>Passive:Shared Destiny : I was thinking if one dies for any reason, the other will commit suicide automatically the night after (like the butler who poisoned a good king). If the idea of “suicide” may be too much, we can aim the other idea of reconverting the lonely twin into an other existent class in BD/Neutral and make them total strangers with a small advantage of knowing each other roles.<br>
Day Ability 1: Little Secrets - (2 Uses): They can communicate privately on whispers between them without letting others know (like the Mystic with whispers hidden).<br>
Day Ability 2: Perfect Timing - (2 Uses): In whatever action one twin does/need the help of the other one in the day, he can ask him through this skill to automatically follow (it can be special because i’m thinking in the case that the other twin got reaped or is afk). It can be for example a voting action.<br>
Night Ability 1: Mystical Link (Infinite Uses): Like the mystic, he can link directly to his twin every night.<br>
Night Ability 2: Same Education (2 Uses): A mutual cover at night (like a guard) or when one is attacked the other one protect him and it takes one use?</p>

<p>I would do more but I’m on phone<br>
And I can’t copy and paste the passives and the other stuff since you would make me have to go back up there so i may do it later.</p>
