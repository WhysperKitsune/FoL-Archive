    <description># **SFoL 58: Virtuous II — Return of the Fallen** 

Phase Length:
Day Phase: 48 Hours
Night Phase: 24 Hours
Day 1: 24 hours but no lynch

Lore &amp; Baseline Mechanics: Read the second and third paragraphs with this same paragraph title in the OP of this thread for details: https://forum.imperium42.com/t/sfol-57/79506

**Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB**

**Convert Classes [can be found on the SFoL57 page](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/sfol-57/79506) or in the classcards below, but due to space constraints they had to be removed from here**

[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color] = Scum Killer
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color] = Scum Converter

Game Setup: 16 players
King (60% [color = purple] **Corrupted**[/color], 40% [color = steblue] **Righteous** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Purified**[/color])
[color = steblue] **Visionary** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Arbiter** [/color]
[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] or [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color]
[color = purple] **Duke** [/color]
[color = purple] **Marshal** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color]
[color = purple] **Random Unseen** [/color] / [color = grey] **Random Neutral Non-Killer** [/color]
[color = grey] **Random Neutral Non-Killer** [/color]
[color = grey] **Neutral Killer** [/color]

16-er, King, 11-12 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 2 BD or HoB, 1 NK

**All Unique Non-Neutral Non-King Classes besides Duke, Marshal, Sheriff, Agent, Prince, and Warden will have Prestige, and as such only up to two of them can roll at the start of the game. If the starting convert class is rolled as a Prestige class, this would contribute to the limit of 2. An Unseen Prestige class and its scum convert equivalent cannot both roll as starting classes in the same game; i.e. no spawning of both Archivist and Librarian at the start, etc. Sheriff, Agent, Prince, and Warden cannot spawn as the starting convert class.**

**If a Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium class can be converted into from an Unseen class with Prestige, then that convert class also has Prestige for the purposes of factoring into the starting convert, regardless of whether or not that convert class itself is unique (as for most classes, two different unseen classes convert into the same BD or HoB class, and sometimes one of those Unseen classes has Prestige and the other does not). This means that there are a few more BD and HoB classes with Prestige each than Unseen, as unlike with the unseen, a BD or HoB class does not need to be unique to have Prestige, just be a convert class of at least one Unseen class which itself has Prestige.**

**Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 4 players alive (except for Electromagnetic Channeler and Sorcerer who must make it to the final 3 players alive, and Doppelgänger, who must make it to the final 2 players alive). If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.**

**The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert night 1, and all conversions have a 1-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to three members alive.**

**There will be no lynch on day 1. After that, lynches will be majority and plurality enabled for the rest of the game.**

**The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Grand Trial or Royal Pardon, and if the latter, on who.**

**&quot;No Lynch&quot; is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer &quot;No Lynch&quot; to end the day early without a lynch. If No Lynch is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.**

**Any time I use the word &quot;antithetical&quot; in reference to altering investigative results, this is what I mean:**
Any alignment check equals a greencheck, unless it would normally be a greencheck, in which case it becomes a redcheck.
For typing checks:
Killer = Social
Offensive = Investigative
Investigative = Killer
Support = Offensive
Social = Special
Special = Support
Anything else is up to my discretion.

No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.

Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.

<p>noobs are obviously less experienced</p>
<p>but even in your first game you can pick up on things you think are odd</p>

            <p>You’d be surprised how fast evils can be caught based on vote patterns. In my last ToL game today, I was a knight and I was pushed on by cult. Guess who voted to executed me? Cult king and 2 cultists.</p>
