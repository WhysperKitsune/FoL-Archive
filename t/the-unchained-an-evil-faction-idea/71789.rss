    <description>&gt;# [color=orange]The Unchained[/color]


&gt;**[color=orange]The Recruiter[/color]**
&gt;*[color=orange]Unchained Special[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (No One Tells Me No)** - Immune to death at night.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Revengeful)** - Gain a charge of all day and night abilities on loss of a Unchained member. If you die the player in the faction the longest will become the Recruiter. Charges of each ability will be retained, but they will gain another use of each ability because you have died.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Tell Secret)** - Target a player. They now know your &quot;secret&quot; (They do not get notified) and they are marked on your player list, much like a scorned. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (The Secret Is Death)** - Poison a player that has been told the secret. They will not get notified and die in 3 nights. Player immune to poison will still not be notified but will be immune. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Secret Actions)** - Convert all players that have been told the secret. If they are immune, they will still have the secret, but you will be refunded your use of Tell Secret. (This means they can be poisoned but not converted.) _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Riot!)** - Give every member of the faction one use of all their abilities tonight. _2 uses._

&gt;**[color=orange]The Brute[/color]**
*[color=orange]Unchained Non- Converted Killer[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Teach To Kill)** - If you die, the person that&#39;s been in the faction the longest that isn&#39;t the Recruiter will become the Brute.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Threaten)** - Pick a player. They will lose all of their night immunities tonight only, this mean occupation immunity, death immunity, poison/bleed immunity, etc. _1 use_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Rebel)** - Attack a player. _Infinite Uses_.

&gt;**[color=orange]The Smuggler[/color]**
&gt;*[color=orange]Unchained Converted Social[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Pressure)** - Force a player to vote another player. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Sell Info)** - Target a player. You will hear all the whispers to and from them tomorrow. King is targetable. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Blackmail)** - Target a player. They will not be able to vote, speak, or whisper tomorrow. They can use day abilities that do not involve speaking or voting (Example: Telepathy, Noble Twin). _1 use_.

&gt;**[color=orange]The Distractor[/color]**
&gt;*[color=orange]Unchained Converted Offensive[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Skilled)** - Immune to most occupation and redirection abilities.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Show Leads)** - Redirect a player. The player who was redirected into will be framed. _1 use_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Conversate)** - Occupy a player. _2 uses_.

&gt;**[color=orange]The Supporter[/color]**
&gt;*[color=orange]Unchained Converted Support[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Exhume)** - Learned what killed a player at the end of the night. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Guard)** - Guard an Unchained member, preventing all who target them. _1 use_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Relocate)** - Swap two players, all make all who target one, target the other. _2 uses_.

&gt;**[color=orange]The Insider[/color]**
&gt;*[color=orange]Unchained Converted Investigative[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Learn secrets)** - Choose a player that has been told the Recruiter&#39;s secret. All unchained will be shown their logs. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Show intent)** - Learn a players faction. _Infinite uses_.

&gt;**[color=orange]The Backup[/color]**
&gt;[color=orange]Unchained Converted Killer[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Mark for death)** - If the selected player dies tonight, their logs will not be shown. _1 use._
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Defend)** - Defend the Recruiter tonight. If they are visited by an investigative class, kill them. _1 use._
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Stab)** - Stab a player. They will be notified that a hunter or backup has bled them. They will die the next night.

**Goal: Same that unseen/cult has**

**Mechanics:**
You can only have 4 members converted at once. This is because the &quot;secret&quot; ability only has 2 uses. 
You always start with one brute and one recruiter.
The Investigative class for the unchained is:
If a recruiter player that has the secret dies, they will gain back a use of the ability.

&gt;**[color=blue]The Watchman Guard[/color]**
&gt;*[color=blue]Blue Dragon Investigative[/color]*
&gt;
&gt;**Passive (Aware)** - You are notified when someone has been told the secret. You will not know who this was.
&gt;
&gt;**Day Ability (Force to Forget)** - Select a player. If they know the secret and are not converted, they will forget it. The Recruiter will gain a charge of Tell Secret back. _2 uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Knowledge of Rebellion)** - Check if a player is a member of the Unchained tonight. _Infinite Uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Ability (Check for &quot;Secrets&quot;)** - Select two players. If one is poisoned, you will be notified. You will not know which one. _Infinite Uses_.
&gt;
&gt;**Goal**: Same as rest of BD


&gt;# This was my first faction idea and I struggled to make classes. I was going to make one for every BD class but that&#39;s harder than I expected. Questions, Opinions, and Ideas for change are appreciated. Thanks!</description>

<p>But not talking to anyone isn’t fun.  Plus this would open up new strategies(you could talk to neuts)</p>

<p>Reduce the use of riot to 1 then.  And no class/faction deserves a hardcounter.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Addressing your points:<br>
For the first one, it  includes all type of immunity, which includes redirection immunity. I just wanted to put some examples.<br>
For the second one, the I believe the player shouldnt be allowed to talk to anybody because I want it to work as chill does. Also if they could be able to talk to the blackmailer only that would in my opinion be a buff to an already amazing day ability, which I do not want.<br>
For the third one, I don’t want evils to just not have logs. I don’t want to encourage evils to play badly like that. Also everyone once they know its an Unchained game would just copy their logs every time they add something new to it.<br>
For the fourth one, I believe the unchained should have a hard-counter investigative because of how good they are. The unchained is OP because of the Recruiter’s RIOT! ability, giving them all uses of abilities that are very dangerous (Stab, blackmail, learn secrets, show leads).</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, though!</p>

<p>I like the idea, but completely preventing speech would not be fun.  Instead, they should be allowed to talk but only to you(and you should be able to talk back to them).</p>

<p>I like the concept, but this could also work: shred(1 use): erase your Target’s journal and prevent them from writing in it furthur.  I think this would be better because it gives evils a valid excuse to having no logs.</p>

</aside>
<p>This should be removed.  Evil factions shouldn’t have a separate cop hunting them down.  One cop would do just fine.  This is a deduction based game, and IMO cops are a bit boring to play(they only affect the faction they are designed to counter, and their results are linear)</p>
