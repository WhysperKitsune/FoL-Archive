    <title>Queen (Unknown Special)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/queen-unknown-special/1363</link>
    <description>Just something I experimented with when coming into terms with the actual game

##[color=#FAED00]Queen[/color]

----------

**Faction:** Unknown
**Type:** Special

**Passive Ability 1:** The King&#39;s Side
Your faction is the same as the King&#39;s and will be revealed to you when the King dies
**Passive Ability 2:** Royal Blood
Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King
**Passive Ability 3:** Last Letter
Have the King be revealed as a Good King if he dies but still revealed as his true faction to you 

**Day Ability 1:** Confront
Have the King reveal his true faction to you (1 use, only available on Day 3)

**Night Ability 1:** Save
Protect the King from any attacks, sacrificing yourself in the process (1 day cooldown)

**Lore:**
Although it seems as though the whole royal family of Adiart should be very close with knowledge of all secrets, sometimes powerful figures get left in the dark. The _Queen_ has been a pawn in the _King&#39;s_ game, for the whole time he&#39;s ruled the _Queen_ has been expected to pick up the pieces of the _King&#39;s_ fallacies. She does not know where he goes, who he trusts or who he talks to at night but she does know that if he is discovered a traitor of the region, all swords will be pointed at her. Though loyal to his side she decides enough is enough and confronts the _King_ during the day to ask who he is really serving, his words shocked the _Queen_ from her finding out that he&#39;d been serving the _Black Rose_ this whole time under her nose and her decisions with the _King_ had been against the people. From her surprised reaction, the _Blue Dragons_ then became suspicious that the royal couple was hiding something and had the mighty _Knight_ to determine whether the _King_ had been persuaded by the _Black Rose_ to save the people from the _King&#39;s_ suspicious nature. In quick efforts, the _Queen_ quickly wrote a fake letter as the _King_ stating that he was _Blue Dragon_ the whole time and that the _Knight_ had got it wrong. When the people in castle awoke the next morning, they found the bodies of the _King_ and the _Knight_ who was killed by the _Black Rose_, and as the _Queen_ wept tears for her beloved husband and as she sat with the people at the round table she knew it was time to finish his duty

**Additional Information:**
The Queen will not change factions if a new King is appointed 
If the Queen dies before learning her faction she will still be revealed as the Queen (Blue Dragon faction)
The Cult Queen or Traiter Queen cannot talk in night chat unless the original King dies. If a new King is appointed after the original King dies, the Queen can still talk in the night chat
The Neutral Queen will win if she is alive at the end of the game</description>

            <p>Well it’s more fun than Citizen which is the most boring of all roles, plus you still are able to strategically protect the King to save you<br>
Maybe Day 4 is too long though, I may then actually make it so you can ask on Day 3 so you aren’t tempted to actually kill the King for information instead of helping him</p>

            <p>It’s a good role on paper but to be honest playing as the queen will bore people to death because you just sit there doing nothing until day 4.</p>

            <p>There appears to be a problem.</p>
<p>Last Letter should be a passive ability just because if there is even a chance that you mess up a single night action by not using it at the right time, you’re instantly dead to the point where you can’t even claim Queen at all. You’re basically like a Mercenary.</p>
<p>Now with this as another passive, a Good King who is suspicious and dies will have his/her judgements questioned, and an evil king’s actions could be trusted.</p>
<p>Works to preserve the secrecy.</p>

<p>also a couple of questions</p>
<p>If you die and are, for example, Cult Queen, do people know you are Cult Queen and therefore the King is Cult King?<br>
If you’re Neutral do you have to survive or do you have to make sure the King survives, like a Mercenary<br>
If someone else becomes King does your faction change to reflect theirs?<br>
If the Prince becomes King how will you explain being married to your son?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<ol>
<li>Because you don’t know your faction yourself and for the King’s cover I think it should just be shown as the Queen (Blue Dragon faction)</li>
<li>To not copy the Mercenary and because I’d like the Queen to be more like the King, I believe the Queen should just have to survive</li>
<li>No, you will stay in the faction your original King was in otherwise the Queen can betray all the Cult or Black Rose members</li>
<li>Well it’s the same as was a king to die in royalty and the new heir is too young to marry so the Queen becomes Queen Mother (I think dint quote me on that). It’s the same confusion as the Princess becoming the new King in the game, does she change gender…</li>
