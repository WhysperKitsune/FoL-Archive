    <description>Current Circle of Death:

Everyone visiting target player will die. (Unavailable before Night 5)

Change to:

Circle of Death

2 people visiting your target will die unless there are 3 or more people visiting. Pierces night immunity. If the Inquisitor visits the target, he will be the priority to be killed and will bypasses Guarding and Healing on the Inquisitor only. If used on the Inquisitor, he will die bypassing Guarding/Healing. No other visitors will die. (Unavailable until Night 3)

Limited to 3 uses.</description>

            <p>If you have strong clues that you’ve found the Inquisitor, it will be more than worth it!<br>
Being found and killed by the Inquisitor is an instant loss for the Sorcerer after all. Removing that risk by 1 extra attack at night may grant him several days of extra time.</p>
<p>If someone encourages to put some suspect up and that suspect ends up claiming Court Wizard on the stand… What does that say about the person that put him up there? Could very well be an investigative BD, but if you decide to attack him (BD needs to die!) and he lives… well… Why would someone with some form of immunity have reasons to put someone with magic ability on the stand? Well worth a shot in this case I would say.</p>
<p>And again, chances are the Inquisitor already lost his Night Immunity because <strong>someone else</strong> attacked him earlier. In this case, only one attack from the Sorcerer kills him. (checks in-game if Inquisitor is male… confirmed  <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">)</p>

Of course it does! They survived! This will start your deduction. Could it be the Inquisitor? Or a Scorned? Perhaps the Mastermind or an Alchemist?</p>
<p>The attack itself won’t tell you anything else, but information should not be handed on a silver platter. Deduction is part of the game.</p>
<p>Was there a Trollbox ever used? You now must consider that the person you attacked could be Scorned.<br>
That would be a waste of a valuable night attacking him again. Perhaps what he said in chat might steer towards getting someone exed. Makes Scorned more likely again. In this case, you could consider attacking a target that is likely a Blue Dragon. (again, you don’t <strong>have</strong> to kill the Inquisitor)</p>
<p>Did someone claim that target was immune to occupy? Also a clue to him being Scorned or a guarded BD that is occupy immune.</p>
<p>I would really hate it if this game was ever to come down to just check results: 100% A or 100% B.<br>
Or random killings.</p>

<p>That is not a problem at all, that is an interesting choice (backed by some level of deduction) you give to the sorcerer.</p>
<p>If the Sorcerer knew for sure that an immune target would be the Inquisitor, it would be <strong>far</strong> too simple. So he has to pay attention to signals from chat, whispers and voting. Yes, he will be in a disadvantage in the race to find the other, because of the abilities the Inquisitor has. (investigative and the one-time immunity)</p>
<p>But keep in mind, this is not the Sorcerer’s primary race! His win condition is <strong>not</strong> to kill the Inquisitor. If he has some leads presented to him, he can choose to spend some effort there, because killing the Inquisitor will make his life a lot easier. But his goal is to survive and kill the Blue Dragon!</p>
<p>Also, the Inquisitor can be attacked by other sources, like Alchemist, Knight or Cult Leader. This will also remove his Immunity to death at night. So it is not nearly as bad as you describe.</p>

<p>Uhm… No? I can’t see why that would be the case with my suggestion.</p>
<p>Both your suggestion and mine can cause the Inquisitor to die earlier in the game. (for balance reasons I think we agree on)</p>
<p>Mine is just adding one word to an existing passive. Your suggestion means making an ability with 3 lines filled with information just to have it kill the Inquisitor. I don’t like that much text/info on abilities.</p>

            <p>Really question. Has anyone even used the n5 ability? Seems like no-one has and sorc doesn’t make it that far.</p>
<p>Also has anyone ever see a sorc win…?</p>

            <p>This would be a solid change. I’d also like to see the Sorc’s win condition changed to “See the inquisitor die before you”</p>
<p>Right now Inquis is an honorary BD with permanent death immunity and Sorc is an Unseen that doesn’t get the win if he dies before they win.</p>

            <p>I think inquisitor simply needs to not be immune to sorcerer.</p>
