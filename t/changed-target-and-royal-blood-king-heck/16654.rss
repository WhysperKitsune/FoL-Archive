    <title>Changed target and royal blood king heck</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/changed-target-and-royal-blood-king-heck/16654</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I&#39;ve been checking player number 11, and recieved a message that my target were changed.
The message after that said that player number 11 got royal blood.

he turned out to be observer, so i think i got another player info
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I supposed to get info about the changed target player, 
But it wrote me that the changed target was the original target,
So I think i just got the number wrong
#### Steps to reproduce: 
The second message should show what is the right number of the player you got redirected to and not the number of the original check.</description>
