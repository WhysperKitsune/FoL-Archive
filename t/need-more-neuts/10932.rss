    <title>Need More Neuts</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/need-more-neuts/10932</link>
    <description>It is my opinion that the addition of one or two more true neutral classes....There is no Jester in the game...how can you have a medieval court game without a Jester.....So maybe a Jester Class....like the alchemist, have him be a boon or hindrance depending on who he aligns with. Another beneficial neut class would eliminate the &quot;Neut Out&quot; meme I think.</description>

            <p>I mean im all for more beneficial neuts.Or neuts that are hard to deal with.Right now even as confirmed alchemist prince will still exe you bc neuts out.For example,There is a good king,2 alchs,2 unseen,1 BD,<br>
a scorned,and a possessor.(8 people and 2 Bds)<br>
The king and some other people(I dont remember but they werent BD)hung me(The confirmed alch)bc <span class="hashtag">#NEUTSOUT</span>.This was gamethrowing technically.Having the 2 alchs + the scorns vote was the only way he would get someone on stand.But he hangs me loses the game for BD and all bc <span class="hashtag">#NEUTSOUT</span>.I think if there was a neut that good benefit either side would be good for the game.</p>

            <p>No, you’re fine. There are just other games like this with a role called the Jester that is basically the Fool.</p>

            <p>Adding a Jester as a Neutral Support or something and making it completely different from ToS’s Jester is an okay idea with me</p>
<p>Neutral Investigative are bad in general (see: ToS Witch)</p>

            <p>Alchemist is so good. Staying Neutral, helping the majority. I definitely agree we could use a new Alchemist-Like class, just like Alchemist mixes a killer and a healer, it could be a mix of investigative class and something else. Neuts IN!</p>
