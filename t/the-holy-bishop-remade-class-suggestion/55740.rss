&gt;**Name -  [color=blue]Holy Bishop‚ù§Ô∏è[/color]**
**Type - investigator**
**Faction - BD**

**Passive 1:**
_**Royal blood**_ - you may step forward as new king

**Passive 2:**
**_Stuck in confession_** - anyone who wants to do a night ability on one of the people in confession(healing,occu,killing, etc‚Ä¶) the night ability will affect both the Bishop and the other player visiting the Bishop for confession.
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
**Day Ability 1:**
**_Family Reunion_** - The Bishop Invites the King to join him in confession that night. {**_3 uses}_** (if the king denies the invitation then it will not count as a uses) [this is similar to to when the merc send asked you to become her next contract] 

**Day Ability 2**:
_**Confession Meeting**_ - invite a player with royal blood to confession tonight (Similar to a merc offering you a contract). (**_Unlimited uses)_**

‚Ä¢ If the player has royal blood then they are given the option to accept or deny the invitation. The Bishop would know what decision the player has made.

‚Ä¢ if the player does not have royal blood then the Bishop is given the message that ‚Äú[player name] is not worthy of a confession‚Äù

‚Ä¢ only can be used two times per day. If the first one fails(because of no royal blood or denied then you can use a second time)

‚Ä¢ if prince picks the player that you want to go to confession with, then the prince brings that player to jail
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
**Night ability 1:**
_**Locked with your sins**_ - The Bishop locks the player in the room with him, occupying the person that&#39;s in confession with him. (**_Unlimited uses)_**

Night ability 2:
  **_Guardian Angel_** - The Bishop calls upon a living angle that helps keep the player alive tomorrow. Can only be used on the people you‚Äôre having a confession with
 (the next day the player you casted the angle upon can not be voted up for treason and can not die that night.). {**_2 uses}_**
_____

&gt;**Name -   [color=Purple ]Unholy Bishop[/color]üíî**
**Type - investigator**
**Faction - unseen** 

**Passive 1:**
_**Stuck in confession**_ - anyone who wants to do a night ability on one of the people in confession (healing,occu,killing, etc‚Ä¶) the night ability will affect both the Bishop and the other player visiting the Bishop for confession.

**Passive 2:**
**_Royal blood_** - may step forward as new King 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
  **Day Ability 1** - **_Dark  Reunion_** - The Bishop Invites the King to join him in confession that night. {**_3 uses}_** (if the king denies the invitation then it will not count as a uses) [this is similar to to when the merc send asked you to become her next contract] 

**Day Ability 2**:
_**Unholy Confession**_ - invite a player with royal blood to confession tonight (Similar to a merc offering you a contract). (**_Unlimited uses)_**

‚Ä¢ similar to Holy Bishops confession meeting.  
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
**Night ability 1:** 
_**Unstable spirit -**_ select a player. You will get the same results that player gets.(_**Unlimited uses)**_

**Night ability 2:**
**_Fallen Angel_** - send a fallen angel to protect the unseen. Anyone who visits an unseen member will be occupied **_(3 uses)_**&gt;

**What happens in confession?:** confession is a mix between prince&#39;s jail and mystic&#39;s link, the bishop can talk with them. The catch is that what happens to the bishop or whatever happens to the player in confession will happen to both of them. 

Strategy:
So a good strategy is to invite a poisoned/bleeding player to confession so that way you will be protected if the poisoned/bleeding player is targeted that night for healing. Because if one player is affect then the other player is too

Notice:
Please tell me if this would work with the game. It&#39;s a decent class with a lot of claim space. If you do get converted then you can&#39;t have meetings any more but you can just say that the two people you tried to invite to your meeting didn&#39;t have royal blood or denied the invitation.

Edits: 
Unholy Bishop day Ability 2 removed:
Day Ability 2:**
**_Unholy thoughts_** - make someone think that they are poisoned. If someone heals them then both the player getting the heal and the player giving the heal will believe that it was successful. 
(**_4 uses)_**

This is replaced with current one seen above.</description>

            <p>Exactly. So should the Unholy Bishop be given the same day Ability as the Holy Bishop or should he have a different one? That‚Äôs my worry about giving them the same day Ability. That‚Äôs why they removed it from illusionist</p>
