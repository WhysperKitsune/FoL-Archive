            <p>The idea is that you have troll box and tailor Ability’s that can make people seem innocent. Combine that with being able to steel the vote of the accuser and you actually have a shot at winning. There is also the existence of a converted form. In other words if an evil is executed early on you can try and get yourself converted and win that way instead.</p>
<p>After all how would the change you described work with the fool? Btw would like to point out that getting the Unseen/cult killed at night as fast as possible is a viable way to win.</p>

            <p>In my opinion this is a bit counter-intuitive; why not make it that, as a Neutral, he wants to help other Neutrals? This means Fool, Scorned, Merc, Alchemist. He’ll know if the person being voted up is a Neutral.</p>
<p>When there are confirmed Sheriffs/Paladins or Observers who know that the person is evil, it will be so much harder to accomplish your role. And the goal of an attorney, the best one, is to protect the innocent.</p>
<p>I think the goal should be changed so that no non-killing Neutral can be voted guilty during the day.</p>
