    <title>Increase number of evil people or nerfing the priest?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/increase-number-of-evil-people-or-nerfing-the-priest/9637</link>
    <description>Right now you can have about 4-5 uncovertable BD
king
prince
priest
alchemists
priest res target

1 way to deal with it is to nerf priest, for example remove night immune

another way is to improve evil:
make unseen max to 4
make cult max 5

because now, BD can just chill, wait until they have all the numbers and just execute all convertable targets.

I think a better answer is to buff evil and not nerf the priest</description>

            <p>agree with that . it’s when you get into the later turns and nobody is asking questions of anybody who.  First few turns you want to be getting your facts  together.</p>

            <p>Actually against unseen, i’d say they’re not punished that much for being idle the first few days. If you kill the assassin, big deal, you just allowed the MM to convert your sheriff. And MM is pretty hard to catch especially with the new change.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What about something different, like making priest convertable AFTER he has wasted his rez? Also, maybe something similar with rez target? Conversion immunity eventually wears off? I think that seems reasonable.</p>

</aside>
<p>I would agree with the make Unseen cap to 4, but with the Cult, five would be a ridiculous number. Since they are based on a convert and kill pattern with their cooldowns, they are able to convert lots of people quickly, and when the Cult Leader is killed, it already gives rein to the next Cult Leader to convert. This is why they are likely not going to change the cap for the Cult. Unseen on the other hand… I guess we will wait and see.</p>

            <p>They indeed aren’t, but as they more or less need to keep in BD’s good graces, as the unseen/cult have a heck of a time getting to majority, it is in their interest to be working for the BD through the whole game, Claiming either phys or appearing to be BD means for them to put their efforts into helping BD</p>
