    <title>Don&#39;t Be Salty Just Because You Got Outed</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/dont-be-salty-just-because-you-got-outed/65209</link>
    <description>I often see people get very salty for having been outed, sometimes to the point of deliberately throwing the game for revenge against whoever forced forced them to publicly claim.  The most common example of this is a King getting the court to put someone on trial, and then that person being so furious at having to claim that they convince the court to execute the King &quot;even if he&#39;s Good King&quot;.

I just wish this nonsense would stop.</description>
