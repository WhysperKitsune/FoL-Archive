    <description>The Crackpot (Neutral Support)

Passives
[Overexposure]
After being exposed to her own concoctions for a long time, the crackpot becomes immune to 
the after effects. (immune to bleeding, poison, redirection and occupation)

Day Ability
[Concussion Concoction]
The crackpot menacingly gives a concussion concoction to a target. If the target visits another person that night, the person visited will be occupied. (4 uses) 

Night Ability
[Special Brew]
The target will be given a drink specially brewed by the crackpot. The drinks affect the individual differently based on the class type. (infinite uses) **the crackpot won&#39;t be noted of the effects.**
*Special - Occupied. Bypasses occupy immunity.
*Invest - Heals.
*Killer - Prevents visitors from visiting.
*Offensive - Poison/bleed
*Social - Unable to chat the next day
*Support - Death Immunity
Cant visit the same target twice in a row.

[Gas fumes]
The crackpot starts concocting in her lab, which usually produces a huge amount of fumes. Luckily for her, the fumes strengthens her, giving her death immunity. Visitors on the other hand, will be unknowingly poison/bled and die the next day, if not healed. (3 uses)

Goals:
Survive until the end.</description>

            <p>Way too BD-sided. All type abilities are really good for BD except not being able to speak and poison/bleeding offensives, but it also makes this class super confirmable, while having great positive effects for BD. Why should this class not out day 1 and stay BD-sided. It also can die n1 due to assassin or something, so it needs some form of night protection like every single other neutral.</p>
