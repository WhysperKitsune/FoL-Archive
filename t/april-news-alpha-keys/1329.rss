_&quot;The Neutral King&quot; by Adiart_

**Hi everyone --** we mostly update first via [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB), so some of this news may be a bit behind :slight_smile:

* We have been updating like crazy. 
* We recently sent out a couple hundred Steam keys to **Esquire** backers with an early invite to Alpha!
* We finished our Euro promo to get some more Euros on the same timezone.
* [Polish Wikia](http://pl.tol.wikia.com) is getting a start-to-finish revamp by two awesome volunteers, @PerunPerunowy and @Eevee.
* We successfully had our first 16-player game last night.
* We discovered peak-time is, surprisingly, **9pm-5am EST**
* Our **#looking-for-group** [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB) channel is getting popular! Type **?rank lfg** be be @pingable for a group!
* Our end-game events are starting to work, which means stats and gp gains at the end of matches are starting to work _(although gp will reset later)_.
* Lobby chat is coming soon!
* There are TONS of Throne of Lies YouTube videos and Twitch streams about us! [Look us up](https://gaming.youtube.com/results?search_query=throne%20of%20lies)!
* We added a new **Lorebot** to our Discord to start pulling feeds from the forum here - and it&#39;s actually posting in the correct categories~
* There are free keys given out all over the place! Mostly in Discord, YouTube and Twitch. Follow our Streamers/YouTubers **in yellow** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvNbRSB) for the best chances of key giveaways!
* The game is **mostly stable, now.** We&#39;re still working out a few kinks, but it&#39;s pretty good!
* We&#39;re working ways to load between day/night faster. **WAY faster.** 

Oh my, a lot of good things lately and on the way.</description>
