    <title>[Class Suggestion] Spy v3 (unconfirmable BD Social)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-spy-v3-unconfirmable-bd-social/72843</link>
    <description>No big changes here from the the last one, just a minor change to seizure that removes its investigative ability (not befitting of a social class).

&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=blue]Spy[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Blue Dragon Unique :star: Social[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Mole (Passive) -** Will see the votes when a new King is elected. *You will keep this passive even if your class changes.*
&gt;
&gt;**Stake Out (Day) -** During the night, you will be able to hear the messages of the Cult or Unseen. Alerts the Cult/Unseen of your presence at the beginning of the night when used. *(1 use)*
&gt; 
&gt;**Bug (Night) -** Send a scout to a chosen player. At the beginning of each night, the scout alerts you if the target used a day ability. Regains uses upon the scouted player dying. *(2 uses)*
&gt;**Seizure (Night) -** All Non-BD players will not receive feedback for their abilities on the chosen target. They will receive &#39;prevented&#39; feedback. *(Infinite uses)* 
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*


&gt; &lt;big&gt;[color=indigo]Double Agent[/color]&lt;/big&gt;
&gt;**[color=grey]Unseen Unique :star: Social [/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Expert Espionage (Passive) -** Your votes for king count as triple the normal value.
&gt;
&gt;**Plant Evidence (Day) -** Frame a player. They will appear as suspicious to investigative classes this night. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Cronies (Night) -** Send a crony to the chosen player. At the beginning of each night, the crony tells you what day ability the target used. Regains uses upon the targeted player dying. *(2 uses)*
&gt;**Forge (Night) -** Choose a player and rewrite their Logs at night. If they die, their Logs are replaced with your rewritten ones. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;*Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon, and any neutrals that seek to do you harm.*</description>

<blockquote>
<p>You could just say you used it on someone that isn’t a prince/</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is an ability belonging to a BD class. Confirming yourself to confirmed BD is extremely valuable, and more importantly uninteresting.</p>
<p>Noble has Noble Twin. That ability is only used to confirm the noble in cult games, and sometimes in unseen games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing wrong with that. Abilities should have risk to using them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, but this is really unfun for BD. The whole point of the ability is to weaken the claims of evils claiming BD, which with making it effect all would be extremely useless. It would have no point.</p>

<p>This ability provides little use outside of disruption, so it doesn’t need changing.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase that. Rewriting logs is too weak, it should be able to edit them instead. If it was just rewriting then it would be easy to tell forged logs. And making it a day ability would go with the first change</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Editing logs is probe + upside. Too strong, simple as that. Making it a day ability would free up a night action, and that in combination with the probe + upside makes it way too far above the power level of other classes.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, but Seizure doesn’t provide anything of use except for weakening the claims of evils. It shouldn’t have risk because the times it is effective are limited.</p>
