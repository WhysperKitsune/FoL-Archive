    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Warlock and The Ghouls</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-warlock-and-the-ghouls/41502</link>
    <description>Just an idea that came to mind while playing Hearthstone. 

Also this way, dead Neuts don&#39;t leave right away; they have a chance to rejoin the game and unite under one Neutral Overlord.

Enjoy!

            <p>I’m just toying with the ideas but yeah, you’re right, I should bring it down a notch. It would still be cool for an undead army though, but overpowered.</p>

            <p>Hey Livicus, cool class suggestions, let me just ask some questions.<br>
Considering that he’s Neutral, that leaves a maximum of 2 other Neuts in the game + the NK.</p>
<ol>
<li>So Firstly, can the NK become a Ghoul? If so, that’s a maximum of 3 Ghouls in the game, so we’d have a player with 4 votes in the court. That’s really OP. I know that in order to do so, you’d have to successfully occupy 6 players, but that’s not impossible.</li>
<li>Let’s consider a not so rare scenario where the Neutrals that spawned are: NK + Fool + Scorned + Warlock. Both the Fool and the Scorned win and the NK remains alive. In this case, Shadow Essence remains unusable, the same goes for Mortal Coil. So basically we have a Neutral Butler that can, if bled or poisoned, heal himself. Because I don’t see any other reason to spend 2 souls counting on a chance of maybe being attacked.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, basically, what I’m trying to say here is:<br>
Bloodbloom - I’d add on it that, if not required, then you get one soul back.<br>
Shadow Essence - I’d change “For every Ghoul” to “If there’s a Ghoul”. This way you only get an extra vote.</p>

<p>The Ghoul</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The thing about the Ghouls is that, as I said up there, you can have a maximum of 3 Ghouls. And the thing that they’ll do more often than not is occupying. So you have the Warlock occupying and 3 other Ghouls. That’s 4 different players (since they can talk and organize) not doing an action in a 16 player game. And I’m not even considering one or two butlers in the game. 1/4 of the players will not act, in a game whereby n6 nobody died and that never happens. That can’t be allowed.</p>
<ol>
<li>I’d make the Ghoul, much like the DK, unique. If there’s a Ghoul alive, there can’t be another one. That’s actually the only thing I’d change. If you were to make another Ghoul, the already existing one would feed on his flesh to regain his abilities. If you chose to do it this way, which I think is the better way, I’d honestly take one use from Hellish Wall and two uses from Nightmare, to make it so that the Ghoul has to be fed.</li>
</ol>
<p>[Suggestion Box]: What I’d certainly do is change his passive. Like this:<br>
Passive 1: Ghoul - The player will appear dead to all living players. He may not accuse or vote. He cannot speak to the dead, only to the Warlock at night. If the Warlock dies, the Ghoul’s soul is set free and he is treated like a normal dead player.<br>
Passive 2: The Dead Hungers - If a second Ghoul is created, the existing one will feed on his flesh to regain all uses of his abilities.</p>
<p>I actually made a neutral class with similar gameplay, would you mind taking a look?<br>
