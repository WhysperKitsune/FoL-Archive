Why i made this: 

i would like some classes in the game that messes with your limited abilities. This can affect game play. You also have a decision on who you want to work with. Blacksmith or thieve, or even both. One major example is if youre playing as poss and you get another use of your jump. These classes right now arnt perfect and i would like feedback. As of right now there is no reason not to out as any of these classes but i would like to see what people think of them. Originally the Thieve had to steal from the Blacksmith twice but than it ran into the problem of what if the blacksmith dies early. Tell me if any typos too.. thanks!</description>

            <p>The point in these classes is for a way to gain abilities and possible lose abilities. It also has you working with some new neutral classes which we could use more of. Read some of the other comments posted here too. They make some good points on these classes. I also can say that the merc class is pretty pointless. Has no real reason to be in the game, should be reverted to merc with contract</p>

            <p>I seriously doubt they ever add this. last time I checked they removed more classes overall than added classes. But this is interesting. steal 4 times successfully or steal from the blacksmith twice. This makes it pretty feasible as a goal, since almost every class has some limited use ability yet there should be enough influx of other classes to tempt the thief to try and go for the blacksmith. The blacksmith on the other hand had abilities designed to make stealing from him or his good trading pals as hard as possible, At least to a point where the thief might just not bother and steal from other people rather than potentially lose the game trying to go after them constantly. Though just a tip, I don’t think a thief should be able to use special delivery on the person he just stole from, it’s like stealing from the museum and coming back the next day to return what you stole not to mention trivializes the thief since he can just out himself day 1, steal from someone before the blacksmith gets them and give them a special delivery. repeat this four times and you win, and the BD will at worst probably kill you if you decide to steal from the prince, HECK you could give the prince more executes in return for him not killing you. which is interesting considering you can steal from ANYONE with a limited ability regardless of who they are, The thief could go literally any direction except NK, while the blacksmith is essentially an old pre patch heathen alchemist that gives stuff to people during the night. The thief as a standalone class is interesting. the blacksmith seems more like the free mini dlc added on top.</p>

            <p>well I do want these in the game, but I think change the whitesmiths win con. none of it’s abilities are helpfull to survive. like make it so your shop needs to be visited 5 times (banned people counts as 2) etc etc<br>
EDIT: yes I like Thief too and they would make a good couple because you can’t just claim d1 and redsmith needs something to get rid of the thief not only find it</p>

<p>i would like some classes in the game that messes with your limited abilities. This can affect game play. You also have a decision on who you want to work with. Blacksmith or thieve, or even both. One major example is if youre playing as poss and you get another use of your jump. These classes right now arnt perfect and i would like feedback. As of right now there is no reason not to out as any of these classes but i would like to see what people think of them. Originally the Thieve had to steal from the Blacksmith twice but than it ran into the problem of what if the blacksmith dies early. Tell me if any typos too… thanks!</p>

<p>Have to say, Interesting dynamo duo. Also cool it messes with limited abilities, and glad that both sides have reasons to keep both around. Yeah old style of winning seemed bad, too much of Sorc and Inq. But seems cool <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p><s>Also new ship spotted</s></p>
