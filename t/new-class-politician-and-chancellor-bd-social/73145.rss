    <description>**Politician (Unique Blue Dragon Social)**

**Passive 1: Court Ties**
See who votes who whenever there&#39;s a vote for king. You will keep this ability even when your class changes.

**Passive 2: Incomplete Campaign**
Unable to step to become king when there are over 10 players alive. You will keep this ability even when your class changes.

**Day Ability 1: Rigged Election - 2 Uses**
Whoever you vote for king during this election, they will get 1 extra vote. (If you vote for someone with Royal Blood, they will get 3 votes instead of 2, _NOT 4_)

**Day Ability 2: Unknown Interceptor - 3 Uses**
Select 2 players. They will be unable to whisper each other for the rest of the day. They will not be notified if they try to whisper to each other that it failed, and will appear to be sent to the player that sent it, but not to the rest of the court nor the other person. Instead, you will see what they said in the whisper. (Cannot Target King)

**Night Ability 1: Blackmail - Infinite Uses**
Select 2 Players. The first player you select will not be able to vote guilty\pardon on the 2nd player, nor vote them if they step to become king. The player will think they are voting them as king or voting guilty\pardon, but it will just abstain the vote without telling them. It will, however, tell the rest of the court during a trial that they abstained. 

**Night Ability 2: Listen In - 4 Uses**
Select 1 player. You will hear all whispers sent _to them_ for that day.

**Extra Info:**
Not Occupy Immune. Not set of the amount of uses for listen in, I might switch it with blackmail.

**Chancellor - Unique Unseen Social**

**Passive 1: Unseen Ties**
See who votes who whenever there&#39;s a vote for king. You will keep this ability even when your class changes.

**Passive 2: Incomplete Campaign**
Unable to step to become king when there are over 10 players alive.  You will keep this ability even when your class changes.

**Day Ability 1: Rigged Election - 1 Use**
Whoever you vote for king during this election, they will get 1 extra vote. (If you vote for someone with Royal Blood, they will get 3 votes instead of 2, _NOT 4_)

**Day Ability 2: Unseen Interceptor - 2 Uses**
Select 2 players. They will be unable to whisper each other for the rest of the day. They will not be notified if they try to whisper to each other that it failed, and will appear to be sent to the player that sent it, but not to the rest of the court nor the other person. Instead, you and the rest of the unseen will see what the message contained. (Cannot Target King)

**Night Ability 1: Blackmail - Infinite Uses**
Select 2 Players. The first player you select will not be able to vote guilty\pardon on the 2nd player, nor vote them if they step to become king. The player will think they are voting them as king or voting guilty\pardon, but it will just abstain the vote without telling them. It will, however, tell the rest of the court during a trial that they abstained. 

**Night Ability 2: Political Unsettling - 1 Use**
Select 1 Unseen member. If there is a vote tomorrow to elect a king, the unseen member will count as if they have royal blood. If the unseen member you selected already had the royal blood passive, this ability will do nothing and you will lose a count of it.

**Extra Notes:**
Not Occupy Immune.

**Comments:**
The class&#39; name is up for change, as it doesn&#39;t really fit with the whole medieval theme of ToL. Anyway, this is my try at a less-confirmable social class. Obviously it could be confirmed if you try hard enough, but almost any class can be confirmed if you really try. ALSO if you know how to change the colors of text tell me and I will for sure make it look nicer. Tell me what you think of the class! :smile: If you have any feedback just let me know and I&#39;ll try to change something. Also I couldn&#39;t come up with another night ability. This is pretty incomplete. I tried to make the Unseen version a bit more balanced by having it pretty much have the same things, but lowering the uses on for the Unseen member, but adding in Political Unsettling.

Also, I&#39;m not set on any of the ability names or anything, so if you have a better name let me know :stuck_out_tongue:</description>
