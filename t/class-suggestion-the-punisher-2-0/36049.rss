    <title>{Class suggestion} The Punisher 2.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-punisher-2-0/36049</link>
    <description>Backstory - the Punisher is sick of these silly faction wars and decides to take action 

Win condition - survive with any other Neutral player till the end of the game(includes NK&#39;s also)

Passive 1 - little hope - when no one has died when you wake up during the morning then you will be death and occu immune that night. 

Day Ability 1 - knock out - Instintly murder a player. {1 uses}. Everyone will be alerted

Day Ability 2 - Deep cut - make a player bleed, they are given the normal message &quot;you are bleeding, you have 2 days to live.&quot; But really the have 1 day to live until death.(can only be used during the first half of the day) {3 uses}

Night ability 1 - Punish - click on two people making on of them bleed and you will attack the other one
{2 uses}

Night ability 2 - special surprise - click on a player and any one that wants to do something to that player(attack,heal,occu) will be redirected to the Punisher that night. If any one was planning on killing that player but the Punisher redirected it to him then, the person attacking will die{3 uses}

Ex. 
The Punisher is #2. 
The assassin is #3. 
The alch is #4. 

The Punisher uses &quot;special surprise&quot; on #4. The same night #3(the assassin)wanted to kill #4(the alch)The assassin will be redirected to the Punisher and die. 

If you remember back when the drunk had his first night ability, it&#39;s similar to that

Notes: This can only spawn when it&#39;s a 16 player game. 

• Ability was removed. I thought this would make it too one sided towards helping BD. 
Day Ability 2 - lie detector - know secretly what a player did last night{3 uses}. 

• this works well with my inspirer class 

Tell me what you think</description>

            <p>Yeah I realized that it will be to one sided. So I added the Deep cut ability. I might need to change it again if that doesn’t fit in. I was thinking like a heal Ability to protect the neutrals but tell me what you think</p>

            <p>Seems like a neut Knight/Alch hybrid. Not bad.</p>
<p>“Little Hope” seems like a very fun passive as well.</p>
<p>“Lie Detector” makes the Punisher a very strong BD ally if he decides to ally with them.</p>
