    <description>By my question I mean what class requires the least changes to be perfect. Personally I think that the Observer is the most balenced class. What do you guys think?

Btw I am not asking for your favorite class but the fairest class.</description>

            <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/vandalay">@Vandalay</a>.<br>
I’m not wild about the Observer because the amount of information they get with Follow is so much that it makes them auto-confirmable.</p>
<p>I don’t think having classes that can auto-confirm themselves is necessarily a bad thing: you kind of need those in a game where conversions are common. However, the current game is overrun by them.</p>

            <p>heh, kind of funny as for me I think the oposite on observer. To me I think too many classes being highly confirmable is the greatest shortcoming with balance. To me, my thought of “balance” would mean that if  every bd role were about this strong, it would be a fair game against the unseen/cult… To me having logs that automatically prove/disprove is worth waaay more than the difference in abilities between classes.</p>
<p>Therefore in terms of balanced I have to give the points to CW, Knight, Physician. Those would be the classes that if all were equally strong, the game could actually stay balanced in a mode where new players weren’t the balancing feature.</p>

            <p>I agree that observer is the most balanced class.  Prince too if the occupy immunity gets removed.</p>

            <p>I also believe Obs and prince to be perfect as it is, so is drunk and alch in my opinion.<br>
Merc could need an additional guard if you ask me.</p>

            <p>Because otherwise people would think they could block the jailing probably.</p>
<p>And to keep “occ immune, exe” from being a thing.  Right now it’s stupid because it might be the Prince.</p>

            <p>I would say observer too. I would say prince but I don’t understand why he needs to be occupy immune.</p>
