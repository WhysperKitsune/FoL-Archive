          <h1>Welcome to SFoL 33: The Golden Dragon 2</h1>
<h2>This SFoL works like a normal SFoL with one twist: The Blue Dragon is replaced with:</h2>
<p><big><font color="orange">The Golden Dragon</font></big></p>
<p>The main differences this faction has over the Blue Dragon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen is a more “Social” version of the King.</li>
<li>The only guaranteed role the Golden Dragon has is “The Bailiff”.</li>
<li>There are no classes with royal blood, instead the starting Queen is able to give royal blood to whoever she wants.</li>
<li>All royals are able to speak to the Queen and each other at night as long as the Queen is alive.</li>
<li>Golden Dragon classes convert into their special unseen classes, and the cult classes may have different abilities than the ones converted from the BD.</li>
<li>There is no Prince or jailing of any kind in this faction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The scum faction will be:</h2>
<h1><font color="darkgreen"> The Reptilians</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Reptilians are usually slower than Cult/Unseen but are better at hiding.</li>
<li>Reptilians get more powerful the longer they stay alive.</li>
<li>Reptilians are able to chose between many different abilities depending on the situation.</li>
<li>All reptilian converts have a way to kill, although its usually limited or situational.</li>
<li>Reptilians use venom instead of bleeding/poison. Venom kills slower but disables day abilities until healed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Also, to anyone that played the first Golden Dragon game, these are the main differences:</h2>
<p>The main changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most Golden Dragon classes have been nerfed.</li>
<li>Accused, Prosecutor and Lawyer have been reworked.</li>
<li>New NKs added: The Siren and The Collector.</li>
<li>New neutrals added: The rivals, the occultist and The Identity Thief</li>
<li>Bounty Hunter has death immunity</li>
<li>The Count can frame two people each night instead of 1 and starts with 1 use of Fate decided.</li>
<li>EFoL notifications will be used.</li>
<li>Reptilians have been added, and will be the main scum faction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> Psychoneirik<br>
<strong>Cohost:</strong> <a class="mention" href="../../../u/luxy.html">@Luxy</a></p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Global Forum Rules</li>
<li>If you haven’t posted content in 36 hours, you’ll be prodded for inactivity. If you don’t respond to that prod in 16 hours, you will be force replaced.</li>
<li>No private messaging others in the game about the game.</li>
<li>Do not post anything on a previous night’s royal chat.</li>
<li>Do not post anything during nighttime.</li>
<li>Do not screenshot or quote private host messages</li>
<li>If you already submitted a night action and wish to change it, say it on a new message. Don’t edit your previous action, so the hosts can notice. Some actions are instant and cannot be changed once sent.</li>
<li>Don’t throw the game. This includes any form of intent to make you or your faction lose</li>
<li>Do not edit your messages. Edits are only allowed for grammar mistakes.</li>
<li>People that are not in the game cannot post in the thread or message players about the game.</li>
<li>Players are not allowed to use big letters. These are reserved for the host.</li>
<li>Remember, this is a game. Respect others and lets have fun!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Important note about Spectators:</h4>
<p>Please understand that due to the events in previous games, spectators <strong>will not be allowed</strong>. If the game fills up, you may still sign up as a backup however.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Days will be 72 hours long, or shorter if someone is executed</li>
<li>Nights will be 24 hours days long</li>
<li>Actions are done by messaging me</li>
<li>You cannot target yourself with abilities unless an ability says otherwise.</li>
<li>You cannot use day abilities on day 1 unless an ability says otherwise.</li>
<li>FoL classes outside of those stated in the class cards thread will NOT appear in this game.</li>
<li>Unseen/Cult will have a private day and night chat</li>
<li>The Queen and all royals will have a private night chat. There will be a different chat for every day, and you are only allowed to talk on the most recent one.</li>
<li>When you receive a card you will have 24 hours to reply, confirming you have received it. Failure to do so might make you lose your spot.</li>
<li>Players are able to ask the host for flavor text or notifications to help with fake claiming.</li>
<li>To avoid angleshooting, all questions to the host will be answered <strong>privately</strong>.</li>
<li>Frame will make the target appear to have visited whoever died that night to the Bailiff’s Interrogate ability. In the case of multiple deaths, a target will be picked randomly.</li>
<li>Frame will make a player give the opposite records to a librarian.</li>
<li>Framed players appear as Killer classes, or if the class is a Killer or Offensive class, it will appear as Special.</li>
<li>Instant night abilities like Hearsay and Words of Wisdom don’t count as visiting and are unaffected by occupation, redirection or visit prevention.</li>
<li>Portal trick also makes the user immune to those effects, so they can’t be occupied, redirected or prevented while using it.</li>
<li>The maximum number of non-unique classes is 3.</li>
<li>Vote altering abilities won’t notify the affected player unless it states otherwise. The changes however will be reflected in the vote count.</li>
<li>Matriarch is not notified if one of their eggs is healed</li>
<li>Matriarch’s eggs will persist after the matriarch dies. These eggs can be hatched by the new matriarch.</li>
<li>If you lay an egg after reaching the egg limit, the oldest egg will be removed</li>
<li>Players with eggs will appear as reptilians the same night the egg is laid unless healed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Executions</h3>
<ul>
<li>To accuse someone say “<strong>/vote [player]</strong>”</li>
<li>To rescind your vote say “<strong>/unvote</strong>”</li>
<li>Everyone will be able to keep talking when someone is on trial</li>
<li>While someone is on trial, everyone will be able to vote <strong>/pardon</strong> or <strong>/execute</strong>. Their fate will be decided once majority is reached.</li>
<li>Trials will last for a maximum of 12 hours.</li>
<li>Trials are limited to two per day.</li>
<li>Day will end immediately after someone is executed on trial or after the second trial.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Journals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message me your entire journal, the last draft I receive before you die shall be the one displayed</li>
<li>If you have a killing ability, you can submit a deathnote with the kill. The deathnote can be either an image or a message. The hosts might not accept a deathnote if it breaks any rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To Join</h3>
<ul>
<li>To join, simply express interest in joining by saying something like “I want to join” or “/join” or “/in” or “sign me up, coach” or whatever you want</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ability results/notifications</h3>
<p>Only certain abilities will give night results. Most players will only be told if they die or if they are bleeding/poisoned/envenomed (they won’t be told if they are healed). Investigative abilities will know if they are unable to perform their abilities or if they are redirected (they won’t know who they are redirected to).</p>
