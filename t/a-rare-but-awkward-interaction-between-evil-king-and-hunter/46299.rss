    <title>A Rare but awkward interaction between Evil King and Hunter</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/a-rare-but-awkward-interaction-between-evil-king-and-hunter/46299</link>
    <description>The Situation: Only Men standing in the court during the day are: The Hunter and The Evil King (this king is not the starting King and was ellected by the court at some point during the match, meaning he can only guard and not execute people during the night). 

During That Day: With only these 2 men alive, The truth is finally unveiled and The Hunter has only 1 option which is to accuse the King of treason. That is not gonna work since you need 2 votes during the day. So The Hunter&#39;s reality is that he cannot do anything.

The King on the other hand has 2 options. A) Accuse the hunter and point the finger in order to get the extra vote he needed. Then he procceds to vote execute on the hunter but then &#39;&#39;retribution&#39;&#39; triggers killing the King. B) Knowing that the hunter cannot kill him at night or accuse him of treason during the day, he proceeds in doing nothing in order to avoid getting killed by the Hunter&#39;s passive &#39;&#39;retribution&#39;&#39;

The Problem: The King is known to have the upper hand in a &#39;&#39;1v1&#39;&#39; situation during the day because of his day ability &#39;&#39;point he finger&#39;&#39;. Ironacally In this extremely rare occasion the King is actually the one with less power. He is the only one that can make a choice. Option &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; gets him killed and he loses the game OR Option &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; forces an awkward interaction where King joins The Hunter in doing nothing and the next days and nights pass without anything happening.

The Solution: Make it so when retribution triggers, the game does not end and the hunter  gets executed right after King&#39;s death. This way the game will end in a draw, avoiding the awkward situation which finds both players doing absolutely nothing for the next days and nights.
I understand that if you were to consider my solution from a &#39;&#39;reality&#39;&#39; point of view, it would make no sense since there would be no one there to actually execute the hunter (since the King dies by the Arrow) but this is not real life :P 

PS: This is a rare interaction but i truly believe that the outcome of this is not healthy for the flow of the game.</description>

            <p>People didn’t realize that cult would have lost like this, sure I would have said I am the cult leader while I am on stand since it’s obvious the king know who the prince is and killed him, still I keep saying I am the Psychic (The reason I got royal fingered is that king didn’t expect I get converted in last minute before I am the last cult leader) and that makes the hunter believe I am the good guy (long live deception!)</p>
<p>He almost gamethrowed so I had to execute the king together with the hunter and brainwash the hunter later that night, who is exhausted of his abilities to use against me.</p>
<p>Now the whole cult, including new converted hunter and my mercenary wins.</p>
<p>The reason I killed the king, is that I want the hunter win with my way rather than stupid king make them cult look typical villains.</p>
<p>I somehow figured that this situation with cult king and hunter will end up losing for cult and I rather convert the hunter too, so…</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t say it’s wrong, though. There are plenty of force-draw situations, not just this one, and if someone get’ this setup, they probably deserve to lose. And I don’t see you pointing out any other force-draw ones. Heck, I had one my second game, and I’m not complaining. (Stupid Mastermind.)</p>

            <p>Probably because BD’s winrates are <span class="bbcode-i">heavily</span> dependent on the King and Prince, making them very swingy - if anything goes wrong with either of those (Prince dying early, King evil, etc) BD’s winrate plummets.  And with a small sample size this means you can get a sudden swing like that.</p>

            <p>The interaction with the bad king and hunter.</p>
<p>I vote and executed the king together and converted the hunter, <strong>if the hunter did executed me then it would lead into same experience between hunter and king mentioned on this topic</strong> before and how people are discussing with this auto-win and whatnot, I’d say avoid these confrontations.</p>
<p>That in my game, the king is the true gamethrower.</p>

<p>Why though? BD certainly doesn’t deserve this one if they all died, elected an Evil King, and only left a Hunter by luck probably</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I played one game like this and I got in stand with only the Hunter and Cult King alive while I am cult leader.</p>
<p>The hunter voted pardon and I and the hunter then voted the cult king who got revealed during the execution and brainwashed the hunter the night after.</p>
<p>People got salty for no reason.</p>
<p>Why I did that is that I want my mercenary and hunter win, rather than killing the hunter outright. After all if I did accuse him first then my merc lose and the hunter lose as well, leaving only the stupid bad guy the winner even though he shares the witcon with me.</p>
<p>Hunter’s abilities were exhausted and cult king is starter, so they both have killed the powerclasses (Neutral Killing including) for me.</p>
<p>So that way, the hunter fell for my pity (and cult king thought that psychic wouldn’t be converted in last minute) and avoided this 1vs fight.</p>
<p>People who got salty or want to report me have no idea what they are awaiting if I was executed that time.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Preliminary data from an admittedly small sample size of the 26 Tournament For The Throne games from this past weekend shows that this is not the case once players know what they’re doing.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dcd9e98ecf440d5127c55e0565a199ba63f485f3.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vvJUWO0pEJRQycH30vHSz1rXOvN" width="496" height="401"></p>
<p>In addition, most all of the scum wins occurred when there was a non-BD starting King.</p>
<p>This would look even worse had some black magic not tanked the BD’s D2 winrate <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>These stats aren’t great, but they’re probably the best we have in terms of ignoring new and/or awful players</p>

            <p>I know. But for them both to die there would need to be an execution animation. However there is no 2nd person to carry out the execution.</p>

            <p>In terms of what is shown in the game currently, the retribution arrow is fired killing the king. At this moment, the game awards victory to BD, and the hunter is never actually executed or killed.</p>

            <p>And as for the possible win rate argument. Unlike in ToS, ToL has a roughly equal chance of BD wining as with Unseen or Cult and there tends to be about 3 or 4 converts on average making almost half the players playing for either side. This means there is no particular reason why the evils always need to win ties.</p>

            <p>This change would defeat the purpose of the Hunter’s retribution.</p>
<p>Beyond that, my feeling is that evils should almost never be completely, 100% certain in their victory (that’s also boring.)  It’s good to have roles that could potentially turn a winning situation into a losing situation if you’re careless of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why though? BD certainly doesn’t deserve this one if they all died, elected an Evil King, and only left a Hunter by luck probably</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s silly.  You’re assuming that the Evil King got to his position through some clever strategy (it could also have been luck, eg. converted the very night before when Cult had no idea he was noble); and you’re assuming that the Hunter survived last by luck (it could have been carefully-planned by BD over the last few days as a last-ditch effort to win.)</p>
<p>My feeling is that this function is essential to Retribution and is very good for the game, since it gives BDs another interesting goal to play to and forces the king to identify the hunter if possible.</p>
<p>More generally, providing for alternate victory conditions is a good thing.  I don’t see any benefit to removing this - I’m not at all convinced by the “deserved” or “feelbad” arguments.  You can flip it around and say that if Cult left the last person alive as the Hunter and was left with nothing left but an evil king, they have played badly and BD has outplayed them.</p>
<p>And I’m <span class="bbcode-i">more</span> sympathetic to that because it’s more interesting.  The king already has an incentive to try and end up 1v1 against anyone <span class="bbcode-i">but</span> the hunter (so, making them win against the hunter adds no new strategy or depth - because that’s already a scenario that can play out with every single other class.)  Whereas the hunter winning 1v1 against the king is unique and adds new potential lines of play for BD, while adding new risks for the evil king and Cult / Unseen.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Aside.  Curious question:  Supposing there are three people left - evil king, Hunter, NK.  The king votes up the Hunter with finger, but the NK doesn’t accuse (they do have to guilty for the Hunter to die, of course.)  Does the Hunter die?  Or do they survive because only an accuser can actually perform the execution, and there’s none left with the king’s death?  It’s a somewhat odd corner-case that is unlikely to ever occur, but I’m curious.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure this needs to be fixed. The chance of this happening is pretty rare, and I don’t think it qualifies as a problem.<br>
(BTW, I just had my first two games. First was as poss(Loss), second was as phys turned herb turned assassin.(Draw))</p>

            <p>that is what i am saying. Since there is no one left to perform the execution on the Hunter he ends up winning. Even tho this makes sense it’s not good for the game. King is being forced to do nothing for every day and night to come in order to not lose. The solution i suggested would fix the problem but it would feel weird watching a hunter die by a ghost…</p>

            <p>No not that. When someone is executed there is an animation of the first accuser killing them. Normally this would go to the second person in the case of the hunter. Since here it is just the King and the Hunter who actually preforms the execution?</p>

            <p>"I understand that if you were to consider my solution from a ‘‘reality’’ point of view, it would make no sense since there would be no one there to actually execute the hunter (since the King dies by the Arrow) but this is not real life " as i already mentioned in the post.<br>
Imo the game running correct should be <span class="hashtag">#1</span> priority and not being realistic. It is a game after all</p>
