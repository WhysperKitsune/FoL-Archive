    <title>[RESOLVED] Game update Required v0.9.4.b</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-game-update-required-v0-9-4-b/2633</link>
    <description>Hey, you can call me Blyss.

 I just bought the game, I love ToS and after watching a few videos I fell in love with this game aswell so I wanted to support you guys by buying the game and trying it out. The problem is, after logging in through my steam acc(I did all the confirmations...) the only options I had were seeing the credits, going to the options or closing the game. I thought it was a visual bug so I restarted the game but now when I try to log in through steam I get a message saying &#39;&#39;Game update Required v0.9.4.b&#39;&#39; while I have v0.9.4.a. That is fine but steam isnt finding any updates for the game that&#39;s why I&#39;m a bit confused. 

Hope you can help me!</description>

            <p>I forgot to mention that I did restart steam and it wasn’t showing up but now it is, I guess that was some real unfortunate timing hehe</p>
<p>thanks for the fast reply.</p>

            <p>Version v0.9.4b just came out.</p>
<p>Try verifying your files (rightclick on game -&gt; properties -&gt; local files -&gt; “Verify integrity of game files”) or restart steam.</p>
