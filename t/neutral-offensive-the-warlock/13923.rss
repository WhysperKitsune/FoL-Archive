    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/neutral-offensive-the-warlock/13923</link>
    <description>Neutral offensive
Goal: live to see the blue dragon fall

**Passive one: Invisibility**
Immune to visits at night when you do not leave your room

**Passive two: Corax&#39;s sight**
You learn the names and classes of everyone who attempts to visit you (even if you were immune to visits that night)

**Day ability two: Distant Whispers**
_(infinite uses)_ Your target will unknowingly have their messages hidden to everyone else for the rest of the day

**Night ability one: Infernal chains**
_(4 uses)_ occupy your target tonight and the following night

**Night ability two: Portals**
_(3 uses)_ Cause everyone visiting your target to be redirected to another of your choosing. Does not redirect occupy immune players. This does not count as a visit.</description>
