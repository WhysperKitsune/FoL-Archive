            <p>The ability to find the exact class if it has 2 passives could include an inoculated version of any class with 1 passive. This gives much more information that i assume you intended.</p>

            <p>I really like this idea and I was thinking an idea of an investigative that finds passives as well. Your idea is very well executed. My only suggestion would be changing the second check for perch to something that doesn’t make the princess redundant.</p>

            <p>The whole time I was writing this I was thinking about making it and at the same time not making princess useless. As princess, you can learn a players class type down to 2 every night and it has no cooldown. As falconer, it takes a use of a day ability and 2 nights and the ability to learn passives has only 2 uses. And as for the double passive thing for hawker, heres the list for classes with two passives:<br>
Drunk<br>
Hunter<br>
Prince<br>
Fool<br>
Inquisitor<br>
Sorcerer<br>
Possessor</p>
<p>Im still thinking about changing that ability because even though its more than just nk that’s a relatively small list of classes so.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

            <p>I like the idea, however it kinda makes princess obsolete so think about changing that. Furthermore, the unseen version’s stalk can only find NK I believe since it is the only one with two passives (i think)</p>
