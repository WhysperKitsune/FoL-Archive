    <title>2 psys in dead chat can be hard to follow</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/2-psys-in-dead-chat-can-be-hard-to-follow/33453</link>
    <description>I feel that there needs to be a way to differentiate two different psys for people who are dead. There can be conversations that go like this:

Psychic: Class and log
A Player [14]: knight
Psychic: info would be nice
Psychic: You gonna give logs?
Psychic: or you gonna be silent?

In this case, there are two psychics who are linked, and one has a silent guy whilst the other has a guy who isn&#39;t giving logs. The only way you can differentiate the two psychic, which was only done to make it easier to understand for this demonstration, is that one psy starts their messages with a capital letter and the other doesn&#39;t. Without that info, it can sound like one guy talking, and it would be handy if one had, for example, a green name rather than a blue name. Let&#39;s look at the same conversation using bolded names:

Psychic: Class and log
A Player [14]: knight
**Psychic**: info would be nice
Psychic: You gonna give logs?
**Psychic**: or you gonna be silent?

It is so much clearer to read with this, and it doesn&#39;t give you a headache when someone tells you there are two psys later.

In conclusion, I believe that the names of psys should have different colours in dead chat, or a similar way to differentiate the psys.

EDIT: Psychic is now unique, this post is now irrelevant</description>

            <p>Problem with that is that it’s not exactly easy to link that name with every single message they send. even if psychic made names, the above situation could still easily happen. and putting that name on every message is too tedious</p>

            <p>Pfft, people appear to forget to ask one simple thing:</p>
<p>“Psychic name please”<br>
“Yolobomb Alch”<br>
“coldsteel kni”<br>
“Yolobomb Alch and Coldsteel Kni?”<br>
“Yes”<br>
“yeah”</p>
