</blockquote>
<p>For truth potion Nothing to say. It was a needed change and I have no issue.</p>
<p>With the Stoneskin removal I actually do have a (small) problem. However it is not the fact that it is a night ability which does indeed solve an important issue with alchemist.</p>
<p>Rather it negates the original purpose of Crimson Potion. The solution is simply to make stoneskin a separate night ability and re-add Coagulate. The overall intent behind the change however is fine and I wouldn’t be too mad if the change stays as is.</p>

        <title>1.2.0 Patch Notes</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Navi]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thought I’d put these here since they address a lot of the issues people had with the patch:</p>
<h1>1.2.0d Patch Notes</h1>
<blockquote>
<h3>Alchemist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed Coagulate and Stoneskin Potion</li>
<li>Can now target themselves with Crimson Potion</li>
<li>Truth Potion only discovers a player’s class if they are BD, otherwise it only shows their faction. MM will show up as Sheriff for first 3 nights.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This weakens the Alchemist’s longevity significantly, meaning they will need to rely more on forming alliances with the other factions and will end up being less useful to BD since their healing ability is now required to keep them alive as well. It also means that their death immunity can be bypassed more easily or blocked with occupation.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Assassin and Cult Leader</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nightshade/Rupture day abilities reduced to 3 uses.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Reduced classes that can heal means poison/bleed becomes stronger. Makes sense with the Alchemist change. Will make early poison/bleeds much more wasteful.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Fool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Poor Fellow only disable abilities of those who accused the Fool of treason.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Will make it so Fool can only block half the players, preventing the strategy of everyone executing effectively skipping a night.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Mercenary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starts with 2 brilders.</li>
<li>Don Armor cost reduced to 1 brilder. Can now be used Day 1.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Less reliance on chance early is good. May have to increase the number of brilders required for the Mercenary to win, but I haven’t seen Mercenaries having a high win rate so far in the new patch.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Scorned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only immune to death once.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat prevents the strategy of the Scorned outing as a death immune investigator. The strategy may still prove too strong, but time will tell.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry but yeah that is probably a bad idea</p>
<p>1: This has no effect on balance when there is no Inquisitor, and as such doesn’t truly nerf Sorcerer in anything but winrate.</p>
<p>2: As soon as people realize there is a Sorcerer, the Heathens are just going to out themselves and catch the Sorcerer immediately.</p>
<p>Not to mention we don’t actually know if it’s overpowered yet.</p>

            <p>so uh they buff a class that was already pretty fun and balanced (reaper) ok cool cool</p>
<p>then for sorc they listen to the community and make it good (sorc) ok cool cool</p>
<p>and for the class thats impossible to win with and that has the lowest win-rate they give a 3time use ability used for making someone vote someone <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
<p>i know im underestimating this ability but poss will still prob be better due to pretender giving him a subtle buff when jumped into king and this ability but still im still scarred from my double poss experience from OhGodATourny</p>
<p>edit: this is probably a bad idea but how about if sorc and inq both spawn then sorc is one of the heathens guranteed? idk its not the best idea but sorc does seem kinda OP currently</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some things that confuse me, for example, are why the Inquisitor-Sorcerer nemesis thing was completely removed instead of trying to fix it?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because inquisitor was a broken concept.  It is a hardcounter, and it’s not fun to play as or against.  It also has an easy win con(they didn’t even have to do anything most of the time, and when they did win by themselves it was usually a yolo kill early on).  And people believe that sorcerer needed a hardcounter because of its easy win condition(even though sorc did not)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why was Scorned changed so drastically? It had some minor problems like both targets dying N1, or an N1 frame on a Mystic always backfiring in Unseen games, but I didn’t know anyone wanted it completely reworked.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this.  Fool and sorcerer were balanced, aside from a few minor changes.</p>

<p>With scorned, all they needed to do was let me keep trollbox after I win, and I’d be perfectly ok. But I think they changed it since it’s the old “Your Exe” style, and dumb bd being confused.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Scorned shouldn’t keep TB after they win.  I’ll sometimes claimed scorned as scum after an execution.</p>

<p>And the fact that they side with BD. I think they should change it a bit, since it feels like another BD role.</p>

<p>Agreed, stalk should be replaced with mind warp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be fair, it might’ve worked better if Sorc didn’t basically hard counter Inq. Inq’s only option was to stab randomly since their detection method was worthless. I’d have liked to them try the suggestion on the forum (make it easy for sorc to hide from BD but impossible to hide from Inq) but I also like this new stuff a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Frames and tailors are the only “hard” counters that I’m ok with.  Investigations would be overpowered if they were infallible.  Their only weakness would be being hard to confirm.</p>

<p>I don’t really know why people were asking for more true neutral neuts tbh. Some neuts will always benefit one side, doesn’t mean they aren’t neutral.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because they’re called neutral for a reason.  And I find true neuts more fun to play as since you aren’t restricted to a single side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For some of them it makes sense. Mercenary for example doesn’t HAVE to be as BD sided as it was (although it definitely could be). However Sorcerer and Fool are NE for a reason</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>NEs are fine, but there shouldn’t be BD-sided neuts(at least not like the old merc was).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t even care if neutrals want to help BD, but they shouldn’t be risk free in doing so. Why do they have death immunity? Using pro - BD abilities like nightstalk or that investigative potion should remove your night immunity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Investigative abilities aren’t always pro-BD.  Alch is fine now, it would be too hard to survive without some self-survival ability.</p>
