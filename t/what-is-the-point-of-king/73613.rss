    <title>What is the point of king?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-is-the-point-of-king/73613</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s be honest mastermind will only use little bird on king basically driving the whisper meta into the ground, but what is the point of king now? Like it or not, before the update king was used to whisper claims at to give leads and suspicions  basically being the leader or &quot;king&quot;, but now with the whisper meta driven into the ground what&#39;s the point. So what&#39;s he now? A slightly better alchemist truth potion? Well what&#39;s king going to do just randomly pick a player,  since he isn&#39;t given logs or anything that may make him check someone?  Btw this is the complete opposite in cult games if cult don&#39;t spawn with apostle then King is extremely op.</description>

            <p>the question though, is what is the definition of failure? I think that in many ways, letting only unseen and a good king have all the claims might still be better than letting everyone have claims. With a perfect king, it is obviously true. Even with an imperfect king, it can still be better than giving the nk claims as well or, even worse, having the bd stand around doing nothing</p>

            <p>I find the point of the king is to be a leader for the BD. comparing it to the town of salem meta, where jailor outs himself day 1. People need a leader to keep track of everything or else things can fall apart.</p>

            <p>Let’s be honest mastermind will only use little bird on king basically driving the whisper meta into the ground, but what is the point of king now? Like it or not, before the update king was used to whisper claims at to give leads and suspicions  basically being the leader or “king”, but now with the whisper meta driven into the ground what’s the point. So what’s he now? A slightly better alchemist truth potion? Well what’s king going to do just randomly pick a player,  since he isn’t given logs or anything that may make him check someone?  Btw this is the complete opposite in cult games if cult don’t spawn with apostle then King is extremely op.</p>
