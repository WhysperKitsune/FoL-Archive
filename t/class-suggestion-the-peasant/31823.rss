    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Peasant</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-peasant/31823</link>
    <description>Okay so I realized this while playing Town of Salem; we don&#39;t have a Neutral Amnesiac class. I know that it could make this a bit suspicious but it would be very interesting and would help buff the topic of &quot;NEUTS IN&quot; a bit more.

If anyone else has names for this class (because Amnesiac is directly from Town of Salem) please feel free to chip in. 

Lore: The Peasant was a young man, straight out of the countryside, who came to the city to find his true life&#39;s work. What would he do to find his calling?

[quote]
**The Peasant**

Unique Neutral Special

Goal: Choose a Class to Become and fulfill the Goal of that Class.


*Passives*

**Pitchfork Fury:**
You will kill your accuser if executed.

*Abilities*

**Hide:** (Night) (3)
(Identical to the Fool&#39;s ability)

**New Identity:** (Day) (Unlimited)
Choose a dead class and become it starting from the following night. It works similar to the Mastermind&#39;s Dirty Work ability. Doing this changes all passives and abilities to the chosen class.

Parameters: 
- If the target was defiled then you cannot become them. 
- You cannot become a unique class that is currently alive. 
- You cannot make the Cult/Unseen go above its member limit. 
- You cannot become a class that has already won unless it is fool. 
- You cannot become a Scorned who suicided.
- If you become Scorned you will have the same targets as the dead Scorned. 
- If you become a Mercenary you will get to choose a target, but you cannot get a second.
- You may become the Mastermind if he dies after Day 4.
- You cannot become the King. EVER.
[/quote]

And here, please choose possible passives for the Peasant. You can select as many as you want, but only one or two will be chosen that will most fit for the Peasant. 

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=3 public=true]
* Pitchfork Fury (If executed, you will kill your first accuser.)
* Poor Man (If executed, the court will not be able to vote the next night.)
* Gravedigger (You may hear the dead at night. You cannot speak to them.)
[/poll]

<p>But if it wasn’t there this would suffer from the same issue as knight.  There’s no way to confirm themselves so they would be frequently executed.  And the neuts out mentality that some players have is annoying, it’s not uncommon for someone to be executed just because they’re a neut.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Coming back just for this quote.</p>
<p>The solution to stop knight claims = auto execute is not to make there be less reason to execute and MORE classes that can be claimable.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing about a “neuts out” mentality. Neutrals are not, and never are, BD. No where on their class list does it say “live until BD wins” or the likes. Merc is pretty darn close, but even she can win with NK. Neutrals should never be able to openly claim and just be removed of scrutiny. If you remember, we had the situation for a while with Inquisitor who was literally immune to all forms of death.</p>
<p>Now this class can’t really do this with Prince still alive, but I have to ask you: what would this class add? Being able to randomly decide faction has already been an annoying topic for players with Alchemist. And the play to stop alchemists is to execute them, should you so choose. Having an inherent “you execute me, you die” mechanic only serves to punish BD for making correct plays. If this class has a possibility of actively hurting your team, execution should be possible. With Fool, all it can do is vote against BD. But this class can become new scum classes.</p>
<p>tl;dr A class that can decide factions doesn’t deserve a “you can’t execute me” passive. If the class can switch sides and BD find them out, they deserve to punish that class if they so choose.</p>

            <p>Personally I’d swap Hide with a passive ability that grants him night immunity for the first 3 or so nights or until the night after he chooses a class, whichever comes first. Good use of Hide will allow him to lay low and survive until he gets to the point where he could easily pick the winning team, and that’d make for boring and frustrating games in general.</p>
<p>For the new identity mechanics, I’d say the Peasant should be able to select unique classes as long as he isn’t able to select the Prince as otherwise he’d be way too BD-sided, nor should he be able to pick Inquisitor as that class’ win condition would be extremely easy for a late-comer. Additionally, if he selects a non-original Assassin or CL however he should become their previous Unseen/Cult classes.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I still like the idea of having more classes that punish “just in case” execution. One of the worsr things for BD should be to lose someone and yet most players think it’s okay to exe any claim that’s not both confirmed and useful, even if it’s BD. So if that’s the fate of BD, neutrals are just always out. So more neutrals that punish BD for lynching is definitely something I support.</p>

            <p>As already stated, a class like this just kind of sucks. With no limit to how long he has to wait, he can just sit on his hands and wait until the end to pick.</p>
<p>Even then, he has a descent amount of restrictions, that it would be hard for him to properly join certain factions. Imagine if only cult leaders, the prince, Hunter, and possessor body jumps die early. Then the character has nothing to go to. Thus is, admittedly, a more rare occurrence, but is possible and can just screw over any chance they have of playing the game.</p>
<p>Finally, having a “if you hang me, you get punished” character is silly. Imagine BD find him out, and realize he isn’t changed. They can force the issue and tell him to be BD the next night. If he doesn’t go through, barring prince, there isn’t much they can do to him, since they lose a member executing him.

            <p>IMO a neut of this style sucked in town of salem, and will suck here for more or less the same reason.</p>
<p>The problem with “chose your side”, is naturally the smart play is to “chose the side that already is advantaged”. So instead of being the wild card that might turn the tide when people least expect it, it is instead going to be automatically become the final nail in the coffin for the side that’s already struggling.</p>
<p>Also can’t say I like the idea of a new “punish bd for executing a non bd” added to the list. One is already too many.</p>

<p><strong>The Peasant</strong></p>
<p>Unique Neutral Special</p>
<p>Goal: Choose a Class to Become and fulfill the Goal of that Class.</p>
<p><em>Passives</em></p>
<p><strong>Pitchfork Fury:</strong><br>
You will kill your accuser if executed.</p>
<p><em>Abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Hide:</strong> (Night) (3)<br>
(Identical to the Fool’s ability)</p>
<p><strong>New Identity:</strong> (Night) (oo)<br>
Choose a dead class and become it starting from the following night. It works similar to the Mastermind’s Dirty Work ability. Doing this changes all passives and abilities to the chosen class.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the target was defiled then you cannot become them.</li>
<li>You cannot become a unique class.</li>
<li>You cannot become a class that has already won unless it is fool.</li>
<li>You cannot become a Scorned who suicided.</li>
<li>If you become Scorned you will have the same targets as the dead Scorned.</li>
<li>You can become a Sellsword.</li>
<li>You may become the Mastermind if he dies after Day 4.</li>
<li>If you select a dead Cult Leader, you can choose to become a Cult Underling the next day.</li>
<li>You cannot become the King. EVER.</li>

            <p>I don’t know about Alert, the whole point of Peasant isn’t to kill people and play aggressive. It’s to be passive until you choose a side and play the part you have now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, didn’t realize this.  Though you don’t really need to be specific since you already said “You cannot become an unique class that is currently alive”.  MM is an unique class, so it also applies there.</p>
<p>Also, here’s an idea for another night ability:<br>
Alert(2 uses): Kill everyone who visits you.  You will death and occupation immune tonight.</p>

            <p>As far as the passive suggestions, Pitchfork Fury would be the best one.<br>
Regarding the assassin part of the parameters, you should be able to become an assassin only in the absence of one. You should change that.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I totally understand his point here and I don’t think you did. Assassin, MM and Cult Leader are unique classes, so they fit the parameter of only becoming a unique class if no other player alive has it. So you could just take out the Assassin and Cult Leader parameter. The MM one, however, needs to stay.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful new year, man! I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other a lot around here! <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
