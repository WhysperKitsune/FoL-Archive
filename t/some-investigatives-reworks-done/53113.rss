&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Inner Soul: discover a player&#39;s exact class type, 1 use
&gt; Changes:
&gt; 1. Replaced Princess&#39;s wilo-wisp ability with a new unconfrimable ability making classes like seeker, MM, and duchess claim princess without having to confirm using wilo-wisp
[/details]

&gt; 
&gt; Changes: 
&gt; 1. Made Pally and Sheriff 1 class because the player does not need to auto know which faction their fighting plus it will make a Scorned win a lot easier
&gt; 2. Gave it a nerfed version of old Surveillance
[/details]


[details=&quot;Sleuth&quot;]
&gt; [color=purple]The Sleuth, Unseen, Investigative[/color] :mag_right:

&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Stop Watching Me: same as distract but it&#39;s for 50 seconds (if it is too OP I can change it and if it is to UP I can change it too)
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Follow: same
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Watch Carefully: same as peek except it gets classes not factions
&gt;
&gt;Changes:
&gt; 1. Gave it a distract ability since I think that&#39;s useful and fitting for it
&gt; 2. Gave it the passive so it can be a buff and it is fitting
[/details]


[details=&quot;Seeker (done) criticize it now &quot;]
&gt; [color=red] The Seeker, Cult, Investigative [/color]:mag_right:

<p>do you think the ability called surveillance that I gave detective is to OP?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think so, the only problem is it is a slightly better version of the CW’s ability (notification plus without the occupy immune drawback). But as an ability itself it seems fairly reasonable, especially in exchange for not checking someone that night</p>

<p>Finding a killer class and then checking faction and then telling your unseen and trying to not get caught or die takes too long and is too hard. 3/4 killer classes are BD anyway, and you can usually deduce if it’s not or some BD class based on how talkative they are or how much they whisper the king. I would rather have the current duchess that can deceive and hide the unseen tbh. More unseen classes need to be able to hide probably.

</aside>
<p>well I was just giving an example you could find a support/offensive/investigative/social class and do that too, also the sleuth having a hide ability seems more fitting.</p>

<p>Not really, Well this surveillance is more like smite except it doesn’t kill could make it 2 uses, it also isn’t slightly nerfed it’s a lot more nerfed, the old one confirmed you and other players</p>

<p>lol I kinda got a bit sleepy what I meant to say is it’s exactly like probe except name changed, you could make it visit one unseen only</p>

<li>
<p>If you’re duchess finding out a player’s faction is useless since you MIGHT find nk or a fool or seomthing but it’s more likely to be BD(like 90% of the time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dark Wisp is actually useful… you can hide yourself and the other unseen from investigatives. What do you mean it’s useless??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Framed targets already show up as K/O so this entire thing was a nerf to princess</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detective is too OP in cult games tbh and surveillance is already really powerful and is unnecessary. The investigative do not need a way to protect themselves or others, as this would give MM/CL a really hard time(even though it is slightly nerfed)</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m kinda bad at writing so here’s the shortened version of things: These changes are a giant nerf and completely unnecessary. I would not approve of these changes(merging the paladin and sheriff might still be considered).</p>
