    <title>CW is still boring</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cw-is-still-boring/10536</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve hated all CW incarnations thus far. I feel the class lacks a theme, but mostly, it lacks feedback. When a physician/alch heals someone, they know they did.

As a CW, you never know whether your actions had any effect. So you&#39;re just randomly choosing people to protect, because you can&#39;t even stay on a proven target. No matter how strong a class is, without feeback, people will always feel powerless.</description>

            <p>Did people get notified about visiting a different target other than their original? I thought Scorned swap was silent. I’m almost sure it was.</p>

            <p>When did they remove Bait and Switch from the Scorned? I have more than once framed my target in this way when I know who the Paly/Sheriff is going to target at night.</p>
<p>They didn’t even replace it with another night ability. What a bummer. Was Scorned win rate too high?</p>

            <p>Transporting creates chaos and fits a Neutral class aiming to disrupt the BD more than a BD class. Obviously in higher levels this is not true but in the chaotic ToL a BD transporter would only hinder them.</p>

            <p>I’d so much rather them introduce a neutral class with a transport ability. Transport always causes chaos in uncoordinated game (ie every single ToL game) and would far more suit a Neutral role trying to see BD fall imo.</p>

            <p>I think it’s less to do with being told that they did something and more <em>feeling</em> like they did something.</p>
<p>I also feel like thematically the class has been lacking; Court Wizard is a glorified guard right now. Ice ward essentially does the same thing a Mercenary does minus the perks of having a person knowing they were protected. The current version is definitely an improvement on the previous versions though.</p>
<p>There usually are enough supporting classes in games to the point where the CW isn’t recognized or valued. His recharge ability would probably work better on a neutral class like Alchemist (being a potion of rejuvenation rather than a spell of course).</p>
<p>Maybe give him the ability to teleport other players and swap their locations during the night? He is far too passive in his current state and needs a proactive and high reward ability.</p>
