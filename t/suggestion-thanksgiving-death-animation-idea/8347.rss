    <title>[Suggestion] Thanksgiving death animation idea</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-thanksgiving-death-animation-idea/8347</link>
    <description>Hey, so I was reading the forum idly while thinking, when I realized the next major holiday coming up was Thanksgiving. What do you think of when you hear the word _Thanksgiving_? **Turkey!**
How about a death animation in which you throw a rune down, turning your victim into a nicely cooked turkey dinner? 

Just thought it&#39;d be cool, and there&#39;s no harm in posting, haha.</description>
