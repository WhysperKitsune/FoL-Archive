    <description>Since Allies is no longer a thing on the game, King is now a super boring class to play. You cant do nothing but wait for a good lead.

**You cant prove yourself**, You cant investigate, And you cant make the game keep going faster.

Allies made the game more dynamic, because King was REALLY a Court Leader. Now he has to wait good leads/claims or **just put random people up for logs.**

Lets also talk about **Order.**

Order is a super **boring ability to play against,** lets imagine There is 4 people left in the game. 3 blue dragon members (For example, a Butler, A hunter and a Drunk) and there is Evil King.

Evil King can just use order 4 nights in a row and force the draw.

Its just extremely boring.

Since i dont like to just whine, I bring to you some solutions to this problem, there is some ideas:

**A- Make Allies not available until Day 3:**

This would give evil some time to not get exposed by Allies, since they have more opportunities to fake his logs

**B- Make Allies only have 3 charges**

Probably getting 4 people´s factions is super powerful, you can just nerf it to 3 and it will be fine.

**C- Make Allies give you information in a different way**

What if instead of giving you the Faction, it gives you if he can **Target the King with abilities** or not. This is a nerfed version of Allies, but it can be more useful than Order.


Well hope this helps since **a lot of Kings are being Clueless on what to do right now** and it gets boring to wait Leads from **A king who cant investigate anymore.**

**Good Night.**</description>

            <p>Allies was a problem because the king is auto-confirmed as a king.  (And evil kings never, ever, ever lied about finding someone to be BD or neut.  I never saw it happen even once.)</p>
<p>As a result, when you’re called out by the king as evil or neutral, you have no options.  You just die.</p>
<p>Games like that are boring for everyone.  There’s no thinking or depth, no room to accuse the king of being a Scorned or to try and post a good enough will to buy yourself some time - as Court, you just always do what the king says, and as an evil, you just die if Allies is pointed at you by a good / neutral king.</p>
<p>Additionally, the extreme power of allies made the random pick of whether the starting king is good or evil far too impactful.  If the starting king is evil, BD loses access to Allies no matter what (even catching him immediately won’t get it back), and with Allies being so powerful, that was too much of a luck-based swing.</p>

<p>hahahahahahhahahahha!! Other than the fact it killed the early game, caused the BD to go braindead at times (which is frankly true sometimes), created an unopposed check that you can’t defend against, and on top of all that it shouldn’t have been added, but I can see why they did add oit</p>

<p>In addition to what Vandalay has already said, the issue isn’t “King checked me, boo hoo, so unfair”. The issue is that pretty much every single Invest!King game starts the exact same way, and it’s just… boring.</p>
<p>Plus, it has pretty much served to make people complacent in-game, so there’s not a lot of reasoning for more casual players to try and improve. Definitely not healthy.</p>

            <p>King doesn’t need allies he just need a social skill for claims.</p>
<p>For example: king visit 4 with his guards, now the king can talk with 4 like a psychic, at the end he can decide to<br>
1.kill 4 (1 use),<br>
2. guard 4(6 use)</p>
<p>Its not like prince because 4 can still get healed, and king can only kill once. but it make the king more about his social understanding of the game.</p>

            <p>you mean sus/not sus in general? Ah ok. That would be better than the last Allies, at least.<br>

            <p>They also explicitely stated that there were some classes that made the game swingy.<br>
Guess what… if BD wins with Good King 70% of the time, with Neutral King 60% of the time, and with Evil King 20%… it is balanced in total.<br>
Plus… balance could have been changed without patches, as people become more experienced and strategies change.</p>

<p>Where are you seeing this? Just curious.</p>
<p>I don’t really see a problem with Allies being changed a little. I do have a problem with the current implementation. In my opinion it should have 3 charges and go back to giving feedback in the form of “sus/not sus”.</p>

</aside>
<p>They were, but that’s also right now they are laying the groundwork for new players getting their own mode… when you remove new players from the equasion… bd winrates will more than double. Just look at town of salem which has ranked and ranked practice modes… at least for a while the winrates were about 65% mafia winrate in ranked practice… While they were 85% town winrate in mid elo ranked.</p>

            <p>But you are right about BD killing King, that needs a solution. But the right solution is not <em>Buff the King so that he makes his faction win 80% of the time</em><br>
The right solution is <em>Nerf the King and make its murder by its own faction heavily penalized.</em></p>

            <p>ok off the bat</p>
<p>first off BD is on a team… dying isn’t an auto loss for BD. So assasanate is in a whole other category than an investigation that can find neutrals.</p>
<p>Next sheriff/pali checks. You at least have the ability to fight back and convince people that the sheriff isn’t a sheriff. also they don’t effect classes that automatically LOSE by getting executed (IE alcs, NKs etc… they have no team to root for when they die).</p>
<p>observer peak, yeah ok I’ll agree on that one… which is why observer isn’t a guaranteed class and it only gets 2 peaks, that are generally best served for late game. Versus king that’s auto executed if it doesn’t use the checks constantly for the first 4 days.</p>
<p>the king didn’t always get those checks… way back king didn’t have them… and IMO it was a much better game for it. after it was added BD just started shutting their brains off, waiting on the king to either solve all their problems. or they execute him and finally start trying to solve their own problems when the king hasn’t on day 5.</p>

            <p>I keep seeing people saying things like “Allies is fundamentally flawed”, “Allies is unfair” etc…why? How is Allies any more unfair than Assassin’s Assassinate? Or Sheriff/Pally checks? Or Observer peek?</p>
<p>I have yet to see anybody properly justify their hate for Allies.</p>
<p>What was so wrong with Allies that it calls for the devs to kill the King as a class in terms of gameplay impact and fun factor? Right now it’s almost always correct to not trust the king at all and kill him as soon as you can, in case he is evil. There’s no way of verifying if he’s BD or not and Evil kings will kill BD.</p>
<p>Revert the patch tbh.</p>

            <p>I actually feel that King is about right.  Orders might need some tweaking, but the King’s job is to gather info and lead now, not go out and do it all himself and get killed when he doesn’t.</p>
<p>It’s rarely boring, half the time you’re juggling 5-6 whispers and tons of info.  Sorting it all out before the day ends is pretty stressful most of the time.</p>

            <p>Of course not. Guards are not the problem here. I made this post because Order is not giving nothing to the King and needs to be checked. The game for the King is now much more BORING</p>

            <p>Well if the target was attacked he knows he was guarded so that’s not an issue really.</p>

<p>Also Phys is fun and only has 1 job, thats right, but thats because the Healing job gives you constant feedback and information no one will know before you. This is not happening with Actual King.</p>

<p>It would solve this problem.</p>

            <p>It is still a not-so-good feedback since target dont even knows if King guarded him and the target can easily lie and say “Yes”.</p>

            <p>Order is fine</p>
<p>Just do a few tweaks to other abilities, drop guards back down, and boom imo</p>
<p>Still, let’s all try this one first lol</p>

            <p>Not what I meant. I mean shouldn’t you be asking for it to tell you if the target was attacked?</p>

            <p>Guards no longer gives you feedback, Only if you use them on yourself and get attacked.</p>
<p>Now people (If no attacks) will never know if Guards are being used on them. So its not that good for feedback.</p>
