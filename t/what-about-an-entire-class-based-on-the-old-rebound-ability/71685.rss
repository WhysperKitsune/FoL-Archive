    <title>What about an entire class based on the old Rebound ability?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-about-an-entire-class-based-on-the-old-rebound-ability/71685</link>
    <description>Remember old Mercenary could attack someone who voted against his contract?

What if there were some class that was fueled not only by getting accused and voted against, but also by being attacked, poisoned, and bled?  

If he were an NK he could gain &quot;rage&quot; points to spend on cool abilities, but this concept could also be applied to a Blue Dragon and converted class.</description>

            <p>I don’t think it’s balanced for a BD class, seems like it would make more sense for a reworked Mercenary.</p>

            <p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-the-berserker-nk/70527">Like this?</a></p>
<p>A NK that got more powerful the more he was trialed would be counter-intuitive, though. The entire point of trials and executions is to be BD’s primary method of removing evils, so that’s just penalizing good play.</p>
