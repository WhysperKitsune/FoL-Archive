<p>How about he is able to do nothing after he wins kind of like how scorned/inq works or he can just disappear after he wins</p>

</aside>
<p>Well… as I mentioned, I already hate how the scorned/inq work. I mean I do give some credit as that does leave scorned as a possible scum-claim. Inq obviously fails at it due to people generally knowing if there’s a sorc in the game (and nobody is dumb enough to believe that a real inq killed the sorc in the overused possesor fake, tip… real inqs don’t kill the sorc, you know there’s an inq when the BD hangs the sorc).</p>

            <p>Tbh I think Inq is stupid anyways.</p>
<p>This goal is also very arbitrary, and it doesn’t give anything the Alchemist doesn’t already provide.</p>

            <p>I may be a minority, but I don’t like the existance of completed wincon classes. I consider both scorned and inq as highly problematic in that regard (they exist as swing votes that are entirely based on their own bias and whims, there’s no means to sway them by giving them better chances to survive or accomplish their goal because there’s nothing left in the game for them that matters.</p>
<p>Nothings more disheartening than losing a game as BD because 2 BD, 1 scorned 1 possesor is a deadlock and this particular scorned believes the NK is hard and deserves the win, then losing the next game as possesor in a nearly identical situation, with the only difference that this scorneds personality wants the most people to win so he sided with BD.</p>
<p>I personally won’t back any classes that win early and stick around in the game. Personally I’m massively in favor of a removal of inq if it isn’t massively reworked, and needless to say completely opposed to making the problem worse by adding more early win classes.</p>
