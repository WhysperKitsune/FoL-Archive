The Balancer(Neutral Unique Special)

**Converted class**:The Imbalanced(Unseen Special)/The Seeker(Cult Investigative)

**Passive 1**:The Other King:If you become King, you will be of the opposite faction of the first King.
(Good King-&gt;Cult/Unseen King, Cult/Unseen King-&gt;Good King)
**Passive 2**: Forged Ancestry:You may step up as King as if you had Royal Blood.
**Night Ability 1**:Balance of mind(2 uses) Resist any attempt to convert you. If you successfully resisted an attempt to convert you, then you are conversion immune for the rest of the time.
**Night Ability 2:** Remove Imbalance(infinite Uses):Disable Royal Blood on your target for two days and nights.
**Day Abilitiy 1**:Balance of body(1 use) Remove poison or bleeding from yourself.
**Day Ability 2:** Knowledge of Imbalance(2 uses):You will know which faction currently has more votes than any other faction.

**Objective:** The starting King loses the game.

Lore: Your sect has been notified that the King of Castle Adiart may have taken sides with a faction. You are tasked to find out if that is true, and if it is true you are tasked to punish the King and its faction. Should it not be true you are tasked with helping the King or at least another neutral minded person.

Converts into:

The Imbalanced(Unseen Special) 

**1.Passive 1**: Forged Ancestry:You may step up as King as if you had Royal Blood.
**2.Day Ability 1:** Knowledge of Imbalance(1 use):You will know which faction currently has more votes than any other faction.
**3.Day Ability 2:** Throw off Balance(1 use): Disable any Day Abilities of your target today.
**4.Night ability 1:** Imbalanced Body(1 use)Remove poison and Bleeding and be immune to poison and bleeding this night, but any healing attempt on you this night will kill you instead.
**5.Night Ability 2:** Establish Imbalance(Infinite uses): Your target has Forged Ancestry for the next two days and nights. They will be informed about this when the King dies.

Now, the idea behind this is simple: The faction of the initial King is unknown.
This role mitigates the advantage of the King faction. This role is very interesting to play: You do not know your true goal as long as the first King is alive. You have to guess and wait. On the other hand, as long as you are not converted, you might have a manageable goal: You just must make the first King&#39;s faction lose...
For both Blue Dragon and Unseen/Cult, it is important to remember that this class is only fully on their side if 1.the King was on an opposing faction and 2. the Balanced was made King. Otherwise, it is free to give the win to the Neutral Killers. If Cult/Unseen/Blue Dragon are wiped out, and the opposing faction is alive, then that might be its only win chance.
The Forged Ancestry is different to Royal Blood... it does not stick upon conversion!</description>

            <p>Yeah thats one of the themes of the class rope. They don’t know their exact goal until the King dies. But if the King is Neutral, then they don’t want that…<br>
You can use Knowledge of Balance to <em>try to</em> determine what the King could be. That is why I added it.</p>

            <p>the problem is the balance keeper wouldn’t know what their goal is. If they did (if king is evil) they can just call him out on it.</p>
<p>King matters a lot in 8p games, but 16p? Not that much.</p>

            <p>It gives you info…<br>
Examples:<br>
1.MM dead. Assassin and some other Unseen alive. King alive.2 killers dead. 3 BD must be alive<br>
3 BD 2 Unseen you(don’t count) and the King.<br>
Now you suddenly get: Balance.<br>
3 BD and 3 unseen including King do not give you Balance.<br>
Nor do 4 BD including King and 2 Unseen<br>
-&gt;King is Neutral, and its survival your last hope for a win.<br>
And what if you get Imbalance? Well, it would be good for you to get rid of your enemy the King.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Its the beginning.3 kills night 1, all on BD.<br>
3 people are dead, 13 remaining.<br>
1 of them is the Balanced<br>
12 remaining(for the calculation)<br>
2 are probably Neutral killers.(if the prince didnt miskill)<br>
2-4 are Unseen/Cult<br>
6-8 are Blue Dragon.<br>
Now you suddenly get a message that there is balance.<br>
That means: Unseen/cult converted… and the King is evil or Neutral.<br>
<span class="mention">@JammySplodge</span> I’ve talked with Rope quite a bit, but you had unspecified issues earlier. Did I repair these potential issues or did I worsen them… can you please help me a bit?</li>

<p>so if there is more blue dragon or the cult/unseen have equal to blue dragon? in other words, there is always an imbalance?</p>

            <p>It is now:<br>
1.Passive:Mental Disorder: You will not meet with the Unseen, and will not replace the Assassin, but you do not count against the conversion limit either. You will turn into Mastermind if all other Unseen die.<br>
which should be clear.</p>
<p>… and the way it is currently worded, yes, you could win with the neutral King. Do you think that winning with the neutral King and another faction is a problem?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neutral King= wins if another neutral wins<br>
Its presence has a reason, and that is to lessen the advantage of the Faction with the original King.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think this is a good way to fix this imbalance, as 8 player games are almost entirely decided on the king’s alignment; that being said, if the king is neutral, can you meet the win condition by having the neutral king win?[quote=“Unknown, post:15, topic:2126”]<br>
And about replacing the Mastermind: Please remember that all Unseen except you must die.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I did not realize this; please make this clearer in the original post, as this fixes the class a great deal.</p>
