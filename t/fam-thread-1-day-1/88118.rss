# [color=ffc60a]Welcome to FoL&#39;s Annual Mash![/color]

Hosted by @Chloe, @DatBird, @Geyde, @Arete, and @osieorb18 

Host account: @FoLAnnualMash 

Big thanks to Marl and Firekitten for their moral support.
&lt;/div&gt;

## [color=ffe296]Rules[/color]
Follow the [Global Forum Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244) as well as the [Forum Game Rules](https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/official-forum-game-rules/78926)

Flavorclaiming is not allowed. More information can be found farther down.
## [color=ffe296]What is FAM?[/color]
All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; *nobody will be vanilla.* 

This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!

There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.

## [color=ffe296]Voting[/color]

* Both majority and plurality are in effect. 

* All votes must be in the form of `**/vote [player]**` to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form `**/unvote**`. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.
* You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.
* Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.
* MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.

## [color=ffe296]Gameplay[/color]
* Days are 36 hours and nights are 12 hours. In the instance the day ends early due to majority, the Night phase will be extended to begin at a consistent time. 

* Deadline to submit Night actions is 2 hours before Night ends.

* Deadline to submit Day actions is 1 hour before Day ends, unless specified otherwise.

* Barring the potential existence of janitors, flips will always be true. Rolecards will not be fake. Conversion does not exist. Game-ending jesters do not exist.
* Other than the above, everything is on the table (:

* We will be following [Natural Action Resolution](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution). If there are any major issues with NAR, [Reasonable Action Resolution](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution) may be utilized. (We  don&#39;t expect this to occur)

* Should the main thread reach 9k posts, a new thread will be created. 
## [color=ffe296]ITAs[/color]
* Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of `**/ITA [player]**` and pinging the host account: @FoLAnnualMash  

* ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%
* Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded
* If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be &#39;Hit! Nobody died.&#39; Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or &#39;Miss!&#39;

* ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.

## [color=ffe296]Rolecards and Flavor[/color]
### Example Rolecard

&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
&gt; &lt;img src=&#39;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788195400930689056/846952271370649640/rizahair2_-_Copy.png&#39;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Chloe**
&gt; *&#39;its not fucking o???&#39;*
&gt; [color=green]**Town Idiot**[/color]
&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Expert of Forum Mofoa:** All instances of the letter *i* that you post in the thread must be replaced with the letter *o*. To bypass this restriction, you may post freely as long as you include an image of a cat within your post.  
&gt;
&gt; *Eliminate the Mafia and all other possible threats to the Town.*

The user is **Chloe**, the role name is [color=green]**Town Idiot**[/color], and the flavor is *&#39;it&#39;s not fucking o???&#39;* as well as &#39;Expert of Forum Mofoa.&#39;
&lt;div align=center&gt;

# &lt;mark&gt;[color=darkred]**DO NOT FLAVORCLAIM OR PARAPHRASE FLAVOR. YOU MAY ONLY CLAIM YOUR USER AND ROLE**[/color]&lt;/mark&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Do not claim or paraphrase any quotes or flavor within your rolecard. Do not claim the name of your abilities or passives. You may paraphrase what your passives or abilities *do*, but may not repeat the text word-for-word.**

The alignment of any User will be entirely random. Attempting to solve the game based on flavor is useless.

### Standard Win Conditions
[color=green]**Town**[/color] is the uninformed majority. Their win condition is:
*Eliminate the Mafia and all other possible threats to the Town.*

[color=red]**Mafia**[/color] is the informed minority. Their win condition is:
*You win the game if no more threats to the Mafia exist or nothing can prevent that from happening.*

Other win conditions may or may not exist.

<p>Please vote in your rolecard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to create an ITA thread, similar to the voting thread, to aid in ITA processing? This will be implemented if more than 50 percent of living players vote in favor of it.</li>
<li>Would you like to switch to 12/12 or 24/24 phases after this night, or stay at 36/12? Please vote for all options you are okay with. If the game switches to 24/24, both phase changes will happen at the current SoD time. This will only happen if at least 75 percent of players vote in favor of it.</li>
<li>Do you want a new main thread at the start of Day 2, or to wait until this thread reaches 9000 posts? A new main thread will be created immediately if more than 50 percent of <em>voters</em> vote in favor of it.</li>
