    <title>Reaper still feels a bit weak</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaper-still-feels-a-bit-weak/28189</link>
    <description>Maybe toss him a bone and let him hear the dead?

He is an undead monster or something anyway.  As it is he doesn&#39;t have the escapes of the Possessor or the help of Evil like the Sorc.  Also he gets killed/outted by psychics fairly well since he can&#39;t claim many things without the dead telling on him.

Just spit-balling.  Possessor feels good and Sorc seems able to win now, but Reaper still feels like the hardest win in the game to me.</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It really does make sense. Occupation Immunity is ment to prevent someone from tampering with your Ability (note: The ability itself not the results). A redirect qualifys as that just as much as an Occupy if not more so.</p>
<p>Personally they should just rename Occupy immunity to something that makes it more clear like Tampering Immunity or make it a keyword like how night Immunity refers to being killed. Possablely call it “focused” so instead of saying “Occupy immune” it would say “You are focused”</p>

            <p>Hearing the dead would barely do anything.  Instead, Gather darkness should make it so reap can’t fail instead of just bypassing night immunity.  Reap could also leave an empty body until that player is killed again instead of only for 1 night.</p>

</aside>
<p>I disagree with this.  Puppet strings should happen instead of the target’s ability, and redirection and occupation immunity shouldn’t be the same thing(it doesn’t make sense, and there are a lot of classes which are occupation immune).  Sorcerer just needs to have inquisitor removed or completely reworked so that it isn’t a hardcounter and have circle of death be usable at any time</p>

<p>That’s too specific, especially for a neutral killing.  Abilities shouldn’t only affect one class.</p>
