    <title>[Co-designer seeking] [Discussion] [SFM] MCU FM</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/co-designer-seeking-discussion-sfm-mcu-fm/82359</link>
    <description>I have decided to go ahead and make my MCU mash idea.  It will be a mash based around the Marvel Cinematic Universe and heavily foucsed on Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame (although there may be characters from other MCU movies).  I have a lot of ideas, but as this is my first time designing a setup I am looking for someone to help me out.  I would want help with designing the setup/balance/running the game.  I already have a lot of ideas to go off of.  I plan to make it a high power rolemadness setup similar to LotR.

I don&#39;t have a timeline that I&#39;m shooting for yet so I&#39;m in no rush to make it.  If you&#39;d be interested in helping out just let me know.  Thanks!</description>
