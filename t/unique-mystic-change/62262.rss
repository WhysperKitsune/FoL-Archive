    <title>Unique Mystic Change</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/unique-mystic-change/62262</link>
    <description>It&#39;s now confirmed that Casual Mode is being put into custom games only, and from what I could assume, Mystic became un-Unique so that there would be multiple BD Socials in Casual Mode.

However, to balance the strength of Mystic, I think that it should become Unique again.

Reasons are that 
1. Mystic is one of the most confirmable classes, with the all-unique Link Minds and Conduit.
2. Mystics can confirm the other Mystic via Link Minds/Conduit targeting them.

Having a class that can easily confirm itself AND confirm others is a big no in considering the balance between town and scum. And having 2 of them in the same game exponentially squares their raw power level.

So while point #1 can&#39;t be removed without removing its utility as a neighborizer and night communicator, I think Mystic should be unique so that there isn&#39;t two of them, and so that they can&#39;t confirm each other (or stab each other in the back when one realizes that the other is converted.)</description>

            <p>The point being made here though is that Mystic is too strong for two to spawn in game, but you can’t have a counter class to a BD that isn’t guaranteed xD</p>

            <p>Very much agreed. Mystic is a very strong class, even if it’s prince jr. Mystic is still able to get claims quickly. Having 2 mystics and a prince alive means claims are gotten extremely quickly. And killing one isn’t enough since the others are still alive and have access to the now dead player’s logs.</p>
<p>It’s not often two mystics spawn, but when they do, it’s extreme hard mode for evils.</p>
