    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-black-knight-neutral-killer/3632</link>
    <description>**Black Knight** (Neutral) - An otherworldly brute who wants to watch the Castle burn...

Passive:
**Dark Herald** - You are immune to murder at night for as long as the original King lives.

_^ This applies even if the King is against you. It&#39;s just an interesting &#39;twist&#39; on your immunity._

Day Ability:
**Wraith&#39;s Whisper** - Send a message to the player of your choice, which will display only to them and will have the name of a random living player instead of yours. (Limited use. Three?)

_^ Think &quot;Troll Box&quot;, but only one person hears it, and the name of the speaker is randomized. Much less chance of this being abused, since you&#39;re not making a specific person say something dumb to the entire player group. Can ideally be used to spark confusion/suspicion._

Night Ability 1:
**Molten Shield** - Protect yourself with your blazing shield. If used, you will kill anyone who attacks you on that night. (Limited use. One/Two?)

_^ Note you&#39;d kill people who attack you, not people who just visit you._

Night Ability 2:
**Ignited Blade** - Attack a player with your flaming sword, killing them. If your target survives the attack by any means, they will be &quot;set ablaze&quot;, notifying two random living players. (Unlimited use.)

_^ The reason for being &quot;set ablaze&quot; is to essentially &quot;out&quot; people who survived an attack, but on a smaller scale than telling the whole round. Note that your target could&#39;ve been saved, may be immune, etc. so at least two people will suspect them of being immune from that point forward. If confronted, your target will of course claim they were healed, protected, etc. even if they weren&#39;t, so this isn&#39;t an automatic exposure._

Lore:
A Blue Dragon traitor who keeps his allegiance to the King, but no one else. The Black Knight sees the Blue Dragon court as weak and inept, preferring war and brutality over peace and prosperity. As the Black Knight, you will try to destroy not only the evil elements at play, but also the Blue Dragons you feel are leading the King down the wrong path. Your identity is a mystery, as you wear unmarked, black armor when perpetrating your dark deeds.</description>

            <p>I would rather have it be. “Achieve the Original King’s goal”. Meaning that a neutral king makes you a survivor. You would still want to keep the original king alive because of your passive.</p>

            <p>Would this class be truly <em>neutral</em> is the question.</p>
<p>It technically isn’t, but until you learn what the King’s alignment is, you should consider yourself neutral.</p>
<p>Also an interesting point is that BD will want to hang King if they discover a Black Knight is in the game so they can discover the Black Knight’s alignment.</p>

            <p>Will a Black Knight choose not to kill because of the chance of a Good King? Probably not since he can probably kill the Assassin, converted member or find the MM.</p>

            <p>Could have an interesting meta attached to it.</p>
<p>Knights could try whispering the King, but the King might not believe they are a Knight.</p>
<p>Evil King: “Should I actually tell this guy I am evil? But if he is lying and is BD, I’m getting hanged…”<br>
Neutral King: “Oh sick, I’ll check this guy tonight and confirm him and we’ll win together.”<br>
Good King: “This guy just told me he was a NK, better tell the castle to execute him.”</p>
<p>Lots of interesting lines of play there. Or you could just <em>guess</em> the King’s alignment…</p>

            <p>I’d like Wraith’s Whisper to give you the option of choosing who your target thinks it is coming from.</p>
<p>I like the interaction with the King.</p>

            <p><strong>Black Knight</strong> (Neutral) - An otherworldly brute who wants to watch the Castle burn…</p>
<p>Passive:<br>
<strong>Dark Herald</strong> - You are immune to murder at night for as long as the original King lives.</p>
<p><em>^ This applies even if the King is against you. It’s just an interesting ‘twist’ on your immunity.</em></p>
<p>Day Ability:<br>
<strong>Wraith’s Whisper</strong> - Send a message to the player of your choice, which will display only to them and will have the name of a random living player instead of yours. (Limited use. Three?)</p>
<p><em>^ Think “Troll Box”, but only one person hears it, and the name of the speaker is randomized. Much less chance of this being abused, since you’re not making a specific person say something dumb to the entire player group. Can ideally be used to spark confusion/suspicion.</em></p>
<p>Night Ability 1:<br>
<strong>Molten Shield</strong> - Protect yourself with your blazing shield. If used, you will kill anyone who attacks you on that night. (Limited use. One/Two?)</p>
<p><em>^ Note you’d kill people who attack you, not people who just visit you.</em></p>
<p>Night Ability 2:<br>
<strong>Ignited Blade</strong> - Attack a player with your flaming sword, killing them. If your target survives the attack by any means, they will be “set ablaze”, notifying two random living players. (Unlimited use.)</p>
<p><em>^ The reason for being “set ablaze” is to essentially “out” people who survived an attack, but on a smaller scale than telling the whole round. Note that your target could’ve been saved, may be immune, etc. so at least two people will suspect them of being immune from that point forward. If confronted, your target will of course claim they were healed, protected, etc. even if they weren’t, so this isn’t an automatic exposure.</em></p>
<p>Lore:<br>
A Blue Dragon traitor who keeps his allegiance to the King, but no one else. The Black Knight sees the Blue Dragon court as weak and inept, preferring war and brutality over peace and prosperity. As the Black Knight, you will try to destroy not only the evil elements at play, but also the Blue Dragons you feel are leading the King down the wrong path. Your identity is a mystery, as you wear unmarked, black armor when perpetrating your dark deeds.</p>
