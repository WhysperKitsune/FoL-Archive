**Personal Assistant (Passive)** - See all King&#39;s actions during a night.

**Accurate Listing (Night)** - See all whispers to and from the King - Infinite uses

Talking about wild discussion about the &quot;Whisper King&quot; Meta, adding a new class who is relying to whispers and overall King&#39;s action this would be one of solutions (Other is obviously buff Noble to counter this strategy but you know this).</description>

<p>I’d make commissionaire limited/1 use, since that makes it less easily confirmable and makes it so the chancellor can claim it’s unconverted counterpart.</p>

<p>Actually, it probably doesn’t matter in most scenarios, but yea i can see a point.</p>

<p>I’d also suggest making chancellor’s accurate listening give into to the entire unseen to coordinate claiming easier, but im less sure of that</p>

<p>There is no need for that, the only situation when this will make any difference is when the Chancellor will be in jail next night.</p>

            <p>So, the problem may lies in a 60/20/20 thing than in actually whispering. Otherwise this class could counter any tries to “allying” with suspicious claims.</p>

            <p>I don’t think this will actually work. He’s BD most of the time so king is still safe to whisper.</p>
