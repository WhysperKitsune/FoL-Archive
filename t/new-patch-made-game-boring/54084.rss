    <title>New Patch made game boring</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-patch-made-game-boring/54084</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am a ToL player who plays a decent amount.  This new patch made many classes SUPER boring.

Phys with No DK?  super boring.
No CW fix? CW super boring
Noble?  Super boring
Psychic to Mystic?  Wtf?  Now Mystic has a bunch of work to do...super boring.
Knight still a suicide class?  Boring

A few things were nice, but wtf m8?  We want easy stuff to do. DK was FUN. Psychic talking to dead was FUN.  Noble, never fun, CW never fun. 

Dying Night 1 is Never Fun.

I like a lot of the changes like to King and UI and Emotes, but fix the boring classes so you don&#39;t want to automatically suicide</description>

            <p>Actually, I found many people stayed after death. Of course, it doesn’t happen now, since you can’t do anything while dead.</p>
<p>DK was super swingy. But Call of the Dead wasn’t unreliable. And you had your normal abilities even if everyone did leave. For the most part, people would stay at least long enough to see if there was a Psychic.</p>

<p>While I think it would be nice for conduit to get 1 or 2 extra charges I don’t think it should be the main ability since about 2 people each night will be claiming which is a bit OP.</p>

<p>I’m not liking that they removed call of the dead but it did have some problems, it isn’t fun when a poss can’t use their abilities, also I find it less effort now because I don’t have to write what the dead say every night</p>

            <p>The patch didn’t make things worse. It made the game better (minus the removal of dead interaction)</p>
<p>Every other change improved the game.</p>

            <p>and that’s how you survive. Play BD strong early on, make it questionable mid-game and suddenly flop. I’ve won Neut king by finding evils, and by surviving until all BD are dead. I know how to survive as neut king.</p>

            <p>The point of Neut king was to try your best to find evils in the early game, and if it failed and you felt things were swapping, start stalling until you suddenly ex a confirmed BD. It was a highly skilled class that took someone that really understood how to play it, to win.</p>
<p>Removing it is really unfortunate. Like many changes in this patch in my opinion. It dumbs the game down so the younger crowd can play.</p>
