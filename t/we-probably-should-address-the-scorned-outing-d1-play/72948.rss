    <title>We probably should address the scorned outing d1 play</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/we-probably-should-address-the-scorned-outing-d1-play/72948</link>
    <description>I played for the weekend. I only have one question on my mind right now.

WHY ARE SCORNED CLAIMS LEFT ALONE?!? He frames, he decieves, he tricks invest classes. There&#39;s no use to BD now that the faction check is gone. So why?

Every single game I&#39;m in.

And they leave the scorned alone.

Someone&#39;s framed.

Scorned outs day 1.

No action against the scorned.

What kind of fucked up meta do we have here?</description>

            <p>Yeah. The fact that even if the setup or something close enough to it happens you still have to figure out that it happened as scum. And even then you need the non-SS neuts to vote with you and even THEN you need to hope that BD doesn’t have enough killers to take back majority</p>

            <p>BD is dumb and naive for letting a Scorned live<br>
Scorned is opportunistic for exploiting this<br>
This dynamic is a problem</p>
<p>any objections?</p>

<p>Sure. Because something like “conversation” and “being wrong” doesn’t exist. Good talk. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Well, arguing with a boy who calls an opponent “kiddo, mister, dumb and naive” just because someone doesn’t agree with them serves no purpose indeed, shouldn’t have wasted my time.</p>

<p>Why is it suppose to be Scorned’s fault? KEK</p>

<p>Following your logic, voting up people quickly is correct play because everyone does it.</p>

<p>What logic? That BD sometimes doesnt have their own mind and doesn’t think about consequences?<br>
It’s a fact, kiddo.</p>

<p>So???</p>
<p>It doesn’t change a fact that Scorned doesn’t have a restiction to always vote with BD. Complaining about backstabbing Neutrals and pretend it isn’t BD fault is dumb and naive.</p>
