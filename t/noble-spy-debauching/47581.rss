    <title>Noble Spy Debauching</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/noble-spy-debauching/47581</link>
    <description>Since when Noble spies do not count as visiting when used. I think when debauched the noble spy should not go on to the drunk, but to the target who the noble attempted itself? I was debauched as a noble when spying and was disappointed when my target who whispered a lot during the duration of the game was changed! I think that it is a Bug and need to be fixed!!</description>

            <p>Always remember this: The balance is more important than the lore. Perhaps it would make sense, but balance wise it is better if this continues to work.</p>

            <p>The Drunk Debauch Ability “Get in a player’s way, causing them to target you. You are immune to all attacks and conversions redirected to you.” But the Noble’s ability sends a maid, so when the drunk debauches the noble the maid should go to the assigned target not the drunk because the drunk is getting in the noble’s way not the maid’s. Therefore, the noble’s not visiting is relevant unless the noble is snooping.</p>

</aside>
<p>It is not a bug. The Drunks ability does not care if your ability actually counts as visiting because it swaps targets. The fact that it does not count as visiting only matters for Obs, Princess and Sorcerer</p>

<p>It changes your target, so it should work on Noble. It’s just an arbitrary nerf on the Drunk.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is it really?  Most of the time, as a Drunk, if I accidentally targeted a Noble I wouldn’t <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> it to work.  Having the Drunk’s ability fail to affect BD actually buffs them by reducing the risk of interfering with allies.</p>

            <p>All I am saying is that since it does not count as visiting the drunk debauch should not be effective on nobles unless the noble is snooping. Additionally, it is a buff on the noble that was a bug in the first place and should not have even been there to begin with!</p>
