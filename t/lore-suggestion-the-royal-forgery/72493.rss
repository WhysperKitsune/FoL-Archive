    <description>Pretender lore

Being a royal ain&#39;t always easy. Faking one is even harder.

The pretender sat in her &quot;royal palace&quot; writing her &quot;royal logs&quot; with her &quot;royal crown&quot; with a &quot;royal stare.&quot; So much faking had to be done. Too many royal documents had to be forged. How could she make it easier for herself to gain more power in society?

Then it hit her. The king had all the power. But how can she get in his place? Plot an assassination? Kill the Royals next to her? The place was trembling with the unseen, so maybe all she had to do was be here in the right place at the right time.
