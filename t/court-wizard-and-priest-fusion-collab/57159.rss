    <description>Kinda rushed this out to meet deadlines so there may be updates, and @Livicus and myself may finish debating specifics here, but at least we&#39;re getting it out there!

&gt;## [color=steblue]The Court Wizard[/color]
&gt;**[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Support[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Ice Ward (Day)** - Encase another player in a shroud of ice, preventing all others from visiting them tonight. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Tornado (Night)** - Swap two players&#39; positions, causing all players targeting one of them to target the other. *(3 uses)*
**Empower (Night)** - If they are not occupied, your target&#39;s ability will be guaranteed to succeed, will not count as a visit, and they will be guaranteed to recieve correct feedback. - *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm._


&gt;**Converts into [color=purple]The Sage[/color].**
------
&gt;## [color=purple]The Sage[/color]
&gt;[color=purple]**Unseen Support**[/color]
&gt;
&gt;**Wall of Fire (Day)** - Surround your target with a sheet of flames, preventing all others except your fellow Unseen from visiting them tonight. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Mimic (Night)** - You will use your first target&#39;s chosen night ability on your second target. This spell will fail if your first target is not a member of the Blue Dragon. *(3 uses)*
**Tornado (Night)** - Swap two players&#39; positions, causing all players targeting one of them to target the other. *(Infinite uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Your objective is to Eliminate the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who stand against you._
---
&gt;## [color=steblue]The Priest[/color]
&gt;**[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Support[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Devout (Passive)** - Your voice may not be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, Trollbox, Mental Blur, etc. will not work on you.)
&gt;
&gt;**Blessing (Day)** - You may bless a player, protecting them from all negative effects and conversion. The blessing will stay on the player until you bless someone else. *(Infinite uses)*
**Consecrate (Day)** - Make a player immune to death tonight. *(1 use)*
&gt;
&gt;**Anoint (Night)** - Prevent all day abilities from affecting your target tomorrow. *(Infinite uses)*
**Intercession (Night)** - Any day abilities your target attempts to use tomorrow will have no effect. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Defeat the Unseen or Cult, and any Neutrals that seek to do you harm._

&gt;**Converts into [color=purple]The Heretic[/color].**
---
&gt;## [color=purple]The Heretic[/color]
&gt;**[color=purple]Unseen Support[/color]**
&gt;
&gt;**Hearsay (Passive)** - As long as you are alive, the Unseen will have a separate chat tab with which to talk during the day.
&gt;
&gt;**Witness (Day)** - You will be told the name of the next player to use a day ability. *(Infinite uses)*
**Indulgence (Day)** - If your target uses a day ability today, they will target themselves. *(2 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;**Mislead (Night)** - Any day abilities your target attempts to use tomorrow will have no effect. *(Infinite uses)*
**Scheme (Night)** - Prevent all day abilities from affecting your target tomorrow. *(3 uses)*
&gt;
&gt;_Your objective is to Eliminate the Blue Dragon and any Neutrals who stand against you._
---
In this way, the Court Wizard&#39;s previous main utility, preventing negative effects, is instead moved to the Priest, allowing the Court Wizard to take on a new and different Support role. Both @Livicus and myself strongly believe that this is the best course of action, as Magical Barrier, despite its relatively strong utility, is seemingly forever unpopular.

It&#39;s also worth noting that I&#39;d also support replacing Tornado with the following ability:
&gt;**Magical Door (Night)** - All visits to a single target will be redirected to another target of choice. Can’t target self or King. *(2 uses)*

Of course, the Sage would still get infinite uses.

Also of note: Anoint, Intercession, Mislead, and Scheme do not work on abilities such as Imprision, Scout, Dirty Work, and Sacrifice, but do work on Stoneskin Potion, Ice Ward, and Wall of Fire. Indulgence has no such restrictions, but any day abilities that would normally target oneself will be unaffected by it.</description>

            <p>Yeah I do get what you are trying to do there. (part of why I took so long to respond to the summon was the lack of any ideas to supplement anything). I overall like the concepts. Between both classes, we lack one ability. I suppose coming up with one ability will determine whether it’s magic barrier or anoint that needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>The way I see it</p>
<p>CW day - Ice ward<br>
CW - night - X or Magic Barrier (barrier informs if target is attempted to be converted)<br>
CW - Night - Empower</p>
<p>PR devout (passive)<br>
PR X or blessing (day)<br>
Pr Anoint (night)<br>
PR intercession (night)</p>
<p>I like the way they work… but I’m unable to solve for X, which we’d need to do to figure out which one to put it in</p>

</aside>
<p>Well honestly I think it’s just that we can’t really come up with a better non barrier idea. Trying to beat the hard to confirm vs effective. IMO the best balance tweak would be to give barrier a “you stopped a conversion” notification to the CW. That at least signals to the CW that he found a non unseen.</p>
<p>Empower, I kind of like as a secondary… honestly that could remove the somewhat confirmable nature of tornado.</p>
<p>of course if we kept barrier we’d need to replace blessing if this is a bundled deal. I do like the priest concept overall. But yeah can’t come up with a non-confirmable good alternative to barrier, as while I like empower, it does seem even more on the “I don’t feel like I’m doing anything” than barrier is.</p>

            <p>But again, it doesn’t solve the issue at hand, which is CW’s uselessness.You’re correct to say it can be quite good if used well, but the scenarios where it can be used “quite well” are so impossibly few, CW will continue to be a “boring” class. I’d put your CW and Noble in a similar boat where they have powerful late-game abilities, but it requires them to live long enough to see the end game. CW is even worse though, because he requires a combo piece, just to give Butler the Drunk’s happy hour.</p>
<p>At this point I don’t think I can really say anything else, and honestly it feels like we’d be better off just removing CW entirely.</p>

            <p>That seems like a bit of a logic fallacy. Recognizing problems with the ability and then just keeping it. Honestly I would still want Magic Barrier, but I want to work under your construct, and also assuming Priest makes it back in as is, Magic Barrier would be a bit redundant.</p>

            <p>Personally, just using your idea specifically, I would keep Tornado (or change it to doorway), give CW a different main night ability, and then remove ice ward and replace it with Empower. I’m not sure what night ability I would give him.</p>

<p>You think cutting the number of uses will make it a better class?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not exactly. I think the ability would be better as a secondary or day ability with limited uses. It does have interesting possibilities, but it also leads itself to be useless the majority of the time. Moving it off of the main ability and limiting can help players see “Okay, this ability is situational since I’m limited in uses” rather than its current main ability, infinite uses where they’d use it on anyone.</p>

            <p>I’m not denying there is utility in the idea. But look at that scenario you just presented. How often, if ever, do you think games will end in a situation like that? We can talk forever about these golden scenarios, but most games will never reach that. Add in we’re looking at the ability being the primary utility of the CW.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s technically strategy rather than griefing if there’s a concrete reason why your side should do it. It’s actually massively OP in that scenerio. If there’s a MM. a converted, and an assasain. NK is dead in this hypothetical. You only know the assasain’s identity. you’ve got no idea who the MM and converted are… lets say it’s 4v3 at this point, you could kill the assasain, The MM will convert a BD, the former converted is now an assasain killing. and the new numbers are 2v3 BD lost.</p>
<p>Or you could hold the assasain, try to find the MM. Assuming no phys the worse he can do is poison. Unseen is full so MM can’t convert. if you figure out the MM<br>
4v2 (1 bd poisoned, MM executed)<br>
4v1 (2 bd poisoned, hopefully converted executed now)<br>
3v1 (one bd died from his poisoning again assuming no phys/alc)</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not sure what I want to fix Empower other than turn it into a limited ability. I understand it has uses, but I don’t think I’m underestimating it at all. I mean, you can Empower a butler all game and if he only ever targets the Assassin and Reaper, what’s the point? Sure you can indefinitely stun them, but by the time you recognize they’re who they are, I feel you’re already set to put them up on trial, rather than grief them into not getting to play the game.</p>

<p>I think confirm able abilities are fine. Something like Tornado is somewhat confirmable as well, yet we’re leaving it in. And if the Priest is wasting time using it on allies to “confirm” herself, she’s not getting the utility to stop evils.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am definitely for anything that nerfs the Prince, be it as rare as this class may be. However, I believe the day chat will be rather boring. Like you could use it to plan out stuff during the day, however most planning needs to be done at night. There are some fringe things like the MM finding out the class of another player or the assassin explaining his target was immune, but I believe the daychat will be underwelming. That being said, it doesn’t define the Heretic, so it’s doesn’t need to be that powerful.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>But doesn’t that just ignore the whole point of this? To create a “more fun” CW? Your suggestion here was to switch out Magic Barrier with Empower. I feel that takes away from the whole point. But I have ignored the the Sage and Priest reworks, so I’ll share a few thoughts over them.</p>
<p>One more bit with Sage, I feel Ice Ward is a bit random. Like it feels like it doesn’t belong with the kit. Most day abilities have utility to work only during the day or in a few evil classes case, powering up night abilities. I mentioned this with someone else, but I think Empower could be decent as a limited day ability. But that’s besides the point.</p>
<p>Mimic is interesting, but I swear I remember hearing Boslof mention that an ability like that would be difficult to code. I’m sure it’s not improbably and would be fun, but overall I don’t think the Sage even needs to be changed. Wall of Fire is one of the strongest Unseen abilities, and using Tornado is a situation where you can discuss with two other players optimal usage is amazing.</p>
<p>On the Priest, I like the idea of day ability prevention. I am also definitely a fan that it is a night ability, as that stops it from being a rush during the day to pick your day ability before another player. I do believe it’d be better if the ability just locked them out of their day ability, rather than make it have no effect. You could, in theory, use this to “prove” you’re the priest, but it’d have to be used on someone with day abilities, and I think only about half of BD, if not less, have them. This, in theory, makes the prevention ability seem almost useless, however it being limited makes it a more thoughtful ability in the player’s mind.</p>
<p>The Heretic seems a little weird. None of the abilities seem particularly useful. Other than jail or telepathy, I don’t think there’s a day ability you really need to locate the person. Also, both of the night abilities seem nearly useless for Unseen. What day abilities are you protecting your team from? Best I can think of is Chilling Touch? No other day abilities target the unseen. Unless, of course, it stops jail. Other than that, The Heretic seems horribly underpowered and almost useless to the unseen. Unless I’m missing something.</p>
