    <description>Dunno how long this will go

Anyways, this is for any quality FoL  grand idea classes. 

Rules are:
1. Cannot prevent another class in thread from rolling.
2. Cannot target specific players.
3. Each class must be its own post, and each post must have the correct number.
4. You cannot have multiple of the same class as posts in a reasonable margin. = 100 posts
5. Classes cannot target other specific classes unless they are meant to be a faction softcounter or hardcounter.
6. Go to town with this.

If you guess their faction correctly, they will be immediately killed, piercing death immunity, wiping their class card and logbook, and also revealing their class card and logbook to yourself, in addition, you are allowed to guess again.

            <h1>27</h1>
<p>If you roll this slot, pick the Spiritualist (26) first.</p>
<h2>Revenant</h2>
<p><img src="https://forum.imperium42.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/24ff9e8d2d981dcdadbf7a6f2587450cb40d002d.png" alt="image" width="128" height="128"><br>
<strong>Neutral Killer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dead (Passive)</strong><br>
The Revenant appears as dead, because they are. The Revenant cannot directly be targeted by any day or night abilities, because they are dead. The Revenant cannot vote. While the Revenant still exists the game will not end</p>
<p><strong>Chilling Aura (Passive)</strong><br>
While you exist, every player shall know that you do by the message of “The haunting presence of a Revenant fills the castle” at every time a new day starts. Abilities that detect visiting players can detect the Revenant visiting their bound player every night.</p>
<p><strong>Wailings (Passive)</strong><br>
You may speak to the living during the day, however you also talk to the dead (not the priest) by the use of a special PM, Discord channel, Yahoo! thread or whatever your hosts wishes to.</p>
<p><strong>Soul Bind (Day Ability)</strong><br>
Bind your soul to a living player for the following night and the day after. The use of this ability during every day is mandatory. If this is not used, the same target from before is picked; if there was no target before, a random alive player is selected. If the target of “Bind Soul” is killed in any way while their soul was binded with the Revenant, the Revenant will be erradicated for good. A Reaper receives 2 souls by reaping a bound player. - Infinite Uses</p>
<p><strong>Haunt (Night Ability)</strong><br>
Haunt a player, killing them. If they are immune, a second haunt will kill them - Infinite Uses</p>
<p><strong>Win Condition:</strong>  <em>Your goal is to erradicate all main factions and neutrals that would stand in your way.</em></p>

<p>Each player may choose to “attack” another player each day, in private. When attacked, the host will roll a 20-sided die and apply the buffs or debuffs for the hit. If the resulting number is equal or superior to the opponent’s armor class (AC), they will receive damage equal to the damage dice of the attacker.</p>
<p>When dropped to 0 HP, the player dies.</p>
<p>When killed using this method, all attackers are presented in the thread alongside with the dead’s flip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Your objective is to see three monsters slayed by the use of this method.</em></p>
