    <description>Hi!

Im pretty pumped to play this game again after a long time, but if i make mistakes and get shamed for them(like i have in the past) i might as well skip it. Is this community harsh for newbies in general or am i just asking a stupid question?</description>

<p>You might meet some rude people in game, but don’t let that discourage you! If you look around in Discord and Forum, people are pretty nice in general. Every games have their bad 'uns but this here is friendly as a community.</p>

            <p>Only like 2 players are rude to newbies (but, they’re also rude to like everyone) Otherwise, its a newbie friendly community</p>

            <p>It is generally very friendly compared to other games and the moderation team is quite active in my experience.</p>
