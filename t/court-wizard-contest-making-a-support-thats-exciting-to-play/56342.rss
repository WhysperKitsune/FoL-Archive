    <description>**Court Wizard**

**Passive ability: [Astral Projection](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/45/65/e84565becbb2cce2b89555620c1c448b.jpg)**
- After the night you die, you will appear as a ghost for THAT day being able to vote and talk.
(at ghost form you cant whisper or get whispered to. And you cant see dead chat)

(a blue ghostly figue will appaer instead of you main character like the graveyard figures)




**Day Ability: &quot;Turn Cat!&quot;**   USES=2
- transform  ANYONE (except the king) into a Cat for TONIGHT ONLY, preventing them from taking any actions and making &quot;any action targeting them&quot; to fail.


_-Idea behind the skill_: The transformed person wont see their character in their room, instead they wil see a black cat wondering. Killers or healers or even the prince cant do anything to them since they will see just a black Cat wondering in the room ;)[Kitty](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0784/5697/products/WP224LP.jpg?v=1516149476)

_Details:_ 
the person turning into a cat will recive this message at the start of the night &quot;You suddenly shrinked in size and turned into a cat for this night&quot;.

**Night Ability: &quot;[Arcane Runes](https://www.google.com.tr/search?biw=1920&amp;bih=1019&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=ZczDWupciKWwAeCrrqgM&amp;q=magic+runes+art&amp;oq=magic+runes+art&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i8i30k1.2979647.2982691.0.2982803.16.16.0.0.0.0.150.1569.0j12.13.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.12.1567.0..0j0i67k1j0i30k1j0i24k1.106.P2lYUqyMr6g#imgdii=BF6bMpSzTWZHuM:&amp;imgrc=xN3D5rJ_UdzlmM:)&quot;** USES= 2
- If your target dies tonight their killer will be occupied the next night.

-chat notification: You saw wierd symbols outside your victims house, you started feeling dizzy.

**Night Ability &quot;Magic Barrier&quot;** USES=Infinite

_Good old magic barrier._


note: i dont think tornado is a healty game mechanic its nearly imposible to keep track of specially in unranked. It doesnt help it just creates chaos in the minds of BD. I dont think BD needs a skill that can mess themselves up 99 percent of tthe time.</description>

            <p>Turn Catt and Arcane Runes are Offensive abilities, not Support abilities. Magic barrier is going to be the main ability still, and that’s the ability everyone thinks is boring on CW.</p>
<p>Arcane Runes is ew honestly, because it completely screws Cult, Reaper and Assassin whle doing very little to the other killers. Assassin can just poison to make up for it, and so it’ll be fine. Very swingy ability.</p>
<p>Also Tornado is a high-risk hgh-reward ability, the whole point is it messes them up when not done properly. But i digress.</p>
<p>Also Sage needs to be changed if you remove Tornado.</p>
