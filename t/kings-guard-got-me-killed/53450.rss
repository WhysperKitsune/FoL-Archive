    <title>Kings guard got me killed :(</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/kings-guard-got-me-killed/53450</link>
    <description>I was the mastermind we were doing all fine and dandy when our assaisn attacks a drunk.... the drunk debuached me and it said you were attacked but you are immune... I was confused cause I didn&#39;t attack him. And it was because the kings guards. Is there any way to give hint it was something different?</description>

            <p>What Hippolytus said.  You were just extremely unlucky; but the change you’re suggesting would mostly buff BD (since you’d be giving more information to people who are attacked, who are usually BD.)</p>

            <p>In general giving less ability-specific info is a buff to Scum. If the drunk had debuached any other player you would have got a free mis-lynch. You were just unlucky I am afraid <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>
