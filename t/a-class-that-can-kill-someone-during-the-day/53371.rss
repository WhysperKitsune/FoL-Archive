<p>honestly if you ask me… the game doesn’t really have a shortage of neuts… if you ask me the category it is really hurting in, is non-confirmable BDs. In many ways I’d say we have too many neuts more than too few… inq IMO was a silly addition, (No he dosn’t balance sorc, because he’s incapable of actually catching sorc, full court frame makes sure his false positive rate is too silly high to actually act on.</p>

            <p>It probably won’t happen. This has been asked about before and Boslof said there wouldn’t be a day killer.</p>

            <p>From my POV:</p>
<p>A class that can day vig is basically self confirmable.</p>
<p>And it didn’t fit into the deception game.</p>
<p>(Sorry, haven’t being in game for like 5 month)</p>
