    <title>Rules misunderstanding - suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rules-misunderstanding-suggestion/37960</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i’ve played about 700 hours so far but nowadays I realise there is one thing which is becoming more common - it’s discording. 
It’s written in the rules that communicating outside the in-game chat is NOT forbidden, however you must not share any info about the game. Many people break this latter part.
A week ago I was a possessor and jumped to a guy n2 which was an observer. The next night I was jailed and even though I gave the logs of the guy who I jumped to, prince executed me silently. In dead chat I tried to say that possessor jumped on me, but the guy who I had jumped on before said this: “r u dumb? prince exed you. we r in discord”. I said that this is cheating, the guy replied that speaking in discord is not forbidden - “check the rules”. Hopefully you will understand how mad I was, considering this game didn’t even have a psychic.
Another example - I was a cult leader and another cult member said “convert 6 :)” n2. This 6 guy hasn’t said anything in chat, but I had no reasons not to follow my teammate - what if he knows something that I don’t? The outcome was just insane - paladin smited exactly this 6 and I died. There is no way I would believe in this coincidence on n2.
These were two of the many times where I see some people don’t even hesitate to claim they are discording. I do understand there is some amount if them who follow the rule and do not share ANY infor about the game, but I am more than sure that the majority of these guys at least share their classes with each other. 
Honestly, I don’t see any reason why this is allowed. What I am suggesting here is to completely forbid any communication outside the ingame chat to at least decrease the stimul to do so. People don’t see the difference between what is allowed and what is not. Your new friend has just bought the game and you are helping him to get thrugh? Use whisper chat! If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of. Let nobles do their job and check how suspicious those whispers are.
You can always communicate with any of your friends using chat (unless if one of you died), so why not use this instead? 
While some guys have fun playing together and talking, others are having a huge disadvantage playing on their owns. This is really disappointing. Even 2 BD talking and sharing info significantly decrease the chance to win for the unseen, because these two guys are equal to have been given a noble snoop, sheriff invest and scout ability targeted one on another in addition to theirs. 
This game is different from others. You can’t play it “in team” like you do in Dota 2 or CS GO. Discording must be forbidden IN RULES so that it wouldn’t provoke players to do so. Don’t spoil the fun for others. 
Please share your thoughts if you agree with me or not.

            <p>The only issue I see with this suggestion is that it assumes those people don’t think that what they do is against the rules. How many of those actually know that it’s against the rules, or care ? It seems to me that when they argue that it’s not against the rules, they’re only trying not to get reported.</p>
<p>I’m afraid such a change would only make them stop admitting that they’re doing it. Still, it has no downside so why not ?</p>

            <p>Creating a section of “but this and this and this is aloud” just let’s there be that area of mistakes and misunderstanding. And even repeating known information can effect the game, as alive player may of forgotten or overlooked that bit and therefore effecting the game.</p>

            <p>100% agree that “no discussion of an ongoing game outside the game, fullstop.”</p>
<p>I’ve seen many people argue things like “oh, we were just faking each other out; we enjoy teasing each other or trying to deceive each other outside the game.”  No.  Communicating <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> in relation to an ongoing game outside the game itself should be grounds for an instaban - even the tiniest bit of information can be used to deduce stuff.  If you want to try and trick people or whatever, you must do so through the game’s existing channels, accepting the risk and limitations of being (eg.) overheard or noticed if it’s a whisper, or unable to contact the dead at all, or unable to contact fellow Unseen / Cult outside of the night.</p>

            <p>If people could figure out that you are using discord then you are cheating. That doesn’t mean that if they can’t tell your using discord that you aren’t cheating. I just mean that if you do something that could make you recognized as using discord then it’s cheating.</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn’t matter (asking the MM to convert your friend without telling the friend anything.) But even then it’s still technically cheating.</p>

            <p>So effectively no change to the rules, just a change in wording? I think that might be a good change actually.</p>

            <p>I support this rule.  No discussion about ongoing games outside of the game.<br>
It’s not just that people will intentionally use it for cheating, it’s also because people will make mistakes, and they will accidentally release information which they didn’t mean to. Why risk it? Talk about the game after you finished it, or stick to the games intended dead chat.</p>

            <p>I’d support this being a rule change 100%. Something along the lines of “no discussing the game outside of the game, period”, which neither explicitly states “you may use an external chat” nor “talking about other stuff is against the rules”. This should give you a solid umbrella where discussing other stuff is fine, but it’s obvious what the intent of the rule is. Giving people the leeway of “you may chat, but not about X or Y” is a lot less clean than simply “don’t talk about the game out of the game in any fashion”.</p>

            <p>Some people do enjoy just talking with friends about off topic stuff and want to play the game together.</p>
<p>I feel like the problem you have isn’t with the rules themselves, but with the general public’s awareness of what is cheating and what isn’t.</p>

            <p>My main point was that they allow people to communicate without sharing info BUT this provokes people to do so where they eventually DO share info not even realising it is forbidden. I start having more issues with this, and all the times the answer is the same: “discording is allowed, read rules”. People dont realise they must not share ANY info, even the way how you died and so on. Changing this rule into “any communication outside the game is forbidden” won’t bring any harm to the game and will prevent newcomers from doing this.</p>
