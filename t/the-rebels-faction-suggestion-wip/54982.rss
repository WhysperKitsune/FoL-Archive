    <description>The rebels are BD who rebelled against the other BD and now want to take over the Kingdom!!!

The Rebels can only have four members at a time, They will start off with a Chief and a Henchman

&gt; [color=111reddder]The Chief, Rebels, Special :shield::sparkles:[/color]
&gt; =
&gt; Passive 1: Royal Blood - Your votes count as 2 in king elections. 
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 2: I&#39;m Chief!!! - You are immune to death at night, occupation/target change, you will also appear to be BD the first time you are checked by an observer, 
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Hehe Be Scared - Scare a player removing their royal blood passive, will not notify them unless they try to become king, 2 use
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Rebel Against Them!! - Convert a player to be a rebel, 2 day recharge time
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Join Us Or Else - Kill a player, unlimited uses, can only be used after the Henchman is dead



&gt; [color=111reddder]The Henchman, Rebels, Killer :shield: :hocho:[/color]
&gt;  =
&gt; Passive 1: Determined To Takeover- If you get attacked you will live one extra day, unless healed
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Suffocation - make a player unable to breath making them unable to talk for the day, they will die in 2 nights unless healed, 2 use
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Help us or... - Kill a player

&gt; [color=11redder] The Retainer, Rebels, Offensive :dagger:[/color]
&gt; =
&gt; Converts from Butler
&gt; 
&gt; Passive 1: Rebellion - You&#39;re immune to occupation/target change
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability 1: Bewilder - Make someone unable to use their day abilities, 2 use
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Wine Heaven - Forcefully make a player drink so much wine that they will become drunk and  will receive incorrect info, does not notify them, 3 use
&gt; Examples:
&gt; Princess will see a person as kill/off while flirting
&gt; Princess will see that a person killed someone while using WoW
&gt; Observer will see a person as a Rebel while peeking
&gt; Negotiator will see a person as a Rebel while investigating 
&gt; Drunk will think they did not succeed while debauching a person
&gt; Butler will think they did not succeed while serving wine to a person
&gt; Noble will see empty logs while snooping
&gt; Phys will think that he succeed while healing self or other person
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Rebel Party: Same as normal party
