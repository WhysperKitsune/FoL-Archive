    <title>CATHARS (evil faction suggestion)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cathars-evil-faction-suggestion/86274</link>
    <description>hello good friends so i was recently playing a good game of ck2 and the cathars took control of soutern france through a secret religious cult (ck2 is a videogame about medieval kind of like throne of lies).

whats a cathar? they were an evil gnostic church that taught celibacy, creation is evil, god of old testament is evil, heresy about the trinity, etc. i think they would make an excellent evil faction

there would be only 1 role, the cathar

passive - cant be occupied (they are too focused on heresy)
night action - make celibate (the opponent will die in 1 turn)
night action - cooldown two nights (conver them to catharism)

when the blue dragon wins the screen will say &quot;Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.&quot;

what u think</description>

            <p>this is so potentially offensive i don’t even know where to start</p>
<p>(and let’s be honest by potentially offensive it probably actually is offensive)</p>
<p>also that’s not how catharism works in the real world</p>
