    <description>Because I&#39;d buy them if they weren&#39;t more than like $10 each.  I wish there were more skins.</description>

            <p>The skins should just be more expensive too, it takes no time to be able to get all the skins you want.</p>

            <p>IMO what would be cool is if they did a bit of both that, and the opposite. A special skin or execution only available to people who contributed to the game, is awesome and I fully applaud.</p>
<p>Though I would say I’d also be really impressed if there were some skins you couldn’t buy with real cash. Maybe a few achievement based skins… IE “this skin is available if you win 40 games as prince” etc…</p>
<p>That all being said, what I love most about this game, is that they clearly spend way more time and focus on balancing gameplay and mechanics, and much less time on skins/executions, which to be quite honest in this style of game I forget they are there because I’m too busy analyzing the chats.</p>
