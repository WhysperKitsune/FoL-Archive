    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestions-alternate-cult-classes/45136</link>
    <description>These are alternate classes that you could be when you get converted to cult. As of right now you only get converted to one specific class to the cult. With these classes you can either because one of two class options of your type. This was taken from my third eye idea

**Name - Vengeful eye(needs better name) **
Faction - cult
Type - offense

**Day Ability 1** - deep cut - make a player bleed. It will say that they have 2 day before they die(like normal) but they will only have 1 day to be healed.(similar to butlers poison). (1 use)

**Day Ability 2** - stolen poison - poison someone, they will die in two days unless healed. (3 uses)

**Night ability 1** - admire - have a player admire them self, occupying them for that night (unlimited uses)

**Night ability 2** - switched - select a player and a class. When that player gets investageted they will appeared as that class (2 uses)(can select teammates)

            <p>All Seeing is like princess wisping each night but to themselves, despite the fact that princess only has 3 uses of that and that Golden Eye is able to use a night ability in addition the the passive seems a bit overpowered. Additionally, let’s say sorc with a magic rocket and physician healing, you know that 1 of them is a healer and that 1 of them is the NK eveynight. Furthermore, you could see that the Nk visited you and tell the psychic, Nk is already hard to win and with all seeing it makes it harder to win.</p>

<p>I do not think the Vengeful and the Cult Leader should be able to cause bleed, only one of them should be able to have that ability.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This allows them to bleed even if they know BD has healer because healer would have to focus on more injured allies other then healing a confirmed BD member. I do see your point tho, like everyday someone starts to bleed might get annoying, but until something like this is added to the game then we wont know for sure</p>

<p>Yes it is supposed to bring confusion to the court, his class is supposed to throw off or distract BD</p>

<p>How is this too over powered and what should it be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For Extra Cash, what happens if a mercenary is not in the game?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This doesn’t affect the mercenary directly, pretty much a player will be notified that a mercenary stood outside their door that night, also making them immune that night. This allows you or one of your fellow cult to claim merc or even guard one of your cult members if a knight or someone attacks them that night. If there is a merc in the game then this ability doesn’t involve him at all.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps, respond back if you still don’t understand or have anymore questions. I also made some changes to the classes</p>

            <p>I do not think the Vengeful and the Cult Leader should be able to cause bleed, only one of them should be able to have that ability. I also dislike that the Cult can use poison because bleed is a trademark of the Cult and having poison will therefore remove that trademark this will cause confusion in the court or just lower the amount of use to 1 use. So I disagree with the Stolen Poison ability. I feel like the wording for the switched ability is unclear. I think golden eye’s passive 1 is a little bit overpowered and needs a debuff. For Extra Cash, what happens if a mercenary is not in the game? I think for uses for I am not real is a lot either 3 or 2. A good view cannot have an option for prince or psychic, it has to be prince because if psychic is not in the game then Cult will know it and maybe change it to one use because that is a bit strong 2 uses or you could make it  a night ability. Also maybe add a tab so they could switch between cult chat and the prince chat.</p>

            <p>This is similar to the other post like I mentioned but they would be implemented as an alternate cult class that you can be converted into and the cult can convert people</p>

            <p>Why are you renaming everything? This is an entirely different faction. Also there is no conversion. Also aren’t these the same classes in your other post?</p>
