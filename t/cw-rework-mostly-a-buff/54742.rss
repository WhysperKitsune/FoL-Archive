            <p>Day ability is just an old version of Ice Ward. Scry is really situational. Tornado shouldn’t be the main ability. Boslof already said that it didn’t work. Also CW shouldn’t be occ I’m, it makes it a bad scum fake claim and serves literally no purpose. Also Mage Armor is one use so you’ll pretty much never hit anything and it’s just a straight up nerf to Reaper cause he loses 2 souls if he tries to empower reap you target. So, overall just a merf, as he can’t even prevent conversions anymore.</p>
