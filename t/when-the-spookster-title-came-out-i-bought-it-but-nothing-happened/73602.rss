    <title>When the Spookster title came out, I bought it, but nothing happened</title>

    <description>#### What happened?
When the Spookster title came out, I bought it, but nothing happened, or at least I thought. I clicked twice more and each time the gold was deducted, so I stopped. 

#### What should have happened?
 Receive spookster title on first click


#### Comments:

Eventually this was fixed. However, my gold was never refunded to me, so I&#39;m just out 14k gold instead. Of note, this happened many, many days ago, so it might be too late, but if not, hopefully I can get the gp back!</description>

<p>Hmm, this doesn’t sound like a familiar bug: There are tons of fallbacks to store bugs.</p>
<p>If there was an error, you wouldn’t be able to click the button a 2nd time - if you bought it, clicking again would only equip it.</p>
<p>Even then, in the back, it checks to ensure you only own ONE item. It rejects if it’s already owned. This means if gold was deducted, if you restarted the game it’d pop right back in.</p>
<p>Please message i42-Xblade on Discord so I can further investigate: <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a></p>
