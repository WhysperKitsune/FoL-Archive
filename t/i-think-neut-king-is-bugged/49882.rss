    <title>I think neut king is bugged</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/i-think-neut-king-is-bugged/49882</link>
    <description>What happened?
I was a neut king and there was a knight and a CL, cult auto won even though knight wasn&#39;t converted and I was neut king

What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I think the game should have continued since I was neut king and not auto give it to cult
Steps to reproduce:
Well knight killed off the invoker, I protected myself and in the day cult auto won
Comments:
Is this a bug or does this always happen?</description>

            <p>other possiblity, knight left the game… maybe that explains the lack of an update to his character for the end game screen.</p>

            <p>I am sure he wasn’t reaped, it was a possessor game</p>
<p>Maybe the game just messed up at the end screen and said that knight wasn’t converted and marked him in red, The CL said at the end Yay I converted the knight, I asked the knight if he was converted but he didn’t respond</p>

            <p>The game’s autoresolve is turned off and even if it was on, it shouldn’t have ended the game. Are you sure the Knight wasn’t reaped?</p>

            <p>maybe the game just didn’t say the knight was converted at the end screen and made red on him, I don’t really know, Imperium told me to talk to someone discord so that’s what I will probably do, once I get an answer I will comeback here and inform you all</p>

            <p>In short with auto resolves, win with everyone classes are considered non-existant for all practical purposes. To which I get the logic, as it was one of my pet peves in town of salem. Where survivor or won executioner decide the winner at the end of the game, and it’s a variable that just negates the skill between the players. Did you intentionally let him live as evil… oh well unknown to you his personality is “always let the most people win”. You make similar assumptions as good, “oh evil doesn’t win as often so he’s siding with evil”. It is rarely is based on what happened that particular game, it usually winds up being biases from the persons personality combined with past game experiences. With normal classes etc… you can work to interpret what they are going to do, with their win condition. But when their win condition has already been met, or is indifferent to which sides win, it is often very unsatisfying for them to decide on their own whims. Yes in some cases it is cool when they make the decision based on which side tried to kill them, get them executed or helped them execute their target in scorneds case. But it does often kill the fun when it’s made based on things outside the current game.</p>
<p>Now neutral king out of the equasion, and knight vs single cult… I don’t know. I’d say it would take more current knowledge of the current winrates. Played out that’s an “everyone loses” ending, to which I do think it’s better to chose a winner based on which side has to do more work to get in the final 2.</p>

<p>but that does not look like it came from day. And htm saw knight in the endgame screen probably… so that would be a bug.</p>

            <p>Did you win as well?</p>
<p>If so, the auto resolve just kicked in, so it’s probably not a bug, even if you don’t like the auto resolve.</p>

            <p>What happened?<br>
I was a neut king and there was a knight and a CL, cult auto won even though knight wasn’t converted and I was neut king</p>
<p>What was SUPPOSED to happen?<br>
I think the game should have continued since I was neut king and not auto give it to cult<br>
Steps to reproduce:<br>
Well knight killed off the invoker, I protected myself and in the day cult auto won<br>
Comments:<br>
Is this a bug or does this always happen?</p>
