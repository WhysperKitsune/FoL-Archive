    <title>Using school shootings as names</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/using-school-shootings-as-names/47876</link>
    <description>Now, at the start of the game, I saw the names and while they appalled me, I didnt think much of it. That is until our #2 started making awful remarks to our number 7, whose name was Colombine. What he said sent me into an instant rage. Maybe I am off my rocker here, but after what happened in Florida, USA last week has sensitivity levels a little high. And to sit in your video game and have to watch people make fun of these shootings like this disgusts me. I understand there is to be done while they are acting like this, but I think it goes without saying that these 3 people should be perma banned period. Thoughts?

            <p>True enough if he did name it after the shooting which probably is, but hey its a basic name at the end</p>

            <p>Just because it hasn’t become uncivil and full of insults yet doesn’t mean that it won’t. Nothing good can come of continuing this. Future discussion of this won’t lead to anything meaningful.</p>
<p>The devs have spoken about it. And joking about things like this is clearly and obviously not okay, so there isn’t really any room for discussion.</p>

            <p>Now I understand that rules are rules whatever mods or any higher have a say and I do agree to a certain extent but are we not able to have discussion about or “debate” on it here?</p>
<p>Honestly I don’t know I checked the rules and the only thing that could possibly deny the most is probably rule 20.</p>
<p>“Leave your salt at home - no drama, no fueling the fire – just ignore bickering.”</p>
<p>But like, the discussion is in a sense still very much civil<br>
and again I understand the mod have already said “School shooter” = Ban, so you could say thats the end of it but I’m interested in the conversation and Peter and Bread could possibly want to continue discussing, is it a problem to continue this thread?</p>
<p>can this conversation continue or not is pretty much my question. For this specific topic or future reference</p>

Folks that are naming themselves school shooter names are going to find themselves suspended for 3x longer starting now~ it’s not funny, just don’t do it. :banhammer:</p>

<p>Noz pls. You should know better than to try to shame someone for trying to do the right thing. Making this forum post was unnecessary and the reports should have been done privately, but still.</p>

            <p>No. I told you I would put your disgusting sense of humor on blast for the world to see. Players name is Hannah. You will never silence justice. Now the entire world knows you like making fun of dead children. Shame on you. Have a nice day.</p>

            <p>I genuinely don’t think it’s offensive, but yeah I’m going to stop replying now</p>
<p>The only reason I replied was because of this -<br>

            <p>Sorry if this isnt the right place for this, but I think an open discussion is ok as long as it is kept in line. Maybe if we can get this person to see WHY it is so wrong, they will not be so toxic anymore in the future.</p>

            <p>Once again; Not the time nor the place for this discussion. If you end up getting banned and want to appeal to a moderator you can do it privately.</p>
<p>And you knew what you were doing could be deemed offensive when you did it, don’t even try to argue that.</p>

            <p>Your literally making jokes about dead children…It;s obvious you just don’t get it, and will never get it. Seek help, and during your ban, dig deep into that moral compass of yours and truly decide if poking fun at dead children is the kind of example you want to set. Nothing funny about school shootings. Period.</p>
