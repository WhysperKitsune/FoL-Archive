    <title>Players disconnecting after getting Reaped</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/players-disconnecting-after-getting-reaped/5598</link>
    <description>So often after night you see player disconnect, but he&#39;s still alive? Why? Obviously because he was reaped!! 
This disconnect announcement makes games more difficult and unfair for Reaper players. Everyone instantly knows there is reaper in game.  I&#39;d suggest making &quot;Players has left&quot; announcements after they get &quot;reaped&quot; to appear only after they are announced dead in game.</description>

            <p>Yeah. But my idea is to postpone leaving announcement <strong>only</strong> for <strong>reaped</strong> players.</p>

            <p>You know people can just leave while they aren’t reaped or don’t like their class</p>
