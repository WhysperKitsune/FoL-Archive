    <title>Possessor jumping change</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-jumping-change/6359</link>
    <description>As it is right now, the person who gets jumped into by the possessor swaps their number with the body of the now-dead possessor for purposes of speaking in the dead chat. This is extremely confusing and also means that any living priest will be able to immediately find the possessor. 

An idea to this would change it so that the person jumped into doesn&#39;t die. Instead of dying, any message they send will only be heard by the possessor. I feel that this would be really cool and suit the theme of the possessor really well, instead of weirdly disguising the person they jump into as a different number in the dead chat.</description>

            <p>It’s not so much about priest immediately finding possessor, it’s to remove unnecessary confusion in the dead chat. Swapping numbers just seems to be a real band-aid sort of fix to make this function work, and doesn’t really make much sense.</p>

            <p>You just make sure the priest is dead before jumping, or it is probable there is no priest. Otherwise it would he too strong.</p>

            <p>That would also be equally effective for removing unneeded confusion, but misses out on a cool opportunity.</p>
