          <p>The discussion in the Taskmaster thread made me think about an reverse gamemode, so here’s that.</p>
<p>The Unseen had won, taking over Castle Adiart. But now, the small remainder of the Blue Dragon is fighting to take it over again! The changes are are as follows: The Unseen becomes the uninformed majority, not knowing who the others are, while the Blue Dragon are now the informed minority. The number of Unseen and Blue Dragon that appear are swapped. Neutrals still spawn as normal. There are new classes, and the majority of existing classes are changed to spice things up. The Mastermind, Assassin and Sellsword will never spawn. The Blue Dragon starts with The Negotiator and The Insurgent. The faction cap for the Blue Dragon is 4. If the Negotiator dies, the newest member of the Blue Dragon other than the oldest killer will become the Negotiator, unless the only other member is the oldest killer, in which case they will become the Negotiator anyway. The Insurgent can’t be replaced.</p>
<p>The new classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><font color="steblue">The Negotiator</font></h2>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Blue Dragon Special</strong></font><br>
<strong>Undercover Rebel (Passive)</strong> -  You will appear to be a Servant to investigators for the first three nights.<br>
<strong>Busy (Passive)</strong> - Immune to Occupation.<br>
<strong>Call to Arms! (Day)</strong> - Call the Blue Dragon to arms, empowering them tonight. The Blue Dragon will receive a message when this is activated. The individual effects can be found on each class card. - Infinite Uses, 2 day cooldown.<br>

          <p>I have 2 suggestions.</p>
<p>A: Make it so that if the BD have no Killers then the oldest member other than the negotiator becomes an insergent.</p>
<p>B: Give the Soulcatchers revive a second use. Make it so that you can’t use it on the same person twice as well can give her the consume soul passive instead of the devoted passive. Between all of that it should make the Soulcatcher much more interesting than a nerfed priest.</p>
