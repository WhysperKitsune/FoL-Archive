    <description>Hi,
This is my first topic on the forums. Whenever I was ingame and saw someone type something negative like &quot;oh not this class again&quot; I could&#39;ve guessed that they probably got Court Wizard and many people doesn&#39;t enjoy the class because he doesn&#39;t do anything interesting. I think with my suggestion Court Wizard would have an important role amongst the other Support classes. The class names are good, I don&#39;t think they need to be changed.


**Day ability:**

_Mirror image_(1 uses): Cast an image of a _target_ making them immune to occupation,conversion,redirect, negative effects and if they are attacked their clone will be killed instead of them. _Target_ will be alerted if their clone were killed at night.

**Night ability:**

_Magic Barrier_: same ability as the current one. ://I think the current magic barrier works just perfectly. You can save investigative BDs from getting converted or mind warped

_Rewind time_(1 uses): Cast your _target_ back in time. They will gain an extra use of all of their abilities, they will be immune to conversion,occupation,redirect and if they are attacked at night and healable they will be healed.

Converted Court Wizard (Unseen Support)

**Day ability:**

_Cloak of shadows_(1 uses): Conjure a thick cloud around the castle making _the Assassin_ invisible at night. Whoever tries to visit _the Assassin_ will be prevented. Attacks from _the Assassin_ will  kill the target(s).(Bypasses night immunity,guards,heals)

**Night ability:**

_Blue mist_(2 uses):Cloak the Unseen in a Blue mist makin them appear as not suspicious to investigatives.

_Tornado_:same as the current one.</description>
