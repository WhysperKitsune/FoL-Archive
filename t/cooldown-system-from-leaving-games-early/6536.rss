    <description>The cooldown would stop players from rerolling their roles by leaving each game. It seems unreasonable to ban players that have to leave for other , eg internet breaks. Thanks for reading.</description>

            <p>5-10 minutes seems reasonable.<br>
Though it shouldn’t count if you leave while dead since what’s there to do as a dead evil/neutral/BD that priest doesn’t wanna resurrect anyways?.</p>

<p>Are you drunk Norm? If there is gonna be a cooldown it’s not gonna be that long. Imagine losing connection and being unable to play for 3 hours 'cause your connection sucks. I’ve had a really bad connection until some months ago and I feel the pain. If there is gonna be a cooldown it’s gonna be for few minutes.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree 1-3 hours is stupid (at least as a starting point), but I also think less than 20-30 minutes is a bad concept as well. Bottom line, I think it should be worth making leaving the game N1 if you aren’t a role  you wanted, a worse option than playing through the game until at least you die.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the 5 minutes wrist slap is needed in a game with a reconnect feature. IMO it should start at the average length of a game, and go up from there.</p>

            <p>or maybe its my idea, but the rate of growth goes up if they do it every 2 weeks, but it always starts at 5 mins<br>
so it could be 5 then 15 one 2-week-period,<br>
and 5 then 30 the next</p>

            <p>i was going with the 1-2-5 “round numbers” approach<br>
basically, if you want to have, say, different phases for a video game boss, you could have 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 4 doesnt really make sense</p>

            <p>I think it would be better to start at 5 mins, then 15 mins, then an hour, then 3 hours, then 10 hours, then 24., and every 3 days you go without leaving a game it goes down 1.</p>

            <p>maybe starts at 5 mins, then escalates to 15 mins, then half an hour, then an hour, then 2 hours, then 3 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 20 hours, 25 hours, 50 hours, and so on, but it resets every week, so that it never gets ridiculously long, and people who this happens to by chance aren’t severely punished</p>
