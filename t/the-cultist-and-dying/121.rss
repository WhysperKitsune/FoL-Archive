    <title>The Cultist And Dying</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-cultist-and-dying/121</link>
    <description>I am liking the idea of the cult however something has been troubling me for some time now.
I don&#39;t think people are gonna like becoming a cult member just to die the next night. it is way more likely that they will attempt to get the cult leader killed so they will survive. you need to find a way to encourage the cult members to die for these class to work or people will just hate cult

My idea is when cult members are killed by the cult leaders power they do die but instead of being totally useless they become 1 of 5 unique classes Depending on what they were before they joined the cult and died. for example, if a butler joined the cult and was killed by the cult leader he would become a Puppeteer.
also instead of talking with the with the rest of the dead at night you talk with all the living cult members at day so you can plan what you will do with your new classes.
of course, if you were to die in a way without being killed by the cult leader you will not get a new class and will talk with the normal dead instead with the living cult but you can still hear them at night

Class 1) The Snatcher(Cult_Social)
Night Ability 1:Night Cool
[1x] Steal The Body Of Your Host Controlling Everything they do tomorrow during the day(you are unable to use their day abilities or alter their Journal)

Class 2) (Cult_Investgative)
Night Ability 1: Journal Theif
[1x] Steal your targets Journal so the other cult members are able to read it(They don&#39;t lose it I just can&#39;t think of a better name then the journal thief)
Night Ability 2) Unravel Clue You Get A Clue To Your Targets Role (I believe you need 1 of the Investigative to get a clue because none of them at the moment get clue&#39;s right now)

Class 3) The Faceless (Cult_Support) 
Night Ability 1) Trick The Trickster 
The Cult Member you target ignores being occupied
Night ability 2) False Aura
[2-uses] [1 Night Cool Down] The Cult Member You target Appears as a blue dragon to all Blue dragon investigative results 

Class 4) Blood Guardian (Cult_Defence)
Night Ability 1: Blood Shield
The Cult Member you target becomes immune to death this night
(i honestly can&#39;t think of any other defence ability because the only defence for the blue dragon is the court wizard so the only class that can become the blood guardian is the court wizard)

Class 5) The Puppeteer (Cult_Offensive)
Night Ability 1: Pull The Strings
[2-uses] [1 Night Cool Down]
Control who your targets Target is this night(Will Fail If Your Target A killer)

If all living cult members are killed all the dead cult members who are part of these classes lose their powers and join the normal dead
doing this would make the cult members happy to die by the hand of the cult leader while still having a part in the game and would add a bit more options for the cult to do instead of convert kill, convert kill all the time</description>

            <p>If the cult got this (with a given of it only applying to sacrificed cultists), then paladin would need a day ability to counter this (I like “banish”) AND another ability not related to it.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure about all the suggestions here. The OP suggestion would completely break balance imo. If cult gets abilities while dead, the paladin should too.</p>
<p>The evil spirit haunting is also interesting, but it needs a 1 use limit for both abilities and only members that were sacrificed can do that. i don’t agree that evil spirits should be able to talk with cult members at night, that would reduce the value of apostle. Maybe they can use a 1 time crier message that only cult members see at the following night…so kinda like a townmessage but at night.</p>

            <p>I see what you’re saying. It would suck to get recruited and die instantly. If they were to be converted into another role, it would take some balancing. Otherwise it’d be like they aren’t losing any members. I do like the idea of them at least being able to still talk to the Cult even if they were sacrificed. At the moment the Cult is gonna be a somewhat rare spawn, so they’re a little lower on the list of things to mess around with. They haven’t really changed much since they were thought up. Once I have some time to look into it, I’ll see what we can do to make it more engaging for the Cultists.</p>

            <p>so during the day you haunt a single person to silence them so basically a dead blackmailer.<br>
however, I got to disagree with that night idea. if they visit the cult members it’s more likely for the person who visited the cult member to tell everyone and if everyone who can role block is dead.</p>
<p>the cult member is dead but a good idea none the less</p>

            <p>Possibly they become an Evil Spirit, which can move around and watch people. During the day they can <em>Haunt</em> people which makes you visible to them (they know you were a cultist) but they cannot speak for the rest of that day. At night you have a one-time use ability called <em>Inflict</em> which makes them unable to visit cult members that night (if they try to, they will receive a message saying that they were blocked as if a butler had visited them). Also the Evil Spirits can talk in Cult Chat at night.</p>

            <p>true I was thinking about doing that but I thought this way would give the cult more options instead of a single way to do things. the cult currently only have 2 classes if there was a single class they would become when they die it would be 3 while the black rose has around 12 classes.</p>
<p>if each Type had a class they would become it would become less boring for cult members and add more options like I said before.<br>
anyway if the cult were to only have 1 class they would become when they die what do you suggest it be?</p>

            <p>I am liking the idea of the cult however something has been troubling me for some time now.<br>
I don’t think people are gonna like becoming a cult member just to die the next night. it is way more likely that they will attempt to get the cult leader killed so they will survive. you need to find a way to encourage the cult members to die for these class to work or people will just hate cult</p>
<p>My idea is when cult members are killed by the cult leaders power they do die but instead of being totally useless they become 1 of 5 unique classes Depending on what they were before they joined the cult and died. for example, if a butler joined the cult and was killed by the cult leader he would become a Puppeteer.<br>
also instead of talking with the with the rest of the dead at night you talk with all the living cult members at day so you can plan what you will do with your new classes.<br>
of course, if you were to die in a way without being killed by the cult leader you will not get a new class and will talk with the normal dead instead with the living cult but you can still hear them at night</p>
<p>Class 1) The Snatcher(Cult_Social)<br>
Night Ability 1:Night Cool<br>
[1x] Steal The Body Of Your Host Controlling Everything they do tomorrow during the day(you are unable to use their day abilities or alter their Journal)</p>
<p>Class 2) (Cult_Investgative)<br>
Night Ability 1: Journal Theif<br>
[1x] Steal your targets Journal so the other cult members are able to read it(They don’t lose it I just can’t think of a better name then the journal thief)<br>
Night Ability 2) Unravel Clue You Get A Clue To Your Targets Role (I believe you need 1 of the Investigative to get a clue because none of them at the moment get clue’s right now)</p>
<p>Class 3) The Faceless (Cult_Support)<br>
Night Ability 1) Trick The Trickster<br>
The Cult Member you target ignores being occupied<br>
Night ability 2) False Aura<br>
[2-uses] [1 Night Cool Down] The Cult Member You target Appears as a blue dragon to all Blue dragon investigative results</p>
<p>Class 4) Blood Guardian (Cult_Defence)<br>
Night Ability 1: Blood Shield<br>
The Cult Member you target becomes immune to death this night<br>
(i honestly can’t think of any other defence ability because the only defence for the blue dragon is the court wizard so the only class that can become the blood guardian is the court wizard)</p>
<p>Class 5) The Puppeteer (Cult_Offensive)<br>
Night Ability 1: Pull The Strings<br>
[2-uses] [1 Night Cool Down]<br>
Control who your targets Target is this night(Will Fail If Your Target A killer)</p>
<p>If all living cult members are killed all the dead cult members who are part of these classes lose their powers and join the normal dead<br>
doing this would make the cult members happy to die by the hand of the cult leader while still having a part in the game and would add a bit more options for the cult to do instead of convert kill, convert kill all the time</p>
