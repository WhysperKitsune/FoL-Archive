            <p>Bug reports ain’t really the right place to report someone. Please do it in-game next time. (Even though in this case it was most likely just luck.)</p>

            <p>You can report at the end of a game, that give’s the dev’s the logs. As far as I know currently the only way to really cheat at this game which would give those results, is the assasain was talking on skype with the king.</p>
<p>That being said it could just be a total coincidence. He may have whispered a random person on day 1. and happened to have checked the assasain on n1. Assasain would have shown as unseen until your death, thus been detectable.</p>
<p>I’d have reported, noted “Seems fishy for him to find both the unseen immidiately”. If that’s the only time the guy had been reported the dev’s would probably have done nothing, if the guy had a long track record of almost implausible levels of “lucky finds” then action would be taken against him.</p>
