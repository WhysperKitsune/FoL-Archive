          <p><strong>Good day. This is a disinterest check. In this thread, you will express how disinterested you are in these ideas, such that I don’t feel guilty about not hosting a DR game for a good year for the sake of my own health. With that said, positive feedback will be tolerated. Somewhat. You’re on thin ice.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>So, Dangling Grandpas. The old DR. In the post-game of DR5, several problems with the overall formula were brought up, mostly by eevee, in particular about several problems with the game, which I will summarise in three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Mastermind is pointless, and feels either too involved or too disconnected from the rest of the game.</li>
<li>The fact that as there are less and less people there is more and more content makes the game become less active as it goes on due to having less itneractions.</li>
<li>In a simmilar vein, players who are more likely to do outlandish things (usually leading to murder), or in other words the most active players, are more likely to leave the game earlier, exaccerbating the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with the second two can be fixed, but the first problem is quite thorny. The game needs to have some sort of underlying tension; if it just Stops Happening once five murders have taken place the finale becomes a major anticlimax, but it’s fairly clear that the current syestem of Masterminds just simply isn’t working.</p>
<p>How exactly do we solve all these issues? Well, Ladies, Gentlemen, Gentlefolk and other distinct entities of the forum of lies forum mafia forums, I have created an innovative solution.</p>
<p>Introducing <strong>TRUE ENDINGS</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual thing of having one singular wincon (usually “You win if you escape and you lose if you die”), players will have a set of three  conditions, like such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>BAD ENDING</strong></font> - Die or fail to escape.<br>
<font color="green"><strong>GOOD ENDING</strong></font> - Escape at any cost.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> - [Redacted]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how the game would function. All players will start the game knowing only their bad and good ending conditions, which will usually be identical to the  Participant wincon. However, all players will also have a condition on their classcard, such as this condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unbridled Rage</strong> - If [player] dies, you will learn your <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> once you discover of their death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon one of these conditions being fulfilled, players may gain new abilities, but most pertinently their wincons will update to include a <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font>. Let’s see what would happen if this hypothetical card learned their true ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="red"><strong>BAD ENDING</strong></font> - Die or fail to escape.<br>
<font color="green"><strong>GOOD ENDING</strong></font> - Escape at any cost.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> - Escape after destroying a room on the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if you notice, the player has  a chance of winning a <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> by going against the rest of the players and performing something that has a very real chance of getting someone killed. Players will have an incentive, upon learning their full win condition, to go out of their way to do shocking and potentially dangerous things to potentially get the bragging rights of acheiving a true ending.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of this system? Well:</p>
<ul>
<li>All players are now potentially incentivised to do odd and provocative things <em>other than</em> simply murdering people, making the game overall more exciting as more Things™ happen every phase. You might have to go out of your way to do something dangerous to <em>get</em> your <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> condition revealed to you.</li>
<li>The problem with the game getting less exciting as it goes on is mitigated by the fact that as the game goes on, more and more players will learn their Wilcard-like conditions for their <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font>, making the later phases of the game more eventful as it goes on.</li>
<li>The tension of the Mastermind (that the seemingly helpful people near you could secretly be working against you) is replicated by the fact that players, driven to extremes by the circumstances, could begin to have more and more selfish motivations to potentially win the game as a <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font> instead of merely cooperating to get a <font color="green"><strong>GOOD ENDING</strong></font>.</li>
<li>Lore! The game’s lore will become more important despite the lack of a Mastermind, because conditions based around lore could be used to determine a character’s motivations, and how those would lead to their <font color="gold"><strong>TRUE ENDING</strong></font>, keeping the incentive to explore the game’s lore.</li>
<li>Instead of players becoming Wildcards due to the rand, they become Wildcards due to their own choices, increasing player freedom and agency in the way the game’s story will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with the map size is still extant, of course, but I have certain ideas for fixing that, although I will not publicisie them as I will this system.</p>
<p>So, what are your thoughts? Is there some critical flaw that I’m missing? What is love? Would you play in a game with this sytem (that I will not host until I’m less of a hot mess as a person)?</p>
<p>Please, scream your thoughts into the void in the ceaseless abyss of the thread below! I look forward to hearing your ideas</p>
