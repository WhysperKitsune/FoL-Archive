    <description>(2R1MB) 2 Rooms and a Mini Boom

2 Rooms and a Boom, with only 9 players. Hosted by NightX.

# Rules:
You may not privately communicate with people not in your room, and all communications must go through me in some way. Other than that, anything goes! I will however announce who is communicating with who in your server.
Please don’t be a jerkface.
Have fun!

# The Game:
The game is based around two main teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.
On the Red Team, there is a Bomber, on the Blue Team there is a President.
All players will be split into two rooms,which will be represented by Discord Servers.
Every round a number of players will be chosen to be sent to the other room.

At the end of the game, the Blue Team wins if the President and Bomber are in separate rooms, while the Red Team win if they are in the same room.

In additon, there are roles which are on neither team, they are on Grey Team. Details will be given below.
# Electing a GLORIOUS LEADER
At the start of the game, a random player in either room will be chosen as OUR GLORIOUS LEADER for that room.

At any time, a player may attempt to Usurp a leader, by doing /nominate [new leader]. Should the majority of other players in the room do /approve, the leader will be replaced.
At any time, a Leader may give their leadership away to another player.
At the end of each round, the Leader must have chosen players to send to the other room, or else RNG will pick.

# Color/Card sharing.
During each round, players may do /card share [Player] or /color share [player. If the other player /accepts, both will show each other either their full rolecard or just the team they are on.
You may also /card reveal [player] or /color reveal [player] to simply reveal your card to them.

Finally, you may /public card reveal or /public color reveal to reveal your card/color to absolutely everyone else in the room.

# Rounds:
Each round the Leader of each room will send Hostages to the other room

Round 1 - 2 Hostages and 2 days to chose
Round 2 - 2 Hostages and 2 days to chose
Round 3 - 1 Hostages and 2 days to chose
Round 4 - 1 Hostages and 2 day to chose

# Role List:
[color=STEblue]President
Enforcer/Conspirator
Vampire/Werewolf
Medic[/color]

[color=red]Bomber
Enforcer/Conspirator
Vampire/Werewolf
Medic[/color]

[color=grey]Hot Potato[/color]

# Card Clarifications:

Enforcer - You can force two players to card share. To use the ability: Say to the two players: “You must reveal your card to one another.” Then they shall card share, you can’t use it on yourself but another enforcer can use it on you. You cannot use this on people who are unable to share.

Vampire - Any player who card shares with you that isn’t your color gains the “seduced” condition. All “seduced” players must vote exactly what you vote. You can also force them to do any action, you can even reject any action.

Werewolf - Any player that card shares or color shares with you gains the “bitten” condition. Any player who card shares or color shares with a “bitten” player is also bitten. All bitten players must answer any question any alpha wolves ask as honestly and informatively as possible.

Conspirator (Pug Version) - Any player who card shares with you and has the opposite team’s color gains the “traitor” condition. If you have the traitor condition, your win objective is changed to that of the opposing team. It will not work on people who aren’t red or blue, oe primary characters. (Bomber, President and Greys)

Medic - Any player that card shares with you has all conditions removed, say if a player is a traitor. they will no longer be a traitor. You are not immune to effects though.

# Grey Team Win Conditions:

Hot Potato - If you card or color share with a player you swap cards with them. You lose.

Note: Cards that require you to card share with someone need you to do it with whoever had it last. If they got their card swapped you need to do it again.

Swapping cards also removes all of its conditions.
