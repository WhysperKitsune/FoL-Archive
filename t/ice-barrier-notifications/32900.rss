    <description>I noticed today that on the CW card, if you go under notifications where it tells you what the system will output when you use an ability, Barrier still has Ice wards description &quot;you cast an ice ward on yourself&quot;. 

Obviously not a big deal but I thought I&#39;d say something.</description>
