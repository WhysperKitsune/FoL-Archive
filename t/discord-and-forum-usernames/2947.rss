    <description># Discord Usernames + Forum Usernames

We in the Throne of Lies staff love that both the Discord and the Forums have become more than just a thriving community, it&#39;s become like a family!

People have also been using both equally as much but there is something that has become quite apparent, and that is user-names.

We appreciate that people are free to name themselves whatever they want but it&#39;s hard to keep track of who is who with the Forums if the Discord people don&#39;t keep the Forum up to date.

With the screen shot below, you can keep us updated on who you are on the Discord server by putting your Discord username (not nickname) in the box in your Preferences -&gt; Profile section.
