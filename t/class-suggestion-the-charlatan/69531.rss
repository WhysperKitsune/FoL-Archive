    <title>Class Suggestion: The Charlatan</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-charlatan/69531</link>
    <description>**Class Name: The Charlatan**

**Neutral Social**

The Charlatan role is similar to what the term Charlatan means: a person falsely claiming to have a special knowledge or skill. This class will in essence, copy the abilities of other classes and use them as their own. To do this the Charlatan during the day will choose someone and gain an &quot;asset&quot;. This &quot;asset&quot; will be specific to the class type the target was. Each asset does a different action during the night and can be stored for later use, or stored to gain an enhanced ability if they gain another asset of the same type. The Charlatan can help both BD and Evils well in the multitude of choices they have. Do they use their assets to help a side? Do they reveal info on what class type a person is? How do they make sure they survive in the end?

**Passives:** None

**Day Ability : Acquisition** (Infinite uses)

-Choose a target and gain an Asset of their class type. You will not know what type you acquired until the following night. You cannot gain an Asset from the same target twice in a row. An asset from a Special role will give an asset to that which you have the most number of(Random if tied).


**Night Ability 1: Use Assets** (Refillable uses based on which assets are acquired)

Use ONE asset of a type to do the corresponding action:

Social: See all whispers to and from a target
Support: Heal yourself
Investigative: Gain a hint towards the class type of the target(Similar to princess for clairty)
Offense: Occupy a target
Killer: Bleed a target, they will die in 1 day unless healed

**Night Ability 2: Enhanced Assets** (Refillable uses based on which assets are acquired)

Use TWO assets of a type to do the corresponding action:

Social: See all whispers the following day
Support: Heal yourself and a target
Investigative: Discover a targets exact class
Offense: Occupy a target and ignore any occupation immunity
Killer: Attack a target

**Goal:** Survive to the end of the game

This is my first class suggestion, all criticisms and suggestions are welcome. I do think some of the asset abilities may be a bit weak, but because of the diversity I didn&#39;t want to make them too strong.</description>

<p>I don’t really like the goal but I do think that it’s a very good class.</p>
<p>Maybe change the goal to something else?</p>

            <p>I think this would be a great class once you remove the randomness aspect and give it more survivability.  Maybe let him have the option of using an asset or stoneskinning at night?  It would also be nice if you could elaborate on how he shows up to investigative abilities.  Like can he disguise his faction and class type?</p>
<p>By the way, why can’t he can’t get Foresight or Eradicate from special classes?  Or guard from King? <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But to sum up I think this is a fantastic idea and great for your first class suggestion!</p>
