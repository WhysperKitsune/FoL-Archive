    <title>BASTARD SWORD - Interest Check</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bastard-sword-interest-check/88217</link>
    <description>Title. I&#39;m making a thread here so I&#39;d get feedback on what people want/do not want in the upcoming bastard game as I want to make it a fun bastard game rather than one where everyone just pulls their hair out trying to understand what&#39;s happening. 

I&#39;m still refining the game, so I&#39;d like some feedback. From the get-go here are some of the things I&#39;m gonna do.

* No conversions. Should be obvious, but people in general just dislike conversions and they don&#39;t really add much to the game to compensate.
* No multiball. Only one wolfteam should suffice. I want the game to be bastard, not annoying. Plus, literally every time that a multiball game gets hosted on this site one of the wolf factions just straight up doesn&#39;t bother to play at all. 
* No lying in the OP or about role card. Being a bastard game, the host will lie from time to time. Though the OP and the role card, though not the entire private thread itself, will be free from lies. 
* Limited flip tampering. I don&#39;t think anyone on this site would want to play a game that becomes almost flipless after CFM2.
* Limited shitposting. Personally I feel that Geyde went overdrive when it came to shitposting in CF2. The entire goal of this game is to be a game similar to Eevee&#39;s CFM2 or Anime uPick, not a shitpost in game form.

What&#39;s still on the table.
* Serial Killers, or 3p roles that are basically an entire faction by themselves. Some people dislike them, but I don&#39;t feel like the amount of dislike they receive on this site is enough to completely rule them out. Plus, SKs on this site generally die before late-game so they don&#39;t impact the game by much.
* Jesters. I get that some people hate them *cough*IciandOrange*cough*, but except game-ending jesters they don&#39;t warp the game too much unlike multiball or conversions.
* Dead interaction. Honestly, I feel like the only reason DI is disliked on this site was because of Geyde solving Drakengard from beyond the grave with Boss&#39; help.
* Lost Wolves. Like, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a FM here that used LWs, so I&#39;m still keeping it.
* Millers, Godfathers, Tailors, and Framers. Duh.

What&#39;s unlikely, but still not completely off the table.
* Survivors. Come the fuck on, you know very well that I can make more creative and fun 3p roles than this.
* Cop sanities. Feels like a lazy way to fuck with cop checks.</description>

            <p>If ressurection is added to the game then it’ll be extremely limited.</p>
<p>I absolutely hate this mechanic as it’s way too fucking townsided so if it exists then it likely won’t be like a ToS Retributionist.</p>

            <p>Like, what I want to imitate from Eevee’s games is the feeling of being in the unknown. Like, in a normal match you kind of have a decent idea of what can happen. In an Eevee game, literally anything can happen. I want to replicate this feeling without breaking the game or making people miserable.</p>

<p>this is probably my favorite<br>
mainly because these have niches in setups that can’t really be filled by other roles / conditionals in an interesting manner</p>
<p>for lw medium you could instead have them be informed of the entire scumteam once one dies…but that doesn’t have the interesting element of getting to chat with the dead wolf to know what plans are happening and such</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>if you break down dead interaction down to its barest components<br>
it’s just interacting with dead players<br>
dead players having an influence on the game through mechanics</p>
<p>what opportunities does that yield<br>
what does being dead do to affect the gamestate</p>
<p>there’s bound to be something you can do with dead interaction to make the mechanic interesting</p>
<p>however<br>
in most cases, it serves only to diminish the effect of kills<br>
this isn’t fun to play against since it makes the scum’s plays inherently weaker as long as the dead interaction is substantial in any form<br>
this is amplified further if it extends past purely night dead interaction</p>
<p>and mechanics where dead players decide what [x] role does are often actively uninteresting because players who are dead will tend to not keep high levels of investment for such a small portion of the game</p>
<p>a few ideas that may be interesting which incorporate dead interaction as an idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost wolf medium [general use] / scum medium [as a means for communication between scum groups as a part of a greater team]</li>
<li>effects enabled off of a target chosen immediately after the player in question’s death (using the vengeful portion of the Templar from SFoL 53 as an example for how such a mechanic might work, but be creative with this) - eliminates issue of really having to continue tuning into the game</li>
<li>conditional medium (think something like current mystic in FoL or a medium that can only interact with a certain pool of dead players [either enabled through specific abilities or set in stone at the start of the game])</li>
</ul>
<p>some standard stuff that can work but is in general pretty trash:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited medium - requires engagement from players post death because they <em>could</em> have a limited, yet possibly important, impact on the game. This is trash because they aren’t <em>really</em> doing much other than tossing a single message usually</li>
<li>resurrection (any form) - if not handled properly, this will often put the game into a stranglehold situation where the confirmed town player controls thread (it’s somewhat optimal to let them do this)</li>
<li>dead chat voting effects - you’d have to have a good reason to put one of these in so that it’s not just miserable to play with / against</li>
</ul>
<p>don’t put these in game:</p>
<ul>
<li>full mediums (even if it’s just nightchat) - please god no you know this sucks. I went over earlier why this sucks. It’s going to suck. Don’t do it.</li>
<li>TOTALLY WACKY STANDARD REVIVERS WITH NO CONDITIONS OR DECAY - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Deg7VrpHbM"><strong>This is for you</strong></a>
</li>
<li>roles that action while dead - this is the closest on this list to working given that you can just staple on a limited condition to it and call it a day, but if people are asking “why bother” legitimately, there’s something wrong with the design</li>
</ul>

<p>You know my stance on 3ps, it’s in my title. When I see/hear suspicion of a 3p, I want that person dead. I hate 3ps so much. I think mafia is a better game when there are two clear-cut sides.</p>
<p>Jesters are 3ps.</p>
<p>Dead interaction is ~fine as long as it’s implemented in a way that doesn’t break the game.</p>
<p>Lost wolves are fine, though I sometimes feel like they are like 3ps who share their wincon with wolves, and 3ps… I think I’d rather have lost wolves than actual 3ps, all things considered.</p>
<p>Millers/Framers/etc. are fine to have. I think they are <em>under</em>used here, rather than <em>over</em>used.</p>

            <p>i’ve tried to make dead communication work (ToLFM, where the balancing mechanism was the more people talked about the dead interaction and relied on it and speculated about it the sooner it would dissapear)  and it didn’t work out… <em>badly</em> in that game? but it only lasted a single game so I don’t think we can call that a good sample size or an example of how it can work</p>

            <p>as for dead interaction, it’s basically in the same space as a lot of common bad FM mechanics in that it’s not inherrently busted but the form in which it is <em><strong>almost always</strong></em> implemented is unfathomably busted, and people don’t seem to be willing to deviate from that?</p>

            <p>i get what you were trying to communicate is that you’re going for a more restrained style of bastard game, which is <em>good</em>, but I think trying to communicate that with games whose big problem was always that they included stuff that was just eevee being too clever for his own good is probably not the best idea?</p>
<p>and also i have no idea why you’re trying to convince people to <em>join</em> your game by advertising there is a high likelihood of serial killers, a mechanic that pretty much nobody likes nowadays?</p>

            <p>feel like throwing in a bunch of the classic ‘these elements make the game more unstable, which consequently leads to players having less fun, don’t do these’ list items in a bastard game with the justification being that it’s bastard can very easily lead to an ultimately unsatisfying conclusion where these elements are not altered in a way that addresses the reason that they make the game unfun and are instead just thrown in there because one can.</p>
<p>not super interested in a game with excessive 3ps/dead-interaction/copcheck-ruiners, feel like these things could be done in a creative way that tackles and negates the reasons why people don’t like them in games but that doesn’t feel like the vision of this game</p>
<p>im obv not miss game design, it’s not easy to do all of those things and i have my own tastes in forum mafia which are a lot blander than most peoples’ tastes, but my personal feedback is a hard no atm because i think those features make a game tiresome for myself.</p>

            <p>I normally dislike elements that fuck with cop checks unless.</p>
<p>A) The element is an aware Miller. The correct play in this case is to effectively openclaim it as soon as you can, and I like this because it allows plays such as fakeclaiming Miller as a wolf preemptive defense against red checks or fakeclaiming Miller as V for reactions .</p>
<p>B) The element is a Godfather with some way for town to predict that the GF exists in the game, like in the DR mash I had to can due to having an accident while running it where Junko was a GF but Shuichi, the cop, had a passive that told him that the wolves had exactly 1 GF in the match. This voids green checks until the GF is yeeted.</p>
<p>However, since this game is bastard then I’m not sticking to these rules. The game will still be normally solvable with reads as I won’t pull stupid shit like lying to a player about their own alignment, but mech fuckery will be highly unreliable.</p>

            <p>cop checks should be immutable in my opinion, this one is more up for debate but any roles that fuck with them dont work.</p>
<p>If there’s the rare tailor or godfather or framer, people will ignore the possibility of those roles and just treat the check as fact. Either the role is useless all game, or it triggers, and then the game just gets less fun, it’s optimal to trust the check and when it’s wrong it just sucks but there’s almost no counterplay.</p>
<p>If theres a ton of cop check fuck up items, then cop checks because pretty useless.</p>
<p>The only way that this can be played around is if there’s some kind of mechanic that can directly track, counter, or confirm cop checks and cop check fuckery. Otherwise it’s just mechanical swing that doesn’t end up as fun for one faction or another</p>

            <p>Jesters are fun only if you know explicitly about their existence and make enough of an impact to have to play around them. Otherwise horrible role, never pans out in a mash.</p>
<p>Dead interaction sucks, unless done in very creative ways where deaddies have little to no actual game influence, wolfing in a game where a person who has died can still supply reads makes it significantly less fun to play the game</p>
