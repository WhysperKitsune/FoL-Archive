    <title>What is your best forum post?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/what-is-your-best-forum-post/71904</link>
    <description>As opposed to the &quot;Best/Worst Forum Quotes&quot; page, which is largely humorous, I&#39;ve been thinking a bit recently about the posts I am most proud of here on the ToL forums. Although the majority of my posting here has been in one FM/FoL game or another, I think the two posts I am personally most proud of are two larger write-ups I have done on the state of Throne of Lies itself. I&#39;ve usually had a decent sense for balance, but I am particularly happy with the points I made in these two posts, and very pleased with how they are structured.

I&#39;m sure some of you must have posts of your own that you are proud of making. Although neither of mine are from a forum game, feel free to include one of those if you had a killer reads-list, or an amazing plan, or you made a joke so good you think about it to this day. I am genuinely curious what all of you guys feel your personal best posts are. If you&#39;d let me know which of your posts you really like, and why, I think this could end up being a really cool and interesting thread.</description>

            <p>Fine serious. My proudest moment was when I won the first Behind The Masks because I had no idea what was going on and there were loads of people from other sites who had played before. It was pretty much just a mixture of luck and not being targeted because I acted dumb but I was still super proud.</p>
