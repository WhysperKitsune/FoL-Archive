    <title>Give Aristocrat / Apostle the ability to grant royal blood</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/give-aristocrat-apostle-the-ability-to-grant-royal-blood/47452</link>
    <description>Royal Blood makes it too easy for someone to confirm that they&#39;re not the Mastermind or a starting evil.  While it&#39;s possible for a royal to be converted, it&#39;s never possible for a starting evil to be royal, so anyone who steps up in the Royal step to replace a king is instantly and uncontrovertably cleared of any suspicion of being the starting Mastermind or the NK.

To open a loophole in this and avoid clearing BDs of suspicion too easily, I suggest giving Aristocrats and Apostles a passive that lets anyone in their faction step up to become king as a Royal if the Aristocrat / Apostle themselves are Royal.  (The Aristocrat is always royal, but for the Apostle, this would mean that only converted Nobles would be able to use this ability.)

Possibly this would also extend to the Sorcerer (who would not know that an Aristocrat / Apostle is opening the door for them until the opportunity presents itself - as a reminder, remember that a Sorcerer who becomes king turns into an evil / cult king, not a psycho king.  Giving them the option to step up would reveal to them that an Aristocrat / Apostle exists, but that&#39;s not really a big deal.)

Having the Mastermind step up to become king would be a huge risk, obviously.  And this wouldn&#39;t be something that could be done easily (you&#39;d need a converted Noble who hadn&#39;t become Assassin / Cult Leader, at the exact moment when a new king is chosen.)  But I think it would add a new range of potential claims for roles that currently have trouble claiming, and would give people another avenue to cast doubt on a newly-elected king.

Possibly, this should extend to a Possessor having Royal Blood while possessing someone who had that feature.</description>

<p>Well, they don’t all have to step up (in fact, doing so might make it obvious something’s up, since there would be too many nobles - and you <span class="bbcode-i">definitely</span> wouldn’t want to step up if you previously claimed a non-noble class!)</p>

</aside>
<p>It’d obviously be extremely risky for them to actually become king - but if they’re claiming Princess (a common MM claim) they would definitely want to be able to step up in the noble step, probably hoping that someone else wins.  And while losing your MM to make them king is bad, it’s far preferable to having them lynched or executed because they failed to step up in the noble step after claiming Princess.</p>
<p>(Honestly, it suddenly occurs to me that a vastly easier solution here might be to just…  make the starting Mastermind a Noble, inherently.  It’d require some backstory tweaks, but it’s not hard to imagine that they’re actually a disgruntled noble seeking power.  It would make Princess claims easier for them while being somewhat risky because becoming King after N3 would cost the Unseen its ability to convert.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Idk maybe? Who are you to say? Just because you step up doesn’t mean you will be voted in as King. I could see a MM stepping up to back up a Princess claim.</p>

            <p>Not hard to solve. Just agree on who will step up if the king dies before hand with your night chat.</p>
<p>Kinda like the Nobles did back with noble twins.</p>

<p>This isn’t a noble passive. It’s just if he is converted.</p>
