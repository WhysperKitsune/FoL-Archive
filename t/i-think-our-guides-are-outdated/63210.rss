    <description>Hello Guys

I was just saying that new a guide for fake claims. 

Hopefully for you, I posted a new one one Reddit, since my last guide was outdated after the arrival of the Sellsword. Still the Prince is not in danger. And Adventurous players in the BD might want to try to the Pseudo-Prince Meta, 

So to be short some classes are easy to claim. 
from easiest to hardest

Sheriff, Paladin, Physician, Alch, Knight, CW and Merc are the easy claims.

Princess, Butler, Drunk, Observer, Hunter Scorned and Noble are the Hard claim

Inq, Mystic and Prince are our impossible. You only claim prince as a Member of the BD

------------------

Dangerous Classes in a Prince are Sellsword, Enforcer, Sage, Ritualist, Nightwatch, Poacher and all NK.
Hoverer Sorc can have problem when the prince protector is protected by a physician or an Alchemist
Reaper have problem with the Knight
Possessor puppet string is weak to physicians, while his possess is weak to knight. 


Here is the post https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroneOfLiesGame/comments/8kf2ie/new_guide_for_13_thrones_of_lies/


----
Now I was talking about it, but I a play that can be very effecient is the pseudo-prince meta. you have the advantage of the prince Meta, collecting claims and the play will be focuses toward a bd who&#39;s willing to take the hit for the prince. Exemple. a Mystic, a paladin, it can be even more effecient with the Physician, the Hunter, The Court Wizard or Butler. Since theses classes have abilities that can protect them from attacks. 

For exemple, the Sage can firewall the Hunter, the Assassin will still die to a bear if he attack. 


SO, we can discuss now.</description>

            <p>Its unique, so if it is a Sorc game, the Real Inq will probably Stab you<br>
And if it is not Sorc game good luck.</p>
<p>Hoverer, if you are the Fool. Inq is a very good claim. everyone will just exe you, saying, wow. this is totally possessor or reaper. Good luck trying to fake claim INQ.</p>
