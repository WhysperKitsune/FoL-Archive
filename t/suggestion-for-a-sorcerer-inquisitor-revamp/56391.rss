    <description>**_Sorcerer_**

_Perception_ - **(Additional Effect)** If the Sorcerer selects a class for Magic Dust and there are two of them present in the game, one if they are unique, or zero if they cannot spawn such as a Sheriff in a Cult game, then Perception will notify the user with the message &quot;You sense that your current disguise may not be deceptive enough.&quot; 

_Magic Dust_ - **(Reworked)** The Sorcerer selects a class and will cause the Sorcerer to gain its investigative results until Magic Dust is used again. Will not hide the Sorcerer&#39;s status as a magic user. If the Sorcerer selects a class that is not immune to occupation or redirection, then players who attempt to occupy you or change your target will believe it succeeded. Additionally, you will know who you would&#39;ve been redirected to if a player attempts to change your target. Infinite uses.

_Magic Cloak_ - **(Changed)** Does not hide the Sorcerer&#39;s status as a magic user anymore. Three uses.

The Sorcerer&#39;s other abilities remain unchanged.

Reasoning: Currently, the entire point behind the Inquisitor&#39;s purpose is to be a class that can counter the Sorcerer right now is flipped upside-down. Inquisitors right now rely purely on BD to find the Sorcerer unless they are good scum-readers as the Sorcerer has four usages of day abilities that will flip the Inquisitor&#39;s results. The idea behind this rework is to shift the Sorcerer&#39;s current strengths and makes them nigh-undetectable to BD thus requiring them to fully rely on the Inquisitor to deal with the Sorcerer. Unseen and Cult investigative and offensive roles will also be affected otherwise this could result in both evils being outed.

**_Inquisitor_**

_Holy Blessing_ - **(Reworked)** Immune to death at night until the fourth day. Circle of Death will also result in no kills if used on the Inquisitor. If the Sorcerer dies, the Inquisitor remains immune to conversion for the rest of the game.

_Ruthless Efficiency_ - **(Changed)** Unusable until the third night.

The Inquisitor&#39;s other abilities remain unchanged. The Inquisitor can now be converted to either the Templar for the Unseen or the Seeker for the Cult.

Reasoning: Holy Blessing&#39;s current state is absolutely clunky as it requires evils to waste a night to get through the barrier, but night immunity is required to prevent early-game deaths as like other neutrals. My proposal limits the immunity only to the first three nights but guarantees it against any number of hits. The immunity to Circle of Death should also help BD&#39;s communication with the Inquisitor, as Knights and Physicians would have no risk to guard them past the third night. The nerf to Ruthless Efficiency is obvious as right now smart Inquisitors are basically a second NK that stops killing when the first one dies, and also gives a chance for Sorcerers to fight back instead of being yolo-stabbed before Inquisitors lose their immunity

**_Templar_** (Unseen - Social)

**Passives**

_Nobody Expects The Spanish Inqusition_ - Your visits will be hidden from others at night.

_Heresy on Three Counts_ - Allows the Sorcerer to speak directly with the rest of the Unseen in the same manner as Mystic&#39;s Link Minds. Instead of showing names, it will instead show the classes of each player.

**Night Abilities**

_Find Magic_ - Check if a player is a magic user. The Court Wizard, Paladin, Mystic, Illusionist, Sage, Sorcerer, and the Cult are all magic users.

_Surprise and Fear_ - Attacks a player, killing them them if they are a Blue Dragon-aligned magic user. One usage.

Reasoning: Inquisitors should be neutral. As of right now BD puts in far too much trust in the Inquisitor, more than other BD claims at times, due to their automatically proven nature and their shared goals of chasing down the Sorcerer. The entire point of making a convertible Inquisitor is to remove their automatic confirmation. The idea of the Templar is a class to coordinate the Unseen and the Sorcerer while also keeping Surprise and Fear as a means to keep faking their status as an Inquisitor while potentially scoring an additional KPN for the Unseen. The additional potential KPN and coordination with the Sorcerer should make up for converting a neutral.

            <p>It’s somewhat tricky to balance a converted neut. Ala the Sellsword they should be stronger as a converted neut does not reduce the total of BD, so at least a bonus kill should do the trick. The issue here is finding targets as the only BD-aligned MUs in an Unseen game are CWs and Mystics, and even they aren’t always guaranteed to spawn in the game.</p>

<p>Agreed. That’s why one of my reworks turned Inquisitor into an opposing faction rather than a hardcounter and my other one made it a Neutral Investigative with nothing to do with Sorcerer.</p>

            <p>Templar would be an Unseen convert, so putting Paladin there is kind of unnecessary. The rest, yeah. Theoretically even a CW&gt;Sage&gt;Assassin&gt;MM pre-d4 would should up as magic. In short, anyone who started the game as a CW, Mystic, or Sorcerer would be considered magic users in an Unseen game. I would also add Princess as a magic user as the current MU list is a bit low and this would give the Sorc more plausible deniability if an Inq found them.</p>
<p>And I also addressed the last post in Holy Blessing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>u know that is the exact reason they added the inquistor?</p>
<p>Because they can win with sorc?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Inquisitor was added as a counter to the Sorcerer. The problem here is that because of Inquisitor being an unique role that only spawns with the Sorcerer and that has their goals partially aligned with BD, they’re pretty much automatically confirmed and trusted. It basically goes to what Sketch has said regarding benign neutral class:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a “benign” Neutral class to be fair, it can choose only two of the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be unconvertable</li>
<li>Largely helpful or useful to BD</li>
<li>Easily confirmable</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The Inquisitor violates this as they cannot be converted, they are helpful to BD as they both require the Sorcerer to die, and they’re easily confirmable as it’s impossible to fakeclaim Inq without BD realizing that it’s not a Sorc game or the real Inq getting you killed due to being an unique role. The Inquisitor was made to keep a check on the Sorcerer, but the problem here is that there is no check on the Inquisitor.</p>

            <p>Not an issue. The whole point of conversion is to undermine a player’s wincon. Inquisitor is impossible to fake claim if there is a real one because the real one will just night kill you.</p>
<p>Usually I don’t like Neut Conversions because it can screw over both the Unseen and the Neut. This is not one of those times.</p>

<p>I’d give this 1 use at most. And I wouldn’t refund it on falure. Otherwise it would be broken.</p>
<p>Also give Templar find magic</p>
<p>Also make sure that Inquisitor still had his visitless passive.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer and the Unseen are on the same side, which means the Templar also helps the Unseen by helping the Sorcerer. Having the only class that can find the Sorcerer removed from the game while also coordinating with the Sorcerer in order to preventing wasted nights on both sides of the aisle, and additionally gaining an additional KPN if Unseen knows any CWs or Mystics makes it an extremely strong class that makes up for the neut conversion.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong><em>Sorcerer</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Perception</em> - <strong>(Additional Effect)</strong> If the Sorcerer selects a class for Magic Dust and there are two of them present in the game, one if they are unique, or zero if they cannot spawn such as a Sheriff in a Cult game, then Perception will notify the user with the message “You sense that your current disguise may not be deceptive enough.”</p>
<p><em>Magic Dust</em> - <strong>(Reworked)</strong> The Sorcerer selects a class and will cause the Sorcerer to gain its investigative results until Magic Dust is used again. Will not hide the Sorcerer’s status as a magic user. If the Sorcerer selects a class that is not immune to occupation or redirection, then players who attempt to occupy you or change your target will believe it succeeded. Additionally, you will know who you would’ve been redirected to if a player attempts to change your target. Infinite uses.</p>
<p><em>Magic Cloak</em> - <strong>(Changed)</strong> Does not hide the Sorcerer’s status as a magic user anymore. Three uses.</p>
<p>The Sorcerer’s other abilities remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Reasoning: Currently, the entire point behind the Inquisitor’s purpose is to be a class that can counter the Sorcerer right now is flipped upside-down. Inquisitors right now rely purely on BD to find the Sorcerer unless they are good scum-readers as the Sorcerer has four usages of day abilities that will flip the Inquisitor’s results. The idea behind this rework is to shift the Sorcerer’s current strengths and makes them nigh-undetectable to BD thus requiring them to fully rely on the Inquisitor to deal with the Sorcerer. Unseen and Cult investigative and offensive roles will also be affected otherwise this could result in both evils being outed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inquisitor</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Blessing</em> - <strong>(Reworked)</strong> Immune to death at night until the fourth day. Circle of Death will also result in no kills if used on the Inquisitor. If the Sorcerer dies, the Inquisitor remains immune to conversion for the rest of the game.</p>
<p><em>Ruthless Efficiency</em> - <strong>(Changed)</strong> Unusable until the third night.</p>
<p>The Inquisitor’s other abilities remain unchanged. The Inquisitor can now be converted to either the Templar for the Unseen or the Seeker for the Cult.</p>
<p>Reasoning: Holy Blessing’s current state is absolutely clunky as it requires evils to waste a night to get through the barrier, but night immunity is required to prevent early-game deaths as like other neutrals. My proposal limits the immunity only to the first three nights but guarantees it against any number of hits. The immunity to Circle of Death should also help BD’s communication with the Inquisitor, as Knights and Physicians would have no risk to guard them past the third night. The nerf to Ruthless Efficiency is obvious as right now smart Inquisitors are basically a second NK that stops killing when the first one dies, and also gives a chance for Sorcerers to fight back instead of being yolo-stabbed before Inquisitors lose their immunity</p>
<p><strong><em>Templar</em></strong> (Unseen - Social)</p>
<p><strong>Passives</strong></p>
<p><em>Nobody Expects The Spanish Inqusition</em> - Your visits will be hidden from others at night.</p>
<p><em>Heresy on Three Counts</em> - Allows the Sorcerer to speak directly with the rest of the Unseen in the same manner as Mystic’s Link Minds. Instead of showing names, it will instead show the classes of each player.</p>
<p><strong>Night Abilities</strong></p>
<p><em>Find Magic</em> - Check if a player is a magic user. The Court Wizard, Paladin, Mystic, Illusionist, Sage, Sorcerer, and the Cult are all magic users.</p>
<p><em>Surprise and Fear</em> - Attacks a player, killing them them if they are a Blue Dragon-aligned magic user. One usage.</p>
<p>Reasoning: Inquisitors should be neutral. As of right now BD puts in far too much trust in the Inquisitor, more than other BD claims at times, due to their automatically proven nature and their shared goals of chasing down the Sorcerer. The entire point of making a convertible Inquisitor is to remove their automatic confirmation. The idea of the Templar is a class to coordinate the Unseen and the Sorcerer while also keeping Surprise and Fear as a means to keep faking their status as an Inquisitor while potentially scoring an additional KPN for the Unseen. The additional potential KPN and coordination with the Sorcerer should make up for converting a neutral.</p>
<p>Criticisms and feedback for this idea?</p>
