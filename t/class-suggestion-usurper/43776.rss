            <p>I presume Rumours is a targetable ability? If it isn’t, how would this class account for nights with &lt;1 deaths?</p>

            <p>Seems solid. I think rumors changes the game much though, since King can get away with suspicious actions by claiming to be Rumored. Otherwise this instantly takes out king. I’d replace this with a different ability, but I’m not sure what would be a good replacement. Preferably some milder anti-king ability.</p>

            <p>I really like this. I’m guessing you would have to survive until the end as King sense that’s the neutral kings win Condition</p>

            <p>I think the idea of this class is solid! Would the win condition involve surviving till the end? Might give this more thought and post feedback/suggestions!</p>
