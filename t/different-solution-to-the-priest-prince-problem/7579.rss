    <title>Different solution to the Priest/Prince problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/different-solution-to-the-priest-prince-problem/7579</link>
    <description>A lot of ppl have a problem with the current situation, and they are right. Even a bad BD currently wins most of the time.

Solution:

Split some classes up for Cult and Unseen:
Prince/Priest;Possessor/Reaper

The Prince will be the main enemy of the Cult. Cult kills much less and is more affected by priest and its immunities. On the same time, it will assure that the Prince does not die too early unless the Neutral killer kills it ofc. The Possessor will have to appear in Cult games, because its Possession is a bad joke when priest is present and alive.

The Priest will have to stop the Unseen, who are better equipped to deal with limited immunities and revival. In its current form the Priest is still very powerful... and the Unseen have one less conversion problem(the Prince) and the MM will not die at night unless..
The Reaper, the neutral killer for this one, kills it. The reaper will have to stay alive with all these kills amongst the people but at least these reapings are permanent! And the Reaper can get rid of mm and Priest with its piercing ability...not without risk, tho.

Will this make the baddies too strong?
Well, there is a good chance that BD will lose often. If that is the case we would need 1 more unconvertable again.

But it should not be the Sheriff or the Paladin, that would be too strong.
I recommend the Psychic, because that one can prove itself with Link Minds anyways. And it has no hard way of proving someone to be bad. Plus, it is a horrible fakeclaim.</description>

            <p>That would nerf the BD to become far worse than it was pre-patch.</p>
