            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I read your deleted comment – I checked back into your warn report.</p>
<p>It seems that we didn’t read the report thoroughly: It was actually more to it than we thought, however, for the worse:</p>
<p>The guy reported for “excessive flaming all game” only flamed out 1 time, and wasn’t that bad, hardly the entire game.</p>
<p>Looking back, we also realized that you guys revealed private information to each other outside the game (“Metagaming”).</p>

<p>That’s not cool. Or a 1 in 15 chance that you targeted your friend to support on n1, which is pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this kind of stuff - If I didn’t miss this part, it probably would’ve been more than a warning. So pls don’t metagame with your buddy <strong>(it’s cheating)</strong> – and don’t make reports saying they’re excessively flaming all game when they were not. We thank you for the report, but please be honest in your reports.</p>
<p>For now, warnings are just warnings - fyi’s.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Voice chat with friend? No problem, if generalizing and talking about general info that’s already public. <strong>However, metagaming (like telling each other your class, telling your friend you got reaped when he’s still alive, etc) is cheating.</strong></p>
