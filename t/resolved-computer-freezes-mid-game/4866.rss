    <title>[RESOLVED] Computer freezes mid game</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/resolved-computer-freezes-mid-game/4866</link>
    <description>Alright, so i bought the game today. Played fine for a few hours. 

But then my pc started to freeze in the middle of pretty much every single game. The screen just turns to a single colour, the pc makes a continuous noise and all i can do is shut it off from the power button.

In my effort to fix it: 
I made it full screened (had it windowed at first), 
I lowered the graphics and resolution to almost the lowest possible (I didnt go for the absolute lowest, because then i couldnt really read chat),
I let my pc cool off for an hour (just in case it has something to do with that),
I reinstalled the game.

Still the same thing. Any fixes? Or is it just me?</description>

            <p>Alright, last update now that a few days have gone by. I installed SystemCare and DriverBooster like i42-Xblade suggested and I think it helped.<br>
My pc only froze once since then (and that could have been random), so either that pretty much fixed it or the whole thing was a random pc issue that got resolved by itself.<br>
Hope it keeps working <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Thanks for everything!</p>

            <p>I’d suggest having your computer checked by a professional, there’s not much we can do from here.</p>

            <p>Well, my first thought was indeed pretty much what you said. But:<br>
The temperature is well within limits and the computer doesn’t get noisy (until it freezes at least).<br>
This doesn’t happen when I play other games.<br>
I assumed ToL (being a “chat based” game) isn’t particularly demanding especially in low graphics.<br>
My drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>What I consider most weird is: it didn’t happen from the beginning. I mean, I played for hours uninterrupted when I installed it, but since the first freeze, it freezes up in pretty much every game. Reinstallation of ToL didn’t help. That’s why I thought maybe it had something to do with a permanent log or game progress or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, since others don’t have a similar problem, I doubt I’ ll get a solution here, so I’ ll stop posting. I’ ll try to see what I can do myself (maybe reinstall steam as well, check antivirus, etc). Worst case scenario, I just won’t play ToL. Kind of a waste, but, meh, it happens.</p>
<p>As a sidenote: I can’t even open it with the Vulcan edition, it crashes immediately but I don’t care about that.</p>

            <p>Hmm, speaking as a CompTIA A+ certified guy and not as a dev, this definitely sounds like a problem <em>outside</em> of ToL (unless it happened to everyone):</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you hear any clicking sounds coming from your computer? One cause of freezing is a faulty hard drive.</li>
<li>Do you have a CPU monitoring software installed? Seems that your CPU is overheating, yet your CPU seems pretty nice. Is your computer extra quiet? Perhaps the fan failed. Did you drop your PC? Perhaps the heatsink detached.</li>
<li>Ever consider updating your chipsets (drivers for your hardware, like motherboard and such)? This prevents a lot of random freezing and overall system “weirdness” if it’s hard to find a cause. There’s some software out there like Driver Booster that can find these for you and install them automatically.</li>
<li>If Vulkan works, it seems like a NVIDIA issue. Sometimes NVIDIA has weird driver versions. Try a beta version? You can check options to allow beta updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>…other than that, I’m not sure. It seems that there’s some form of either hardware or driver failure. It doesn’t sound like software failure to me.</p>

            <p>Try it just in case. However, if it works with Vulkan that’d mean either your DirectX or your graphics card has an issue.</p>

            <p>Not sure what you mean by “validating files through steam”. I did reinstall the game after the first few time it froze, if that helps.</p>
<p>My drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>Could the vulcan edition help maybe?</p>

            <p>Also try the classics:</p>

<li>Checking if your drivers are up-to-date</li>

            <p>Alright, sorry about that.<br>
Anyway, like i said, no “crash” folder. Here is the output_log.txt in the ThroneOfLies_Data .<br>
(Also, sorry if i made a mistake with google drive. Have never really used it to share something.)</p>

            <p>Next time your game freezes (and you’re forced to restart your desktop) could you post your logs?<br>
If you don’t know how, follow the instructions.<br>
(<strong>Note:</strong> If you restart the game the logs will reset, so upload the logs before restarting the game)</p>
