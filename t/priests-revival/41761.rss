    <title>Priest&#39;s Revival</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/priests-revival/41761</link>
    <description>I think the Priest has been gone long enough and deserves to be brought back about now. The game has room for her.

But with the Priest, I hope to bring her back, so please leave your feedback. We bring back the glory days of the Priest! 

This is currently a blank slate. Let&#39;s all contribute to the Priest.
