    <title>New NK: Necromancer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-nk-necromancer/20040</link>
    <description>What about a NK that is a Necromancer? :D You bring back dead people and you can talk to them at night and tell them to kill ppl. That would be a way to have ppl interact more when they are already dead. 

**Necromancer 1**:

Passive skills:

**Unholy Flesh**: Immune to poison/bleed. (to be able to claim alch, stoneskin, why he doesnt die when saved by zombie)

Active Night Skills:
**Resurrect Zombie** (2days CD): Resurrect a dead player to your side with defensive skills.
**Resurrect Skeleton** (corpse must be Kill/Off) (2days CD): Resurrect a dead player to your side with offensive skills.

Zombie player night skills:
**Guard Master**: Guard your master and die if attacked.
**Scary Scream**: Occupy a Player at night.

Skeleton player skills:
**Sword at Night**: Kill a player, remove all immunties. Kill yourself if Off/Kill.

Necormancer Day Skill:
**Dark Vision**: Reveal Player Class. (3 days CD)

NK wins if Evil/BD are dead.
The Undead Chat would be a seperate like the Psychic to reveal the Necromancer early on.

Pros: Strong lategame, fun to play I would guess. Room to bring back The Priest (!) as counter to Necormancer.
Weak: Very bad early game, can&#39;t kill anyone before others kill and even then only slow start.

**Necromancer 2**:

Based on Polik Suggestions I think it would be also fun if the Necromancer is &quot;hidden&quot; from everyone else. The Necromancer can not be executed at day or killed at night. The only way to kill the Necromancer is to kill all his minions. He Spawns With 1 Zombieplayer and can convert more at night and the Zombie represents the Necromancer at day. The Zombie(s) can only talk if the Necromancer allows him to. 

Passive:

**Unfathomable Entity**: You do not appear in the list of players and you are represented by your Zombies
**Unholy Echoes**: You can talk to all Zombies at night.

Day abilities:

**Let them Speak** (twice per day): Your Zombies can speak one line of text.
**Let them point** (twice per day): Your Zombies can point at someone and vote.

Night Ability:

**Death Touch**(2 days CD): Convert player to a Zombie, bypass all immunity. Max: 2(3)


The Necromancer then has to think ahead and allow his minions to talk/vote at the right time or they will abstain and ppl will know there might be a Necro (similar to Reaper checks)

You win if the Court is full with Zombies. Every converted (dead) Zombie wins at the end if Necro is alive. Zombies can become Kings, becoming a **Zombie King** (not neutral/bd/evil) upgrading the Necromancer ability to have 3th zombie. 

I am not sure about zombie abilities, it should be something fun but not too powerful. Any suggestions?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been considering a Necromancer class that would be a Cult converted class (maybe from Physician). But for some reason after reading this post… what if instead of Necromancer being a NK or being Cult convert, Necromancer is the Cult Leader/Mastermind equivalent of a third Evil Faction? The concept already involves essentially converting other players to your side.</p>
<p>Then you have an investigative class akin to Sheriff/Paladin like…an Undertaker, who can check dead players to see if they have been raised. The problem lies in the fact that you can’t have players that were dead just returning to the council randomly, but you can’t have people voting up and executing players who are supposed to be dead. Unless the Undertaker class has an ability that “reveals” an undead player, making them visible and accusable for treason. But that makes it impossible for the player to even try to defend him/herself. Then again, maybe raised players can’t speak anyway, as if they were reaped?</p>

Btw this is an alternate version, I will edit my OP to show both Necromancer ideas.</p>

            <p>Suggestion:  Spawn with a zombie.  The necromancer uses the zombie to kill.  And it acts as defiense against attacks.</p>
<p>The zombie will die if acttacked.</p>
<p>That way the zombie serves both a offensive and defensive purpose.</p>
<p>Once the zombie dies.  You can resurrect another one.</p>
<p>And this time telepathy comes into effect.  Allowing you to ciommuncate with the zombie.</p>
<p>The zombie also maintains commucation with the dead but does not know wheo the necromancer is.</p>

            <p>Thoughts your an NK who can die N1…<br>
Automatically bad -_-<br>
Your also bad if no one dies…<br>
Also you can die if the only people who die are killer/offensive(They would be skeletons not zombies)<br>
Also if you “resurrect” a player do they lose if you lose?<br>
How does this work with Reanimate?</p>

            <p>I like the idea if bringing backt the dead ad then using them to kill people.</p>
<p>It will be a nice disguise.</p>
<p>And of course, someone will know that the Necromancer is around if the Observer notices that a dead person just killed someone.</p>
