            <p>So basically a hard buff to nk, whenever it’s in the game. neutral killers don’t win a lot, but i don’t feel like having a class to hard buff it with about a 70% chance of being in a game is the way. i don’t think we need this personally,  i’m new to this whole reviewing thing but that’s my opinion</p>
