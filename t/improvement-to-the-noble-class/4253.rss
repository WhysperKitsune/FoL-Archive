    <title>Improvement to the Noble Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/improvement-to-the-noble-class/4253</link>
    <description>I originally planned to have this as a new class, but someone suggested that the noble just get redone like this.

Originally it was intended to be called The Magistrate. ANyway, here is what I thought of. Lemme know if you like it please.

****
Was thinking there could be a role thats neutral that is specifically linked to accusations.

Daytime

Execute - Choose one player you think to be suspicious. Have them executed for treason. (Once per game)

Argue - Change one players vote to the player of your choice - That vote may not be rescinded (2x per game)

Extra Vote - Your vote counts as 2 votes (Infinite)

Night

Investigate - Investigate one player - One faction is ruled out per investigate (Ie : Bd/Unseen/Neutral). This skill can still be fooled by disguising abilities. (Infinite) (Example, Use INvestigate on player #5 - it says &quot;Player #5 is NOT a member of the Neutral faction!&quot; then try it again next day &quot;Player 5 is NOT a member of the Unseen!&quot; so now you know player 5 is Blue Dragon.)

Guards! - Have guards arrest a player, occupying them for a night. Ignores night immunity. (2x per game)

Maybe as a downside, have them outed from d1 like the king? Everyone will already know who the magistrate/noble is?

***NEW***Also I was thinking that if Magistrate is killed, any existing Noble or Assassin can step in to fill the role, changing the alignment of the role to whatever the person who fills it is.

What do you guys think?</description>
