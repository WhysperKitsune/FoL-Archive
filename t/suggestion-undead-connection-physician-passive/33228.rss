    <title>[Suggestion] Undead Connection (Physician passive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/suggestion-undead-connection-physician-passive/33228</link>
    <description>Hello!

First of all, i want to say Physician is a good class, he is fine and he dont really needs a huge change, this is only a idea. Also, sorry if my english is not the best :slight_smile:

Undead connection is a new Passive ability for physician. This passive allows him to talk with the Death Knight he ressurect in a &quot;Undead Chat&quot;, even after the rotting ends, like the Psychic chat!

DK only sees “Physician” in chat like when Prince talks to you in jail.

This allows Physician to be a more powerful class and not only a Healer since he now can talk with a dead knight and make more decisions.

Death Knight cant talk in the Undead Connection chat, only listen to the Physician (Since he cant talk anyways because Death Knight class card abilities)

Hope you like my idea!</description>

            <p>This just seems like a bad idea.  DK talking in the Undead chat and <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> talking to the living is what makes the ability interesting.  It’s not intended to be a communication bridge between the living and the dead - the psychic already satisfies that role.</p>
<p>What’s the advantage to making the DK / Phys a way to get information to or from the dead?  Basically, what does this suggestion add, strategically?</p>
<p>Especially given that it’s now devolved into taking away the DK’s ability to talk to the dead, an absolutely <span class="bbcode-i">awful</span> suggestion that would take away one of the things that makes dead chat interesting in exchange for…  what?  What’s the goal of this suggestion?</p>
<p>Physician is already a powerful class.  If the goal is just to buff it because you think it’s underpowered, there could be way better buffs than this.</p>

            <p>/no-support. That would let the physician talk to the other dead through the DK for one. It would also mean that the DK knows who the physician is (right now he doesn’t and that’s a good thing). This would also mean that if the physician is converted that the DK would immediately know and then CS the phys like with Psy.</p>
