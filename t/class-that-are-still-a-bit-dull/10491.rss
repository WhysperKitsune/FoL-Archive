    <description>Court Wizard

Its still kind of dull to play .

I feel like the ice ward ability is too valuable to use on yolo targeting . So I spend the first 3-4 nights hoping that I don&#39;t die before an investigator or prince reveals themselves some how . 
then if they do I ice ward them. 

I get  that its quite powerful but it feels wasteful to do anything early game .

Noble 

Id made my peace with the Noble , it was kind of getting exciting with the PMs and you could do some fun stuff .

Now its again quite powerful but not really much to do in the early game , it comes into focus a bit at later stages but stopping people hanging the prince for example just means that the noble gets hung this turn instead . The  evils know who is who .

The only use I tend to get out of this that&#39;s useful is for some reason I know something everyone else don&#39;t , like people are getting succeed in my scorned etc . But I cant ever really be sure .

Again the extra votes for execute are a bit meh . If we have not got the votes to get someone up what&#39;s the point in having the votes to swing the axe and if we have got the votes to get them up , what&#39;s the point in having the extra vote , we should already have enough to hang .

So again it comes down to only being useful if as a bd I know more than the other bd 

Still just these two really that are groans when I get them .</description>
