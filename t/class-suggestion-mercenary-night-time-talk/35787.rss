    <description>Hey there, 

Just a suggestion to buff make mercenary a little more interactive, I think mercenaries should have the opportunity to talk with their contractors at night, allowing a little more planning and sources of information between each other as I feel day time whispering makes both individuals very sus.

I can understand why it isn&#39;t implemented, but it&#39;s just a thought I had.</description>

            <p>I think the daytime whispering actually adds a little risk/reward mechanic. I usually whisper very long messages as merc and encourage my contract to do the same, as to avoid heavy suspicion. Mercs are usually identified through these whispers, but that also makes it easier to fake a merc relationship for unseen/cult. I once won a game as sorcerer pretending to be a merc for the MM, after I had been checked as a neutral. That’s an oddity, but adding this would still remove some uniqueness of the game. The decision to guard or not guard is usually enough to think about at night for me personally as well. Lastly there is the issue with conversion as mentioned above.</p>

            <p>I mean that’s already the case with a lot of classes though such as psy. While I see your point, it also wouldn’t hurt</p>
