Ninjas and Guns is a matrix setup. There are 18 possible combinations:

16. **D1** - [color=green]Vanilla, Innocent Child, JOAT.[/color] [color=red]Jailkeeper, 1-Shot Vigilante[/color] 
17. **D2** - [color=green]Vanilla, Innocent Child, JOAT.[/color] [color=red]Ninja JOAT, 1-Shot Vigilante[/color] 
18. **E1** - [color=green]Masons, Bodyguard, Vanilla.[/color][color=red] Jailkeeper, 1-Shot Vigilante[/color] 
[/details]

Additionally:

&gt; - Jailkeepers and Doctors cannot target the same player on consecutive nights, nor can they self target.
&gt; - Town Alignment Cops get a random n0 town peek. Peeks alignment (town/mafia).
&gt; - Mafia Role Cops get a random n0 vanilla town peek. Peeks full role.
&gt; - Mod rands the setup (rows and columns), *then* rands the &quot;OR&quot; statements. This means each row/column has a 10% chance of being chosen. *Setup 4 &amp; Setup B cannot have two jailkeepers.*

Regardless of the setup that is randed, 10 Vanilla Townies and 2 Mafia Goons will be added.

[details=&quot;More in depth explanation on how I will rand this&quot;]
To rand the setup, I will do the following:

First, I will roll a d10. 1-5 will obviously be 1-5, while A-E will be 6-10. 

If I roll a 7, then I get Column B. 

![image|132x316, 100%](upload://niSbGUJ7EVnxM4vvHYEYfXXgZVm.png)

In cases like this, I will roll a d2 on the two mafia roles. Keep in mind there cannot be two duplicate Mafia Jailkeepers.

If I roll a 2 on the d2, then I will add a [color=red]**Mafia Ninja JOAT**[/color] and roll a second. If I get another 2, I will add a [color=red]**Mafia Jailkeeper**[/color].

This would be setup B2, and would (in total, after adding the 10 VTs and 2 Goons) be:
&gt; 
&gt; [color=green]**11x Vanilla Town**
&gt; **1x Town Doctor**
&gt; **1x Town Tracker**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; [color=red]**2x Mafia Goon
&gt; 1x Mafia Ninja JOAT
&gt; 1x Mafia Jailkeeper**[/color]
[/details]
# Gameplay

* Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours. 
* Yeets are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the yeet will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.
* No-yeet is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-yeet and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-yeet will have priority in the rand.
* Self-votes are considered valid votes. Accompanied AtE is not required. 
* Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios. That is to say, in situations where a misyeet or a no-yeet will guarantee a Mafia victory, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.
* All votes must be in the form **/vote [name of player]** to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form **/unvote** . This is to enable the smooth processing of votes. Pinging the host(s) is not required, but is welcomed.
* The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.
* The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.
* Mafia **can** perform the factional kill alongside any abilities they have.
* Alts will **not** be allowed.

&gt; 
&gt; *You win when you eliminate the mafia.*


&gt; # [color=green]Town 1-shot Bulletproof[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; The first time you are attacked, you will survive.

&gt;
&gt; *You win when you eliminate the mafia.*

&gt; # [color=green]Town Jack of all Trades[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Each night, you may use one of the following abilities:
&gt; 
&gt; - Vigilante: Target a player. You will attack them.
&gt; - Cop: Target a player. You will inspect their alignment, and receive a Town or Mafia result.
&gt; - Jailkeep: Target a player. You will jail them, roleblocking them for the night and protecting them from attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; You may only use each ability twice, and you must use each ability once before you can use one again. Like a regular Jailkeeper, you may not consecutively target the same player with your Jailkeep ability.
&gt; 
&gt; *You win when you eliminate the mafia.*

[/details]


&gt;# [color=red]Mafia Goon[/color]
&gt;
&gt; You have no special abilities, but possess a 24/7 scum chat and a factional kill.
&gt;
&gt; *You win when you reach parity with the town.*
[details=&quot;Mafia PRs&quot;]


&gt; # [color=red]Mafia Jailkeeper[/color]
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; *You win when you reach parity with the town.*


&gt; # [color=red]Mafia Ninja JOAT[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Each night, you may choose one of the following passive modifiers to grant yourself: 
&gt; 
&gt; - Godfather: You will appear as Town to alignment checks.
&gt; - Ninja: You will appear to not visit anybody if you are tracked.
&gt; - Bulletproof: You are immune to death at night.
&gt;
&gt; Applying a passive modifier resolves instantly and does not count as a visit.
&gt; 
&gt; *You win when you reach parity with the town.*

&gt; # [color=red]Mafia Role Cop[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Each night, you may inspect a player. You will learn their role.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, you know that [NAME] is [color=green]**Vanilla Town**[/color]. Their name will be redacted in the event you flip.
&gt;
&gt; *You win when you reach parity with the town.*

&gt; # [color=red]Mafia 1-shot Vigilante[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; Once, you may target a player. You will attack them. This is separate from the factional kill.
&gt;
&gt; *You win when you reach parity with the town.*
[/details]

Flavored rolecards will look like this:

[details=&quot;Example Rolecard with Flavor&quot;]


&gt; # [color=green] &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  Jeff Kaplan &lt;/div&gt; [/color]
&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnLAD623M7ZDyMeV8T_I1GhW3WY=/0x0:1200x800/1400x1400/filters:focal(466x108:658x300):format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55882051/Jeff_dva.0.jpeg&quot;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; [*&quot;2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3. What&#39;s up, this is Jeff from the Overwatch team. Making changes that you wouldn&#39;t believe, I&#39;m going to take you out with a long range beam.&quot;*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMDItOwN_SU)
&gt;
&gt; You are [color=green]**Vanilla Town**[/color].
&gt; 
&gt; You have no abilities, other than your voice and your vote.
&gt;
&gt; *You win when you eliminate the mafia.* &lt;/div&gt;
[/details]

Flavor will not be alignment indicative. This flavor will not be present in the game.

[details=&quot;Investigative Feedback&quot;]

## Alignment Cop

&gt; [name] is Town.
&gt; [name] is Mafia.

## Role Cop

&gt; [name] is [role]

examples:

&gt; [name] is 1-shot Bulletproof.
&gt; [name] is Vigilante.
&gt; [name] is Vanilla.   **[This would be the feedback on both Vanilla Town and Mafia Goon]**

## Tracker

&gt; [name] visited X, Y, and Z.
&gt; [name] did not visit anybody.

## Any investigative who had an action fail

&gt; You failed to investigate your target.

<p>Using “oh well it was funny” is a shitty excuse and shouldn’t be allowed to be used anymore, saying you aren’t playing the game and wagoning players because it’s funny just isn’t okay at all and feels a lot like gamethrowing to me, in reality though it seems like some sort of pityful excuse people use in case they’re wrong, I won’t say I’ve not done it before, but it’s insanely annoying to see</p>

            <p>Dk slipped into townradar for so many people and the only reason he slipped out was because of what he said at the end of day 3</p>
<p>Intensify was messed up the moment it was him or Derps, not to mention his end of day 3 behaviour was strange</p>
<p>Esooa was heroshot, still proud of PKR</p>
<p>Marshal played really well, she slipped in and out of “this player is town” and their kills were so carefully selected they planted the seeds of doubt in everyone’s minds about the towncore as it currently stood.</p>
<p>Also once again, I will state, Mafia!AT never kills me at night as I’m literally in his pocket.</p>
<p>And I will also state<br>
Using “oh well it was funny” is a shitty excuse and shouldn’t be allowed to be used anymore, saying you aren’t playing the game and wagoning players because it’s funny just isn’t okay at all and feels a lot like gamethrowing to me, in reality though it seems like some sort of pityful excuse people use in case they’re wrong, I won’t say I’ve not done it before, but it’s insanely annoying to see</p>

            <p>Honestly I feel like there should be a clearer line between messing around and gamethrowing.</p>
<p>There’s a point where trolling begins to actually make the game unfun for others and sadly this site has never really defined it well.</p>
<p>Like, we had a point where Hjasik/Isaac/Marg were suspended because their shit became unbearable, but otherwise… eh.</p>

            <p>Don’t want to take anything away from the mafia’s performance btw - they played much better than us and fully deserve the win.</p>
<p>Dk was invested and was doing all sorts of stuff early to muddle interactions, while Intensify/Esooa/Marshal were all playing okay to decent games. Townies just weren’t really invested in the game from the start I feel - when I was rereading, some of those wagons I saw were quite bad.</p>
<p>Honestly the sulit rand D4 kind of balanced out the Intensify/Derps wagon not going scum’s way D3. That rand basically broke the game in half in favor of the town and the game should have easily been solvable from that point on.</p>
<p>Ideally that rand never goes through because Marshal votes Derps there and this game probably ends in a perfect or near perfect wolf victory though.</p>

            <p>Think most of our postgame gripes just boils down to a mismatch between how seriously people take this game compared to others.</p>
<p>Some people want to be funny or to treat mafia as a social game first over playing to win. Not saying that there isn’t room for all of these things, but I play mafia for the joy of the solve as town and to complicate the puzzle for others as mafia. If there’s incoherence in what people want to get out of the game in the first place, then we end up with games like these.</p>
<p>(yes I am aware the above post has tense mistakes, I just woke up and am phoneposting)</p>

<p>I think this every game. Many times.<br>
Which is why I don’t really blame villagers for making wrong decisions, it can be hard to make choices with no TMI. :c In this specific case, I had a couple of words to say, but it was more me trying to understand the mindsets, and less berating the town for poor play.</p>

            <p>I mentioned this in spec chat, but in retrospect I should have spoke out louder against the rand.</p>
<p>Didn’t realize Marshal’s vote was real until katze put up the vote total, plus this was my first real town game on this site, so I was thinking to myself “am I wrong or is everyone else wrong”?</p>
<p>Vulgard is saying everything I wanted to say here but in a much more critical/in-depth way. Props.</p>

            <p>Also. Proph replaces in D4, writes a grand total of ~25 posts, is in the game for only 24 hours, the previous slot holder was hard PoE.</p>
<p>Instantly gets nightkilled. No hesitation.</p>
