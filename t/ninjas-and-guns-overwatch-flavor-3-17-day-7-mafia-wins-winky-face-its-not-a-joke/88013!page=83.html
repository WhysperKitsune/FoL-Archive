<ul>
<li>Darling in the Franxx</li>
<li>Most recent scum game that started was actually Upick 2, and I got voted out D1 so it also ended very fast for me lol. Most recent scum game that I played till the end was Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis, on Mafia Colosseum, but it started in March. The day phases were 12 irl days long and the night phases were 48 h so I bussed both my partners D1 and D2 and got stuck solo wolfing till the end (and won) lol.</li>
<li>Better for the town game? Could’ve trusted my reads more. I managed to bag 5/6 wolves in a single post early in the game without knowing I had done so, and also towncored a widely scumread town player for a while, but went back on some of those reads and towncored a wolf and dropped that one widely scumread player out of my towncore and straight into my PoE cause lol consensus.<br>
Better for the scum game? Uh, not bussed both my partners immediately. We were screwed because they were both top wagons on D1 and very nearly tied for votes (but Gorta accidentally hammered) and also weren’t counterwagons, so they got chain yeeted as a result. But also, I didn’t have enough distancing interactions, either. People were just not really looking at me because I was doing weirdly useless things in the game and also coasting because town was pushing agenda for me. Think I got a bit lazy and had low WiM because of the long day phases (game lasted 3 months) and having randed wolf 5 times in a row.</li>
<li>I skimmed very fast and didn’t see anything of note, so I think I completely missed that. Will go back and look for it. I refuse to write it off as towny because I think Marshal is more than capable of keeping her cool as a wagoned wolf. I’ve only seen one wolf game from her, though, and she was not very cool with the wagon (but it wasn’t during the meme phase so lol).</li>
<li>I would suggest policy voting them out of the game, but that would include myself, so I guess I should self-vote and AtE? <s>This is the way-</s>

<p>Ok now I see cloned’s post lol. Oddly enough I think this is slightly towny coming from him. I don’t think Sulit was towny for jumping to scumread me and saying I made a weird post, but I think Cloned jumping to read it as a rule of 3 is like… <em>too</em> easy to default to, and that as a wolf he might avoid making a post like this. It’s not reading me off what I posted in terms of content or tone or weirdness of the post in general, but just a default rule like “if nobody else is scummier let’s just yeet Wind” which, although it could be setting me up for a future ML, is actually not pushing agenda (and I think sulits reaction to my post is within agenda range).</p>

<p>I think sulits reaction is OMGUS but not sure if it’s agenda. I don’t like that she didn’t answer anything I asked about and also didn’t comment on the player list but just voted me probably for listing her within my “scumlean??” list and didn’t add commentary on anyone including herself.<br>
I think Intensify had a somewhat towny reaction, I don’t know why I said he was speculating on neutrals cause I just remembered there aren’t any in this game and he made a joke (oops) lol.<br>
I think Cloned had a fairly towny reaction because he put me on the back burner as possible wolf just by the rule of 3 and didn’t jump to point out anything directly scummy in my post? Now that I think about it, though, it’s slightly notable that I also put him on my list and he said I might be scum. I don’t think his reaction reads as an OMGUS like sulits does,but I guess I should factor that in more than I did up to this point.</p>

<p>It <em>can</em> come from me as either alignment but I expect everyone to figure me out by the rest of my posts. If not toDay, later in the game.

But I’m trying to get you to pay attention to something and except for like, 3 or 4 of you, you’re all reacting exactly as I’d expect people to react if they’re not actually reading into things enough. I’m not just handing out free reads to people because they want me to. I’m giving something to evaluate me on, and receiving something to evaluate them on.</p>
<p>I don’t expect that people think all of my posts are definitely AI one way or another, I don’t expect people to believe anything I’ve said thus far about what I’ve been doing in this game, but I am using the information for myself and hoping someone else will also use it to read others by their treatment of my slot and whether they’re just pressuring me or actually pushing me.</p>

<p>I’ve done this in a few games and apparently it’s considered gamethrowing, but sometimes encouraging people to pick out scummy things in my ISO and give their explanations allows me to read them off of their logic. If they can come up with reasons that I haven’t thought of that make my posts look scummy, they’re actually usually town. However, if the only thing they can use to case me is consensus reasoning or very surface-level thoughts that prove they didn’t read into the meat of my posts, their alignment can go either way (and often ties into how much effort they’re putting into the game as well).</p>

<hr>
<p>TL;DR - first off, fuck you, read it<br>
i didnt spend two hours on this for it to get ignored<br>
Wind is a townlean, if i ever go back and read franxx i could probably come closer to a more certain read in either direction<br>
theres a lot she does thats towny, and a lot that she does thats scummy<br>
Overall, the towny bits are more prominent, and theres a few certain pieces that I don’t think wolves really ever think about, and i dont think any of the scummy bits are especially damning<br>
this should definitely be re-evaluated late-game depending on how her tone changes, if it does<br>
but overall her approach is cognitively consistent and most of her thoughts line up<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/windwardaway.html">@WindwardAway</a> please read through, i had questions in a few places and would appreciate your answers</p>

<p>Ok now I see cloned’s post lol. Oddly enough I think this is slightly towny coming from him. I don’t think Sulit was towny for jumping to scumread me and saying I made a weird post, but I think Cloned jumping to read it as a rule of 3 is like… <em>too</em> easy to default to, and that as a wolf he might avoid making a post like this. It’s not reading me off what I posted in terms of content or tone or weirdness of the post in general, but just a default rule like “if nobody else is scummier let’s just yeet Wind” which, although it could be setting me up for a future ML, is actually not pushing agenda (and I think sulits reaction to my post is within agenda range).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree on the cloned part<br>
it feels like it’s wacky enough that the exact only two scenarios where he does it is as W/W with you or as town</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>he’s definitely not W/W with me, in which case he’s town, which is what I was saying lol. w!Cloned doesn’t push on w!Wind for two days straight. He would probably drop the push on me by now because nobody was even interested in voting me out yesterDay (and tbh I’m still not sure why).</p>

</aside>
<p>yes because I noticed more than one person going “Wind is scum because she isn’t solving” like halfway into D1. I don’t <em>want</em> to have a meta of solving the game halfway into D1. I’m here to have fun and bust wolves before the end of the game, not pressure myself into solving the game in a single day when I <em>know</em> at least 50% of my reads are wrong in all games on D1 unless I have TMI. This is just based on my personal statistics. I know I’m weak at gutreads and strong at reading later in the game, so I don’t intend to do stupid things and tunnel the wrong players just by confbiasing myself on D1 after someone forces me to make reads and stick with them.</p>

<p>what do YOU think about it<br>
now that Marl has flipped town<br>
do you think Esooa/sulit were reading in bad faith? Which interpretation do you think is more correct? I didn’t read that Katastrophe or follow it so <em>shrug</em></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Esooa subbed in after I died, so her understanding of my posts might’ve been a bit different than Marl’s or sulit’s, who played with me. Sulit only lockwolfed me off of my first post in Sonic and then decided my second post was also wolfy enough that she began tunnelling me for the entire day. I don’t think it was optimal but I guess that’s why I’m not surprised she quickly jumped to a conclusion on my posts here, too. I wasn’t trying to discredit her but point out the flaw in jumping to conclusions too fast, and it came across as a complete discredit and I’m aware of that (not that it hasn’t already been pointed out). Marl is correct in that I was doing the exact same thing here, but I’ve been doing it for a different reason and honestly it’s getting tiring being pushed to give reads and solve the game when I just want to relax because I have more stressful things to do irl. I’m not very competitive in forum mafia and I don’t intend to be. I’m not striving to rep the forum for champs or anything; I’m just having fun in my free time. I partly did the “I don’t need to be townread” gambit in Sonic Heghog because of these reasons, but also because I was a PR (town poisoner) and covering my ass so I wouldn’t get nightkilled, which failed miserably because I got nightkilled N1 lol. Here? I’m just fucking with people and I’m annoyed that everyone expects so much from me when I am literally adjusting my playstyle to the game and so that I can produce the most accurate reads I possibly can. I don’t think jumping at people on D1 in this game would’ve produced highly accurate reads; I fucked up on voting Eli and I admit that. I didn’t even have strong reasons to scumread him; I just sheeped you because I figured you’re better at reading him than I am, but it’s still my fault for placing my vote there and I take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>Because people are going “Wind is scum and here is a post that shows Wind is scum, so Wind is even scummier” and it’s not leading them to any new conclusions because they are labelling me as scum and then finding evidence for it. It’s what everyone accuses me of doing in all my games, even when I’m town, and I still think town could be doing this but it’s just tunnelling.</p>

<p>no it’s not, you’re looking at it wrong<br>
it’s not -EV for town but town isn’t using their heads to solve, they’re just looking at one post, calling me scum, and then using all other posts to also call me scum<br>
that’s not solving and the reason I can freely say this is because I AM NOT MAFIA. Therefore I know their “conclusion” is incorrect and that they are clearly <em>not</em> reading my posts to solve me; they are reading my posts to mine for wolfy content.</p>

<p>what’s going to happen is that I’m going to flip sooner or later, I will flip town, and half the player list is gonna go, “Wind was playing extremely anti-town and suboptimally, what the fuck, she should improve her townplay” and yet I will still probably have more accurate reads resulting from my play here than I would from being highly aggressive with solving on D1. It just doesn’t work for me. It works for some people, but not me.</p>

</aside>
<p>it’s a lame wall because cloned’s posts and my posts are both lame<br>
but cloned tunnelled me in another game as I recall where I was town and he was town, so if I sound like I’m being condescending that’s why. it’s rude and I shouldn’t do it but it’s subconscious so unfortunately I do it anyway (sorry, cloned!) because I do think that cloned often brings up good points to think about when he’s town, and even when he’s completely wrong on his conclusion, his level of analysis still shows that he’s putting thought into his reads.</p>

<p>she hadnt really interacted with koba recently, and i havent seen her interact with nether or pkr recently either</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I literally have never been in the thread with Nether and the problem is I don’t want to jump to scumread him for not posting, because I can’t tell if he’s a lurking wolf or a town LHF. As for PKR, I absolutely suck at reading him. I find that usually my first thoughts on him are more correct than my later thoughts, and GTH if I had to give a read on him I’d say he’s town here, but I don’t actually trust my read because it’s not at a high enough level that I’d be confident in it. I did interact briefly with him when he was getting frustrated about being wagoned, and Wazza was also involved in that interaction (if you’re backreading you’ll see it). My interaction focus shifted from PKR to Wazza because of Wazza’s responses, however, so that’s probably why there’s a lack of interaction between PKR and me. As for Koba, I don’t like that he’s saying he should be obvtown by now, but on the other hand I do think some of his points are good. It’s just that I haven’t seen enough from him to get a solid read, and I think I have too many people in my townreads which is making me extremely suspicious that there’s a powerwolf or deepwolf in there that I mistakenly threw into the town pile. That’s also partly why I’ve been sticking to the not yeet/yeet categories for the current day, instead of establishing a permanent readlist. Towncore for me still only consists of sulit and cloned, and what irks me about them is that I think both of them are capable of solving the game but they’re both busy and cloned is way too confbiased on my slot, and consequently is reading everyone else off of preflipping me as wolf. I think teambuilding is a good thing so I can’t fault him for that, but if he has no actual scumreads based on if I’m town, it’s very detrimental because his entire worldbuilding will fall apart once I flip.</p>

<p>because Eli can freeze as either alignment<br>
he was within both his town and wolfrange and because he was going to either slank or get replaced I didn’t see much of a way to be able to read him clearly later in the game, unlike with other slots that I didn’t want to touch on D1 even if I thought they were a bit wolfy.<br>
you said “he’s scum, trust me” extremely confidently so I assumed you must’ve seen something from him that made you certain he’s a wolf, which is also why I didn’t think you were a wolf after he flipped town, because it would’ve been one of the dumbest agendas ever.</p>
