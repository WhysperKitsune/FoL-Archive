            <p>Remember. Something being more useful is not justification for it being a better ability for the game. You need to first demonstrate that a buff is needed at all before you can say we should add any given buff. And if buffing the class is NOT the intention then you need to also nerf it by an equal or greater amount</p>

</aside>
<p>OP even before taking into account the day ability’s. The King should be a tie breaker. Meaning that if there are 2 people and one of them is a King then the King has control. If there is a 2v2 then the King has control. However in a 2v1 the King should always lose</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here is more what I would do for starting King for example:</p>
<p>Note: Kings in general can speak on the self defense stage. You don’t need to specify</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue"> Starting Good King </font></h1>
<p><strong>Passive 1: Tenacity</strong> - You are occupy and redirect immune. Your actions do not count as visiting<br>
<strong>Passive 2: Loyalty</strong> - If you are lynched then there will be no trial tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: Royal Finger</strong> - Put target player on the stand immediately<br>
<strong>Day Ability 2: Decide Fate</strong> - Instantly execute or pardon a player on trial. If you pardon them then they cannot be voted up for the rest of the day</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: Guards!</strong> - Give target player death immunity tonight. You can self target  (5 uses)<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2: Audience!</strong> - Whispers between you and target player will be hidden from the public tomorrow and cannot be intercepted (4 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="gray"> Starting Evil King </font></h1>
<p><strong>Passive 1: Tenacity</strong> - You are occupy and redirect immune. Your actions do not count as visiting<br>
<strong>Passive 2: Scheming</strong> - You are immune to death once</p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: Royal Finger</strong> - Put target player on the stand immediately<br>
<strong>Day Ability 2: Decide Fate</strong> - Instantly execute or pardon a player on trial. If you pardon them then they cannot be voted up for the rest of the day</p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: Allies!</strong> - Learn if target player’s class if they are not Blue Dragon (3 uses)<br>
<strong>Night Ability 2: Audience!</strong> - Whispers between you and target player will be hidden from the public tomorrow and cannot be intercepted.  (4 uses)<br>
<em>Goal: The Blue Dragon loses</em> or <em>Unseen/Cult Wincon</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally just replace the Day ability’s and nothing else for elected Kings and have Mastermind Keep convert if he is elected (just convert. Nothing else)</p>
<p>if we give neutrals their own Kings then you don’t actually need to change anything for most of them. Literally just have them keep their wincon and let Neutral King’s kit do the rest. (Besides Merc who can instead just have unlimited guards but with a cooldown and 2 brilders per block and Inquisitor who needs a heathen check)</p>
<p>If you REALLY want them to have a difference then let any elected neutral keep their primary ability. Whatever it is. But then make neutral king only have 2 guards to compensate</p>

            <p>And none of this justifies buffing the Kings in the first place. The only thing that makes sense is changing the MM’s King to have convert and making Neut kings keep their wincondition (and even then the ability’s should be as close as they can be to BD King)</p>
