            <p>It’s not really that complex.  Different factions already become different Kings, so it shouldn’t be that confusing to have neuts keep their win condition.  I agree that neuts shouldn’t be able to escape their win con though.</p>

            <p>reason i dont think fool and scorned really need to be specific kings is it’s a bit too complicated, this idea really is only to help nk/neuts and the fact that it’s a bit anticlimactic that you can play as a class that’s negative utility to bd, then become positive utility to bd.</p>
