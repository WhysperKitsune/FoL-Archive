            <p>Because he boasted about killing two BD so I thought it was a good opportunity to use my poison which is really the only fun ability on Butler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, it’s much harder for them to win they have lost their ability when becoming the neutral King.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Alch already has 4 stoneskin and being immune to Butler upon becoming King just makes Butler feel even more boring.  Butler poison is like Rebound on the old merc, the class is extremely boring and if you used Rebound  and it failed because of death immunity or prevention, it was extremely frustrating because you only got one use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does this mean Phys/Herb keeps immunities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My complaint is mostly that this makes Butler’s only fun ability, which is single-use, even more useless.</p>

            <p>The thing is, it’s much harder for them to win they have lost their ability when becoming the neutral King. Psycho gets to keep theirs since they tend to be made of neutral killers that are mainly night immune, including the Sorceror with their one shot immunity.</p>
<p>I agree with Ashe, it makes the game far more interesting now. That means that both the minority faction at the time as well as the Neutral Killer actually has a chance to win with a neutral king, as when they posion the king and they do not announce it or die the two nights later, then they know that they have an opportuity to lie and have a chance to convince the king to help the win. This game is about deception after all, not just “oh, this guy is a filthy neutral that will always side with the minority faction”.</p>
<p>Those that have has experience with other deduction games like Town of Salem, you will see that those neuts have to work much harder to get their win. We have to do the same, but with the problem of having up to two possible claims pf a particular class and a lot more unique classes, it makes things much harder.</p>
<p>Basically what I’m saying, keep it. If it doesn’t work out, it doesn’t work out and it may be reverted back the way it is. But currently, I feel like this may give a chance to boost up the wins for the neutrals and the minority faction slightly more rather than just the BD.</p>

            <p>Unfortunate, but I actually like that interaction. Because of royalty you don’t see enough Neutral Kings imo, so it’s cool that there are things like Psycho King and Alch keeping their poison immunity.</p>
