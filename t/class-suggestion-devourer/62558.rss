    <description>The Devourer (Neutral Killing)

This NK is special, because it has two forms. It starts the game in its &quot;sleeping&quot; form and may evolve into its &quot;awakened&quot; form. The devourer awakens after successfully killing 4 players at night. Transformation occurs the moment the Devourer achieves this goal (at the end of a night).

SLEEPING FORM:

PASSIVE (Eternal Presence): Immune for the first three nights. If The Devourer would die the moment he transforms, he will not die, even if it&#39;s past night 3.

DAY (Premonition): Choose a player during the day. If that player dies during the following night (for whatever reason OTHER than you killing them), you will receive an additional kill for your awakening condition. Infinite use.

NIGHT (Demonic Impale): Attack a player. If you successfully killed the player, also occupy them. This is a normal attack. Heals and knight guards stop it. Infinite use.

AWAKENED FORM:

PASSIVE (Unyielding): Immune to occupation and target changing. Drunks debauching will kill the drunk.
PASSIVE (The Awakened One): Immune to death except execution during the day. Does not die to Prince&#39;s night ability. Does not die to Order of Execution. Does not die to any other ability. Only killable during the day through voting. (Therefore instantly wins any 1v1 stalemate, should it occur)

DAY (Devour Hope): This ability, once used during trial, instantly executes the person on trial. This acts exactly like the king&#39;s ability to choose fate, except it can only execute. Upon use, the court will see the message &quot;The King or The Devourer has decided to execute [number].&quot;. Single use.

DAY (Overwhelming Presence): This ability, once used BEFORE you are put on trial, negates all votes for the day, ultimately wasting the day. This acts exactly as The Fool&#39;s passive. Upon use, the court will see the message &quot;Tremendous dread fills the court. The immense fear prevents voting.&quot;. Single use.

NIGHT (Isolate and Devour): Attack a player. This ability kills your target, no matter what. Pierces immunities, hits through prince&#39;s jail and through healing. Infinite uses.

NIGHT (Adapt and Overcome): For the night, all players that visit your target will be killed. This ability kills affected players no matter what. Pierces immunities and hits through healing. May target yourself. Two uses.

Comments:
I felt like putting this here. I have to admit I didn&#39;t study other posts and there might have been similar suggestions before. I feel like this concept is refreshing because it combines two classes into one, kind of. If you&#39;ve played Town of Salem then you can tell this was inspired by Plaguebearer/Pestilence. Inspiration is good, right? Oh, also, sorry for poor formatting and stuff. This is my first post on the forum, been playing ToL for over 300 hours and felt like contributing, however meaningless it may be. Feel free to share your thoughts and attempt to balance this NK... Because it seems very strong tbh. Possibly too strong. The class requires a quick transformation because of night immunity only for first three nights, therefore it&#39;s risky to be sleeping past night 4.


EDIT1: Tweaked Devour Hope to enable the possibility of causing confusion. Added Unyielding. Tweaked Adapt and Overcome so that it can be used on any living player including The Devourer himself.

EDIT2: Reached daily reply limit for a new user, so I guess this post will become very silent for 14 hours, lmao. The Devourer now requires 4 kills to transform into his Awakened form. As before, both kills and deaths predicted by Premonition count towards the condition.</description>

            <p>I see what you’re trying to do though. The issue here is that its sleeping form is basically a regular NK while its awakened form is a super-powered one, which causes it to become a little strong when compared to the game’s current NKs. Town of Salem’s Pestilence is balanced as the Plaguebearer is an extremely weak role as it has pretty much no powers at all to compensate the Pestilence being completely immune to everything. Honestly I’d just change its sleeping form’s night ability and add a different condition for him to awaken. The lowered KPN in the early game should balance out the NK’s monstrous potential in the mid and late game.</p>

            <p>Prince exing this will give it away and the prince will wonder why aren’t you dead. I think killing drunks are a little harsh, but it’s suppose to be strong so. I suggest raising the amount of kills needed if you keep the day ability. The night ability of the awakened is a better sorc.</p>

            <p>Easily being found leads to super swingy games where, if you would implement your suggestion, a Princess finding the Devourer n1, almost leads to an instant win for the BD. Note that all other NK’s don’t have this downside to even someone as strong as an observer by virtue of their abilities and retain claimspace in this manner. I like the overall premise of a NK that grows stronger as time goes on, but I think it wasn’t executed perfectly here. You can compare it to Reaper who grows, in some sense, stronger as he obtains more souls, but can actually protect himself from the court through chilling and raising the amount of people needed to vote up by 1 through the way his Reap works.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Other than that, what’s your view on being absolutely immune in exchange for very revealing abilities he has? What about his ability to kill everyone without exceptions? Needs tweaks?</p>

            <p>As the passive ability suggests, once The Devourer wakes up, he may ONLY die by day execution. This is compensated by the fact that he takes some steps to be OP and that, right now, he’s not occ immune. I might adjust that.</p>

            <p>After thinking for a good while, maybe the class isnt overpowered in its current form because of how easy it is to detect it. Almost all the abilities, albeit incredibly powerful, are unique to The Devourer. Therefore he is found with relative ease. Maybe upon investigation by Princess instead of giving k/o it would say “[number] is an otherwordly abomination!”? Either way, the immense power is compensated by telltale signs of the class. Thoughts?</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m personally not against the absolute  immunity that this class brings in but the bypass immunity attack is so rare and it says “bypasses” so I think that should be removed</p>
<p>After thinking it a prince jail immunity is nice since it nerfs prince</p>
<p>And OE should also not work on it (OE should be completely removed tbh)</p>

            <p>See, I get what you are trying to do, but I think the uniqueness of this class lays in its absolute immunity. I agree with adding occupy immunity. MAYBE take away the Prince immunity. Also, changing Adapt and Overcome to your idea makes sense, makes The Devourer less suspicious when a lot of players die visiting one person.</p>

            <p>Yeah lol I mean it could be a good class but bypasses immunity doesn’t make any sense since they are called “bypass”</p>
<p>What I would do:<br>
~ Remove immunity to attacks that bypass immunity except prince jail<br>
~ Add occupation/target change immunity or bleeding/poison immunity<br>
~ Make Devour Hope double your votes and make it 2 to 3 uses<br>
~ Make Adapt and Overcome 1 use but can be used on any player including self</p>

            <p>You mean Overwhelming Presence? That only keeps you alive for one more night. Prince can jail you again. Maybe more kills required for awakening?</p>

<p>Not really you can just use your isolate and devour for the day and you should be good</p>

            <p>That’s kind of the point. The awakened form is supposed to be OP because it requires a setup. Also, since you are immune to prince exe, it will be painfully obvious that you are exactly this class after you survive jail execution.</p>

            <p>Also I saw the sleeping form btw and I think it would be pretty easy to kill 3 people in 3 nights</p>
