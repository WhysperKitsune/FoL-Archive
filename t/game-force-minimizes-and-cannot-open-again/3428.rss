    <title>Game force minimizes and cannot open again</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-force-minimizes-and-cannot-open-again/3428</link>
    <description>What happened:

The game (randomly) flashes and minimizes itself. Any attempt to re-open the game only results in me being able to see the sword mouse icon but my desktop stays in front of me. I have to force close the game before I can do anything else at this point. This happens constantly in both Windowed and Fullscreen mode. 

My specs: GTX 980, I7-4790K, 16GB Ram, on SSD Drive. 

What was SUPPOSED to happen:

I was supposed to enjoy playing the game without fear of it crashing.

Steps to reproduce this issue:

1. Start the Game
2. Play the Game for a length of time
3. Get a good role (jk)

Thank You for any help. I will try and take a pic next time it happens. (There is no crash report as the game &quot;minimizes&quot;)</description>

            <p>Hi there –</p>
<p>This isn’t actually a ToL issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/0/217691032449213266/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/0/217691032449213266/</a></p>
<p>Try updating your gfx card and using compatability mode. There are also hints about issues with DirectX - perhaps Google a repair utility.</p>
<p>Alternately, try launching with Vulcan instead of DirectX (there are 2 launch options).</p>

            <p>Just happened again.</p>
<p>I just uploaded my text file to my mediafire account this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/3utrjs3l930h591/output_log.txt" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.mediafire.com/file/3utrjs3l930h591/output_log.txt</a></p>
<p>I notice that this log has an interesting thing constantly written throughout the end.</p>
<p>d3d11: attempt to lock null buffer</p>
<p>Wonder what that is. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you everyone so far.<br>
When I verified the files it stated that all files had been successfully validated (to my understanding this meant nothing was missing).</p>
<p>Edit: Posted Logs below:</p>

            <p>As Try said and showed how, Logs might be useful but You might need to Validate your files.<br>

            <p>Have you tried verifying your local files? Maybe something’s missing. Logs might be useful as well, if the game manages to actually log anything.<br>
