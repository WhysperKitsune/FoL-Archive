            <p>Did you seem to get your day abilities confused ?<br>
Why would you need role block immunity when you’re not doing any thing ?<br>
The day abilities are not creative and they seem just a rip off from other existing classes. You also can’t have three passives.</p>
<p>The silence thing is unnecessary and I don’t think we need any more silencing when the reaper exists.</p>
