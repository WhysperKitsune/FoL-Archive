    <description>Several figures, with two others in the lead, walked down a white, metallic corridor. Everyone was in a hurry. One of the figures was a young scientist in a white lab coat, glasses, with a notepad in one hand and a pen in the other. He had short black hair and blue eyes. Next to him, walked a prominent figure who looked like a businessman. &quot;I sure am excited to finally get this started. This is my life&#39;s work and everyone who will know about it will be a few psychotic rascals running around throwing fireballs at each other,&quot; he chuckled.

The two walked in through a pair of automated doors into a bay full of trucks with a single exit for vehicles that led to above ground. The businessman and the rest made their way over to a wooden crate, as he presented the cards to the delivery team. He took a Black Card of King Arthur in his hands and said: &quot;Gentlemen. This is our most ambitious project so far. Don&#39;t fuck it up,&quot; he put his cigarette back in his mouth as he spoke. &quot;This card portrays... King Arthur of Camelot.&quot;

Suddenly, a bright light shined through in the room, as a sword adorned with golden trim appeared in the man&#39;s hand. &quot;As you may already know, the cards offer magical abilities to the last person that touched them, but in order to help them develop - we need to give them to attuned users. I&#39;ve already enchanted the scanners in your trucks. Your task is simple; deliver these cards to the right people,&quot; he put the King Arthur back in the box. &quot;And no playing around with the powers - these are not toys. These are the way that mankind will regain contact with the Magic of Old... Now get moving!&quot; he turned around and yelled.

Each delivery team took a small box of cards as well as scanners and got into their trucks. As the trucks&#39; motor started, a woman in black appeared carrying a small box. &quot;The agents are deployed, sir. They will help the card holders as planned&quot;

The man nodded as he puffed another cloud of smoke from his cigarettes. &quot;And the associate groups?&quot;

&quot;They have begin their distribution earlier as planned.&quot;

The man nodded absentmindedly. A new era of magic had begun.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(Marcus is there too, right?)<br>
(If so:)<br>
I can actually explain part of that.<br>
It is actually natural for almost everybody to remain for at least a short period of time after death, like an hour or so. But quite a bit of people remain longer than that, for weeks or months, or even years for some, after they die. They usually fade once they can rest easy, so to speak. Like, promising to feed their cat can do it, for instance. Although, usually they change into being quite self-centered/having almost total tunnel vision after they died. You seem to be fine, though, but that’s probably for the same reason you can make yourself visible to the living.</p>
