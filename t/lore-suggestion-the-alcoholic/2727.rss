    <title>[Lore Suggestion] The Alcoholic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/lore-suggestion-the-alcoholic/2727</link>
    <description>Deep in the light of the castle, layed a tavern. A tavern were they held wines of low - high alcohol levels. There was the brother of the prince, one that was of the older age then his. The Younger prince would always go out to the tavern and drink, drink, drink. And due to his royal heritage he was able to do as he wanted, for to him he had the most money in the world. Until one day, one day that changed his live forever............


Younger Prince: Ey! Ima go down to the tavern and have a drink
Butler: What ever you say my master......

_The Younger Prince walked down the stairs to the tavern_

_He opens the door_

_Everyone in the tavern looks disappointed_

_The Younger prince walks over to the bar_

Younger Prince: Ey! Bartender could I have a drink?
Bartender: _sighs_ Alright, here you go.
_Slides a glass of wine to the Younger Prince_

_The Prince Quickly Picks up the glass_

_He drinks it all down_

Younger Prince: Another one!

_The Bartender Sighs, and gives the Younger Prince another drink_

This continues until about the 20 glass.

Younger Prince: Ey! Youbettergivesmeanotherrdrink!
Bartender: No sir, you are way to drunk
Younger Prince: Whatareyoucallingmedrunk? Iaintnodrunk! 

_The Younger prince throws his glass at the bartender_

Bartender: Alright! That&#39;s it!
Bartender: Until you can control your drinking habits I here by ban you from this tavern!

_Younger prince is shocked_

Younger Prince: Whatdidyousay?Whatdidyousaytome?Iamtheprince!

Bartender: No, you are just a good-for nothing drunk!
Bartender: Hey! However escorts this drunk out of this tavern gets a free drink!

_Multiple Men stood up_

_They all grabbed hold on the drunk/Younger prince_

_They then proceeded over to the door and threw the drunk/older prince out_

_The Drunk-prince fell onto the ground and blacked out_


_He a-woke in his quarters_

Drunk/Younger Prince: Eh what happened?
Drunk/Younger Prince: Oh wait, I was banned from my favorite tavern!
Drunk/Younger Prince: I could never go sober! 
Butler: Um Sir?
Drunk/Younger Prince: Yes?
Butler: The king has revoked your rights to be prince, but you are still a member of the royal family.
Drunk/Younger Prince: WHAT! I am his soN! 

_Throws something at the Butler_

Butler: I am just going to leave now

_Butler Leaves the room_

_Nothing happens for a while, the Drunk Royal is now just sitting in his bed_

_Then something happened_

???: Hello?
Drunk: What who are you?
???: Well, I personally think that them kicking you out of the bar was a bad decision, as well as them revoking your rights to be prince. 
Drunk: I agree! Why would they ever kick someone like me out of a tavern! And It is just plain stupid that they revoked my rights!
???: I have a deal for you, I will supply you with as much alcohol as you desire? And, treat you as the prince you deserve to be.
Drunk: Already sounds like a good deal!
???: In exchange you will join a group that seeks to destroy the wicked blue dragon.
Drunk: Alright! Ill join.
???: You will?
Drunk: Ya, I never liked my father anyways, always, &quot;Don&#39;t drink its bad for your health&quot; and all the stuff like that!

--
From this day forward in time the Younger Prince/Drunk was no longer Either a Prince or Drunk. For he was a alcoholic seeking to destroy all of the blue dragon and their wicked deeds, whether it be to kill the father that betrayed him. or Seek the bartender that denied him. The drunk was a member of the group known as the _unseen_. 


Also, I am not the original poster of the younger prince idea. I just thought that it was a good idea
the page it came from was by

jammySplodge (She makes really good lore ;3)

            <p>Change the older prince to the younger prince and you will be golden.</p>

<p>It does not seem as smooth as Jammy’s.</p>
