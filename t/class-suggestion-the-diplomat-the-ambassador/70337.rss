            <p>In otherwords NK’s are balenced with these problems in mind.</p>
<p>Observer see’s reaper on a delay, doesn’t see the possessor at all and the sorcerer has a cloak</p>
<p>All 3 can survive both a knight and hunter.</p>
<p>So that leaves just princess who can find them which is a much smaller risk than all 4</p>

            <p>Now the point isn’t that they always do this (if it was then converting them would be pointless). However it happens enough that calling them objectively scum is just false</p>

            <p>By that logic, Nuclear, all NKs should never kill and side with BD because they might get caught by Princess, Observer, Knight or Hunter.</p>
<p>Kills are risky, sure, but I’d argue killing as Alchemist is 100% worth it if you actually use your skill and judgement to determine whether killing someone is a good idea.</p>

            <p>Like Squire is the closest thing to Amnesiac i’d like to see in ToL, because I don’t think having a Neutral that can take alignments could be a good thing for the game, especially with the issue of convert caps and in-faction promotions.</p>
<p>Plus, it only adds swing, while having a Universal Backup only reduces swing.</p>

            <p>however this class is bad because scum to town conversion is literally the worst fucking thing in Mafia ever</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rhcube">@RHCube</a> btw here’s a ToL Amnesiac for ya:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="steblue">The Squire</font></h1>
<p><strong>Blue Dragon Social</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Training (Passive)</strong> - You will survive the first time you are attacked in the first 3 nights.</p>
<p><strong>In Their Footsteps (Night)</strong> - Choose a dead non-unique Blue Dragon player. You will become their class. (Infinite uses. 1 night cooldown)<br>
<em>BD goal</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="purple">The Page</font></h1>
<p><strong>Unseen Social</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Training (Passive)</strong> - You will survive the first time you are attacked in the first 3 nights.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Their Mistakes (Night)</strong> - Choose a dead non-unique Blue Dragon player. You will become the Unseen version of their class. (Infinite uses. 1 night cooldown)<br>
<em>Unseen goal</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Credit goes to jammy, basically just the FoL class but with changges to how In Training works.</p>
