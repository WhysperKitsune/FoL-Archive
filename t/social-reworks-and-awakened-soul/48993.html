</aside>
<p>This feels like a really good rework, especially since speaking to the dead is still in the game. More on the Priest later, but I’m a fan of this new Psychic - they are the liaison between trusted BD, but since all BD can be converted (mostly), it’s not a “confirmed” network per se. Also, this is a potentially valid solution to the Social issue in live right now.</p>

<p>I’m very wary of this kind of “basket” ability, but this isn’t as op as, say, “You become the class of a dead person.” I’d be willing to try this, it’s restrained enough to possibly work.</p>

          <p>I love your noble, psychic and priest. Can you explain the mechanic of awakened soul please? I don’t quite understand it.</p>
<p>The social classes were obviously very unclear from what their actual roles were, so its great to clearly define their roles like this.</p>
<p>My only problem is that the scribe is very weak. Seeing whispers isn’t enough to carry an entire class, and although the passive is interesting, it definitely needs to another element to keep it on tier with other BD. Especially as unseen don’t even whisper that much in the day as they have a night chat.</p>

<p>I know I’ve mentioned this before, but why does this have a cooldown?  Illusionist’s skilled passive allows them to use mind warp in the same night without being suspicious.  Also, change this so it only adds a player, and change focus link so it removes a player.  Also give the new focus link unlimited uses.</p>

<p>NOPE. Then it just has an OP ability pool. It can already use all sorts of abilities, but I don’t want it to become just every class that’s ever died. It should use its dead people carefully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Awakened Soul works like this:</p>
<p>3 BD are Dead. Priest uses Awaken. All 3 become Awakened Souls.</p>
<p>During the night, they can vote who to kill. Basically the get to lynch someone. If it is a tie or their is no majority, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Once they kill someone they all revert back to their original classes(still Dead though)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You know what? At first I was very cautious about this since it’s a big departure from the DK (a class I love), but I actually think this is a big improvement. Awakened Souls incentivize all BD to stay in the game after death in a more dynamic way than the DK.</p>
<p>In general, upon reflection, I think these suggestions for Social classes are <strong>very</strong> good.</p>

<p>It’s not for the illusionist. It’s for the Apostle. He cannot alter the link at all and if he could then that would beg the question of what it would do if he was converted from Noble/Scribe/Priest.</p>
