            <p>That basically means the Dead decide who is lynched.</p>
<p>A more mild version might be to let just the Priest cast the vote. It’s pretty strong as the living know the Priest is good.</p>
<p>I’d consider it, but I’d want to hear more feedback first.</p>

            <p>And would this be broken on the Priest:</p>
<p>Seance: (D) (1)<br>
Allow all dead Blue Dragon players to accuse and vote for the next trial.</p>

            <p>You could also just make it a Special class. And than make special convert into Apostle. Maybe that’s weird though.</p>
<p>Or we could make Ritualist have Dark whispers.</p>

            <p>I don’t know, because then it wouldn’t make sense for the Apostles to have Dark Whispers, just is thematically and more organized as a Social class</p>

            <p>Still has the same problem as the original I think.</p>
<p>Besides, it would be more interesting to give the dead other ways to interact instead of just one method.</p>

            <p>Okay would this be a better Seance? I’m just trying to strengthen the Social part of Priest</p>
<p>Seance: (D) (1)<br>
Choose a player when dead. Tonight, only you will freely talk with them.</p>
<p>This is heavily nerfed from the first suggestion</p>
