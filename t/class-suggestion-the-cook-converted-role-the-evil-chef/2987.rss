<p>or <em>lose</em> BD the game. Assuming this ability will always be successfully used on Scum doesn’t allow for proper balance theory.</p>
<p>This is why Black Wine was removed – It helped Scum have a reason not to talk. Giving Scum an alibi to not defend themselves actually assists them.</p>

            <p>Especially when you’re nearing the end of the game it could win BD the game if someone suspect can’t defend themselves from being accused of treason. I’ve seen many situations where Unseen wins because they can easily just defend themselves as everyone suspects everyone in the lategame. And it’s only a Support role, I don’t think the abilities should ALWAYS be useful.</p>
