    <title>[New Class] The MadMan</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-the-madman/11657</link>
    <description>Alright, so i have this idea to bring in a new neutral, it would be almost identical as the fool, but this one would have to get himself killed at night.

The idea is to copy the fool&#39;s mechanism, but you&#39;d rather try to get yourself killed at night and not during day ! If you succeed, the identity of your murderer as well as his class will be displayed to everyone the next day ! This could slow down the &quot;Random kill lol&quot; at night and force people to think more about their actions...

Goal of the class : Get executed at night.
Abilities : The old fool&#39;s fireworks
There could be only either fool or MadMan, but never both in the same game !</description>

            <p>But random killing is to some extent the necessary goal for evils. You’ve got say, 1 confirmed investigative, 6 unknowns and you are pretty sure there’s protectors left… you attack the confirmed you are basically knight food, or a phys is going to undo whatever you’ve done. You charge the unknowns you’ll probably find the prince etc…</p>

            <p>It would force them to carefully select their targets, rather than just going for yolo kills. And a kill from a possessor would appear from the possessed, now the possessor himself.</p>

            <p>Its pretty impossible to tell the difference between this and the fool . It would be impossible to deduce which it was so you would end up with a 50-50 chance of getting it right .</p>
<p>Also random killing for possessor and assassin shouldn’t be this heavily punished .</p>
