    <title>[Bug] Knight Guard kills Sorcerer?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/bug-knight-guard-kills-sorcerer/24471</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Got killed as a Sorcerer by a Knight guarding my target. My target still ended up dying for some reason.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Sorcerer is immune to death at night, so I shouldn&#39;t have been killed.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Attack someone being guarded by a Knight as a Sorcerer.
#### Comments:
Sorcerer/Inquisitor are the only night immune classes that can attack, so I think that it&#39;s an oversight, as they&#39;ve been recently added. If it&#39;s NOT an oversight, at least add to the Knight&#39;s skill description that it can bypass night immunity.</description>

            <p>In general night immunity is protection from most things that target you… IE you cannot be killed by an assasain or CL’s attack, or a knight Cold steeling etc…</p>
<p>defensive attacks, such as a knights sacrifice. hunters bear etc… will still get you… as well as certain night immunity bypassing attacks such as the princes execution, or a reaper using souls to bypass immunity (obviously the latter doesn’t relate to sorc). that being said yes the knights ability should have guarded him from you… meaning maybe someone else also attacked, or perhaps he was already poisoned/bleeding,</p>

            <p>Knight Guard bypasses immunities.  Possessor will also die if they self possess into a Knight.</p>
<p>Target should live though.</p>
