    <title>Cannot Copy Paste Logs to chat on Mac</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cannot-copy-paste-logs-to-chat-on-mac/32993</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I tried to copy and paste my logs when I was jailed and again after, but I tried to right click copy, which did not work, so I tried both Command C Command V and then also Control C Control V (just to see if that would work). The outcome was me typing the letter &quot;C&quot; over all the text I had selected instead of copying it. So I never did get to copy and paste my logs to prove who I was. So I wound up getting executed.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The logs should have been copied and then pasted with natural hot keys. 

#### Steps to reproduce:

Just try and copy paste from your logs into the game chat.

#### Comments:

Let me know if you need any more info! Thanks for the help!</description>
