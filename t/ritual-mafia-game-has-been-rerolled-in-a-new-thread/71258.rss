    <title>Ritual Mafia - (Game has been rerolled in a new thread)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ritual-mafia-game-has-been-rerolled-in-a-new-thread/71258</link>
    <description>## :skull: [color=darkred]Welcome to Ritual Mafia[/color] :skull: 
In Ritual mafia The Congregation (town faction) must fight against The Heretics (mafia faction) in order to gain the favor of their gods. How do you gain their favor? By sacrificing your own teammates on a ritual, of course!

Also every class has a high-risk/high-reward ability that can give your team an advantage if used correctly. However you must be careful, use it without thinking and you will face the wrath of the gods.

### :skull: [color=darkred]Gameplay[/color] :skull: 
* Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch Phase
* Ritual Phase lasts 24 hours
* During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.
* Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.  
* &quot;The Ritual was interrupted&quot; message means that the player&#39;s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.
* People can vote for themselves during Ritual phase, but not during Lynch phase.
* Lynch Phase lasts 48 hours or until majority is reached.
* You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.
* If a lynch happens within the first 12 hours of the lynch phase and ritual targets&#39; haven&#39;t been chosen a grace period will be given to pick the targets.
* During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched. 
* Nights will be 24 hours long
* During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.
* Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.
* The Heretics will have a day/night chat.
* The most recent version of your logs will be shown when you die.
* You can submit deathnotes on kills. These can be text or pictures.
* There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get &quot;You slept peacefully.&quot; or &quot;You died&quot; as feedback. The exceptions are the following:

[details=&quot;List of night results&quot;]
If you use an investigative ability are you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.
_If an investigative ability fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action._
_If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target&#39;s class type is [class type]._
_If you receive a private message because of the Confession day ability: Someone sent you an anonymous message [message]._
_If a Blood Mage successfully kills a member of the Congregation with Collect Blood: You gained 2 extra uses of Barrier of Blood._
_If a Medium uses Seance on a dead player: You got the following message from your Seance: [message]._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!_
_If one or more of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;At least one of your targets is a member of the Heretics!&quot;_
_If none of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;None of your targets are members of the Heretics&quot;_
_If you successfully predict a death with Oracle&#39;s Prediction: You gained 1 extra use of All-seeing Eye._
_If you use Clairvoyance on a player that didn&#39;t visit anyone: Your target didn&#39;t visit anyone last night._
_If you use Clairvoyance on a player that visited someone: Your target visited [Player(s)] last night._
_If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that wasn&#39;t visited by anyone: No one visited your target last night._
_If an Oracle uses Vision on a player that was visited by someone: Your target was visited by [Player(s)] last night._
_If an Oracle uses All-seeing Eye on a player: Your target is the [Class]._
_If you get a new ability from a Ritual: You have gained a new ability: [ability description]_
[/details]


### :skull: [color=darkred]Other mechanics and interactions[/color] :skull: 
* You cannot target yourself with abilities unless stated otherwise.
* Conflicting abilities will be cancelled. For example, two Enchanters trying to redirect the same player to different targets would cause said player to not be redirected at all.
* Enchanter can only redirect targeted abilities (for example, you cannot force a blood mage to use barrier of blood on someone else).
* Self-killing or suicide abilities cannot be healed or prevented in any way except being occupied or by Voodoo Link.
* Dying because of Voodoo Link counts as a suicide.
* If your limited use ability fails for any reason you will still spend an use.
* If a medium&#39;s target is changed their abilities will fail instead.
* A target of Channel Spirit will not get notified when the effect ends due to conversion.
* The medium will visit the targets of the channeled spirit.
* Starting warlock appears not suspicious only to Diviner&#39;s &quot;Divination&quot; ability. Any other class or faction revealing effect will check him as a Heretic.
* If the last Heretic is sacrificed, Town will NOT win, since the conversion triggers immediately (unless their Ritual abilities are disabled somehow).

            <p>I tried to signal that I was Diviner by putting my scum leans in forms of 3 occassionally, but noone caught on. I was very unsure if I should have outed and taken the sacrifice or not. 2 faction checks is pretty powerful, but I could do that every night honestly, so instead I only softed sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Welcome to the Inner Macinations of Marluxion’s Mind</em></p>
<p><em>Immediately upon entering the game and receiving my class card, I was hoping to draw as much aggression and pressure towards myself as possible - as I wasn’t planning to life past this first phase. Little did I know…</em></p>
<p><em>Memesky townslipped by starting the wagon - his reasoning was good. I called him town, when he was trying to get scumread. Slayer’s Gambit, as Icibalus calls it.</em></p>
<p><em>However, things stopped going according to plan when Ici called out Marl’s reaction, creating an entirely new layer of WIFOM to this borderline gamethrow-ey play.</em></p>
<p><em>Was this going to stop Marl? No, only a reasonable man would have stopped this play there. Marl’s goal wasn’t just to catch one mere scum - It was to catch an entire basket of scum. A murder of scum.</em></p>
<p><em>Through Marl’s ritual ability, he was going to enable the town to kill TWO scum in one day. A Buy One Get One scum, if you will.</em></p>
<p><em>Marl made his move - he claimed his class in an attempt to become the day’s sacrifice…</em></p>
<p><em>But his hubris was his undoing. He was too focused on reading people as scum that he missed reading the most elementary thing… his own classcard.</em></p>
