            <p>The Forger’s Mischief is wayyy too strong, maybe make it so he occupies all players he made an armour for, if a forger gets converted late game that could be like 4 kills in one night. Also being able to stack armour 3 times is OP, 3 nights of death immunity for the prince makes the game un-winnable for evils. Maybe instead change the Blacksmith’s two day abilities to:</p>
<p>Make Armour - Make a player a piece of armour, granting them death immunity until attacked (Infinite Uses - Can Target Self - Cannot Target the Same Player Twice - Does Not Stack)<br>
Make Weapon - Make a player a weapon to buff their abilities with, empowering their abilities [Same as Court Wizard] (Infinite Uses - Can Target Self - Cannot Target the Same Player Twice - Does Not Stack) | Or it could give a player an extra use of their abilities that aren’t infinite (Day or Night), that way if you accidentally empowered assassin then they could have an extra poison.</p>
<p>This way you have to make a choice of whether to armour someone or empower them, however since you can only do it once of each, it isn’t too OP and doesn’t make Court Wizard useless.</p>
