    <title>Why reaper (somehow) has royal blood</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/why-reaper-somehow-has-royal-blood/53946</link>
    <description>There was once a king (Beleive it or not :wink: ) This was in the time before everyone said NEUTS OUT. He was a neutral king. That night he made sure to have guards with him. As he was falling asleep he heard this scrapping sound. He knew it instantly. The reaper has come. The reaper is one of his worst nightmare. Not for the fact it can kill. But for the fact his guards are powerless against it. 1 by 1 the guards died. When the reaper reached his chamber door. When the reaper looked the king in the eye, he saw that survival look. He doesn&#39;t want me dead. He just wants to survive he thought.  Then the reaper said &quot;King If you want to survive you must do me a favor&quot; the king said he will do anything. You see your daughter. She shall be mine and you shall live. Does that sound fair? Anything just leave me alone the king said.

The reaper laugh echoed across the chambers, as he was married. 

He was finally able to be king he thought...
Oh what chaos can I cause?</description>
