    <description>Kidnapper - Neutral Special 

Passive - Night immune once

Day ability - Jail your target. If the Prince selects the same person your jail will fail. If you jail the Prince his jail will fail. If he jails you your jail will fail. If you both jail each other then your jail will fail. (Otherwise jail works just like the Prince&#39;s 

Night ability 1 (Execute): Execute your prisoner - 3

Night ability 2 (Royal Mask): Have your jail chat appear as Prince for the rest of the night (normally says kidnapper) - infinite

            <p>All of these facts are known and intended. The fact that you can to a Kidnapper check means it won’t effect games it’s not in. The princesses means he can be found to not be Prince and the first thing you mentioned means that you need to go into each jail with atleast some kind of plan.</p>
<p>In other words you are completely right and this is fine.</p>

            <p>I see, but the fact is that you have to be very quick and efficient with your button pressing because otherwise they’ll probably see you as evil. Also people can Kidnapper check on d2 to confirm that there is actually a Kidnapper in the game. (Also princess will see Kidnapper as Special/Investigative  so you’ll probably be outed right away. Making the class Killer allows more flexibility). I’m just saying that this role is a VERY difficult role to play.</p>

            <p>While this class would make a great NK with a bit of tweaking (same with a survivor goal) I made this class with a goal in mind: putting pressure or the Prince and giving BD prisoners a reason to seem scum. The goal I gave is the only one that works to fulfill this purpose</p>

            <p>I’m just looking through this role suggestion, and I do think that this class should be a NK and have an NK goal. This role is a very good one but it will be very difficult to claim and once Prince dies everyone knows theres a Kidnapper. Honestly make it so that you just survive, helping whichever side you think will win.</p>

            <p>It’d be negative in the respect of BD arguing with Prince in jail over not revealing info or their class and getting executed for it. Flame wars would ensue.</p>
<p>So the Kidnapper has to use his night ability to have himself appear as Prince, but if he does so he can’t execute…</p>
<p>So the meta shifts into “If Prince talks first, he’s probably Prince.”<br>
Even with this new routine, important BD players (or self-important ones lol) will refuse to give their class <em>in case</em> the Prince is actually a Kidnapper that will execute them the next night.</p>
<p>BD is fairly strong right now, but even so its win rate would plummet with the huge rise of mis-executions and lack of trust with BD’s most powerful role. The Kidnapper is one of those classes that can hugely influence the game even if he doesn’t spawn in said game.</p>

            <p>Remember the fact that a Kidnapper cannot appear as Prince and Kill you on the same night. This means that if in jail you see the prince chat then you cannot be killed by the Kidnapper (the Prince however…).</p>
<p>Also who said that the change is negative?</p>

            <p>I think the Kidnapper will affect the meta in a negative way.</p>
<p>Even if a Kidnapper doesn’t spawn in a given game, it causes BD to give false information or refuse to give their class to the real Prince under suspicion of him being a Kidnapper. This will allow scum to have a reason not to claim to the Prince or to lie about information.</p>
<p>I’m not sure the Kidnapper role is interesting enough to add any dynamic change to the game in its current state.</p>

<li>
<p>The mere fact that the Princess is finding this result should cause suspicion – the Princess herself is an Investigative role, reducing the “investigative slot potential” meaning your target is slightly more likely to be a Special class.</p>

<p>KING: always shows up, no matter what</p>
<p>MM: Shows up with Unseen (Same with CL except shows up with cult) So for reasons to prove my point I’m going to combine them into the Converters (NOT SUGGESTING A CLASS WITH THIS) There for, every game 2 specials will <em>always</em> show up</p>

<p>Thus, making this statement wrong.</p>
<p>I don’t like this class due to it really being a Neutral Prince. There should be only one person that can jail and that should be the prince.</p>

<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Because Prince is killer. If you don’t want it to be a ‘killer’ persay, make it neutral offensive, or neut evil, given that the goal is a standard neut evil goal.</li>

            <p>The thing with classes like ToS Witch is they need to be extremely powerful and have a method of not random dying due to not knowing your allies to have a chance at success. I could see Unseen/Cult just by chance alone killing this class in the first few nights before you even get a chance to find any allies, so it’d come down to almost pure luck alone whether you won or not.</p>

            <p>That’s an unpopular opinion believe it or not. Roles like ToS Witch are incredibly popular and fun to play. Since you are evil but other evils don’t know you it means you first need to find your Ally’s. These roles tend to be more powerful than the average evil (other than NK) and this the evils REALLY want to find them ASAP.</p>
