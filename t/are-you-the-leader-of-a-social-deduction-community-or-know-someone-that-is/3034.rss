    <title>Are you the leader of a social deduction community, or know someone that is?</title>

    <description>We are very open to cross-promotional activities! Anyone interested in this should send a message to **i42-Elsa** on Discord with more info.

If you are the leader of such a community (or friends with someone who is), be sure to reach out to them and let&#39;s see if we can get them involved! You&#39;ll definitely be the hero on both sides of the community for making it happen :slight_smile:

Send leads and insight to **i42-Elsa** in [Discord](http://throneofli.es/discord) ~ the genre is very niche and every game is unique to it&#39;s own. The more we can collaborate with others, the bigger the genre itself becomes and the more people will play social deduction games!</description>

            <p>Or me as a leader of the games discussion <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Anyway, it would be interesting if we had any close links to any related games. Might give both parties a boost</p>
