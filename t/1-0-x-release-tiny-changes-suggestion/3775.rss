    <title>~1.0.X release tiny changes suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/1-0-x-release-tiny-changes-suggestion/3775</link>
    <description>After playing game a lot and analysing it I&#39;d like to share my thoughts how to improve gameplay experience by just **tiny changes**.

## Court Wizard
Barrier is quite useless and playing this class definitely isn&#39;t much fun. And magic should be awesome!
**- whenever he casts a barrier on somebody, he casts it on himself as well**
**- let him ice ward himself**

## Drunk
Drunk gets in way of people. Mostly just blocking Blue Dragon members, as evil/neutral roles are often occupy immune. He gets decent amount of information, but dies easiely and quickly, not providing much value.
**- add day ability like alchemist Stoneskin Potion with 1 charge, it can be named &quot;Drunk Man&#39;s Luck&quot;**

## Physician -&gt; Apothecary/Barber Surgeon or Psychic -&gt; Telepath
Name physician is confused by a lot of players with psychic. It produces in game unneccessary chaos.
**- rename Physician to Apothecary/Barber Surgeon**
OR
**- rename Psychic to Telepath**

## Noble
Some people will say Noble is awesome role, as he can hear whispers etc. I do not agree. People often whisper just 1 sentence (very often it&#39;s not even associated with game). Evils almost never whisper each other. In more than half of games people ain&#39;t whispering at all till some mid-lategame, when noble is usualy already dead or confirmed (and he can whisper for any information he needs, instead spying). I think he needs little improvement to be more fun-to-play.

But there is also second matter. In ToS removing spy ability to whisper made a game much better. Evils allowed to whisper come up with better strategies, communicate with each other and game is more alive.

**- remove his ability &quot;maid spy&quot; (aristocrat can still have &quot;maid spy&quot;)**
**- make him talk with king every night (they won&#39;t know numbers), so that noble will kind of &quot;control&quot; kings behavior**

## Summary
Above changes should improve quality of game by a decent amount, while remaining very easy to implement. Their impact on balance should be negligible.</description>

            <p>I agree, they aren’t the same, and most people can tell.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed that now the game is fully released, the general perception of the game’s players has dropped significantly. (using big words to sound smart)</p>
<p>(not people’s perception of the game’s players, but the player’s perception)</p>

            <p>Ashe, when I suggested name change, the core part of my suggestion was “CHANGE THE NAME”, not “IT HAS TO BE DOCTOR”. You missed the point and just blasted my suggestion with meme. And I just hate people, so don’t take it personal ^^.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick jab at my intelligence <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>But Doctor doesn’t fit in a medieval setting. Psychic to Telepath works, or Physician to Apothecary, and I do agree with the want for a change.</p>

            <p>As usual you bring very strong, logical arguments…</p>
<p>Yes. Physician has to be renamed. To doctor or anything else. Or psychic to telepath. I don’t care. Otherwise players (especially new) will always undestand phys/psyc claim falsely a lot. I do not think confusion of new players is what game devs want.</p>
