    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Duke + The Tyrant</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-duke-the-tyrant/2545</link>
    <description>Lady and gentleman, I present to you the most over powered class I have suggested yet........

**The duke**
Blue dragon social; unique
Additional notes:  spawns every game the nobles do not, and in no games that the nobles do.

**Royal blood** (passive) [Only usable after the death of a King] Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. 
**Parliament** (day, 3 uses) Your vote of execute/pardon will be counted twice in the next election.
**Filibuster** (day, 3 uses) all players who are currently accusing you of treason will rescind their accusation and accuse each other randomly. They will be unable to rescind these accusations until after the next trial.
**Private estate** (night, 3 uses) retreat to your private estate tonight; same effect as though a mercenary used “stand guard” on you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Tyrant**
 Unseen social, converted from the duke

**Royal blood** (passive) [Only usable after the death of a King] Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.
**Parliament** (day, 3 uses) your vote of execute/pardon will be counted twice in the next election.
**Filibuster** (day, 3 uses) all players who are currently accusing you of treason will rescind their accusation and randomly accuse each other. They will be unable to rescind these new accusations until after the next trial.
**Slander** (night, 3 uses) if your target goes on trial tomorrow, all blue dragon members will be forced to vote &quot;execute&quot;

-----------------------------------


Partially inspired by ThePlex&#39;s jury ability on &quot;the vassal&quot;

Note: As the tyrant, use slander to reveal who the neutral faction members are.</description>

<p>it only <strong>forces</strong> blue dragon to vote execute. the unseen can also vote execute because 1) you probably used this ability because you wanted this guy dead and 2) to seem blue dragon</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Filibuster will confirm yourself, and that’s it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if no other trial takes place, it prevents those people from accusing you of treason. Here is an example of how it could be really good:</p>
<p>there is the assassin, the tyrant, and two physicians left. the physicians will just heal each other indefinitely. If they are accusing the duke just for the lolz because they are stupid or don’t realize he is the tyrant, eh can use filibuster to make them accuse each other of treason, and because they won’t be able to rescind until after the next trial, the unseen will now have enough votes to get either of them on trial and then will have 2 votes to the other physician’s 1.</p>
<p>it is also a good way to stall for time; if there is about twenty seconds left, you can prevent yourself from getting on trial.</p>
<p>but yes, its main purpose is to confirm them, because the nobles can also confirm themselves.</p>

            <p>You can just state Royal Blood, everyone knows what it is <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Duke:</p>
<p>Make Parliament a limited day-ability. It’s brokenly powerful.<br>
Make Filibuster a limited day-ability. It’s brokenly powerful.<br>
Private estate is decent. Adding survivabillity to the primarily day-focused role.</p>
<p>Arch Duke:</p>
<p>Parliament is WAY too OP on an evil class. It is just about okay in Duke if you make it a limited-use ability but I do not ever see it being workable for an Unseen class. I suggest thinking of an entirely new day-ability to do with vote manipulation.<br>
Make Filibuster limited use like for Duke.<br>
Stronghold is also broken on an evil role. It is Infinite uses so basically this guy is night Immune for no reason??? Why does he need to be night immune AND immune to investigating like what? I would also suggest removing that in favour of a new night-ability.</p>

<p><strong>The duke</strong><br>
Blue dragon social; unique<br>
Additional notes:  spawns every game the nobles do not, and in no games that the nobles do.</p>
<p><strong>Royal blood</strong> (passive) [Only usable after the death of a King] Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.<br>
<strong>Parliament</strong> (day, 3 uses) Your vote of execute/pardon will be counted twice in the next election.<br>
<strong>Filibuster</strong> (day, 3 uses) all players who are currently accusing you of treason will rescind their accusation and accuse each other randomly. They will be unable to rescind these accusations until after the next trial.<br>
<strong>Private estate</strong> (night, 3 uses) retreat to your private estate tonight; same effect as though a mercenary used “stand guard” on you.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Tyrant</strong><br>
Unseen social, converted from the duke</p>
<p><strong>Royal blood</strong> (passive) [Only usable after the death of a King] Can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.<br>
<strong>Parliament</strong> (day, 3 uses) your vote of execute/pardon will be counted twice in the next election.<br>
<strong>Filibuster</strong> (day, 3 uses) all players who are currently accusing you of treason will rescind their accusation and randomly accuse each other. They will be unable to rescind these new accusations until after the next trial.<br>
<strong>Slander</strong> (night, 3 uses) if your target goes on trial tomorrow, all blue dragon members will be forced to vote “execute”</p>
<hr>
<p>Partially inspired by ThePlex’s jury ability on “the vassal”</p>
<p>Note: As the tyrant, use slander to reveal who the neutral faction members are.</p>
