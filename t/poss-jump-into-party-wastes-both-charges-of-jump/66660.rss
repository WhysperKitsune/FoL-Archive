    <title>Poss jump into party wastes both charges of jump</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/poss-jump-into-party-wastes-both-charges-of-jump/66660</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was possessor and tried to jump into a butler (first jump of the game).
The butler partied, I got occupied (since party bypasses occ immunity).
I lost BOTH charges of my jump.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I guess i was supposed to lose only one charge (if any), since my jump was cancelled.
If that&#39;s on purpose (and not a bug), I don&#39;t get the point of losing both charges there.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Be a possessor.
Try to jump into a butler who is partying that night.
Lose both charges of jump.</description>
