    <title>My Throne of Lies Spreadsheet</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/my-throne-of-lies-spreadsheet/44184</link>
    <description>I made this ToL spreadsheet to track things. Right now I only have a game log and a starting project on &quot;Which Slot Is Evil the Most?&quot;. It will probably expand in the future, but I doubt this thing will have any relevancy in one week&#39;s time.

UPDATE: I have updated the sharing permissions. You can now leave comments! Give me feedback, ideas, your opinions on the King update. I will probably end up replying to your comments.

And as always, hail Mithras.</description>
