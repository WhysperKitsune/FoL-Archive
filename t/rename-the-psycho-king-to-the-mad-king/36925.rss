    <title>Rename the Psycho King to the Mad King</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rename-the-psycho-king-to-the-mad-king/36925</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t a terribly big suggestion, but &quot;Psycho&quot; feels a bit out-of-theme for the game.  I suggest renaming the Psycho King to the Mad King, which is much more setting-appropriate.

(Googling, the word &quot;Psychosis&quot; only dates to the 1850&#39;s, and &quot;Psycho&quot; as a slang term for it is even more recent - the first recorded usage of the term is from 1935!  Whereas &quot;The Mad King&quot; is of course a term that has had a lot of historical usage.)</description>

            <p>Yes please.</p>
<p>“Psycho” is evolving as a slur in keeping with rising social awareness about mental illnesses (finally). Please rename him to Mad King or something else that isn’t “Crazy/Psycho/Mentally Disabled King.”</p>
<p>I know the devs are sensitive to these sorts of issues, so it’s worth pointing out. Thanks</p>
