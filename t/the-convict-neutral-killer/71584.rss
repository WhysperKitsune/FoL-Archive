        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hiding logs just adds artificial difficulty of people just copying and pasting logs to an external source as a failsafe.</p>
<p>I would rework it to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burn the Evidence (Night): Kill a player. Their log will not appear. [X Uses]</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>I changed mutiny to a more powerful ability, to help it hide not only itself but all evils in order to keep more killing classes alive, also to balance Capital punishment more</p>

            <p>It’s day ability’s already make it unique. And it’s namesake is already the core game mechanic, it just leads to anti-climatic endgame.</p>
<p>Removing mutiny is to counterbalence removing capital punishment and also because it’s kinda a BS ability. Feel free to rework it into something more contained instead.</p>

            <p>But that eliminates a lot from it like<br>
-The unique aspect of the class<br>
-It actually living/dying to its namesake</p>

            <p>I’d just remove capital punishment entirely but also remove mutiny and then make slit kill survivors in 1 night instead of 2 so it is identical to Hunter wolf</p>
