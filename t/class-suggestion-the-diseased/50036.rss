    <title>[Class suggestion] The Diseased</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-diseased/50036</link>
    <description>The diseased is a neutral class that is permanently poisoned and needs to bait healers in order to survive. This class is usually harmful to the BD since it will redirect healers from healing important targets to healing him.

&gt;**The Diseased**
&gt;Neutral, Offensive
&gt;
&gt; **Passive: Chronic disease**
&gt; At the beginning of each day (starting from day 2) if you are not poisoned or bleeding you will become poisoned/bleeding (depends on the evil faction). You will die in 2 days unless healed.
&gt;
&gt; **Passive 2: Sympathy**
&gt;Immune to death and occupation.
&gt;
&gt;**Day ability 1: Insurance**
&gt;Anyone that tries to heal you tonight will be immune to death and occupation. 3 uses.
&gt;
&gt; **Night ability 1: Pity** 
&gt; Select a player. Anyone trying to visit said player will visit you instead, they will not know who they were forced to visit. Goes through redirection immunity. Unlimited uses. 
&gt;_(Anyone redirected by this ability will get a message saying &quot;You were forced to target The Diseased!&quot;)._
&gt;
&gt; **Night ability 2: Expunge**
&gt; Everyone who visits you tonight will die. If at least one person dies this way you will be healed of any poison/bleeding. 3 uses.
&gt;
&gt;**Goal:** Survive.</description>

            <p>I see, that makes sense.</p>
<p>I guess I didn’t read correctly.</p>
<p>But what would this class claim?</p>

<p>well, if you latch on to one healer the whole game, are you really playing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You will mainly be redirecting from the people who claim poisoned or bleeding or important roles that are likely to be healed. Most of the time when someone asks for healing all of the healers in the game will try to heal that person, which means ALL healers will be immune to your redirection after three uses.</p>

            <p>well, if you latch on to one healer the whole game, are you really playing?</p>
<p>Also, what viable claims does the Diseased have currently?</p>
<p>+immune to occupation (could work positively and negatively)<br>
+Good for offensive<br>
-Bad for a lot else (because Butler can see immune people)</p>
<ul>
<li>Expunge cannot be used for a hunter claim (eventually "hey hunter wolf this kid)<br>
-Pity cnnot be used (hey drunk HH this kid)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can claim Diseased but they’ll just kill you unless it’s only Diseased+Phys(+DK probably) vs Assassin (Diseased, Phys, Assassin can only end with Insurance+Heal+Cold Steel(DK) or Insurance+Heal+Voting next day.)</p>
<p>No claims really</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>That would make drunk the only viable claim as The Diseased, so if there are 2 drunks you cannot claim anything else. Also even if you are claiming drunk, people will be suspicious of you if they see you keep debauching the outed healers.</p>
<p>Also I made his redirection go through immunity because otherwise you can only redirect healers 3 times before they become immune.</p>

            <p>I think this could be a fun class for Forum of Lies honestly!<br>
Might be a bit too complicated for the main game (Difficult for new players to understand/master, insta-death if a very low amount of healers spawn) but I do like it!</p>

            <p>What about this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of each day (starting from day 2) if you are not poisoned or bleeding you will become poisoned/bleeding (depends on the evil faction). You will die in 2 days unless healed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the passive poisons you at day instead of night that means you will be poisoned again immediately even if you are healed. I think making him die in one day would be a bit harsh, since you will die if the prince ever jails you (which will happen most games).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I really like this idea.</p>
<p>The fact that it has to be harmful in order to live makes it difficult, so they have to hide in order to succeed. It’s also interesting because they need the Healers alive.</p>
<p>One suggestion:</p>
<p>You should die in one night, and be able to healed on a night when you get poisoned/bled, like a Hunter’s wolf.  2 days is a lot of time to draw Healers, and means you have a night when you don’t need them.</p>
