<h1>DR5: Mirrored Embers</h1>
<p>A killing game.<br>
Hosted by Arete and Icibalus.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dangan Ronpa is a forum game based on the approximately popular game series of the same named, except because I’m hosting it, there will be a <em>minimal</em> amount of anime.</li>
<li>In the game, you explore the map in the <strong>Daily Life</strong> phase, uncover evidence in the <strong>Deadly Life</strong> phase, and attempt to bring the killer to justice in the <strong>Class Trial</strong>. You can perform actions that could be- well, just about anything an actual human could do.</li>
<li>In the game, the majority of players will be <font color="teal"><strong>Participants</strong></font>, but one player, lurking among them, will be the nefarious <font color="brown"><strong>Mastermind</strong></font>, plotting their destruction.</li>
<li>There are two ways to win as a <font color="teal"><strong>Participant</strong></font>:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Survive the killing game, unveil all the Blackened, and expose the Mastermind in the <strong>FINAL TRIAL</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Commit murder and survive to escape the town.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two ways for the <font color="brown"><strong>Mastermind</strong></font> to win:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the Participants fail to expose N murderers. The value of N is unknown, even to the <font color="brown"><strong>Mastermind</strong></font>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Survive the <strong>FINAL TRIAL</strong> without being exposed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that the <font color="brown"><strong>Mastermind</strong></font> <em>cannot</em> directly kill, but they have other… advantages that they can use to help bring the <font color="teal"><strong>Participants</strong></font> down.</li>
<li>There are also the neutral <font color="red"><strong>Wildcards</strong></font>, who win by doing:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Something. You don’t know what, but something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daily Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During this phase, players may perform actions freely (explained below), explore the academy, and do incredibly stupid and completely unjustifiable actions for the sake of ephemeral comedy.</li>
<li>Throughout the map are secret items, hidden rooms, puzzles, and at least one secret passage. Some of these items are murder weapons. Do with them what their name suggests and you might win.</li>
<li>During <strong>Daily Life</strong>, players have the option to become <strong>Blackened</strong> by comitting murder. This action is tiring, but could potentially win you the game if you go undetected.</li>
<li>During this phase, the game will change between <strong>Day</strong> and <strong>Night</strong>, on a 12/12 cycle.</li>
<li>The following changes will occur during night time:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Murders have a +2% chance of succeeding at night time, thanks to the low visibility.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Sleeping in your dorm room will gain you +30% of your AP per hour, and will allow you to have 150% more than your AP maximum. This is opposed to sleeping during the day, which grants +20% per hour and does not allow you to exceed your AP maximum.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The base cost for moving between locations will become 2 AP instead of 1 AP.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This phase will end when a body is discovered by a group of three or more players encountering a dead body. This could, of course, include the <strong>Blackened</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deadly Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players may investigate the school once more, but not to explore. Instead, they must determine the identity of the killer by finding evidence. The phase lasts for 24 hours.</li>
<li>This phase is fairly simple, so I shall use the rest of this section to explain some finer points of homicide:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Killing a player is a mix of RNG and stats, and costs 40% of your total AP to work up the nerve to murder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>When a murder happens, it’s extremely likely that physical evidence will be left behind, and there’s not much you can do to stop that. Mostly blood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Due to magical wards in place in the town, all items marked with blood cannot be dropped outside of the building the murder was comitted in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Items involved in the murder that are not covered with blood can be placed anywhere, but cannot be easily destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 2 players may be murdered in each Daily Life phase. If two seperate murders were comitted, only the  murderer of the first body to be discobered is Blackened. There are only a few, niche, exceptions to this rule:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If the bodies were discovered simultaneously, the murder which was committed first chronologicaly decides the Blackened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If the murderer of the first victim is then murdered, their murderer will be the Blackened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If both murders were committed simultaneously and discovered simultaneously, the Blackened will be decided by luck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A dead player can be Blackened in cases of suicide. However, without access to necromancy, it is impossible to win this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Trial</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For 48 hours, players may freely discuss the murder, the evidence, and the identity of the killer. No actions may be performed except for showing the class evidence in your inventory.</li>
<li>Players may vote <strong>privately</strong> during the Class Trial. If all players have voted, the phase will end early.</li>
<li>Votes are <strong>weighted</strong> according to your INT stat. Please check later sections.</li>
<li>If all players excepting the Mastermind and the Blackened vote correctly, the trial is automatically a success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Items And Stats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are 5 stats in the game:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>STR - How strong you are, your ability to perform physically taxing actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>CON - How resistant you are, rarely used for stat rolls, but determines AP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>AGI - How fast and dexterous you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>INT - How smart you are, determines your vote weight in class trials, and affects your ability to perform complex, precise actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>LUK - Your affinity for the endless stream of random bullshit endemic to killing games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, all players (unless otherwise stated) have 5 <strong>Public Item Slots</strong> and 1 <strong>Private Item Slot</strong>, each of which can hold one item.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Item Slots</strong> can be inspected at any time. However, you may only check another player’s <strong>Public Slots</strong> a maximum of 3 times per cycle.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private Item Slots</strong> cannot be checked normally. However, during the Deadly Life phase, one <strong>Private Item Slot</strong> from each player will temporarily become public.</li>
<li>It is possible to steal another player’s items from one of their <strong>Public Slots</strong> by passing a roll of (AGI/2)%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT STAT INFO (FOR NERDS (AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE))</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Melee Attack Kill Chance = (50 + (Attacker STR - Defender STR)/2 + Weapon Attack - (Defender’s LUK/8))%</li>
<li>Projectile Kill Chance = (50 + (Attacker AGI  - Defender AGI)/2 + Weapon Attack - (Defender’s LUK/8))%</li>
<li>Poision Kill Chance = 100%, unless an antidode is found.</li>
<li>Time Until Poison Kill = (Poison Power)*(1+Defender’s CON/5).  Symptoms will be experienced depending on the poison.</li>
<li>Electrocution, Drowning, Burn, And Miscellaneous Kill Chance = 100% - (Victim’s CON/2 + LUK/5). Advantage (roll twice, if  either roll kills, the victim is dead) may be given for strong miscellaneous methods, Disadvantage (roll twice, the victim may only die if both kill) may be given for weak miscellaneous methods of murder. Use with caution.</li>
<li>Maximum AP = 25 + CON/4</li>
<li>Vote Weight = 80 + INT/2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AP And Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All players begin the game with an amount of AP. Moving rooms costs 1 AP during the day (2 AP at night).</li>
<li><strong>All actions, unless otherwise stated, cost 1 AP</strong></li>
<li>Murdering another player costs 40% of your total AP to attempt.</li>
<li>AP may be recovered by the following methods:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping. During the day, recover 20% of your max AP each hour. At night, this moves up to 30% of your max AP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Eating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roles, and also Magic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All players will have a role granting them special abilities. You are free to reveal these abilities, but note that there are… certain incentives not to claim your true capabilities. These cards also include a name and gender.</li>
<li>Each role has a one-use <em><strong>ULTIMATE ABILITY</strong></em>, which can only be used <strong>once per game</strong>, but have exceedingly powerful effects.</li>
<li>Magic exists within this game, allowing players to violate the laws of physics, and additionally the laws of taste. However, magic obeys <em><strong>very</strong></em> strict rules, and is very hard to keep a secret. It cannot be used as a catch-all. Be sure to familliarise yourself with the arcane if you wish to use it as a weapon, or uncover the nature of its’ use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Changes From Previous Games (TL;DR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of discovering bodies has changed somewhat.</li>
<li>Some of the wording has been changed to be a bit more naturalistic.</li>
<li>Magic exists and can be manipulated as part of the game. Otherwise, the game will stick more closely to reality. Expect slightly more detail forensics-wise.</li>

<p>so this is uh<br>
a fancy pants method of randomisation<br>
essentially, behind the Door of Death, there are five possible rooms, each represented by one of the rectangles.<br>
Each player has an astrological sign attatched to them, and during the Class Trial, the signs of all dead  (or escaped) players will light up.</p>
<ul>
<li>The red lines show the direction. If all lit up signs are in a single quadrant, the red points in the proper direction.</li>
<li>If two signs light up from both quadrants beside a box, that box will be the room for that Chapter.</li>
<li>The only exception is if two opposite quadrants light up. In that case, look at the tallies on the XIII box. Treat it as if the box with the most lines lit up exclusively instead.</li>
<li>If three or (somehow) four quadrants light up, then we enter XIII.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secrets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During Chapter 5, the signs will pop out, becoming manipulable tiles bound to the Courtyard.</li>
<li>These tiles will have slots for gems in the back- the glowing ones will already have the gems locked in there.</li>
<li>By finding a source of those gems, and lighting up all 16 signs, players can open the FINAL DEAD ROOM, which contains a treasure-trove of information useful for defeating the Mastermind.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Max AP: 40</strong><br>
<strong>Gender: F</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Homunculus (Item)</strong> - You begin the game with the Homunculus Cube, containing a Homunculus, hidden in a special Private Slot:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Homonculus Cube (Storage)</em></p>
<p>Contains a Homunculus. To open, place on the floor and cover with blood. Cannot enter private slots while covered in blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Homunculus (Special)</em></p>
<p>Acts as an inanimate human with stats equal to the player whose blood was used to open the <strong>Homunculus Box</strong>, except with <strong>INT: 0</strong> and <strong>LUK: 0</strong></p>
<p>Other than being inanimate, the Homunculus is identical to a real human, although completely devoid of intelligence, or a soul, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following death, the Homunculus’ eyes will glow for 5 minutes, before all its’ systems rapidly regenerate to a point of being alive.</li>
<li>The Homunculus does not have a tongue.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amortal Ephemera</strong> - If you have seen one dead body killed a certain way, you can instantly recognise another body killed that way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Grave Robbing</strong> - You are able to surreptitiously and exactly remove parts from dead bodies without being noticed.</li>
<li>
<strong>It Walks (U)</strong> - Can only be activated by placing a detatched tongue inside of a homunculus. Give the Homunculus a set of instructions- it will carry out those instructions to the letter, then will die permanently. There is no limit to how long these instructions can be, nor how complex, but if ever the homunculus encounters something it does not know how to deal with, it will die, and will no longer regenerate.</li>
</ul>

<p>(obviously this ability is fucked up and is mostly good for murder, but Amortal Ephemera combined with the Homunculus being able to mimic humans exactly could legitimately be really good for cases with unclear cause of death.)</p>
<p>(also I wanted Ascelpius to uh… not be as nice as it would seem)</p>

<strong>Ghastly Preservation</strong> - You may freely heal non-fatal injuries.</li>

This is only possible through use of your Ultimate Ability. Should you claim this objective to anybody, the Mastermind will learn your true objective.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sword Of The Land</strong> - All murder attempts you make have a +10% chance of succeeding.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cloak Of The Land</strong> - You have taken the assumed name <strong>Arthur Beltrand</strong>, and have the fake Ultimate of <strong>Ultimate Priest</strong>. Even the Mastermind believes this to be your true identity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spirits Of The Land (U)</strong> - Remove the Camera Account from every room for 24 hours. In this time, if a murder is committed, the Mastermind will be asked to choose the identity of the Blackened in the Class Trial.</li>

<ul>
<li>If they are correct, you will fail your objective, and will fade from this plane of existence unsuccesfully regardless of who is voted out.</li>
