<p>Library Puzzle (only activated if somebody says to search the entire library):</p>
<p><em>Walking around a corner in the labyrnthine network of shelves and occasional stairs making the library somewhat reminiscent of an M.C Escher painting, you enocunter a strange sight- a steel device that looks almost like a cash machine, with a note attatched to it:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I am SICK of this. I am BLOODY SICK of this. So, the legal department sets me a Last Will. This should be the easiest thing possible! I mean, wills are easy to figure out, relatively- you simply arrange the mailing of the relevant assets- occasionally the old fart is  a dramatic twat and forces you to do a “reading of the will” with all his surviving relatives, as if that’s something that actually happens. But never this.</p>
<p>So, APPARENTLY the dramatic arsehole left some books to three of his friends, right? I can’t say their names legally, so I’ll just call them Y.Y, Low, and Critic. And he’s set a bunch of convoluted conditions on who gets first pick of the books based on fucking umbrellas and other such balderdash, but nobody can remember any of the relevant fucking conditions! So, I move to declare the will null and void, before I notice a clause at the bottom of the will where he says “The will is legally executable even if the relevant information is not recalled.” But how could it be, when he’s left this fucking information:</p>
<p>Clause 1) No person who has seen me in a green tie is to pick before Low.<br>
Clause 2) If Y.Y was not in Oxford in 1920, the first chooser never lent me an umbrella.<br>
Clause 3) If Y.Y or Critic has second choice, “Critic” comes before the one who first fell in love.</p>
<p>I was not trained for this. Which is why I’m leaving you this note, Mr. Librarian. You’re better at this sort of thing than me. Sort it out, before I fucking strangle this man’s corpse.</p>
<ul>
<li>William Prospero</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Below the note is a screen and a keyboard, the screen on a very much outdated operating system, the kind so outdated and purpose-built that it would be impossible to hack. The screen reads:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><code>[Check-Out - Plays]</code></strong></p>
<p><code>Thank you for checking out a play! In order to complete your check-out, please place the manuscript in the slot below and enter your code:</code></p>
<p><code>ENTER PASSWORD: []</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As indicated by the screen, below is a slot large enough to contain most books. Given that the library contains a massive amount of works of literature and journalism even in its’ abandoned state, the book that was being checked out is probably still in there somewhere, even if it’s nowhere near the machine.</em></p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>I am a big fan of Caliban’s Will, so of course I was going to include it as a puzzle. However, since the answer is available online, I decided to add my own tiwst on the thing.</p>
<p>The book that is being checked out is <em>The Tempest</em>, which is indicated by the fact that the puzzle is called Caliban’s Will and the screen says a play is being checked out (and the name of the author of the irate note). The password is the order of picking- [LowCriticYY]</p>
<p>This one has a lot of hints, and is easy to solve if you know Caliban’s Will, but if you have not encountered the puzzle before there’s a chance that you’ll have to actually solve it, and it’ll be interesting if somebody attempts to. It’s still very much possible thanks to how blatant William Prospero is (the William is there in case somebody unfamilliar with Shakespeare comes up, since they’ll be able to infer that it might be a famous playwright with William as their first name, and there’s only <em>one</em>, really).</p>
<p>When the correct book and password is entered, the machine opens up to reveal… something.</p>

<p>Vault:</p>
<p><em>A strange door lines the vault. It looks… very strong. In it is what looks like a codex that allows you to enter 14 digits or letters. Whatever’s in there, they must really want to keep it safe.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>This one is rather difficult and multi-staged, so we should labour it with a strong reward. Essentially, the key is the symbol and the changed motto-</p>
<ul>
<li>The changed motto is “emperor’s cipher”- in other words, ceasar shift.</li>
<li>Each segment of the symbol has its’ own message- the top says “Red tells you where to look”, the middle (in other words, the one in red)  says “IN PLACE OF ARTS MAGICAL”, the right says “Look on the starless side” (in other words, the left side (this one is mostly there to mess with anybody who tries to brute force the puzzle) and the left says “Password is original motto”.</li>
<li>The place of arts magical is the library building, pointing to the locked storage room in there.</li>
<li>The password is EPLURIBUSUNUM, the original motto indicated by the fact this is the Apotheosis of Washington.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, although by actual cryptographical standards this one is easy, I like it because it will acheive aims amenable to DR gameplay- it forces movement between locations in a manner that could become quite interesting for trials. Obviously puts prospective solvers at a greater risk of being murdered.</p>

<p>Shop:</p>
<p><em>As you enter the shop, you pass through a door with a faintly shimmering blue glow inside the frame. Lining one wall is a series of trays containing threatening sharp objects, each of which has a strange cube fixed into it. This warrants further explanation. There is a large screen on the desk that is showing the following message on repeat through means of an infographic:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>HELLO</p>
<p>WELCOME TO ELDRITCH ELLIE’S MAGIC ITEM STORE.</p>
<p>You have just passed through our state of the art Product Gate™, using the latest in thaumoturgical technology to prevent unauthorised extraction of goods from the store! You may notice the black boxes implanted into all of our products. Well, the Product Gate™ won’t allow any item with a black box to exit the store <em>unless</em> they use the stamping machine next to the door to stamp the box… <strong>with blood</strong>.</p>
<p>Hah! Isn’t that fun! We have a supply of blood stamps that will last a while, but to prevent needless purchases, you will be limited to one stamping per Daily Life per person. Tap this computer’s screen if you want to see a log of extracted items  (the anonymity of the buyers will be ensured, of course).</p>
<p>Now, what is the cost of stamping? Nothing, thanks to our Buy Nothing Get One Free:tm: scheme! We hope you have fun using our <em>distinctive</em>, powerful artifacts for whatever purpose you choose to put them to!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You turn to your left, and by the door there really is the stamping machine the compuer describes. A reinforced glass tank can be seen poking out of the machine, filled to the brim with blood.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Now, what is the significance of the machine stamping the items with blood? Well, one of the rules of the game is that <em><strong>bloodstained items cannot leave the building they were stained in</strong></em> unless they are no longer bloodstained. That’s the catch. It’s a cache of strong weapons that require extra work to extract, but can potentially be very very useful indeed.</p>
<p>My plan is to have the shop contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 “melee weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>2 “ranged weapon but better kill chances” magic items.</li>
<li>1 “what the fuck are ici and arete doing” magic item</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is the most important, obviously. The other two will be relevant once we calculate the kill chances of various generic weapons, I guess?</p>
<p>Also, the labels on the products should big the products up unnececarily without containing anything that is <em>technically</em> a lie.</p>

<p><strong>Library</strong></p>
<p><em>As you enter the library, you see a labyrinthine network of oaken shelves stretching towards the ceiling. The shelves are roughly divided into four clusters, each of which is labelled with a bronze plaque: Literature, Science, History, and Arcana. The deep blue ceiling is painted in silver with astrological symbols. In the center of the room are several ladders, tall enough to reach even the tallest shelves.</em></p>
<p>Public items: books, shelves, stepladders</p>
<p>If someone searches any of the bookshelves or the bookcases, generate a number between 1 and 25 for the relevant section. They find that book. If they search for a more specific book or type of book, they get a random type of book meeting that description. 5 books in each category give Actually Relevant Bonuses; the rest are just flavor unless someone comes up with something really cool. Reading <em>any</em> book gives a +1 bonus to Int (maximum 1 such bonus per 24 hours)</p>
<p>To describe the book, generate a number between 1 and 5, and use the relevant description.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You find a crisp, new-looking copy of [book title]. It looks nearly unused, save for a slight golden shimmer around the edges of the pages.</em></li>
<li><em>You find a bedraggled copy of [book title]. Several of the pages are dog-eared, and the edges of the page seem to sparkle in gold.</em></li>
<li><em>A musty smell fills the air as you pull down [book] from the shelf. It looks like it hasn’t been opened in a long time, and dust has nearly covered the golden flakes that surround the edges of the page.</em></li>
<li><em>You find a beautifully-illustrated collector’s edition of [book]. You didn’t even know that an edition like this existed. The outside of the pages shines with a golden light.</em></li>
<li><em>You find a thin paperback version of [book]. Someone has scribbled annotations in the margins of roughly the first half of it; squinting more closely, it looks like they were reading it for a class. The outer edge of the page sparkles like pyrite.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The golden dust prevents the book from being removed from the library; if someone tries, the air ripples and flashes with a golden light, and an invisible force prevents it.</p>

</aside>
<p>suggestion<br>
have it instead be the actual <em>heart</em> of that person rather than merely their blood. firstly, if somebody sees a dissected and ritualised heart, they’re more likely to try and look up the ritual used to do it… secondly, it’s more difficult and requires more creativity to pull off.</p>
<p>i hope that makes sense?</p>

A sticker is attatched, reading <code>I cannot believe we are pinning our hopes on you people being weebs.</code> on it.

<p><strong>Maltese Raven</strong></p>
<p>A piece of wood painted and weighted to look like a golden raven. Whenever you enter the same room as the raven, you have a (100-Luk)% chance of receiving the following message: “<em>Suddenly, your vision blurs for a moment and you see a burning raven made of gold flash before your eyes. In that instant, you sense an extremely powerful artifact nearby… [either says “In the posession of [player]” or in a particular location], and that someone intends to do something dreadful with it.</em>” - This artifact is actually completely useless, and is just a red herring with enchantments to make people <em>think</em> it’s important. Any detailed inspection reveals the gold to merely be gold leaf.</p>

          <p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
<p><em>A fairly standard kitchen stretches before you. There is a sink, an oven, a set of cupboards, a set of drawers, a fridge, and a washing machine.</em></p>
<p>(washing machines are usually stored in the kitchen in England. that’s why it’s here)</p>
<p>Sink: Nothing</p>
<p>Drawers: Plastic knives and forks, a whisk,  a <s>corkscrew</s> (taken by Night).</p>
<p>Cupboards: Pots, pans. bowls, <s>cereal</s>, flour</p>
<p>Fridge: Milk, chocolate, butter, <s>three</s> two cans of Monster Energy™</p>
<p>Washing Machine: Any item placed in the washing machine and left for a wash cycle has blood cleaned off it, but shows visible signs of being… put inside a washing machine.</p>
<p>General Kitchen Notes: In this room, players can make food. Rules for making generic food:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Makes either Good Healthy Food, Bad Healthy Food, Good Unhealthy Food, or Bad Unhealthy Food.</li>
<li>Whether the food is healthy or not is based on the ingredients.</li>
<li>When making food, make a (Int/2+Agi/2)% roll. If you succeed, create Good food. Otherwise, create Bad food.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good Heatlhy Food</strong> - Restores 30% of max AP.<br>
<strong>Bad Healthy Food</strong> - Restores 10% of max AP.<br>
<strong>Good Unhealthy Food</strong> - Restores 15 AP, and makes you receive 5 less AP from every unhealthy food eaten in the next 24 hours.<br>
<strong>Bad Unhealthy Food</strong> - Restores 5 AP, and makes you receive 5 less AP from the every unhealthy food eaten in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>WHY IS THIS DESK FULL OF BLUNT NEEDLES</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe it’s like the Candy Desk in the US, or the Parliamentary Snuff Box in the UK. This place does appear to have been generated by the town based on a combination of those two places, so it would seem likely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY BUT WHY ARE WE TALKING THROUGH NOTES AND NOT IN PERSON</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I… don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huge Desk: On the surface has a heavy lamp, a gavel, and a mass of papers. Has two concaled department.</p>
<ul>
<li>One compartment contains a dart and a small phial of poison designed for the dart to be dipped in. (any suggestions for the poison would be appreciated)</li>
<li>The other compartment contains an ordinary deck of cards. Well, to a normal person. The Ultimate Magician will notice that these cards are marked in a particular way that allows you to tell a card’s value from over 50cm away (I do actually know how that works, but I’m not going to tell you, because a magician never tells their secrets)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>ok I’m going to focus on making interesting puzzles and then I can figure out what the puzzle rewards are once we have puzzles</p>
<p>Records room</p>
<p><em>You find an aged diary that seems to have belonged to an archivist, describing the details of their job. Most of the pages have been damaged by water, but a few entries are legible.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>March 2nd</p>
<p>At last, I’ve obtained a position at the Archive. My first day is today, and I can’t wait! Ever since I was a child, I had dreamed of working here, surrounded by the records of bygone times.</p>
<p>April 7th</p>
<p>Bad news today. I received a letter from the governor of the prefecture. He says that there isn’t enough funding to support the research project that we’re trying to conduct on Shakushain’s Revolt.</p>
<p>June 27th</p>
<p>I haven’t left this archive in three days. My boss says that it’s nothing, but I know it’s here somewhere. I don’t know what will become of me if I can’t find it. All I know is that if I can discover what I seek, it will usher in a new era.</p>
<p>September 1st</p>
<p>Every day, I can feel the pressure inside me building higher. I’ve lost so much already. I have to keep going. I have to. I don’t have a choice any longer.</p>
<p>December 22nd</p>
<p>I’ve finally found something. I don’t think it’s what I’m looking for, but perhaps it can serve as a point of entry on the long road out of this nightmare. Today I finally went outside; I had nearly forgotten what the sky looked like. Still, when I stare at the night sky, I almost believe that I can escape from this nightmare I’ve found myself trapped in and see brighter days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Next to the diary, you see a bottle of ink and a quill pen. The last page of the diary is completely blank and untouched by water; there’s space for you to write a word in it, if you so wish.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
Solution</summary>
<p>Using the number in each date, count the words in each diary entry, and choose the [that number]th word. If you read those words, they spell out ‘Last letter of every entry.’ The last letter of every entry spells out the word ‘stars.’</p>
</details>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><em>You enter the records room. Stacks and stacks of filing cabinets are full to the brim with records. At the back is an imposing metal locker that appears to be locked with a padlock. There is a desk at the center of the room, as well as the appropriate chair.</em> (Diary is in Marl’s possession)</p>
<p>Chair: Normal office chair.</p>
<p>Filing Cabinets: Basically infinite supply of paper. Contains mostly useless records of past sessions which are incomprehensible to all players.</p>
<p>Imposing Locker: Padlock has no solution (the key has been destroyed) and must be brute forced. Contains the Legendary sword Legislabrand and a note.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Legislabrand</strong> (Weapon) (Legendary)</p>
<p>Shortsword inscribed with the entire US Code on the blade. Glows with the light of bureacracy.</p>
<p>+10% attack bonus normally. Has a +30% attack bonus against players who have violated any part of the US Code in the past 24 hours. <small>Note: This is in game only. Alledging that players have violated the US Code in real life is a legally risky idea, and I would prefer it if we were not liable for slander due to this game. Thank you in advance.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This artifact was imported from our american partners, who apparently “Couldn’t make head nor tail of the damn thing.”. Personally, I think having a bunch of students trapped in a magically charged environment figure out how this thing works is a bad idea, but I also think having funding is pretty cool, so.</p>
<p><em>(In a later hand)</em> This thing is so stupid. I am locking this up and throwing away the key. If you’re reading this, congratulations, you found Legislabrand by literally just breaking open a door, you’re a criminal, very good for you, wow, cool. Please don’t kill anybody with it, please. Capital punishment is illegal in the United Kingdom, which our estimates suggest that this place probably is within the territory of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brute force: Either succeeding by rolling 1-100+STR and getting 150 or more, or by using some sort of clever method to make your chances much better.</p>

          <p>Codex Arcanum (for Harleck Abode):</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chapter 1 - The Basics Of Magic</strong></p>
<p>Magic is everywhere. The idea of mana or manna has been around for centuries, and the truth of the matter is that it is, of course, real. It also has very little effect, and must be channeled through one of three methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Artifact Magic</em> - The most common kind of magic. Most artifact magic is inexorable to a particular object, and follows extremely strict rules. These rules cannot be broken, but they can be circumvented- thankfully, most methods of circumventing these rules can be traced. Elixirs count as artifact magic.</li>
<li>
<em>Ritual Magic</em> - Slightly less common and misunderstood, rituals are a means of imparting temporary.magical effects by use of esoteric and nearly indescribable rituals. These rituals are conveyed through books, and cannot be conveyed by any other means. They also leave definite magical traces.</li>
<li>
<em>Ultimate Magic</em> - Extremely rare. The ability to manipulate mana directly is thought to be a myth, and most magically gifted people will only acheive use of this ability once in their life. Make it count.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book contains examples of the second, Ritual Magic, in order to allow better understanding of the obscure arts, as well as to manipulate them generally.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2  - Ritual Of The Swan</strong></p>
<p>Materials Required:: Small sliver of metal, 1g of dirt, a suspected artifact.</p>
<p>-[]-| &lt;- This glyph will impart knowledge of how to perform the ritual to anybody who reads this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Determines the exact rules of the target artifact by means of psychic communication. Does not consume materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3 - Ritual Of The Raven</strong></p>
<p>Materials Required: A piece of paper folded into a paper aeroplane, ink contained in a suitable vessel.</p>
<p>734123424312 &lt;- Again, this is a knowledge glyph.</p>
<ul>
<li>Determines which Rituals have been used in this location in the last 24 hours. Consumes about half of the ink vessel. It will also tell you if an Ultimate was used in this location in the last 24 hours, but the details will be vague.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4 - Ritual Of The Wolf</strong></p>
<p>Materials Required: 50ml of human blood in a suitable vessel.</p>
<p>|||||||||||||||||||||||||| &lt;- Knowledge glyphs are fun, don’t you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely destroys a nonmagical item, but leaves an immovable piece of magical slime where it once was.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 - Ritual Of Blind Sight</strong></p>
<p>Materials Required: Three pieces of food, a piece of wood.</p>
<p>1235u9125391u05nksdamdsl,sagdlamgdlasmsdgda</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes all objects affected by any kind of magic in the room to glow for 5 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Epilogue - Do Your Best</strong></p>
<p>This book always finds itself in the hands of those who will need it. You will need it. All information about artifacts recorded using these rituals will be added to the appendixes of this book.</p>
