          <h1>Here’s the truth of this case.</h1>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>This case was complicated by the fact that <strong>the Blackened was not intending to use their trap to directly kill.</strong> Although they did intend to use their trap as an element of their plan for murder, the true effects of their tools were unknown even to them.</p>
<p>The first tool that the Blackened used in the murder was an <strong>ink case</strong> acquired in the Experiment Room in Chapter 1. The ink case contained six colors of ink: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Unbeknownst to the Blackened, each color of ink had special properties. Of relevance to this case are three colors: orange ink, which caused whoever looked at it, besides whoever wrote the original message, to experience blinding pain; green ink, which healed minor injuries when applied to skin; and purple ink, which lit itself and the surface it was applied to on fire whenever anyone besides the original writer looked at it.</p>
<p>The second tool that the Blackened used in the murder was a pink Exisal suit, which was placed in the Observatory as part of the motive for this chapter. The Blackened intended to use this suit as part of a murder by coating the visor in ink to reduce visibility, then attacking the wearer directly. However, after applying the ink to the suit, they returned to the Research Roof to sleep for the night.</p>
<p>When the victim, PKR, entered the Observatory to carry out his tasks, he caught sight of the Exisal suit. When he climbed into the suit, he was instantly struck by blinding agony, and the suit began to catch fire around him. Although he struggled desperately to get the suit off, he was unable to manage it, and his body experienced a heart attack due to the simultaneous shock of the pain and the fire. Only his face, which was in contact with the green ink, escaped injury.</p>
<p>When PKR’s body was discovered, even the Blackened was shocked to discover that they were now <strong><font color="red">a murderer</font></strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Reverse Biology Lab</strong></p>
<p><em>In heavy contrast to what you would think a biology lab would contain, the area you just stumbled into contains heavy elements of the occult. On the ceiling out of reach, there are cupboards lining the side of the room and a magic circle in the center, exuding a golden light that shines down to the floor. Several corpses of mythical animals dot the floor, with 5 sacrificial daggers are imbedded into the floor itself.</em></p>
<p>Mythical animals:</p>
<p>An eldritch mess of tentacles, dotted all over with eyes<br>
Unicorn<br>
Kappa<br>
A fox with nine tails<br>
Three pigs with wings<br>
A werewolf<br>
A husk of a monkey (from the animal lab)<br>
A devil<br>
A black cat<br>
A phoenix (comatose and not actually dead)<br>
A lion</p>
<p>Cupboards - Requires a method to gain height</p>
<p>Contains: Dragon Blood Vial (powerful acid), <em>Cooking with the Occult™ with Martin Graws</em> (a book that reveals how to cast a ritual to fuse creatures), <em>A Cannibalist’s Guide to Murder and Deception</em> (grants the user the necessary information to know how to consume body parts and fuse body parts to a body), <em>The Anachronist Reality of using Magic Circles to Facilitate Animalistic Perfection</em>, a safe</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Anachronist Reality of using Magic Circles to Facilitate Animalistic Perfection</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, while producing the best results, the requirement of exotic parts for Magic Circles leaves the community with a predicament: overhunting these magical creatures for the purposes of scientific progress leaves habitats irreparably damaged, in spite of the potential results to communicate that the opposite will be achieved once this is all over.</p>
<p>While the Ultimate Animal will uncover details beyond our wildest imaginations through the use of its eldritch mind (provided by communication with eldritch beings from beyond the mortal coil), it may not be able to sustain itself if prior considerations that Unicorn’s blood’s power fades upon the creature’s death. The issue of finding meat close enough to humanity yet distant enough to not cause the project to go under will also, necessarily, prove difficult. There is also the issue that there are several missing components to make such a being enticing. Instead, I offer a counter solution: gene splicing with humans. This field has achieved some form of results if Lord Henry is anything to be believed.</p>
<p>In any case, developing humanity seems to be the best bet toward progress. While there may be results from developing these creatures, at what cost are we willing to spend an exorbitant fortune on the ritualistic slaughter of these animals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct answer is to fuse the three pigs and the tentacles, use the feathers of the phoenix to revive the unicorn, take the unicorn’s blood, then provide a blood sacrifice on the body to form the eldritch creature.</p>
<p>The Eldritch Creature will reveal more about the puzzles in every room, before being killed by one of the Fates.</p>
<p>Every other result will cause catastrophic damage to the lab.</p>
<hr>
<p>Safe requires a 5 digit code</p>
<p>11037 is the answer<br>
The idea is that the Lion is the only non magical corpse. Lion → Leon → 11037</p>
<p>The safe contains UNLIMITED Vodka</p>

<p><em>Sacrificial Daggers</em>: when picked up will compel the players to stab themselves with them.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Truly Irredeemable?</strong></p>
<p>By Lilian Townsend</p>
<p>Editor’s Note: This essay was the winner of the ████ Royal Institute Philosophy Essay Prize.</p>
<p>Who is truly irredeemable? This question has plagued humanity from the moment man first took another man’s life in anger. Some philosophers have argued that there is some level of moral failure beyond which one’s life becomes worthless and one’s actions become incapable of demonstrating goodness. This view is particularly popular among virtue ethicists[1].</p>
<p>Yet this approach fails in light of a consequentialist approach to ethics. Are all the most heinous crimes – murder, assault, kidnapping – indeed serious? Of course. Yet if a murderer pulls a drowning child out of a lake, that child’s life is saved, as surely as if it had been Jesus himself pulling them out.</p>

</summary>
<p>On the screen, a lavish dinner inside an ornate dining hall plays out in front of you. A smartly-dressed man laughs and quaffs his beer. The rest of the dinner table laughs uproariously. A timid-looking boy, looking to be only 4 or 5 years old, walks in through one of the doors, and tugs the man’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“Daddy! Can we go play now?” says the young boy, pouting in his tiny, cute waistcoat. The man looks down at his son, almost surprised to see him there.<br>
“Not now, son. The grownups are doing business.” he says, above the low hubbub of well-to-do Englishmen eating exotic foods in copious amounts. “Let’s have the Duchess play with you, hmm?”</p>
<p>An austerely dressed woman next to him, upon hearing this, stands up, and says: “Come now, Geoffrey.” And as the boy, dejected, turns to leave, he is suddenly deafened by a gunshot from across the room.</p>
<p>You see a well-dressed man with a desperate-looking face holding the smoking gun, as on the other side of the room blood sprays from the Duke of the Atlantic Wastes’ face. Screams fill the hall as the assasin is tackled to the floor by the nobility. And then, falling from the chair, the Duke’s body, life rapidly streaming out of it in ribbons of red, flops down on top of his son.</p>
<p>Geoffrey cries out in pain as his body feels flattened by the weight of the body on top of him. He screams and struggles as he desperately attempts to untangle himself from it, to remove his broken arm from the mess of millitary honours it is crushed under and scratched by. He doesn’t even notice that the titanic weight he is struggling against is his father…</p>
<p>And he struggles against it to no avail. The film continues for a minute, the hope slowly fading from the young boy’s eyes, until it eventually ends, fading to black, leaving you in horror at the events you have just seen.</p>

</summary>
<p>Text appears on the screen. It reads “FOR YOUR EMPATHY, WE HAVE TEMPORARILY ENHANCED YOUR HEARING TO THE LEVELS OF THE ULTIMATE CONDUCTOR’S. THANK YOU.”, before fading away. As it does, you start to hear the intricacies of the breathing of every other person in the room, little chitters from beyond the wall as the ambiet noises you never really noticed come to the forefront.</p>
<p>Beautiful music plays out as the screen comes to life. A young girl, only about 7, delicately but quickly moves a conductor’s baton as the orchestra streams out an astonishing symphony. The Royal Albert Hall’s audience are mesmerised by each and every tone in the exquisitely conducted performance, and with this enhanced hearing, you can hear every little beautiful, neat, perfect interplay between each and every part of the composition. It is as near to a perfect piece of classical music as you can conceptualise.</p>
<p>The performance finishes. The hall is silent for just a moment, and then at once, rises into a standing ovation, thunderous applause screaming out… but what you hear is not success, what you hear is monstrous, you hear every little off-beat slap, every little incoherent “WOOOOOOOOOO” screeching across your eardrums, the little stomps as particularly enthusiastic members of the hellish ovation stomp their feet. And a final noise begins to join, quieter than any of the other noises drowning out all your thoughts, leaving you an incoherent mess able to do nothing but hear and suffer. A little girl crying.</p>
<p>Your eyes turn to the stage, as you see the conductor, previously so supremely confident and focused, on her knees with her fingers in her ears, crying and screaming “STOP! STOP! STOP!”. She looks up, seeing the crowd relentless and numb to her suffering, and tries to run off the stage, only to be stopped in your tracks by the other members of the orchestra, taking their bows. She tries to push past one of them, and is met with a harsh whisper of “don’t spoil this for us.”</p>
<p>Left with nothing left to do, the girl screams at the top of her voice “EVERY NIGHT! WHY WON’T YOU STOP AND JUST LET ME PLAY MY MUSIC!”. The hall goes silent, sparing you from the thunderous hell your ears have been trapped in for the past… how long has it been? Instead, you hear nothing but a low chuckle scattered across the audience, and a few whispers on the lines of “What a pity…” and “It’s a shame she was born with autism…”, as the scene turns to black.</p>
<p>Your ears return to normal, but… You can’t hear sound in the same way ever again,</p>

<p>The next scene of the horrific anthology opens in a windswept, frozen field. A car drives by, and a door opens. A man screams something in icelanidc, which is helpfully translated as “This is what happened to Boden’s rabbit!” by subtitles, as you see a young girl in a minature labcoat shoved out of  the open door. The car rapidly drives off, spraying frosted bits of mud over the girl.</p>
<p>She shivers as she stands up, her labcoat laughably thin for the snowstorm that is brewing above her. She shouts “FATHER!” in Icelandic. No response. “MOTHER! BO, PLEASE!” Silence. She breaks down crying, the cold lapping up through her legs as she kneels on the floor and screams to the sky. Time passes. Eventually, she stands up, as her eyes fill with a desperate determination not to die of hypothermia for her experiments.</p>
<p>She pulls out a strange device from her coat, and with some kind of fiendish inspiration, gathers together various half-dead plants she finds in the relentless winter, shivering more and more as the cold threatens to snake into her and kill her from the inside out. Eventually, she finds herself clutching a viscous, green concotion made of various plant juices no normal girl would dare to drink, and swallows it down.</p>
<p>In an instant, she throws up blood, and groans loudly. But… she feels warmer. And hunched over, clutching her chest, she begins to limp towards the lights in the far distance. Muttering in icelandic, she says “I have to leave this… this country…”. The movie fades to black.</p>

<summary>
</summary>
<p>You see a little girl struggling against two men holding her arms behind her back, fixing her in place in a claustrophobic stone cell. An old nun in far more ornate wear than the men holds a small, sharp needle, with a tiny little crucifix on the blunt end.</p>
<p>“Matilda… Do you know why you’re here?” says the nun. The little girl shakes her head. “You musn’t lie. And for that lie, I will use you to redeem another child. Sisters, call him in.”</p>
<p>A nervous-looking boy you’ve never seen before walks in, shephereded by two nuns behind him, a look of fear on his face. “Sit down, Timothy. Do you know why you’re here?” says the older nun.</p>
<p>“…Sister Mary caught me kissing another boy.” The boy says, looking down at his feet. A mirthless smile blooms on the older nun’s face.<br>
“And what did she tell you, Timothy?”<br>
“…Boys aren’t meant to kiss boys.” says the boy, patent dishonesty in his eyes, painted across his face.<br>
“You see, hellspawn? Sometimes the impure know how to admit it… Boy, you have sinned. And for that, you will be punished.” With a start, the woman stabs the boy in the hand with the needle. The young girl desperately screams as she tries to escape the arms of the men holding her, but to no avail. And the girl watches and struggles as the older woman, her needle dripping with blood, walks towards her with the same purpose. And with the same fury, she stabs Matilda as well, in the same place. The woman breaks down in tears as the men release her, leaving her across from the simmilarly distraught boy.</p>
<p>“Heal him. Now.” Crying, Matilda crawls across the floor, and touches the boy’s wound, too afraid to disobey. “This is your purpose. You will heal the wounds we are forced to inflict in order to discipline the wicked. So you are aware of what you are sparing others from, you will experience every punishment you heal. That is your punishment for going against the natural order, Witch, and you shall not be spared until we have drained every last bit of that diabolic power from your body. Only then can you be redeemed. Do you understand me?” The girl is silent.</p>
<p>“I said… do. you. understand. me?” The timid girl nods… “Say it aloud, hellspawn!” The woman screams, smacking the little girl hard across the face, sending her down onto the floor, reduced to nothing but a wreck of fear and pain.<br>
“I… understand.” the girl says, choking back the tears out of mortal terror.</p>
<p>The woman leans in  to the girl with a disgustingly warm smile suddenly plastered on her self-righteous face. “Good. From now on, after prayer, you will say the following, and you will believe it: “I am hellspawn. I am worthless without the Church. I cause suffering through my ability to heal. A thousand versions of me suffering is nothing compared to everyone else being redeemed. My existence defies God.” Say it.”.

<p>You see a young person holding a controller in a bedroom decorated with various cat-related paraphernalia, across from a large, high-quality TV screen with gameplay from League of Legends regrettably plastered across it. The player looks more masculine in their appearanace, but is recognisably Alyx Blake.</p>
<p>Then, in an instant, all light in the room fades, plunging the screen into near pitch black. The young enby shouts “MUM! WHY DID YOU CUT THE POWER! I WAS HAVING A GOOD JUNGLE GAME!”. Silence. Standing up, navigating through the darkness, they make their way to the door to open it and turn back on the power. Tugging at the door in the darkness, just barely visible on the screen, they try and fail. It’s jammed.</p>
<p>“…Mum? …Other Mum, I guess?” they say, backing into the center of the room. And suddenly, the screen changes to a timelapse, showing them pace around in pitch blackness for hour after hour, unable to game, and unable to eat… or do anything. Occasional bangs on the door ring out, but it holds strong, leaving the gamer’s isolation entirely complete. The footage slows down eventually, until you see the power come back on.</p>
<p>Two women walk into the room, to see their child, crying, their body twitching, half-starved after a day of being stuck in the darkness… They hug them, but the shaking doesn’t stop. “I… I couldn’t stand to stay still…” cried Alyx, held gently in their mothers’ arms. “I… don’t think I ever really can again.” They stand up… and jittering, they dance. Not in a default manner, but they dance. A wretched, half-starved dance, that ends in them fainting to the floor from exhaustion.</p>

<p>The screen comes up on an entrance hallway in a house, lit by candles. A distraught looking older woman stands across from a 12-year old boy, older than the children you’ve seen so far, but still far too young to be featured in this theatre of horror.</p>
<p>“What do you MEAN you don’t know who killed my son?” says the woman, coldly.<br>
“I… I said what I said. I don’t… know who killed your son.” said the boy, adjusting his little deerstalker hat. The woman looks up, and sees him with the hat.<br>
“Some Ultimate Detective you are!” she suddenly screams. “I… can’t believe it. I… I gave up my chance for justice to some BOY playing detective and now… nobody wil ever take me seriously again… you bastard! YOU BASTARD!”</p>
<p>The boy backs away, as the woman’s screams grow more and more incoherent, and bursts into tears as he runs into a room with an imposing door, and locks it behind him. Hyperventilating, the boy tries to block out the cries of the woman banging on the door, and looks around in an office. Suddenly, he pauses crying for just a moment.</p>
<p>“This is… my father’s office. I’ve never been in here be-” he says, suddenly stopping halfway through, as his crying redoubles. Through the tears, he starts to inspect the room, curiosity not dampened even by the self-loathing painted across his brow. He sits in the chair behind the imposing mahogany desk, and opens one of the drawers.</p>
<p>A tin lies inside. The boy whiffs at it, seemingly notincg some strange smell on it, then gently reads the note attatched to the tin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Alfred</p>
<p>My regards for your succesful attendance in the “AYE” chamber yesterday. It is appreciated.</p>
<p>GB</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious, the boy opens the tin. It sticks for a moment, as if it’s never been opened before. A dark-brown gum fills most of the tin.</p>
<p>“Opium.” he says, instantly, recognising it from his years of study. He pauses. Why… does his father have opium? And you watch with horror, as he says “I’m a failure… this is what failures do…”, lifitng the tin up… And as the opium approaches his mouth, the video ends.</p>

<p>“Yes. I hereby swear to accept the Trial to enter the Circle, no matter what it means, for the sake of true magic.” he says, confidently.<br>
“Good. You will now perform a magic trick. If we figure out how you did it, you die. If we don’t, you live. You have 15 minutes.”<br>
“You…you can’t be serious!”<br>
“We are deadly serious. If you fail, we cannot have an embittered failure expose our secrets.”<br>
“But if I die then… nobody will ever know my family existed. We’ll be gone. Forever.”<br>
“You will perform.”</p>
<p>Swallowing, the boy reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of Monarchs Playing Cards, high-quality playing cards made specifically for magicians, and desperately tries to think of how to fool the greatest conjurors in the world. He sits cross-legged in the circle as time ticks by, until, five minutes before the deadline, sweat pouring from every pore in his body, he calls out:</p>
<p>“I am ready to perform! Would… w-would one of you… please… pick a…” he says, suddenly faltering as with a flourish he spreads out the cards in an elaborate snake between his two hands. He freezes. The cards drop to the floor, and he scrabbles to pick them up for just a few seconds, before looking up at the ceiling, and saying…</p>
<p>“I… give up. P-p-lease just kill me now. Get it over with.”. With those words, the hooded figures slowly begin to swarm around him, collapsed on the floor in the mess of a broken trick. You hear little swooshes as if knives were being unsheathed from inside the robes of the Circle’s members.</p>
<p>Fifty knives slip out of the robes at the speed of sound, and the initiate, holding back his tears and trembling with all his might, closes his eyes… accepting his inevitable death in that one horrific instant, ready to be consigned to oblivion.</p>

Blood splatters all over her, and the determination in the eyes turn to those eys becoming dead… blank, empty, devoid. From a backpack, the young girl pulls out a cube, and she places the bloodied tongue on top of it. It melds into the cube, and the cube slowly expands out, and out…</p>
<p>An inverted man appears. Concave skin, nothing to speak of inside, a distorted mockery of a man. But from the scant tufts of hair adorning the hollow tube masquerading as a face, the girl sees her father. She smiles. “Only… a hundred more to go…” she says, as if making herself out to be determined will make up for the fact that she just defiled a stranger’s grave.</p>
<p>She looks to the sky. “Daddy… I…” She coughs. “Today, I did something that’ll make people unhappy. I don’t… like that. But.” She falls to the floor. “You weren’t supposed to go. They… they were.” She swallows. “…nature seems dead, and wicked dreams… the ends…”.</p>

<p><strong>Part X: The Archer</strong></p>
<p><em>Content Warnings: Violence</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>The young man in the video seems much older than the people in the other videos have been, seeming to be around 15. As you watch, you see him arrive at an archery range, wave at some of the other archers, then change out of a school uniform into something more athletic.</p>
<p>As he walks out to the archery field, you see him notice one of the other archers, trapped in the hallway with an older adult, who looks to be at least in his thirties. “Now, Lena, I don’t see why this is such a big deal,” he says. “You love this sport, don’t you? That’s why you’re on the team?”</p>
<p>The other archer ducks her head. “Well, that’s true, but the reason I picked up the coaching gig was to pay for my mother’s medical bills … if you’re ste-- taking half my paycheck, I can’t really do that.”</p>
<p>As the young man walks past the pair of them, trying not to look, he hears the sound of someone’s hand connecting against another person’s body, and a girl’s voice crying out in pain. The young man winces, before muttering, “with how many people that man is hurting … maybe it would be better if he just died.” He pauses for a moment, then mutters: “and then he’ll never hurt anyone ever again… Tempting. Job at hand.”</p>
<p>The archer begins to take aim at the targets, hitting the bullseye with preternatural accuracy. Then, as he begins to nock his final arrow, you hear several whistles ring out in a fast burst. (A caption on the screen helpfully informs you that five or more whistles means that someone is on the range, and you should immediately stop firing.)</p>
<p>And indeed, the archer begins to lower his bow to the ground. Then, you see him glance up at the range. The camera shifts to match his field of vision, as he catches sight of the older man from before, standing in the middle of the range.</p>
<p>The young man lifts his bow back up, takes aim, and looses an arrow.</p>
<p>As the arrow pierces the older man’s chest, the screen cuts to black.</p>

<p><strong>Part XI: The Snowboarder</strong></p>
<p><em>Content Warnings: Underage drinking, Sporting accidents.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>“Come on, Joey. It’ll make you go faster, trust me!” says the seven-year old girl in winter sports clothing holding up a bottle of cider, leaning against an exquisitely crafted snowboard.<br>
“I… are you sure about this, Ali?” says the nervous-looiking boy, taking the bottle in his hand, and sipping it a little. He swallows it down, then says “Bleh. It… really doesn’t taste that good?”<br>
“Oh, whatever. Let’s go!” says the girl, tucking the bottle into a packpack, and suddenly jumping on her snowboard onto a nearby incline.</p>
<p>“Hey! Wait after me!” says the boy, getting on his own snowboard, rapidly accelerating down the slope until the two are dead even. An unoffiical race begun, with both elegantly weaving their way down the incline… until suddenly, the boy crashes into a tree, screams out in pain, and falls to the ground, dead. Hearing the screams, Alicia rapidly stops their snowboard.</p>
<p>The film cuts to black as she cries over her best friend’s corpse. Then, suddenly, a piece of paper is slammed onto the black screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SUSPENDED FOR LIFE</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Reason for Suspension</strong>: Distributing alcohol with reckless disregard for the consequences.</em></p>

<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>The video turns on. Instead of the traumatic events you expect, you see a boy sitting in a place surrounded by stars and tentacles, babbling incoherently. It’s incomprehensible. Inscrutiable. The babbling continues, eventually coalescing into a single chant: “WHAT IS FALSE, YOU MAKE TRUE”, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>You catch one brief glimpse at the being that is speaking these words. It is everything, and it is nothing. And the moment after, the place where you caught a glimpse of it in your memory is sealed, as if what you saw never happened, the images unwinding themselves, diffusing through your mind…</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the apparitions dissapear, and the boy is just sitting emptily on the floor before a telescope. He stands up, murmering “what is false… i make true…”, before climbing into bed. As he drifts off to sleep, you see him clench his fists, and whisper “I’m being torn apart by this … but I can’t stop. I don’t know what will happen to everyone else if I stop… even if this destroys me, if it saves everyone else, it’s worth it…”</p>

<p><strong>Part XIII: The Historian</strong></p>
<p><em>Content warnings: Violence, kidnapping.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>The scene opens in a dark room. The camera tilts back and forth, in a gentle rocking motion. You hear footsteps, and the door swings open. As it opens, you see light shine on the room, and you see a girl, handcuffed in the corner, leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>“Your dinner, Josephine,” says someone just offscreen, placing a bowl of gruel next to her.</p>
<p>The door closes again, and you hear the footsteps receding.</p>
<p>The girl shifts position slightly. “Julius Caesar…” she mutters. “I just have to follow his example… then I’ll be okay…”</p>
<p>The camera fades to black for a moment, then returns to the same location. Some time has clearly passed, judging by the condition of Josephine’s body. Again, the door opens, and someone walks in; this time, the other person can be seen on the screen, although they are wearing a hood and a mask.</p>
<p>“How much is my ransom?” asks the girl.</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand,” says the stranger.</p>
<p>“I’m worth more than that!” says the girl. “Ask for fifty thousand.” She clears her throat. “Now, I demand that you listen to my poem–”</p>
<p>The stranger walks over to the girl and slaps her. “What are you, some sort of empress?” the stranger says mockingly. “You’d best learn your place. You know what happens if your family doesn’t pay up.”</p>

<p><strong>Part XIV: The Highwaywoman</strong></p>
<p><em>Content warnings: Violence, death</em></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>The film begins with a young woman balancing on the edge of a moving train, holding a rapier and wearing a revolver on her belt. The bottom of her face is covered in a mask, but you recognize her hair and eyes as belonging to Stephanie Brown. As you watch, she makes her way along the top of the train, until she reaches the engine car, before swinging herself next to the door and busting through it.</p>
<p>As she walks through the door, the film shifts to a different scene, this time in greyscale. A caption on the screen says, “Three Days Earlier…”</p>
<p>“What do you need from me?” the young woman asks a hooded figure. The camera pans around the screen to show an abandoned warehouse.</p>
<p>“I need you to disrupt the 490 to Glasgow,” he says. “Government petroleum shipment. Would be very bad if they managed to arrive to their destination.”</p>
<p>The young woman hesitates for a moment, glancing at the door.</p>
<p>“Should be completely routine,” the figure says. “Won’t be anyone aboard accept the conductor.”</p>
<p>The camera flashes back to the train, returning to full cover. The young woman strides over to where the conductor is sitting and points her rapier directly at his chest.</p>
<p>The conductor’s eyes widen and he holds up his hands. “I surrender!” he says. “Please stand down, there are civ–”</p>
<p>You hear the sound of a gunshot, and the conductor falls over backwards, a scarlet wound sprouting in his forehead. The camera pans back to the woman, who is holding her revolver. The woman shoves the conductor’s corpse out of the way, fiddles with some of the the conductor’s controls, then jumps out of the train, rolling safely to the ground.</p>
<p>The train shudders, before the first car bursts into flame. The cars behind it crash into it, and the entire train careens off the rails.</p>
<p>From the inside of the train comes the sound of screams. The woman looks confused for a moment, before running up closer to the train track. There, she sees charred bodies, their faces contorted, and no sign of petroleum.</p>
<p>The screen switches to the image of a newspaper. <em>HUNDREDS DEAD IN PASSENGER TRAIN CRASH.</em></p>
<p>In the last seconds before the screen goes dark, it shifts back to the young woman, speaking once again with the shadowy figure.</p>
<p>“Stephanie…you haven’t managed to complete a run in nearly three months,” says the figure, slamming his fist against the wall. “What’s happened to you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” says the figure. “But ever since the crash, it’s just felt like nothing has gone right.” She swallows. “I’m sorry, father.”</p>

<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>A placard on the screen displays: Three days before the Youth Eco-Friendly Invention Competition.</p>
<p>On the screen, you see a girl, her hair tied back in a ponytail, tightening a bolt on some sort of large machine with several pipes. “I’ll show them,” she says. “I’ll show them that I’m worthy of being an Ultimate!”</p>
<p>A younger girl, about seven years old, walks up to her. “What’s that do?” asks the younger child, pointing.</p>
<p>“It’s a more efficient water purifier,” says the older girl, turning to look at the younger child. “It purifies salt water using a complex temperature-bas–” She pauses, seeing a look of confusion on the younger girl’s face. “It makes salt water not salty anymore. I’ve done the math, and this should be more efficient. – should work better.” As she answers the child’s question, she continues to tighten the bolt.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the bolt she’s tightening snaps, and a pipe bursts open. Scalding water sprays towards the two girls, and both of them recoil, clutching themselves in pain. You hear screaming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the girl finally manages to get out of the way of the water, still clutching her burned arms, she begins to cry. They pull out a piece of paper talking about their plans to get into Feybrook, to do anything to get into Feybrook, and just… kept crying, a waterfall of tears cascading down onto the paper, blotting on the words “<font color="blue">ultimate</font>” and “<font color="blue">inventor</font>” She wipes her eyes. “Maybe they were right,” she whispers. “Maybe I’m not meant to be an Ultimate at all…”</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue: The Banker</strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
</summary>
<p>A surly man stands in an office. He is smoking a cigarette. Behind the office desk is a figure you recognise as Timoleon Silverheart, holding a cane even while sitting in his throne-like chair.</p>
<p>The man speaks, softly, in a french accent: “I know what you did, M. Silverheart. Boden showed me the data.”<br>
“Whatever are you talking about, old chap?” says Timoleon, smirking.<br>
“…Ultimates aren’t that rare! You had… god, you had at least a thousand people who qualified, didn’t you? A thousand people who could help you with your pet project, the Ultimate Mage. So… I started thinking… why did you choose those fifteen?” The man takes the cigarette out, and snubs it on the table,<br>
“<strong>You wanted people who’d do anything to escape their lives.</strong> That’s what you did, wasn’t it, M. Silverheart, <em>non</em>? You used your insidious little tricks to learn anything you could about them, and you used them as tools. The Duchess, that lousy politician and Nicholas were closing in on you, so you needed people who’d <em>agree</em> if you put the slightest bit of pressure on them.”</p>
<p>The frenchman slams his hands on the table. “I’ve read the files. <em>Sacre bleu</em>, you… I can’t believe it. Asuka’s too cowardly to say it, but the Mastermind, whoever the <em><strong>hell</strong></em> they are, isn’t the fucking villain here. You are.”</p>
<p>Timoleon stands up. “So? What are you going to do about it? Are you just going to <em>kill me</em>? I know what I did doesn’t qualify by your small-minded standards of ethics…”<br>
“Small-minded! You sent fifteen traumatised kids into a situation you <em>knew</em> had a chance of being dangerous just to fulfil your pet project!”<br>
“The ends justify the means!”<br>
“What ends? <strong>You haven’t even proven the Ultimate Mage is real!</strong>”<br>
“It is! It… it… it must be…”</p>
<p>The frenchman spits, away from Timoleon, but his intention clear. “As expected. <em>Mon Dieu.</em> You fall apart the moment someone calls you on it. No wonder you chose kids too broken to fight back. Goodbye, Monseuir Silverheart.”</p>
<p>The frenchman leaves the room. Timoleon Silverheart sits impassive for a minute, then slams his fist on the desk with all his might.</p>
<p><strong>The End.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Personal Boxes</strong></p>
<h1><em>As you begin to leave the area where the trial was held, Areténa stops you.</em></h1>
<h1>“Since you’ve all managed to make it this far, we’ve prepared a surprise for you,” they say. “We’ve given all of you … information about your past, before you even came to Feybrook University. I can’t say whether it’ll help you catch the Mastermind, but you might find it interesting.”</h1>
<h1>“To access this information, all you need to do is to <strong>open the sealed box that I’ve placed in your room.</strong> The way you do that is simple: just hold the box and explain why you are worthy of calling yourself a participant in the Ultimate Hunt.”</h1>
<p><strong>ArcticXI</strong></p>
<p>*The box contains a photograph, a small metal box with a picture of a poppy field, a letter, a deerstalker cap, and a fingerprinting kit.</p>
<p><em>Photograph:</em> The photograph depicts a younger you, standing next to a much older man. After a moment, you remember: that man is your father, and this photograph was taken on your sixteenth birthday.</p>
<p><em>Metal box:</em> Opening this box, you find a brown powder, which you recognize as opium.</p>
<p><em>Letter:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Harleck Abode,</p>
<p>I wanted to express my profoundest thanks for your efforts to recover my daughter. In all my interactions with the official authorities, none of them were half as competent as you. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Deerstalker hat:</em> nothing of note</p>
<p><em>Fingerprinting kit:</em> It appears to be a fairly normal fingerprinting kit. You glance at your fingers for a moment, wondering if it could be of use, before remembering that your fingerprints have been missing ever since you arrived here.</p>
<p><strong>Apprentice:</strong></p>
<p><em>The box contains a wrist splint, an arrow, a certificate of achievement, a target, and a photograph.</em></p>
<p>Splint, arrow: nothing of note</p>
<p>Certificate of Achievement: <em>The Certificate of Achievement appears to commemorate you getting first place in an archery tournament.</em></p>
<p>Target: <em>The target appears to have several marks from where arrows pierced it. All of the marks are in the bulls-eye.</em></p>
<p>Photograph: <em>The photograph shows a group of twelve smiling people of different ages, all wearing matching jerseys and holding bows. You recognize yourself in the second row. The back of the photograph has eleven other signatures on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>katze:</strong></p>
<p><em>The box contains a poster, an essay, a GameBoy Color, a photograph, and a note.</em></p>
<p>Poster: <em>The poster depicts Lynx Seventeen from Overwatch.</em></p>
<p>Essay: <em>The essay is written in a child’s handwriting, and is about a page long. It reads:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What I want to be when I grow up</strong></p>
<p>When I grow up I want to be a Pokemon Trainer!</p>
<p>Pokemon Trainer is the best job because you dont have to go to an offess. You would get to spend all day playing with your Pokemon! My favorate Pokemon is Bulbasaur. Pokemon trainers dont have to pay tackses or work when they dont want to or talk to people who are mean or go to bed on time. That is why Pokemon Trainer is the best job.</p>

<p>Dear Miss Blake,</p>
<p>I’m writing home about some concerning behavior I’ve been observing in Johnathan lately. While he is ordinarily an average student, his behavior lately has been unacceptable.</p>
<p>First, yesterday, when we were lining up to come back from recess, Johnathan refused to join either line, which was extremely disruptive. Children are expected to follow the instructions, and lining up is a basic skill that all students are expected to have. Because of this, I had to keep the entire class in for recess today, so that he would understand that his actions have consequences.</p>
<p>Second, while he was in for recess, he started stabbing himself with a pencil. When I told him to stop, he put away the pencil and instead started stabbing himself with a pen. This behavior is also unacceptable, as children in detention are expected to sit quietly and not disturb anyone.</p>
<p>Please sign this letter and return it to me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Miss Abrams</p>

<p>So, one thing I’ve been thinking lately is that everyone I know has either an excellent relationship with their family, or a terrible one. And that’s not something I can really empathize with? Like, my family is fine, they’ve never threatened to kick me out or tried to isolate me or even anything little, like forgetting I was in time-out and leaving me there. But I don’t really feel very strongly about them? They’re people, I’d be sad if they died or something, but once I move out I don’t think I’m really going to care whether or not they know what I’m up to.</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe this is dumb.</p>

          <p><strong>Chapter 6 Rooms</strong></p>
<p>So, on the Entrance Hall painting, there are four towers depicted on the corners of the map. I figured that we could have four towers, each in its own corner: the Vernal Tower, the Estival Tower, the Autumnal Tower, and the Hibernal Tower</p>
<p>here’s a loose sketch of a map</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="../../uploads/default/original/3X/9/c/9cd2296da4f999fc65d2aaf1cd5b6b09f55d7ab1.png" data-download-href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/9cd2296da4f999fc65d2aaf1cd5b6b09f55d7ab1" title="towerblank"><img src="../../uploads/default/original/3X/9/c/9cd2296da4f999fc65d2aaf1cd5b6b09f55d7ab1.png" alt="towerblank" data-base62-sha1="mniKOlqGgABjaF9nXuKPv6yPQAx" width="574" height="500" data-small-upload="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/c/9cd2296da4f999fc65d2aaf1cd5b6b09f55d7ab1_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">towerblank</span><span class="informations">738×642 3.23 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>so each tower would have three rooms, meaning 12 tower rooms total</p>
<p>(there’s also the Obelisk room, but Ici already has stuff for that)</p>
<p>Room ideas I’ve had so far, with a brief summary of what’s in them (I can fill out the things in them, you don’t need to do that, although that’s probably going to do that tomorrow since it’s 2:18)</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre of Darkest Hours (see above)</li>
<li>Ritual Athenaeum - contains instructions for rituals, most of which are ‘technically useful but not really very useful’ but one of which lets them briefly summon Timoleon (…which is admittedly not actually very useful, but)</li>
<li>Brewery - contains potions ingredients, allowing them to make potions with (specific, minor, predetermined) effects<br>
^^we can use those two rooms to direct them to things we want them to find (e.g. ‘this potion directs you to a specific room where you’ve missed something important’)</li>
<li>Admissions Office - contains records of everyone’s applications (except DatBird’s) and a summary of why they were admitted, can be used to dump some lore</li>
<li>Attic - no lore, instead it has a whole bunch of random objects stored in it that are useful in solving the environmental challenges (e.g. the Reverse Tower)</li>
<li>Research Study - contains Timoleon’s notes on the Ultimate Mage project. Possible loreclear here?</li>
<li>Hall of Failures (I am taking suggestions for a less dumb thing to call this) - contains notes from participants in previous killing games, that they managed to transmit through the time loop, written just before their deaths and describing things they did wrong. Can be used to say ‘HEY, X ISN’T A CLEAR.’ Most of them will be red herrings (‘seeing yourself kill in the mirror isn’t a clear’) but one of them is going to be ‘dying isn’t a clear’ (which people knew already, but)</li>
<li>Mail Room - contains letters from Project Jormungandr, written during <em>this</em> loop, explaining among other things how DatBird DatBirding allowed for this to be the loop they actually sort of break into (which we established happened for the first time this time). Possible loreclear here.</li>
</ul>
<p>so then I need four more rooms</p>

          <p><strong>Mail Room</strong></p>
<p><em>The  Mail Room is sparsely populated with relatively little furniture. It has a hundred or so empty cubbies in the back of the room, as well as a counter in the front, with something on top of it. There is also a rug on the floor.</em></p>
<p>Counter:</p>
<p><em>The counter has a manila envelope on it. On the outside the envelope is an ornamented cursive J. Inside the envelope are several folded letters.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dear children, in spirit and in one case in blood,</p>
<p>I write to you today to summarize the progress we’ve made on recovering you from the loop. I have reason to suspect that your iteration of the loop has a unique opportunity to end the simulation, and as such it is of the utmost importance that you discharge your duties with care and diligence.</p>
<p>Based on the data we have collected it appears that an unknown entity entered the Knot at the beginning of this iteration. While we have been unable to determine what precisely that entity is, we believe that this entity is responsible for the comparative ease of transmitting messages between reality and the Knot. Under normal circumstances, it is rare for us to be able to transmit anything at all.</p>
<p>Our research suggests that the necessary ritual to disable the cyclic effects of the Knot can only be performed by successfully identifying the Mastermind. Once the Mastermind has been identified, it should be possible to prevent them from continuing the cycle and freeing the rest of you from this simulation. While an unsuccessful attempt will merely cause the simulation to restart, we are uncertain whether the communicative benefits afforded by the unknown entity will persist into previous iterations. As a result, we strongly encourage you to try to end the Knot on this iteration.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Albert Abode</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the residents of the Knot:</p>
<p>A question that my colleagues often pose to me is why I would bother working on this project at all. All of you, save possibly the Mastermind, are demonstrably willing to kill, often with little provocation; there are certainly those among them who do not believe you to be worth saving. So why, then, am I so insistent on abandoning the rest of my research simply to help you out?</p>
<p>Aristotle says that virtue is a <em>habit</em>, not merely an abstract property that all of us possess within our souls but a choice that we must continuously make. One does not become courageous merely by possessing some sort of essence of courage, nor just by possessing some essence of justice. Instead, by acting in a way concordant with courage or justice or any other virtue, we become more virtuous, more excellent.</p>
<p>But important in this idea is the idea that virtue <em>can be learned</em>, that it is possible to become virtuous. In some ways, this is the beauty of virtue ethics; where deontologists find themselves bound to rigid and inflexible rules, where consequentialists refuse to believe that anyone might have a character in need of changing, virtue ethicists see the truth of your character, while simultaneously understanding that that character can be changed. Your true characters, perhaps more than anyone else, can be clearly seen; after all, we have hundreds or thousands of examples. But that also makes it clear that <em>all of you are people capable of change</em>. That is why you <em>have</em> changed, thousands and thousands of times.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,</p>
<p>Dr. Kobayashi Asuka</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To whomever finds this letter:</p>
<p>I have far more to explain than can possibly be expressed in a single letter. There should be a ritual somewhere in the Towers, and this loop it should finally work.</p>
<p>Until we meet again,</p>
<p>Timoleon Silverheart</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>I’m not nearly as eloquent as the others who are part of Project Jormungandr, so I’m going to keep this brief. From my intake interviews for rescued Ultimates, I’ve heard a lot of worries about our project. I just wanted to list off what we’re doing – and remember, even if you get out of the loop, and decide that you don’t want to stay with us, that’s fine too.</p>
<p>In any case, we’re doing our best to make sure that the Ultimates who get out, however they get out, have access to housing (we have apartments for you to stay in, if you want, a mix of singles and doubles, depending on if you made friends in your loop), counseling, job training, and integration to help you rejoin the wider world if you want to. Many Ultimates have also joined our project, although if you make it out, that obviously won’t be needed.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, you are not alone. We are here for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Ultimates,</p>
<p>I’m going to be honest, my expertise is far more focused on ensuring that you are safe and healthy once you escape the knot than on allowing you to escape. Still, as the member of the project with the greatest personal connection to your iteration, what with the situation with my granddaughter and all, I thought I should probably write something, even if it’s not very helpful.</p>
<p>In any case, as the Táknmynd Apothecary, I feel like I should probably tell you about the Brewery. It’s one of the rooms in the Towers, and based on what little we’ve been able to piece together about the Final Trial, it should allow you to make Elixirs that help you a little bit. At the same time, I encourage you not to focus too much on it, as much as it pains me to say this. It’s more important that you find out the truth of who the Mastermind is, and while potions may help you in your search, they will not give you the answer.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Boden Eriksson</p>
<p>Hi, everyone. It’s me.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if you were expecting to hear from me? And I’m honestly not sure if you would want to. There’s a script here, right, where I talk about how much I regret killing Matilda and how I wish I could apologize to her, but I’m not going to say that, because it’s not <em>true</em>. Every moment I spent in the Knot was miserable, and if I had to kill someone to escape, I’m glad I got lucky enough to kill someone I didn’t particularly like.</p>
<p>But – that doesn’t mean I want the rest of you to be trapped there forever, you know? If nothing else, the cycle restarting is just going to mean more Sonjas being trapped in the loop, and even if they’re only sort of me I still would rather they not be. And it’s not as if I <em>want</em> the rest of you to suffer. Most of you were decent enough people – well, not <em>decent</em> in the sense of being <em>good people</em>, but tolerable to interact with.</p>
<p>(I did consider the question of whether it might actually be good to keep the loop going, since Sonjas are pretty cool and more loops means more Sonjas, but I don’t actually think that’s true, given how much mes hate being inside it).</p>
<p>Sonja</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>The others didn’t really want me to tell me this, but I think you deserve to know. Like, you’re the people actually affected, you know?</p>
<p>Anyways. The weirdass disturbance that happened didn’t just make it easier for you to get out, it also messed with the time dilation between the Knot and the rest of the world. If you can’t make it out this loop, there’s going to be <em>way</em> more of them, and there’ll probably be more unpleasant for the people inside.</p>
<p>Now, go out there and fuck the Mastermind up.</p>
<p>o7</p>

          <p><strong>Admissions Office</strong></p>
<p><em>The Admissions Office has a large desk, with a note on it and a single drawer. There is a chair behind the desk, and a couch sitting in front of it, facing the desk. Next to the desk is a cabinet with two drawers.</em></p>
<p><em>Desk:</em></p>
<p>The top of the desk contains a photograph and a note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you seriously reject everyone who wasn’t sufficiently traumatised for your project? I can’t believe you.<br>
K.A.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*The photograph shows a middle-aged man standing outside of the Vernal Tower. By now, you recognize him as Timoleon Silverheart.</p>
<p>The inside of the desk drawer contains a fountain pen and a ream of paper.</p>
<p>The cabinet top drawer contains a binder with files on all the admitted students. The bottom drawer contains an identical binder, but with files on rejected students instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Sonja Eriksson</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Toxicologist</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject has abnormal skill in identifying substances and their properties. Furthermore, she has discovered several new poisons with unique and especially-potent properties.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject appears to be extremely uncomfortable with cold weather, likely as a result of the events detailed in the essay she submitted to me. Potentially usable as a source of stress?</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Wilfred Arden</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Magician</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject demonstrated several difficult magic trips, including two of his own design. Although he was unwilling to explain how to do the tricks, I believe this to be genuine evidence of an Ultimate rather than merely unusual skill.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject seems to be involved in some sort of cult-like organization. I was unable to ascertain the details; however, I believe that it would be in his best interests for me to accept him.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Harleck Abode</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Detective</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject presented me with a record of past cases he has solved, including several cases which went unsolved for decades prior to his involvement.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject seems extremely intelligent. Furthermore, due to his past history working with other authorities, I believe it will be easy to get him to cooperate with the project.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Dennis Gildenblake</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Archer</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject has won numerous awards in archery competitions. In addition, during the interview, he demonstrated his talent by successfully hitting a 1 cm target from 150 meters away.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject seems to have a stable life, and may be uncooperative with some of the expectations of the project for that reason. However, I have reason to suspect he has an unusually strong paratalent, making him a particularly appealing research subject. Recommend follow-up interview to determine if he can be persuaded to cooperate.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted (provisional)</p>
<p>Further Notes: After learning of the situation that occurred on his range two years ago, I am now confident that he is an acceptable subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Johnathan Blake (NOTE: Subject prefers to go by the name Alyx and requested that I use they/them pronouns.)</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Gamer</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject demonstrates extraordinary proficiency with video games, and appears to be capable of subconsciously manipulating the random number generation (RNG) for games to be more favorable, without the use of any form of exploits. As a result, they were able to beat the speedrunning record previously held by “Minecraft” player “Dream.”</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject refused to talk to the interviewer, instead spending the entire time default dancing. We believe this to demonstrate a creative approach to problem-solving.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Alison Henderson</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Conductor</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject has been conducting professionally from before the time she was in primary school.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject clearly has a genuine Ultimate Talent; however, it is unclear whether she has experienced the sort of stress that I believe to be necessary to become the Ultimate Mage.</p>
<p>Decision: <s>Rejected</s></p>
<p>Further Notes: After leaving the interview, subject became extremely agitated due to a loud noise emitting from a nearby roadway. I believe that this indicates a potential source of stress that could be useful in developing her Ultimate Abilities.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Josephine Farrierson</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Historian</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject displays not only extensive knowledge of history and skill in historical research techniques, but supernatural knowledge of past events.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject provided the interviewer with two draughts, which caused hallucinatory visions once consumed. Based on the subject’s experience with these substances, I believe she will be particularly amiable to any unusual requests made of her as part of the project.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Matilda Martell (NOTE: Unclear whether Martell is her legal last name, due to her complicated status as a quasi-adoptee.)</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Witch</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject demonstrated supernatural healing abilities and other rituals.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject appears to be orphaned and homeless after escaping from Saint Martell’s Cathedral. As a result, I anticipate that she will be extremely willing to cooperate with the project in exchange for shelter and protection from Saint Martell’s.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Geoffrey Fansleigh-Reynolds</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Aristocrat</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject appears to be extremely wealthy.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Although subject has experienced stressful events, they were sufficiently long ago, and sufficiently isolated, that I am uncertain whether they would be sufficient to produce the Ultimate Mage. Furthermore, I have doubts about whether subject is genuinely an Ultimate.</p>
<p>Decision: <s>Rejected</s></p>
<p>Further Notes: After considering the contributions of Her Grace Daphne Fansleigh-Reynolds to Feybrook University, I have decided to reverse this decision. I believe this to be sufficient proof of Mr. Fansleigh-Reynolds’ status as an Ultimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Susannah Redbrooke (NOTE: Subject inconsistently uses the name Hanako in place of her given name)</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Necromancer</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject displayed the ability to use dead bodies to create animated beings.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject was unusually quiet, which may make her less suitable; however, her extraordinary magical potential justifies giving her a place in the program.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Alicia Hutchinson</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Snowboarder</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Although subject retired from competitive snowboarding years ago after an accident, she displayed several arcane paratalents.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject appeared enthusiastic about the project despite lacking details. Although I continued to maintain the cover of a university admissions interview, she talked unprompted about her desire to create the Ultimate Mage.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Sophie McDonald</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Inventor</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject provided extensive documentation of her inventions, including several patents.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Although the lack of extreme stresses in the subject’s life likely make her unsuitable for becoming the Ultimate Mage herself, her passion for research means that she will likely excel in a support role. Furthermore, due to the fact that she has not previously conducted human research, she is unlikely to object to any breaches of the highly regressive established guidelines for research with human subjects.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Arthur Townsend (NOTE: Subject requested that I refer to him as “N.”)</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Astrologer</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Attempts by the subject to forecast future events are successful at a rate substantially higher than random chance although still not perfect.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Subject forecasted that if I did not accept him, the project would fail. Although I suspect this of being a ploy, given the high success of his predictions, I believe it unwise to take the risk.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Alex Bracknell</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Nanotechnologist</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Subject replaced a large portion of her body with nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: Similarly to Ms. Martell, subject is functionally an orphan. As a result, she will likely be extremely willing to cooperate with the project in exchange for shelter and other resources.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Stephanie Brown</p>
<p>Ultimate Talent: Ultimate Highwaywoman</p>
<p>Evidence of Talent: Instead of coming to the interview, the subject held me up on the train, then returned my stolen belongings to the inside of my room, which was locked.</p>
<p>Interview Notes: See above.</p>
<p>Decision: Accepted</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In the binder of rejected applicants, you see dozens of similar files. Although most of them were rejected due to a lack of a true Ultimate Talent, a few of the reasons stick out as different.</em></p>
<p>-Theodore Winkle, rejected due to “lack of formative stressful experiences making him unsuitable as a candidate for becoming Ultimate Mage”<br>
-Logan Bree-Cantor, rejected for “irrational lack of belief in magic”<br>
-Amanda Ell, rejected for “arguing with her interviewer about the ethics of human genetic modification”<br>
-Ciara Kelly, rejected for “projected uncooperativeness with the demands of the project”<br>
-Daiki Ito, rejected for “demonstrated past noncompliance with instructions from authority”</p>

          <p><strong>Hall of Failures</strong></p>
<p><em>As you enter the Hall of Failures, you step over a circle of salt, which someone has placed directly in front of the door. The hall itself contains very little in the way of furniture. In the center of the room is a laptop computer, sitting on the floor by itself. On the floor of the room is a box, with some sort of locking mechanism built in; it seems to want a seven-letter passcode.</em></p>
<p>Computer:</p>
<p><em>The computer contains a file named READMEFIRST.txt, as well as a .jpg image named PROOF.jpg. Would you like to read it?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello. My name is N Townsend, and I’m guessing that I have about forty-nine hours to live – an hour until our final trial starts, and forty-eight more until I’m condemned to death by my classmates, all of whom are convinced, for some reason, that I’m the one trapping them here. Rather than try to change their minds, I’m leaving this for you, in the hopes that some future version of myself will be able to find it and figure out who the Mastermind is for real.<br>
A handful of past mes managed to write down the mistake they made that led them to lose the trial. Based on the patterns I’ve observed, anything directly referencing their identity won’t persist through an iteration, but vaguer clues about what they did wrong might. I’ve collected their notes in a more … legible and comprehensible … form; they were difficult for me to understand, but I think I’ve pieced them together.<br>
So that this doesn’t fall into the wrong hands, I’m leaving you with a simple puzzle to open the box that I’ve left the information. It’s probably super easy and obvious, but I’m hoping it’ll help ensure the box stays in the right hands.<br>
The first, more accurately the nineteenth, begins to add them together<br>
The second, surprise expressed,<br>
The third, a thumb between pinky and ring,<br>
The fourth, the beginning of everything, the end of the middle,<br>
The fifth, coming from the sun’s rays itself,<br>
The sixth, admiration, expressed as the second, although different,<br>
The seventh, simultaneously answered and not, by one incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Good luck.<br>

<p><em>PROOF.jpg appears to depict N/Arthur Townsend, holding up a piece of paper that says “The message on the computer was written by me, not the Mastermind impersonating me, everything there is true.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Run: 19<br>
Mistake: They found a photo of someone killing in a past run. However, it turned out it was in Run 5, and apparently the Mastermind could still kill then?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 118<br>
Mistake: They found a mirror in the weird upside-down castle that showed you visions of a past you killing someone. Apparently, they assumed that the Mastermind wouldn’t know that it did that, but they did, so they just lied and said they’d seen themself kill someone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 563<br>
Mistake: The Mastermind was the very first to die, they assumed the Mastermind dying would end the game and thought that that meant they had to be among the living.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: I’m not sure, but I think it was after 563?<br>
Mistake: The Mastermind repeatedly blatantly lied to cover for literally every killer (e.g. saying they were with the killer when the crime happened), somehow they still made it to the final trial, at that point they assumed the Mastermind wouldn’t be that obvious? I’m not really sure if I should include this one, since the problem here was that they were dumb, but I figure it can’t hurt to give you more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 814<br>
Mistake: The Fates offered a motive in which an accomplice could escape alongside a Blackened. The Mastermind helped a Blackened escape, and everyone assumed that the Mastermind had escaped with them, but they’d actually stayed in the simulation secretly as part of their twisted plan to “end” the game that’s actually making literally everything worse. SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU MESS UP THAT BADLY.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 1314<br>
Mistake: The Mastermind claimed under the effects of some sort of truth potion that makes you glow not to be the Mastermind. It turns out that they have literally perfect ability to lie, and can fool most forms of magical investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 1827<br>
Mistake: They mistakenly assumed that because everyone had a verifiable past prior to the project, and verifiable family or similar, that that meant that none of them were the Mastermind, and they all unanimously voted that there was no Mastermind within the game. In fact, the Mastermind had a life just like the rest of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Run: 2003<br>
Mistake: The Mastermind convincingly pretended to attempt to murder another player, but failed to actually murder them. People assumed that it was a real murder attempt.</p>

<p><em>As you enter the Brewery, you see a mess of different distillation equipment. In one corner of the room is a handwritten sign labelled “POTIONS INGREDIENTS,” and you see several smaller labelled boxes. On a central table is a simple distillation apparatus, several glass bottles, and a note.</em></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making potions isn’t that hard, just combine some of the ingredients in this room in one of the distillers. They take about half an hour to brew, from what I’ve noticed. Admittedly, most of them aren’t very useful. -Sonja</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Potions ingredients:</em></p>
<p>Each box contains four “servings” of a different ingredient. Once used, even as something other than the “active” ingredient, a serving goes away. The ingredients are powdered sage, dragon liver, spider legs, bone dust, octopus ink, owl eyes, and swordfish scales.</p>
<p><em>Potion making:</em></p>
<p>Potions take 30 minutes to brew.</p>
<p>For simplicity’s sake, which potion you get is based solely on the FIRST ingredient you submit.</p>
<p>Powdered Sage (3/4 remaining):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elixir of Recollection</strong><br>
For the next hour, enhances your memory slightly, allowing you to more easily recall past events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[In game terms, the potion makes hosts be slightly nicer about answering questions like “do I remember if X.”]</p>
<p>Dragon Liver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elixir of Rejuvenation</strong><br>
Fully restores your AP to its maximum value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spider Leg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elixir of Legs</strong><br>
For the next hour, causes you to grow six additional legs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bone Dust (3/4 remaining):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elixir of Malleability</strong><br>
For the next hour, makes your body much more flexible, and able to bend essentially at-will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Octopus Ink:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elixir of Cunning</strong><br>
For the next hour, doubles your intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owl eyes (2/4 remaining):</p>

          <p><strong>Ritual Athenaeum</strong></p>
<p><em>The Ritual Athenaeum contains four tiny cages (gold, silver, bronze and copper). Inside each cage is a tiny piece of paper. On a table in the center of the room is a much larger piece of paper. The windows of the room are stained glass, and depict people sitting in the middle of rings of candles.</em></p>
<p><em>Central table</em></p>
<p>Paper: <em>The paper describes a ritual that can be performed to summon a projection of someone’s spirit into the Knot for an hour. The ritual requires three main components. First, a specific, highly complex inscription that the paper does not elaborate on; however, the bottom of the paper includes a prefilled sample circle which the paper informs you is suitable, designating the person to be pulled in as Timoleon Silverheart. Second, some sort of item relating to the Ultimate Talent of every living Ultimate in the Knot. Third, the ritual can only be performed in the presence of the Fate Lachesis. Apart from the Fate, all items used in the ritual are consumed.</em></p>
<p>When performed, the ritual summons Timoleon Silverheart for an hour. He will blatantly lie every time it makes him look bad to tell the truth; I will do my best to make it <em>obvious</em> that he is lying to people. The Lachesis component is so you two don’t have to RP him.</p>
<p><em>All cages:</em></p>
<p>None of the papers in the cage can be read without opening them.</p>
<p><em>Gold Cage:</em></p>
<p><em>Inspecting the gold cage, you see a poem etched into the bottom of it.</em></p>
<p><i>Tyger Tyger, burning bright,<br>
In the forests of the night;<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</i></p>
<p>[The cage can be opened by lighting it on fire inside the forest. This will not harm the ritual paper inside.]</p>
<p><em>On closer inspection it is clear that the paper inside has been torn from some sort of book. It describes a ritual, requiring as a material component a lock of hair, which must be set on fire. Their hair will burn to a fine golden powder if they have used their Ultimate, and to ash if they have not.</em></p>
<p><em>Silver Cage:</em></p>
<p><em>Inspecting the silver cage, you see a poem etched into the bottom of it.</em></p>
<p><em>Even as the sails inflated by the wind</em><br>
<em>Involved together fall when snaps the mast,</em><br>
<em>So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,</em><br>
<em>Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore</em><br>
<em>Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</em></p>
<p>[The cage can be opened by throwing it from a high place]</p>
<p><em>On closer inspection, it is clear that the paper inside has been torn from some sort of book. It describes a ritual allowing whoever performs it to determine if a document has been substantively altered from when it was originally written. As a component, the ritual requires a human finger, which is consumed in the ritual. If the object was substantively altered, it will glow red for five minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>Bronze Cage:</em></p>
<p><em>Inspecting the bronze cage, you see a poem etched into the bottom of it.</em></p>
<p><i>Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,<br>
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,<br>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br>
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest<br>
The rising world of waters dark and deep,<br>
Won from the void and formless infinite.</i></p>
<p>[The cage can be opened by submerging it in water. This does not damage the paper.]</p>
<p><em>On closer inspection, it is clear that the paper inside has been torn from some sort of book. It describes a ritual which allows the purging of objects originating from outside the Knot. It requires a piece of string, tied around the object. If the object originated from outside the Knot, it will disappear; if it did not, it will not. Either way, the string is consumed.</em></p>
<p><em>Copper Cage:</em></p>
<p><em>Inspecting the copper cage, you see a poem etched into the bottom of it.</em></p>
<p><i>Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<br>
Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,<br>
A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew’d<br>
My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:</i></p>
<p>[The cage can be opened by placing earth on it while inside any part of the Tomb.]</p>
<p><em>On closer inspection, it is clear that the paper inside has been torn from some sort of book. It describes a ritual which requires a drop of blood, placed on the edge of an arrow, which is consumed in the ritual. The ritual will reveal to whoever performs it some form of information that is true, but something they don’t want to know.</em></p>
