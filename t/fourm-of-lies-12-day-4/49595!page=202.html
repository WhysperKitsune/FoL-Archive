          <h1>Day 4 Begins with Vulgards death he was the <font color="steblue"> Noble</font> he left a journal</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Vulgard, the Noble.<br>
The other Noble is Damafaud.</p>
<p>N1 - Crier. Also, a talk with Dama about some strategy.<br>
N2 - Sending a Servant to Sam. SSS</p>
<p>Reads:</p>
<p>eevee - I have no idea what he is at this point, but since his earlier Merc claim is uncontested I’ll believe<br>
he’s Merc. Read Note 2 though.</p>
<p>Hippolytus - One of two Physician claims now, and since Parfait seems so scummy, he wins the<br>
“truth award” no contest. He DID seem BD D2 and for now, I’m willing to trust him.</p>
<p>Moleland - Cowardly King vibes, I don’t think he’s Evil/Devout, and I don’t think he’s BD either. The force<br>
pardon on Parfait was definitely suspicious though.</p>
<p>Orange - After all the reveals, and after reading everything he did during the game - proactive pushing<br>
for claims etc., etc. - I believe Orange is the Hunter. His great aggression with Eevee’s help solidifies<br>
that for me. Knowing all the repercussions his playstyle could possibly have, and the fact it makes him<br>
a target, Orange being Hunter would make sense to me. Read Note 2 though.</p>
<p>Marluxion - Maid claim, no reason not to believe it. One of the most trustworthy people here. But, they<br>
could be the convert, and a quite likely one at that. See my convert list for more info about that.</p>
<p>NozBugz - Princess claim, but apparent scum read by the majority of my BD reads and those who<br>
claimed. It might be the Mastermind, but I somehow doubt it. What’s worth noting is that Noz is the<br>
only claim which can confirm that it hasn’t been converted at night.</p>
<p>NightX - First claimed “unimportant BD”, then “Squire”. I think this might very well be the Druid, but I will<br>
wait for an Investigative to confirm that. If not Druid, I would think he’s the Mastermind. He just<br>
doesn’t seem towny enough to be a BD read for me.</p>
<p>Celeste_Ludenberg - Drunk. No reason to doubt this for now, unless converted. He/she seems to always<br>
be scummy, so I’ll just let them be for now.</p>
<p>Damafaud - I obviously know he started as Noble, so I can’t be wrong about that. However, as my<br>
convert list states, Dama is my <span class="hashtag">#1</span> suspect as the N1 convert.</p>
<p>techwolves - Alchemist, uncontested. Can be Mastermind, but less likely than Night in my book. Could be<br>
Unseen, but his claim being uncontested makes that less likely.</p>
<p>Sam - Sheriff. Uncontested. Could be the convert, but then again, everyone could.</p>
<p>Insanity - At first I thought he acted so neut/scum that he could actually be BD, but now I’m doubting<br>
that. I know that he was compatible with me N1 when Marl checked me, but to be honest, Insanity<br>
could be the convert. It might sound ridiculous for veterans, but if NightX is Mastermind, I would<br>
seriously consider it because he doesn’t know the supposed weaknesses of Insanity as scum. Just going<br>
to say this here too - I don’t like the “he plays bad scum” line of reasoning, and the ones similar to that.<br>
Players can play differently every game regardless of alignment.</p>
<p>Parfait - The third Physician claim, and the person who was listed in my read list as a lurker before. The<br>
fact that Frost and Parfait were clearly antagonized makes me believe Parfait can’t be BD, and there are<br>
various red flags from Parfait scattered across D2 as well.</p>
<p>Braixen - I firmly believe this is the Prince and he/she is just being vague about it.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>BD: Me, Dama, Orange, Sam, Celeste, Noz, Marl, Insanity, Braixen.<br>
Unseen: Night?, Parfait, one of the people listed as BD or Eevee.<br>
Neut: Night?, Tech, Eevee.<br>
Cowardly King: Moleland.</p>
<p>Argument for Night and Parfait being scum together: They are both new. The argument about the<br>
weakness of converting Insanity was there earlier, but since they are both new, they wouldn’t know.<br>
I know that this sounds like a ridiculous tinfoil theory at this point, especially since literally anyone<br>
else could be the convert (including Dama, sadly enough), but it’s a theory I believe could be correct.<br>
Call me stupid if you want.</p>
<p>Convert likelihood in my eyes:</p>
<p>5 - Damafaud. As sad as it is, I wouldn’t even know whether Damafaud was converted or not, and neither<br>
would anyone else. I hope it’s not the case, but we should consider that possibility too and let Marl<br>
disprove it if needed. Additionally, after N2 chat, I have an increased suspicion of Dama being converted.<br>
Specifically, not using Send Servant even though I suggested it, and being extremely silent even though<br>
he doesn’t usually talk much. What makes it worse is that he went completely under the radar D2. His<br>
only noticeable interaction was with Marl, about his own Royal Blood, which he confirmed he had. This<br>
interaction is important in my opinion, but still, the fact that he kept so quiet makes me wonder whether<br>
or not he was converted. And again, I do understand he’s not a vocal player, but he was even less vocal<br>
than Parfait until she was accused. That’s quite an achievement even Insanity couldn’t obtain.<br>
5 - Marl. Knowing what I know about Dama, and having seen the “Royal Blood confirmation”, the<br>
interaction between Marl and Dama, I see it as a talk between BD and a convert. One of Marl or Dama<br>
is the convert, this is my theory right now, and I’m sticking to it. I’m basing it on what I said about Dama<br>
above, because Marl’s inititative about the royal blood information could be both BD-sided or scum-sided.<br>
Also, he could very easily gain towncred D2 because it’s very difficult to disprove Maid aside from a<br>
direct investigation. The fact that he outed Dama as having Royal Blood for no apparent reason<br>
(“confirming himself” when he was already confirmed isn’t a good reason to me) only made me suspect<br>
him more too.<br>
4 - Noz. I firmly believe that silent/seemingly unimportant people are the best convert targets, and Noz<br>
fits that description.<br>
4 - Insanity. Same thing as with Noz. Him being compatible with me N1 doesn’t prove he’s NOT the<br>
convert. The fact that he hasn’t claimed yet makes me think it’s a strong converted class too, if he really<br>
is the convert.<br>
3 - Sam. I’m not saying it happened, but to be honest, him being Marshal would make a few things<br>
clear, including why he doesn’t appear to be scumhunting as actively as most. It could just be me reading<br>
him poorly though.<br>
2 - Celeste. Not saying Techwolves is the Mastermind and Celeste got converted by him because of the<br>
deb, but Celeste has been acting pretty scummy throughout D2. It might just be because he’s bad BD,<br>
but in reality, it could just as easily be Alcoholic now, as he pointed out himself. I do realize Celeste<br>
acts scummy nearly all the time though, which is why he/she’s sitting here with score 2.<br>
2 - Parfait. If anything, he’s starting Unseen, not converted.<br>
2 - Night. Unless he lied about being attacked for whatever reason, him being converted makes no sense<br>
because it was the Assassin who attacked him N1. Also, since the other suspicion is about him being<br>
Druid, him being converted is even less likely.<br>
2 - Eevee. Despite the obvious benefits of converting Eevee, it probably wouldn’t happen N1. Way too<br>
risky. It would be like converting him with the intention of executing him later because he didn’t/couldn’t<br>
guard.<br>
1 - Hippo. It was obviously impossible.<br>
1 - Braixen. Because of my read, impossible.<br>
1 - Orange, because Eevee claimed to be his Merc D1, and Sam claimed to be scouting him.<br>
1 - Techwolves. Convert immune based on his uncontested claim.<br>
1 - Moleland. He’s the King, duh.<br>
1 - Myself. I KNOW I’m not converted, lmao.</p>
<p>Note: The Damafaud/Marl Royal Blood interaction is important. In fact, because it exists, I think one of<br>
them is the convert - however Dama seems to be a bit more likely, which is why he’s the highest on my<br>
list.</p>
<p>Note 2: I am considering the possibility of Eevee or Orange being very smart scum, but for now, that’s<br>
not something I’m willing to support fully right now.</p>
