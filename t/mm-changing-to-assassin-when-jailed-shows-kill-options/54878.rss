    <title>MM changing to assassin when jailed shows kill options</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/mm-changing-to-assassin-when-jailed-shows-kill-options/54878</link>
    <description>I used the MasterMind day ability and was jailed that night by prince. While in jail I could select targets for kill or double kill. As the next day started I was executed by prince but didn&#39;t attack either of my two double kill targets.

Shouldn&#39;t see night time skills in jail.

Be MM
Change to assassin the day before jailed.

Minor bug as it doesn&#39;t actually let you kill anyone but still shouldn&#39;t show.</description>

            <p>Unfortunately no. I didn’t think about that while I was in game. I only posted it here even because someone in the after game chat said to.<br>
But it was literally just the jail screen with the two night skill squares where they would be normally on assassin and you can click them and select targets.<br>
Since it was only me, the prince and the original king, so I was screwed anyway, I was talking to the prince about it.</p>
