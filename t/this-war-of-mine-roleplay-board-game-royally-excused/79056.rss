    <title>This War of Mine: Roleplay / Board Game - Royally Excused</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/this-war-of-mine-roleplay-board-game-royally-excused/79056</link>
    <description>Before we get started, I want to put out a disclaimer.

**This roleplay is more board-game than other roleplays. It is much less host biased: I will not pull any trash on you like immediate resurrection or give other people mass weaponry unfairly (if they roll a 100 out of 100 in a weapons locker you best believe they are getting something like an assault rifle hen). It will all be determined by dice roles and the outcome will be roughly already given to you depending on your dice role. For example, I may say if you roll a 20 out of 100 you&#39;ll be given common material.**

**Introduction**

*In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.*

Dice Role Tables will be added as we go along. Players will not be informed of eachother. I&#39;ll explain actions in a moment.

Players:

1. Jgoesgaming
2. Marshal
3. H_Hja
4. GamerPoke
5. Priestess
6. Magnus
7. DirectorHail
8. James
9. Shurian

            <p>Reeee and we did so well ^^<br>
Thank you for hosting<br>
(I see this one as test round, hopefully you’ll learn from it, and hopefully we’ll be able to try again <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )<br>
I even played about 10 hours WoM in the last days, because I got so hungry to it thanks to you</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>I’m extremely sorry to those who wanted to play, but this is needing to be canned. I fear it’s not going to be enjoyable further into the game. It’s being <font color="7851a9">royally excused</font>.</h2>
<p>I’m not happy with how this ended up at all. I understand that there are some players that extremely enjoyed this and even took upon themselves the task to track their own resources and sorts, but this is not going to end up being enjoyable for either party. At the end it’ll just really be a waiting game.</p>
<p>Here are the reasons:</p>
<p>I should have specified mechanics before the game started. People were misled (unintentionally) by not only what the game was advertised to be but also the actual mechanics.<br>
I had no idea a board game of this actually existed. Apologies to those who thought it’d be mirroring the board game. It was intended to be a ‘port’ of the computer game. I’m also extremely unhappy at how I said it’d be not host-biased but it definitely was and I was not happy with that either.</p>
<p>I should have given diceroll tables to start, so players weren’t just blindly rolling for dice rolls or I was choosing what was fair. For example, I should have stated that components rolling from rubble is a 1d10 x 2 = the amount of materials you gain.</p>
<p>I should have specified the simplest things such as Rubble = Components, Crates = Wood and Lockers = Electrical Parts / Weapon Parts.</p>
<p>I should have done more research into the mechanics. I was going primarily off of memory and what I think should happen and that isn’t acceptable for what I wanted the game to be.</p>
<p>I should have waited for a cohost before attempting real-time events. The one we actually managed (<a class="mention" href="/u/emilia">@Emilia</a>) was a blast, and will definitely return if I manage to get enough co-hosts to help. Otherwise, it’s just not possible. I rolled 3 dices for the scavengers out of 4 people. I actually had a blueprint up of a real junkyard</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/3X/5/d/5dbcd0d2e644b74b3cfa0c73641eca471371086d.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="dneWjwgzFHuV2Kl2O61pvTCUWLz" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p>Hja started where the road started on the west side. For those that want to see it, the chat has been publicized.</p>
<p>I should have stated the recipes immediately as well, and not just making them as we went along. That was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>I should have had character sheets pre-made. Some were extremely unbalanced.</p>
<p>I should have known how to manage to keep interest as a host. I originally thought people would just finish actions without being pressured or having a time limit but that obviously wasn’t happening. Time limits should also be defined and not up to my discretion as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think I’ve learned a lot from hosting this. I absolutely love this idea. The reason for excusing wasn’t because I didn’t like the idea, it’s because I wasn’t happy with how I executed it. I’ll definitely host this again once I’ve came prepared and fixed all the mistakes above, because I actually do really like the idea.</p>
<h2>Thank you to everyone who signed up, and I’m sorry that I had to end it but it’s for the best. It wasn’t going to last much longer and interest would go short end-game.</h2>
