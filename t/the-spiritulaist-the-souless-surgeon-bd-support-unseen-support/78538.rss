            <p>I still think that healing has no purpose for the Unseen. I mean it helps against NKs I guess but It doesnt really help against BD in any way. Healing against prince would just waste an exe I guess.</p>

            <p>Can I just ask how Unholy cleansing would ever be useful? The MM is already immune to bleed and the only class that can bleed Unseen is Hunter which doesn’t even spawn every game. Also, it occupies the assassin, which means Unseen loses a kill. Basically it has no utility as even if an assassin is bleeding you would much rather take 2 potential kills over just one. So in the BEST case scenario, there is a Hunter, its D4, and he bled the assassin. The assassin also wasn’t jailed and you’re able to heal him at the expense of a kill. If the best-case scenario is that then this is one of the worst converts ever. Also, it could lead to some Soulless Surgeons to trolling their teammates by occupying them.<br>
I actually think that the Blue Dragon version is super cool though. I think that having a class that can prevent unhealable attacks is a neat albeit niche feature. It also has some weaknesses like having to recover from bleed themselves and only being able to do it once. Deep cleanse could use a buff to 2 uses but that’s just my opinion. (The thought process is it won’t proc that much anyway so giving people another use of it probably doesn’t matter.)<br>
I think there are scenarios where Chronomancers, Physicians, and Spiritualists are all good which is what you want.<br>
Side note: This class seems almost like a direct counter to Reaper. I assume this was intentional in the design and if this class were to be implemented Reaper would become significantly weaker when this class spawned.</p>
