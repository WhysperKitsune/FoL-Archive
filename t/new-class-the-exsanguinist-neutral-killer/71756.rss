    <title>[New Class] The Exsanguinist - Neutral Killer</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/new-class-the-exsanguinist-neutral-killer/71756</link>
    <description>**The Exsanguinist (Version 1.1)**

The man walked into Aldiart and saw nothing but filth. &quot;Well, well, pigs walking on two legs, unlike any pig I have ever seen.&quot; He knew little of the castle and it&#39;s inhabitants but knew that they must be cleaned and strung up to make way for a proper world. &quot;All this waste on the tables and yet the ones in the streets die like animals.&quot; He believed his cause to be noble, though the glee on his face perverted any noble cause he may have. He pulled out a hook and looked at it, it was a little rusty and had seen its fair share of use, but it was the one that was passed down to him from all those years ago. &quot;Taking our food, burning us down, after everything we did for the nobles? Pigs indeed.&quot; He laughed and went to find a place to hide and something to eat, he would hate to have to scavenge an animal or two...

The Exsanguinist is a Neutral Killer who operates with slow deaths and tries to put pressure on healers while reveling in their own injuries.

_**Creator&#39;s Note: This Class assumes that Bleed and Poison have been rolled into one ability. All abilities referring to Bleed also refer to Poison. A poison themed one can easily be rolled into the game, giving them a slight edge knowing whether it is an Unseen/Cult game.**_


&gt; Class Card Name : The Exsanguinist
&gt; Class Card Faction : Neutral
&gt; Class Card Type : Killer
&gt; 
&gt; Win Condition: Neutral Killer win condition.
&gt; 
&gt; **Passives:**
&gt; Feel No Pain (Passive)
&gt; Immunity to Death at Night. Attacks will go through but instead you will Bleed. You are Immune to death via Bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; Crimson Revelry (Passive)
&gt; If you are Bleeding, Bleed &#39;ticks&#39; count as 2 instead of 1 and your abilities cannot be occupied, redirected, or stopped through Immunity.
&gt; _The Exsanguinist sees how many &#39;ticks&#39; of Bleed targets have at any point in time_
&gt;_Bleeds sourced by the Exsanguinist bypass Innoculation, Alch and Physician Immunity while **Crimson Revelry** is active_
&gt; 
&gt; **Day Abilities**
&gt; Stained Journals (Day, 2 Uses)
&gt; Whoever dies today and tonight will not have their log revealed.
&gt; 
&gt; Flesh Wound (Day, Unlimited)
&gt; Make a target Bleed. They will be healed at the end of the night automatically.
&gt; 
&gt; **Night Abilities**
&gt; Butcher&#39;s Hemorrhage (Night, Unlimited)
&gt; Target a player. During the next day they **will** Bleed at a random point.
&gt;
&gt; Lamb to the Slaughter (Night, Unlimited)
&gt; Occupy target player. They cannot be targeted tonight. If they die tonight their role and log will not be revealed.

I was tasked to make a Neutral Killer that utilized Bleeding effects to kill their targets. I am operating under the assumption that Bleed and Poison are interchangeable and that the Unseen/Cult divide will eventually be collapsed into one status effect.

The Exsanguinist can utilize **Hemorrhage** to cause targets to Bleed, mistaking the attack as Unseen/Cult, but more importantly can speed up the deaths and make it so each poison and bleed acts much quicker if he himself is bleeding. He can up the speed by using **Flesh Wound** on himself (to trigger **Crimson Revelry** and punch through a Physician&#39;s Inoculate or natural Immunity) or use **Flesh Wound** to divert attention from Physicians. With the fast acting effects of Bleed, even a Mastermind (who is normally not worried about most night killers) may need to worry about such threats and will have to make themselves known and speak up. The pain of the bleeding also puts additional strain on the Prince and their jailing as well as other redirecting roles.

Using **Lamb to the Slaughter** the Exsanguinist can lock a target down, letting them drip out overnight without any help from others. Alternatively, they can target themself to protect or stop effects that may be targeting them this night (for whatever reason). If a target dies under the effects of **Lamb to the Slaughter** the body will be found in a gruesome and unrecognizable state, making the killer&#39;s presence widely known while destroying a lot of information.

**Stained Journals** timed with a good set of bleeds will cause a lot of information to be lost to the court, allowing the Exsanguinist time to hide and rethink their strategy. While it doesn&#39;t have the ultimate deceptive power of the Possessor or the game ending power of the Reaper&#39;s **Icy Touch**, it may allow for dead leads while the hunt for the Unseen/Cult continue.

More straightforward than most of my other designs, I feel it&#39;s a simple take on a Bleeding Night Killer and I hope you enjoy it.

[details=&quot;Changelog&quot;]
v1.1 Added a Role Hiding effect to **Lamb to the Slaughter**, reduced **Stained Journals** from 3 to 2 uses.
v1.0 Created

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I like the idea of an NK who survives attacks but starts bleeding from them.  But I find the rest highly problematic.  Pretending to be bleeding is already an options for evils; to have an actual pretend bleed adds too much confusion.  And bleeding yourself to get a buff while being immune to bleeding seems silly, it would make more sense for there to be the risk of actually dying from bleed if you benefit from it.  Being able to bleed people that are immune to bleed is also too confusing.  Lamb to the Slaughter is basically just combining both Sellsword abilities into one, along with erasing longs.  And the randomness of bleeding a player at a random point in the day on top of everything else makes me think this class is a bad idea.</p>

            <p>Ultimately the point was to avoid the standard kill option. Those types of killers are common in terms of functionality. Really if you want to kill someone that way you can always occupy them and stop them from getting medical assistance.</p>
<p>The reason for making it a night action is so it has interaction during the normal kill hours with classes such as Princess, Observer, Prince Jail, etc.</p>
<p>The fake bleed is less of a fake bleed and more of a self buff that can double as a fake bleed.</p>

            <p>Well if that is the issue then why not make it a Day ability instead? He both needs a standard kill option (because healers exist) and doesn’t really need a fake bleed so yeah</p>

            <p>RNG is supposed to make it blend it more with the Assassin/Cult Rupture than the Hunter. It will happen during the day, just at some point unknown. It’s really just to make it seem organic instead of it always triggering at the 30 second mark (for example).</p>
<p>Then again Hunter Bleed is kind of the outlier with Wolf. <em>Legends say that the talks of making Wolf a Day Ability have been circulating since time immemorial so who knows.</em></p>
<p>If we make it strike at night, its immediately clear there is an Exsangunist in the game, so I’m not sure if that would help really.</p>

<p>I was tasked to make a Neutral Killer that utilized Bleeding effects to kill their targets. I am operating under the assumption that Bleed and Poison are interchangeable and that the Unseen/Cult divide will eventually be collapsed into one status effect.</p>
<p>The Exsanguinist can utilize <strong>Hemorrhage</strong> to cause targets to Bleed, mistaking the attack as Unseen/Cult, but more importantly can speed up the deaths and make it so each poison and bleed acts much quicker if he himself is bleeding. He can up the speed by using <strong>Flesh Wound</strong> on himself (to trigger <strong>Crimson Revelry</strong> and punch through a Physician’s Inoculate or natural Immunity) or use <strong>Flesh Wound</strong> to divert attention from Physicians. With the fast acting effects of Bleed, even a Mastermind (who is normally not worried about most night killers) may need to worry about such threats and will have to make themselves known and speak up. The pain of the bleeding also puts additional strain on the Prince and their jailing as well as other redirecting roles.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Lamb to the Slaughter</strong> the Exsanguinist can lock a target down, letting them drip out overnight without any help from others. Alternatively, they can target themself to protect or stop effects that may be targeting them this night (for whatever reason). If a target dies under the effects of <strong>Lamb to the Slaughter</strong> the body will be found in a gruesome and unrecognizable state, making the killer’s presence widely known while destroying a lot of information.</p>
<p><strong>Stained Journals</strong> timed with a good set of bleeds will cause a lot of information to be lost to the court, allowing the Exsanguinist time to hide and rethink their strategy. While it doesn’t have the ultimate deceptive power of the Possessor or the game ending power of the Reaper’s <strong>Icy Touch</strong>, it may allow for dead leads while the hunt for the Unseen/Cult continue.</p>
<p>More straightforward than most of my other designs, I feel it’s a simple take on a Bleeding Night Killer and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
