    <title>Big cinematics/ Alchemist/ Cw</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/big-cinematics-alchemist-cw/61124</link>
    <description>First of all, love your game. Thought I could share my thoughts with you. 

1) Very big cinematics... 

Every death/ Trial Execution cinematic take way more time that than I feel they should. I just feel that reducing those timers would significantly reduce the time/ game and make it more enjoyable. 

2) Alchemists

So there have been several games that we just let the alchemist live and by the end of the game he is the one who decides the winning side. Its like having a ticking time bomb in your pocket that might go off at the end of the game or might not. And there is nothing you can do about it unless you are a Neuts Out guy (who I am not) and waste a day executing him instead of looking for the evil. 
I don&#39;t have a good suggestion for this issue. But I really wanted to point out this issue since some games end up being decided by one (neutral!) person, punishing you for letting &quot;that poor alch&quot; live.

3) Court Wizzards

Most people hate playing as cw because it is boring. I believe that the reason behind that is just that barrier does not provide adequate feedback to the player, making him feel that is he is just spectating.

Moreover, he is one of the three most disruptive bd classes along with drunk and butler but he is much worse than that. On first nights, if the cw barriers a random player and a drunk/butler visits the aforementioned player, he will be shown as immune/cw, making the game harder for the bd. If you think about it, the best thing that cw can do the first nights would be to Not Barrier (since number of serves/deb&#39;s &gt; Convert) and just wait for a phys/sheriff to be outed and protect him for the rest of the game.
But cyclone is disruptive as well, and despite this fact the cw still has to use it to random people on first nights, since it is the most effective way to prove himself.


I just realized I wrote more things than I intended. So I would like to make clear that No1 problem for me are the long cinematics! The rest are mostly my thoughts!</description>

            <p>Point 1 I kind of agree with. I think the current time used for executions takes a while, but I never found it too bothersome.</p>
<p>Point 2 is just silly. You’re letting them live, yet you’re complaining about them. If you don’t want them to decide the game, you kill them. Plain and simple. Alchs have it easy anyway if all they have to do is shout “Hey I’m an alchemist, don’t kill me” and then they get a free win.</p>
<p>Point 3 is moot since CW is being reworked.</p>

            <p>Alch is certainly a kingmaker most of the time. Though if we got rid of alch we would have to put a physician on the rolelist causing more claim issues</p>
