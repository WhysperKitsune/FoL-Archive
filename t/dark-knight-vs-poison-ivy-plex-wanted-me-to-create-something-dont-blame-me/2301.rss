* Will show as ns/support only once to a investigative role

#Notes:
The dark knight must kill poison ivy to become a true knight of blue dragon,
they can bypass poison ivy&#39;s immunity therefor this is there main target before they kill you and regain there full powers.

While poison ivy must win with all neutrals therefor must gain her full powers once the dark knight is destroyed.
Once the dark knight is destroyed she gathers her full toxicity in her ivy and can kill whoever she pleases.

journal is removed upon death of the dark knight via poison ivy killing them as a neutral win killer is hard to achieve,
therefor it gives her a better chance of staying hidden.

If either target is killed by means other than there counterpart they will keep there current abilities.

The dark knight can be converted and keep the same abilities,
But if he becomes assassin or cult leader then poison ivy gains her full powers.

            <p>He has to win with bd<br>
But if he outs himself he could get killed by poison ivy.<br>
Therefore giving guaranteed kills by poison every night.<br>
It’s a way to try and get a neutral evil to win but they have to work for it</p>

<p>I am thinking in terms of it being stupid to be a dark knight, as it is easier to win as knight by a lot.</p>
<p>A normal knight need not work for his position, but blue dragon goes several nights without the dark knight as a knight.</p>
