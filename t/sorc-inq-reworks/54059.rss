    <title>Sorc/Inq Reworks</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorc-inq-reworks/54059</link>
    <description>Current Inq/Sorc dynamic isn&#39;t great.

1. It takes no effort as Inquisitor. The Sorc has no great claim, so will often get lynched without intervention.
2. Swinginess, if the Inq yolos with Ruthless efficiency they have a 1/14 of simply winning and removing the NK.
3. A sorc game is a huge advantage for Unseen/Cult, since the NK isn&#39;t after them.

So I thought I&#39;d draft a bunch of suggestions.

<p>2: So no actual NK? Inq seems like a weaker Scorned in that he only has 1 target and since Sorc isn’t killing people, they’re not an immediate threat for BD to take care of. That “prevent healing/guarding on them” doesn’t do much either since you can’t effectively communicate with the Cult/Unseen.</p>

            <p>1: Two NKs simultaneous might be a little hectic. Also the odds of <em>either</em> one winning is very slim. So many deaths each night, even with those cooldowns.</p>
<p>2: So no actual NK? Inq seems like a weaker Scorned in that he only has 1 target and since Sorc isn’t killing people, they’re not an immediate threat for BD to take care of. That “prevent healing/guarding on them” doesn’t do much either since you can’t effectively communicate with the Cult/Unseen.</p>
<p>3: All it takes is one bad lynch for both of you to lose. That would cause a weird paradigm where two rivals are trying to make the other look good during the day so they can kill at night. Not a fan of this one.</p>
<p>Overall thoughts: Maybe but probably not, no, and no.</p>
