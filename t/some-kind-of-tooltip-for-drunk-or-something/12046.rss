    <title>Some kind of tooltip for drunk... or something</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/some-kind-of-tooltip-for-drunk-or-something/12046</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the mass increase in players or what... but I&#39;ve been seeing a huge influx of people who think this is a role playing game or something, of which people getting the role of drunk think it means they are supposed to act like the biggest idiot possible. Almost universally getting beared, wasting princes exes, killing knights etc...

Maybe some kind of tip of the day that says &quot;regardless of what your role is, you should always put the goal of winning as your current team above any kind of *roleplay*.</description>
