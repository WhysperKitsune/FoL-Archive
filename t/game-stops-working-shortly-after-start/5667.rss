    <title>Game stops working shortly after start</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/game-stops-working-shortly-after-start/5667</link>
    <description>I just bought the game and after starting the game (both versions) crash shortly after the first sequence.                        (No error message whatsoever, game just stops working.) 

Well and since im kinda stupid when it comes to game crashes I figured I´ll just ask here. And when nothing comes out I can still refund.

I appreciate any help :)</description>

            <p>OH! You mean the game says it’s not responding while loading the login screen? If that’s the case, many people have this “issue” but it’s just unity loading its libraries. So that basically is not a really big issue, you shouldn’t have problems during the game it’s most likely just that you have low specs.</p>

<p>Post the crash dumps if you have them, or the output log if you don’t, might help narrow down what happened when the devs see this.</p>
