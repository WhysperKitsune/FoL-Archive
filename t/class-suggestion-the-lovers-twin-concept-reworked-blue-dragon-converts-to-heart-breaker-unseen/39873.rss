    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Lovers - Twin Concept Reworked! (Blue Dragon) converts to Heart Breaker (Unseen)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-lovers-twin-concept-reworked-blue-dragon-converts-to-heart-breaker-unseen/39873</link>
    <description>This is my attempt and bringing back the &quot;twin&quot; dynamic... but not in a creepy way. They aren&#39;t related, anymore. XD

There would be two Lovers in a round, never more or less.

This is based on the &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot;, IE: Romeo &amp; Juliet, etc. It also borrows one ability from a previous suggestion of mine, but that&#39;s not very important.

You will immediately know the identity of the other Lover. (Heart icon next to their name, like the &quot;X&quot; the Scorned sees.)

----

**Lover** - Blue Dragon (Alternate names: &quot;Lovebird&quot;, &quot;Soulmate&quot;.)

Passive 1:
**With A Kiss I Die** - If the other Lover dies by any means, you will die the following night.

Passive 2:
**For Better or Worse** - Conversion immune unless there is room for 2 new members, at which point you and the other Lover will both be converted. (For example: The picked player becomes Assassin, the other becomes &quot;Heart Breaker&quot;.)

Day Ability 1:
**Secret Rendezvous** - Talk to the other Lover that night. (2 uses. So 4 uses between you.)

Day Ability 2:
**Jealous Gaze** - See the classes that visit the other Lover that night. Not player names, just classes. IE: &quot;LoverNameHere was visited by: Sheriff, Scorned.&quot; (2 uses. So 4 uses between you.)

Night Ability 1:
**Defy the Stars** - Guard the other lover, killing anyone who attacks them, but only if both of you use the ability on the same night. Ignores murder immunity. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Sweet Sorrow** - Heal the other lover, preventing murder and removing bleeding/poison, but only if both of you use the ability on the same night. (3 uses.)

----

The Lover is a sort of &quot;mixed bag&quot; class. You can try to figure things out together like an investigative class using &quot;Jealous Gaze&quot;, and you can try to &quot;bait&quot; people to attack, then use &quot;Defy the Stars&quot; as if you were a killing class. All the while, you&#39;re basically trying to keep a separate goal going (other Lover stays alive) like a reversed Scorned.

----

Converts to...

----

**Heart Breaker** - Unseen (Alternate name: &quot;Heartbroken&quot;.)

Passive:
**Overly Attached** - If the player who was formerly the other Lover dies by any means (be he Assassin or whatever else, now), you will die the following night. The reverse situation does not kill the other former Lover.

Day Ability:
**Sweet Nothings** - Select a player to secretly stop them from receiving whispers for the rest of the day. Everyone sees the whispers occurring except the target. Example: Whispering to the target will seem normal, but the target won&#39;t know it happened. (4 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**A House Divided** - Prevent members of Blue Dragon from visiting your target. Useful for keeping BD from saving someone, stopping BD from visiting a member of the Unseen, etc. Doesn&#39;t stop Neutrals or fellow Unseen from visiting your target. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Love &#39;Em &amp; Leave &#39;Em** - Occupy a target player and reveal who they were trying to visit to the Unseen. (4 uses.)</description>

            <p>The concept is really cool, but I wonder if the 2 people keeping each other alive theme isn’t more suited for a neutral? Something like a win condition that is basically 2 mercenaries tied to each other?</p>
<p>For Better or Worse is also a tad imbalanced in cult/unseen games, however that also depends on the type you assign, since 2 ritualists is insane compared to 2 apostles in the early game for instance.</p>

            <p>Easier way to think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If one of the Lovers becomes the Assassin, he’s just a normal Assassin.</li>
<li>The other Lover becomes a Heart Breaker, who dies if that Assassin does.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Whats the converted version? And how would conversions work with this class in general? Also I would just make Day ability 1 part of passive 1 instead. That way it would work like the noble twin passive.</p>
