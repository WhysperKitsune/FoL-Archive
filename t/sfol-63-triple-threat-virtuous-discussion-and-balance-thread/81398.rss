Phase Length:

[color = steblue] **Heroine** [/color] = [color = goldenrod] **Champion** [/color] = Scum Killer

Game Setup: 26 players

(3 BD, 3 HoB, King, 19 Unseen)

**All Unique Non-Neutral Non-King Classes besides Duke, Torturer, Prince, and Warden will have Prestige, and as such only up to three of them can roll at the start of the game. If the starting convert class is rolled as a Prestige class, this would contribute to the limit of 3. An Unseen Prestige class and its scum convert equivalent cannot both roll as starting classes in the same game; i.e. no spawning of both Archivist and Librarian at the start, etc. Prince and Warden cannot spawn as the starting convert class.**

**If a Blue Dragon or Hand of Byzantium class can be converted into from an Unseen class with Prestige, then that convert class also has Prestige for the purposes of factoring into the starting convert, regardless of whether or not that convert class itself is unique (as for most classes, two different unseen classes convert into the same BD or HoB class, and sometimes one of those Unseen classes has Prestige and the other does not). This means that there are a few more BD and HoB classes with Prestige each than Unseen, as unlike with the unseen, a BD or HoB class does not need to be unique to have Prestige, just be a convert class of at least one Unseen class which itself has Prestige.**

**The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert starting Night 2, and all conversions have a 2-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to four members at a time.**

**Lynches will be majority and plurality enabled.**

**The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Royal Pardon and on who.**

**&quot;No Lynch&quot; is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer &quot;No Lynch&quot; to end the day early without a lynch. If No Lynch is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.**

**Any time I use the word &quot;antithetical&quot; in reference to altering investigative results, this is what I mean:**
Any alignment check equals a greencheck, unless it would normally be a greencheck, in which case it becomes a redcheck.
For typing checks:
Killer = Social
Offensive = Investigative
Investigative = Killer
Support = Offensive
Social = Special
Special = Support
Anything else is up to my discretion.

No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. 

Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.

<p>And yes, this version of chrono can’t move other people’s deaths. Which is also good, because there is already plenty of KP to go around.</p>
