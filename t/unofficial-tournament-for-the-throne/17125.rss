**Tournament for the Throne**

**TLDR**
I am holding a tournament on Twitch .tv/ lunamink and am looking for participants. The first round will be held 12/2/17 5 pm (PST) and cash prizes will be distributed for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. 

**Introduction:** 
Hey, fellow Throne of Lies players! I am excited to announce the first ever (maybe) unofficial Throne Of Lies Tournament: Tournament for the Throne. Throughout my gaming career, I have always had a love for watching and participating in the competitive scenes of the particular games I was playing. Unfortunately for games like Town Of Salem, Mafia, Werewolf, and now Throne Of Lies, there has never been a highly competitive online scene. I am hoping this tournament allows the best of the best to compete at a high level, on a fair playing field. So if you think you got what it takes to win it all, you can join below!</description>

            <p>I’m Just going to respond to everyone’s questions in this one message to reduce spam (will make it easier to follow for new people coming in):</p>
<p><strong>Satan:</strong> Yes to both examples and I’ll make that clear in the rules. I think assassin turned MM in the first three days has an incredibly hard game ahead of them and if they can survive until the end they deserve some extra credit.</p>
<p>Ya I would also agree that inquisitor looks a lot easier and I’ll be honest I have not done the math to accurately attribute points to those roles because their so new. I’m hoping they don’t show up <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Names can be looked at in two ways. I think there is an element of skill to naming yourself but you can also use it to cheat. For now, I don’t want to be too controlling on the player so I think custom names are okay (unless the players all want this of course),</p>
<p><strong>Orangeandblack5</strong>: I would agree I’m not thrilled with the current state of King + these two magic neutral roles being so new. The structure of this tournament was not built in this patch, it actually was built when priest was still around, so things will have to change. Maybe by the time this tournament gets rolling (the 2nd) there is some work done to the King.</p>
<p>Ya my extreme rules were more a way to just scare away people who saw free money and weren’t going to take it seriously. I will be understanding if something happens that is bigger than the game, don’t worry.</p>
<p>I am set on this being a thing but i’m not set on this being the perfect structure for it. I don’t want to bother the community managers/ devs with an unfinished/ unprofessional product. I want this tournament to be really good and this first one is more meant to show the potential of these type of events, so I have some evidence when talking to the people in charge.</p>
<p><strong>Peachly + Ben_Pollard</strong>: So I knew time was going to be an issue regardless of when I scheduled it. If there is enough people signing up for this, lets say we go down format 2, I would love to have an EU game time and a US game time. If there are a lot of people who want to play December 2nd might not be your game time.</p>
<p>The schedule is never official and once I know all the participant’s timezone/ availability I will make changes. So I would say if your interested but your time zone sucks for what I have currently still sign up because it will most likely be changed.</p>
<p>Thanks guys for all the responses/ questions, I have put a lot of time into this and I want to make it the best experience it can be. So your suggestions/criticism is always welcome.</p>

            <p>Ya, conversions were the biggest issue I came across when mapping out this tournament. It really messed with some of the math and I’ve tried to think of some solutions, if you are converted two days before cult/unseen losses they still are given .5 points, but it always ended up being too objective.</p>
<p>For now, in your example, the observer wouldn’t receive any points and I would agree If I was that player I would feel robbed of my well-deserved victory.</p>
<p>I’m open to suggestions on how to fix this because I do see it as a  major flaw in the balance of my point based system.</p>

            <p>I’d love to participate but I’m in Europe. Therefore I ask you to rearrange the time to something like 7:30 pm <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/clock730.png?v=9" title=":clock730:" class="emoji" alt=":clock730:"> (PST).<br>
Only if there are enough european participants of course.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry I meant it’s better for european players if the tournament begins earlier than 5pm (PST), <strong>not later</strong> as I mentioned above.</p>

            <p>I’m with Sketch, I don’t see any way to make this point-based system work given conversion being a major factor in the game.</p>
<p>Plus, I’m not convinced that 1.0.10 is the best version to play this on. Everybody will just sheep the King anyways.</p>
<p>Also you should add a way out for people who are sick or have something come up irl. A permanent blacklist for anybody who misses their game seems a little but excessive.</p>
<p>Plus, if you’re set on this being a thing, why not talk to Boslof about making a special PTR variant with no Scorned/Fool/Inquisitor/Sorceror or any other changes you want to make. They’ve been really streamer-friendly so far, the worst he could do is say no lol</p>

            <p>“MasterMind: 2*(Must survive entire game)”<br>
Can you specify if MM turns to assassin then wins does that count and also if MM dies and assassin becomes MM does that count as MM win.</p>
<p>having the sorcerer and inquisitor on the same level is a bit odd, the inquisitor seems to be way easier. I’ve not played enough games to know for sure but other people seem to agree.</p>
<p>I would also suggest a rule for no one to have custom names to make it as fair as possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Tournament for the Throne</strong></p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong><br>
I am holding a tournament on Twitch .tv/ lunamink and am looking for participants. The first round will be held 12/2/17 5 pm (PST) and cash prizes will be distributed for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
Hey, fellow Throne of Lies players! I am excited to announce the first ever (maybe) unofficial Throne Of Lies Tournament: Tournament for the Throne. Throughout my gaming career, I have always had a love for watching and participating in the competitive scenes of the particular games I was playing. Unfortunately for games like Town Of Salem, Mafia, Werewolf, and now Throne Of Lies, there has never been a highly competitive online scene. I am hoping this tournament allows the best of the best to compete at a high level, on a fair playing field. So if you think you got what it takes to win it all, you can join below!</p>
