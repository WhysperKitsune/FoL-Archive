    <title>[Class Suggestion] - The Warlock - Neutral Killer</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-warlock-neutral-killer/60573</link>
    <description>**Goal:** Generic NK goal

**New mechanic:** **_Banish_** - This works similarly to Town of Salem&#39;s Janitor. The target will be &#39;cleaned&#39;. For thematic purposes I went with banishing the target to another realm.

For those that get banished, the game will display an empty room with &#39;X has gone missing&#39;. This gives away that a Warlock is in play, but given the ability to &#39;clean&#39; someone is so powerful the trade-off is fair.
______________
**Passive 1:** Portal Trap - The first person that tries to attack you will be banished. This includes being caught by guarding abilities that kill the attacker. Their attack will **not** apply.
**Passive 2:** Wizard&#39;s Resolve - Immune to occupation and target changing.

**Day Ability 1:** Prepared Ritual - You will have access to the journal of the next person you banish. **2 uses.**

**Night Ability 1:** Banish - Send your target to another realm. Their class and journal will be forever lost. Cannot be healed. **Unlimited uses.**
**Night Ability 2:** Nether Flame - Fire corrupted flames at your target, killing them. Does not count as a visit. **3 uses.** (Useful to stall out revealing to BD what kind of NK it is or making logs public).
_______________
**Lore:** A former Court Wizard cast out for his perverse magical experiments, the Warlock will use the Court that turned their back on him as his very own test site for his newly discovered spells.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>With how I’ve adjusted the wording, the single time night immunity is separate from the trap.</p>
<p>What I wanted was the trap to ‘banish’ any attacker before the attack takes place which is why I originally did not give the class single time night immunity. I imagine no such mechanic currently exists.</p>
<p>Banish would behave similarly to an Reaper attack.  It can’t be healed but night immune classes are safe.</p>

            <p>There is no wording that can accomplish that. Rebound and Bear both attack you without visiting you.</p>
<p>Also the Knight instance would need to crosskill because Knight bypasses Immunitys and Prevention (but not healing). Same with bear.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not sure how to word it to cover <em>any</em> lethal action targeting you. So you would kill a Knight guarding your target as they are attacking you. Same for Merc Rebound.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t work for Hunter though given it’s supposed to be the bear attacking you in terms of ability. This would expend the trap’s single use and result in no deaths on anyone’s part.</p>

            <p>It absolutely needs to say. Afterall different forms of protection are bypassed by different kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>Ex: Night Immunity stops CoD but visit Prevention does not. Reap bypasses heal and empower bypasses heal and immunity but neither of those bypass Prevention. Possessor bypasses Occupy, Sorcerer holds back against immunity but not healing. ECT ECT ECT</p>

<p>It does. They are banished before the attack takes place. It’s a one time defense. I clarify that the class doesn’t have night immunity because after this trap has been triggered, they are vulnerable.</p>
<p>Edited the wording slightly to clarify.</p>
