    <title>These people are the worst</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/these-people-are-the-worst/10093</link>
    <description>The guys that watch other people choose names and then make a name that is a slight variation of somebody else&#39;s. 

I&#39;m cool with themes. 

But not slightly changing somebody&#39;s name and making it theirs. I don&#39;t know why that bothers me but it does haha

That is why I wait till 3 seconds left to hit enter</description>
