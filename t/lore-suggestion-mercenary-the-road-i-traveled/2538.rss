    <title>[Lore Suggestion] (Mercenary) The Road I Traveled</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/lore-suggestion-mercenary-the-road-i-traveled/2538</link>
    <description>I only found myself present for Castle Adiart&#39;s crisis by chance. I had answered the call of a guard for someone who feared an assassin may be out to get them, and thought to myself that it would be easy gold. Now that I am present in the court, I understand their fear, as I experience it too. The road I traveled may have perhaps lead me to my death, as unlike most in the court, I don&#39;t have many allies, and anyone except my contractor may very well want to kill me. It takes experience to truly understand the fear of not knowing if you will live another day, and I can&#39;t say I&#39;m better of with that experience.</description>
