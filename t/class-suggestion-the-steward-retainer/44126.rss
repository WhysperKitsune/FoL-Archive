    <description>The Steward - BD Offensive
Passive: Persistent - Occupy and Redirect immune.

Day Ability: Confound - Disable the targets day Ability&#39;s for the rest of the day. They are not notified until they try to use a day Ability. It still consumes a use of the ability they were trying to use. (3 uses)

Night Ability: Lead - Redirect your first target to your second. You cannot make your target visit you or themselves. (Unlimited)

The Retainer - Unseen Offensive
Passive: Persistent - Occupy and Redirect immune.

Day Ability: Confound - Disable the targets day Ability&#39;s for the rest of the day. They are not notified until they try to use a day Ability. It still consumes a use of the ability they were trying to use.(3 uses)

Night Ability: Lead - Redirect your first target to your second. You cannot make your target visit you or themselves. (Unlimited)

Note: Confound CAN target the king. I would pair this with the suggestion of making Bewilder able to target non-kings and be just as silent.</description>

            <p>Fabricate seems OP. Especially if it doesn’t have any of the other limitations that I gave lead. Falcify doesn’t seem to have any real utility as most day Ability’s are untargeted and the ones that aren’t aren’t the kinds of things that should be redirectable for balence reasons.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was actually originally thinking of giving it 3 uses. Your idea about the limited uses seems good as I actually didn’t consider that. I think a better buff would be to give it feedback.</p>

For BD it can stop people from poisoning and stops king from getting Prince’s and such decide fate exed.</p>

            <p>I like the idea, but it could use another ability or two.  Here’s a few ideas:<br>
Fabricate(night)(name isn’t final) (2 uses) - Redirect your first target to your second.  Bypasses redirection immunity.  Your target will not be told that they were redirected.</p>
<p>Falsify(day)(name isn’t final)(2 uses) - If your first target uses a day ability, then they will instead use it on your second target.  They will not be notified that they were redirected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Day Ability: Confound - Disable the targets day Ability’s for the rest of the day. They are not notified until they try to use a day Ability. (2 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like the idea, but this is a bit underpowered on its own.  Make it so it also stops voting and accusing.  And possibly speaking as well if that wouldn’t be too OP.  The same changes should be made to bewilder.<br>
Also, if the day ability they use is limited use, would it still consume a use?</p>
