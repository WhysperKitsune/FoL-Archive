            <p>Go for it. I’d like to see how you can improve upon this. Adding BD/Unseen classes is much harder work than Neuts.</p>

            <p>Also the convert is super weak and the second ability can’t be disproven as the unseen doesn’t have it.</p>
<p>For a high skill ability make it so that you can show all visitors to a target BUT you can add some visits like your assassin thus “confirming” your assassin as a knight and allow them to remove certain people from showing they visited to frame someone.</p>

            <p>The class is still super weak overall and IMO buff both the abilties as right now it’s a weaker court wizard.</p>
<p>The royal blood is fine though.</p>

            <p>I included this ability since it’s not you receiving the information, it’s the person you’re targeting. Remember, Paladin has an ability that kills the CL if they try to convert them or their target, that’s not investigative, bit the Paladin is. Sometimes there are overlaps with the class types.</p>
