    <title>Option to Save Games</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/option-to-save-games/33158</link>
    <description>Sometimes when I have amazing games, I want a way to save it even if I wasn&#39;t recording. It would be a nice feature for us to be able to save games and go back through what happened. Even just being able to download a txt file of everything that happened would be nice. I absolutely love the game by the way.


Thanks!</description>

            <p>I agree with this. Even just a text log of the chat box (including all visible messages to me, abilities/accusations/executes/etc) saved in some folder would be great.</p>
