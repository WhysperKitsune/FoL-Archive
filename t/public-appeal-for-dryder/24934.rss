            <p>Yes, I was making a point. I don’t actually believe you should kill all CW, I was pointing out a flaw in your argument.</p>
<p>After reviewing the logs again, I conclude he should be banned because people asking to be killed are really annoying</p>

            <p>He was pretty clearly game throwing when he was Court Wizard. When he got voted King (not sure why they voted him in; kind of mind boggling to be honest) he more or less stopped throwing. Seems that he was throwing because of his class, specifically, and when he got a class (King) he actually wanted to play, he started playing to win.</p>
<p>Verdict is <strong>Guilty</strong></p>

            <p>Even if it would work it also would lead people to think you are ritualist or sage. You get hung over it and then the person who accused you (probably a phys) is killed too for pushing you or for being converted. Or he gets converted without dying.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it was gamethrowing per say but he WAS trying to die so he could leave. In other words he was trying to get around the whole “no leaving early while alive”. Asking to be killed is aloud because being killed is more obviously bad. He was however still being toxic anyways.</p>

            <p>Actually no he didn’t. First time he was in jail. A Ritualist swapped him. Secondly, allowing someone to bleed out is not gamethrowing, as maybe he thought 16 was lying/evil - or maybe he wanted to protect himself. He’s an idiot, sure - but it’s not throwing.</p>

            <p>Did you read it? He said 16 will not get healed…he swapped him two nights in a row. You can’t ask to be killed either…</p>
<p>(Alive) Lliill [10] (Ray - Court Wizard): 16 i can assure u<br>
Alive) Lliill [10] (Ray - Court Wizard): u will not get a heal tonight<br>
System to Lliill [10] (Ray - Court Wizard)): You will swap Lliill [10] with Murphy [16] tonight.</p>
<p>Also he hung a clear inq when 1 pointed out who the sorc is.</p>
<p>Ritualist swapped first night. He swapped second. INTENTIONALLY to throw.</p>
<p>He is a toxic player</p>

            <p>It’s in the rules saying you can’t ask to be converted. Killed isn’t the same, I’m pretty sure. He claimed to Prince and actually won - just played badly. Maybe he didn’t realise 16 needed healing (I swear I saw cult switching 16 away from heals too tbh)</p>
