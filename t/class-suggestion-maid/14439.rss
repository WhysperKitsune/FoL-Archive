            <p>That is why Im probably going to change it to a journal peek or change the abilty entirely. Most likely into the “See two players who used day abilities at the end of the day” or “See all players who used day abilities at the end of the day” would actually help out BD and execute assassins/cult leaders if they arent careful with the bleeds/poisons.</p>
<p>Edit: me no like how my threads close</p>

<p>Its only for trolling to be honest. Only helpful when destroying some fake “evidence” cough cough Mastermind cough and can get people executed quickly. Might change to neutral and make it a psychotic maid. Or I could change the journal clear into a journal peek. Either way, psychotic maid still sounds nice. Other option is to make the maid be able to know who used Day Abilities at the end of the day. Doesnt tell classes, just names. Would be able to out the Assassin if they arent careful.</p>
