    <title>[Class suggestion]:The Dragon</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-dragon/2685</link>
    <description>Here was my original suggestion for the contest. it wasn&#39;t accepted as it includes the swordbearer, that isn&#39;t a neutral killer. 

**The Dragon (Neutral Killer)**
Passive: it&#39;s a fuckin&#39; dragon: If the dragon is in the game, everyone will be notified of who the dragon is. The swordbearer will also be in the game. The dragon cannot be put on trial, or be targeted by day abilities. He cannot talk in the day chat. He will not be shown at the table. The dragon cannot be killed, exept by the Sword. The dragon cannot be converted.

**Night Ability 1: Eat alive (infinite uses)** 
Attack your target. If you didn&#39;t use &quot;eat alive&quot; last night, this attack bypasses night immunity. you will eat alive anyone that occupies you.
**Night Ability 2: Spew fire (1 use)**
Attack your target and everyone that visits them. this does not bypass immunity.
**Day Ability 1: Roar (infinite uses)**
Send a message to everyone. if you didn&#39;t use roar yesterday, no day ability can be used. this cannot be used in the first minute of the day.
Goal: Kill every blue dragon, unseen, cult and neutral killers.


**The Swordbearer (Neutral Wildcard)**
Passive:  If the swordbearer dies, his killer will gain the sword. the killer will then be able to kill the dragon, and his attacks will now bypass night immunity. If the swordbearer was executed, the prince will get the sword and &quot;slay&quot; night ability, or if he was lynched, the king gains the sword and the &quot;slay&quot; (attack your target) night ability. If the swordbearer&#39;s killer dies, a random killer or the king will obtain the sword. If the dragon has the sword, anyone visiting him at night will get the sword and &quot;slay&quot; night ability.
**Night Ability 1: Use the Sword (1 use)**
Anyone visiting you will die. this bypasses night immunity. you are night immune this turn.
**Day Ability 1: Contact The greater.**
You can send a short message to the dragon.
**Day Ability 2: Hypnotise**
The Sword&#39;s gem hypnotises your target, occupying them tonight.
Goal: Survive.
My first ever class made. It might be way too good for a neutral~ i don&#39;t really know that much about balancing.
be sure to dissect  it and destroy any remains of confidence i have left.
And yes, i know it&#39;s a confusing mess. i realised it now~ and i&#39;ll try to make it clearer.</description>

</aside>
<p>i knew some people wouldn’t understand.<br>
Imagine the swordbearer gets killed by a reaper.<br>
the reaper itself gets the sword, and his normal attack can now kill the dragon, and bypasses immunity. (so there’s no more need for gather darkness)</p>
