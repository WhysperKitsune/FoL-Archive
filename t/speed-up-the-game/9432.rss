    <title>Speed up the game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/speed-up-the-game/9432</link>
    <description>I recently made a post about the days being too short, but i also realized something: The game waste tons of time.

As a simple example, lets say 4 people died in the night, the game will often spend like 90 seconds showing you the deaths. That&#39;s almost longer than the day itself.

I would be in favor of making days a bit longer (2 minutes), but instead let us read the logs by ourselves. Maybe 1 of the dudes was a fool and has an empty log, no need to look at it for 15 seconds. But maybe the sheriff died with detailled notes died and 15 seconds is not enough to read his will.

I have the same comment for the executions. the whole process tends to take a while. Maybe just quickly let him have his last words, show a quick animation, and thats it.</description>

<p>idk, if the days were too long it would be harder for cult/unseen/neutral killers. I think the days are well timed right now but maybe it can at the very least check if a log is empty and not show those and also never show death notes because those arnt essential for info(and only take a second to look at). It could also not show cult/unseen/neutral killers journals as those will only consist of fake journals/useless info 99% of the time.</p>
<p>perhaps the death note could be smaller and shown at the same time as the journal as that’s all you really need.</p>

<p>That makes sense. I like that suggestion too</p>

            <p>The days are only too long if there are no leads. Maybe everybody could check that they’re ready to end the day. And if everybody that’s alive clicks that they’re ready the clock could go to zero. Or something along the lines of the concept.</p>
<p>Cuz sometimes you need the whole day if there are a lot of leads and questions.</p>

            <p>People who don’t want to read logs won’t read them anyways. Trying to force them to is a bad idea. When the devs add ranked this should be fixed.</p>
<p>I just get annoyed when the gamer show me the fool’s empty log for like 20 seconds but then the day goes ultra fast.</p>

            <p>Idea: Just tell people if they left logs and show the Death Note, and that’ll be it. Maybe remind people to check them in  the notification.</p>

            <p>Your suggestion is definetly better than what it is right now. But personally i kinda dislike this “force read log thing”. Just increase the lenght of the days and let people read the log themself. Sometimes you just don’t care about reading that fool’s log.</p>

            <p>How about tying the amount of time a log is show to how many lines are written in it? Early deaths and empty logs would take significantly less time to disappear and longer ones will give adequate time to pick out information.</p>
<p>This also means early game you don’t need to sit there for 2 minutes when you can get through the logs in seconds.</p>

            <p>I kind of like the longer death thing. Gives us time to read logs. I’m always disappointed by how bad peoples’ logs have been in my last few games though.</p>

            <p>I agree, this whole dead process take too much time.<br>
It should take the same time regardless of how many people died.</p>
<p>And one more thing, every time a player get disconected or reconected the game just get stucked for like 2 minutes. i don’t think you should stop the game for that.</p>
