    <title>Hunter Retribution Ability is Broken</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/hunter-retribution-ability-is-broken/19022</link>
    <description>Hunter&#39;s retribution ability counts the first accuse of the entire day, not of the of the current round of votes that gets the hunter up.

We had a game where a suspicious person offered to be the first to accuse to prove his point.

We all pardoned and he was accused but it didn&#39;t kill him, it killed the previous person.

This feels like a bug. 

If it&#39;s the intended behavior then the wording of Retribution should be changed.</description>

            <p>King accuses Hunter. Hunter gets on the stand. Everybody pardons. Hunter returns to the table.</p>
<p>Paladin says that he’s sure the Hunter is evil and will take the arrow on the King’s behalf.</p>
<p>Everybody re-votes the Hunter up the stand with Paladin accusing first.</p>
<p>King dies.</p>
<hr>
<p>If this is the intended behavior the text for retribution should be changed.</p>
<p><em>Currently:</em></p>
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: If found guilty of treason, kill your accuser before your execution.</p>
<p><em>Suggested:</em></p>
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: If found guilty of treason, kill the first person to accuse you that day.</p>

            <p>Trying to understand which way you mean it went (bob being the hunter in these examples)</p>
<p>Jane accuses bob. They vote to pardon bob. Sam accuses bob, they execute jane dies.</p>
<p>With that version it is a bit silly but I don’t see it as misleading mechanically.</p>
<p>On the other hand. if you mean</p>
<p>Jane accuses mary, mary accuses bob. bob is executed. Jane dies. Then yes that is just plain broken and needs fixed.</p>
