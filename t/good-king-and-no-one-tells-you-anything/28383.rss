    <title>Good king and no one tells you anything</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/good-king-and-no-one-tells-you-anything/28383</link>
    <description>So I was a good king and received one whisper of a hunter claiming for the entire game and I was trying to get across that I needed more info as I literally all I knew was the hunter claim and the people I checked with blue dragons.  How am I supposed to get people to be more willing to whisper me stuff? And before you suggest random picking someone to up for logs I will just say I have seen this out the prince ALOT so I am not a big fan of this personally.</description>

            <p>To some extent, sometimes you just end up with a crappy cowardly BD…</p>
<p>but IMO one of the better tricks to use, every day say “OK everyone whisper me nonsense if you have nothing, and if you have a lead please give it to me”.</p>
<p>For an investigative, it generally defeats the point of whispering a lead to the king… if they are the only whisper… as they might as well call it out loud. if you are getting 10 no matter what, they are less afraid to give you the info.</p>
