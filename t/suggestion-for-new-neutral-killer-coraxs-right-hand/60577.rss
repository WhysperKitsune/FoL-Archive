    <description>The Disciple (starts with 1 favour)

Win condition: Survive to see all the major factions eradicated.

Passive
Corax&#39;s favour
The disciple&#39;s life is tied to their master&#39;s favour, making them immune to most about everything. (Death, poison / bleed, occupy and target change immunity) If the gatekeeper loses all of Corax&#39;s favour, (loses one favour when attacked) they lose the immunity.

Day Abilities
Umbral gate (2 favour)
Opens a void which summons creatures from another world to drag the target to oblivion, removing any known information about the target. (whch includes name, class and logs)
Everyone in the court will be notified. If the target isnt guarded or defended, the target gets dragged in.

Corax&#39;s presence (3 favours)
Activate to drop the day counter to the last 5 seconds, preventing any further action from the court.

Night Abilities
Blood sacrifice
Sacrifices the target to Corax, gaining their favour (receives 1 favour)

Marked (2 favour)
The disciple chooses 3 targets for Corax to devour. Those marked will be devoured the next day. Defends, guards and prince&#39;s jail prevents the target from being marked. When the day the marks activate, only those who are succesfully marked will be killed, unless healed or having death immunity.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Does the removal happen at night? When does the notification occur?<br>
The notification occurs as soon as the player clicks on the icon in the day cycle, which writes: “A ghastly bell chimes in the halls.” If the targeted player is not guarded or barriered that same night, everything about the target is removed.</p>
<p>Does this prevent voting as well? This seems pretty expensive since you only get one favour per blood sacrifice.<br>
It doesn’t prevent voting. Makes the game more interesting like that, as ppl will usually random vote or become sheep in this situation. Maybe I’ll up the starting favour value.</p>
<p>Does Blood Sacrifice bypass guard/barriers?<br>
No it doesn’t. If the target is healed, they don’t get sacrificed too.</p>
<p>When specifically does Marked devour the targets?<br>
When the player first press the marked icon,  the<br>
three targets that he chose will be marked. Marking the player goes through immunity. The next night however, if the targets aren’t defended or barriered, they will die. (Devoured)</p>
<p>How do these abilities interact with healing and death immunity?<br>
Healing is kinda useless to fight against this NK except for preventing a sacrifice. Which means that barriers and guards are more useful for fighting against this NK. All the abilities don’t go through death immunity, sadly. Means that mm and immune neuts would be the biggest challenge for this class.</p>
