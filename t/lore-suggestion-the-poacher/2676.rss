    <description># The Poacher 

_The Hunter and his Wolf companion would roam endlessly through countless skirmishes and quickly became the deadliest weapon among the Blue Dragon and it&#39;s court. However, it all seemed like it wasn&#39;t enough to him, as he wanted more. The Mastermind could offer more._ 

_The Unseen had once captured a Bear they could not tame, however, the Hunter had that capability. It was an easy task to tempt the Hunter into the Unseen and eventually, he was converted. Upon joining the Unseen, he would tame the giant Bear and would go on to offer the Wolf as a tribute to the Mastermind. However, he saw no need for the Wolf, as the Bear was much more powerful to them. So, the Wolf was soon released back into the wilderness. Some say he whimpers by the castle gates, hoping his master will return._ 

_The newly named Poacher would alter his tools as well. Turning his deadly spiked traps into harmless snares that would trap his victims rather than causing fatal wounds. With his new abilities at his disposal, he had that extra power he so desired._</description>
