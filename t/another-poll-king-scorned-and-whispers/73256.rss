</aside>
<p>As long as it doesn’t mean forcing the king to finger, then I’m fine tbh. I kinda assumed Burrito meant he could make king vote and double vote… I should probably sleep tbh</p>

            <p>Basically something that makes the odds of the meta failing &gt;50% (combined. So 40% + Starting Apostle odds + Noble N1 convert odds right now)</p>

            <p>That would be a better approach. Something like that, and NK buff or a MM/Assassin buff would be solutions</p>

            <p>An anti-whisper NE could be added.  IMO there should be a NE that makes each confirmable BD class suspicious(Like how sellsword already does this for Mercenary and Butler)(And separate NEs, not one)</p>

            <p>FYI. That rework is great and all but is also too statistically unlikely to actually matter in order to be a threat to the meta</p>

            <p>Here’s a possible solution: <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/noble-and-aristocrat-rework-v3/71943">My Noble and aristocrat rework</a><br>
It would discourage whispering to a single player while not making king boring or destroying whispers in general.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t fix the problem with whispers though, which is when people only whisper one player.  That would just discourage whispering to multiple players, which should be encouraged and not discouraged</p>

            <p>Whispers to or from the king should never be disabled.  Being able to whisper is the only thing that makes king fun, it would be boring if the king couldn’t send or receive whispers.  And limiting whispers is also not the correct solution.  The problem with whispers is when people only whisper one player, not whispers in general.  This would still happen if whispers were limited(and it would discourage all types of whispering).  Find another solution(like adding more abilities to read whispers).</p>
