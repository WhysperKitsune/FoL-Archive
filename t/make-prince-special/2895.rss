    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/make-prince-special/2895</link>
    <description>While this won&#39;t change very much gameplay wise it fits to have the Prince be special rather than Killer. Sure he does kill but so does the Cult leader. This would also buff the Seeker and Duchess as now they can find the Prince and know that he is the Prince 100%. It also means that the Prince is more likely to be voted up if invested by the princesses as Special/Invest is a sus result.</description>

            <p>There are ways to play around it such as claiming that the other person is full of shit, claiming framed, claiming to be a Hunter/Knight, If your a poss then you can hop to the body of someone else next night. The scorned would probably use the sus of the result to its advantage so you can claim that the princess is a scorned. There is counter play to it and claiming prince was NEVER an option.</p>

            <p>I disagree Norm.</p>
<p>The Prince is there to socialize with it’s prisoners and gather information during the night. The Killing is secondary, in my opinion. He could go a whole game without ever having to kill.</p>
<p>It’s called Blue Dragon Killing because it has that ability.</p>

            <p>I have also thought that the Prince should be considered a “Special” class. It fits into the context of the game as a whole now… even more so now that they changed the Paladin/ Sheriff.</p>
<p>Reasons Special Type makes sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The (Cult Leader/ Mastermind) and Prince are all 3 unique classes that appear in every game. They are the “leaders” of their class.</li>
<li>Each faction would have their one “Special” class</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no reason for this. The point of “special” is it can’t be put in the other categories well; prince is obviously a killer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This logic does not hold up… since the Cult Leader is also a “killer”. The ability to kill is not override any other characteristics. Nobody else is unconvertable, straight up occupy someone, and chose to kill them. That all sounds pretty special to me.</p>

            <ol>
<li>why do you necessarily want seeker and duchess to be more valuable?</li>
<li>why do we want to make it harder for MM? He has to fake princess, and can be outed by them demanding he step up for king as royal.</li>
</ol>
<p>keep in mind that MM has to fake princeliness for a lot of nights. It needs to be convincing, so putting information already known can get you killed.</p>
<p>There is no reason for this. The point of “special” is it can’t be put in the other categories well; prince is obviously a killer.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would disagree that making killer/off more sus and making the prince easier for the evils to find is a bad thing. For one it makes the Duchess and the Seeker more valuable to the Unseen/Cult. Second of all it can make things a bit harder for an MM claiming princess. If your not sure what I’m talking about then consider which roles are unconvertible to the unseen. The Sheriff(Invest), Alch(Support), Prince(Killer), Fool(Wildcard), Scorned(Wildcard), Poss(Killer), Reaper(Killer). Normally when someone can’t be converted you can just claim they are Killer/Offensive and 9 times out of 10 they are or they out as sheriff/alch by the time it matters. A Prince is less likely to out and thus can add more uncertainty to things. In the current update things are even worse because the sheriff is convertible. This means that other than Alch (who might not even want to out you anyway) everyone you can’t convert is killer/offensive (remember that wildcard pops up in that list for some reason). Even if none of this was true it still has the benefit of allowing for BD that can find exact class types like you already said.</p>

<p>The problem is how it helps evil.</p>
<p>If there was a BD that could learn the exact type of a player, then it would be good, as it means they won’t out them in case of prince.</p>
<p>There is none, so all you are doing is making it more likely for princess to out killer/off results and are making it easier for unseen/cult</p>

            <p>The princess is not able to find the Prince 100% of the time. The Seeker and the Duchess can. This should be fine because they are evil</p>

<p>This would also buff the Seeker and Duchess as now they can find the Prince and know that he is the Prince 100%.</p>

</aside>
<p>The whole point of the investigation results is to make them not too OP. They shouldn’t be able to 100% tell. Also, You forgot the fact that they find Investigative making it also possible for it to be sheriff/paladin.</p>

            <p>While this won’t change very much gameplay wise it fits to have the Prince be special rather than Killer. Sure he does kill but so does the Cult leader. This would also buff the Seeker and Duchess as now they can find the Prince and know that he is the Prince 100%. It also means that the Prince is more likely to be voted up if invested by the princesses as Special/Invest is a sus result.</p>
