<p>Soooo you’re basically suggesting to make a Prince convertable counterpart or he can be good or evil from the start (66/33%). Maybe  it’s just me but without ANY confirmed BD in a game, it would made a situation, when some people will gonna backstab each other more often than now.If you ever saw a BD loss because of solo EK then you know to what I referring.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I’m not… I mean it should be fixed sorry if it was unclear</p>
<p>also if prince would have the same system as king then I’d nerf it a bit</p>
<p>Also what should we call him? I’m just gonna call him Duke</p>
<p>Nerfs:<br>
Evil King can’t spawn with him<br>
Sorc can’t spawn with him<br>
Unseen will start with 1 member who won’t be notified who the Duke is<br>
Duke can’t kill</p>

            <p>Seconded. Is the target NMU? Could be the Sorc who used her Magic Cloak. Is the target MU? Could be NMU while the Sorc used Magic Dust. At this point the only thing I’ve seen Inqs do right now is either kill a few BDs with Ruthless Efficiency and then die or win because BD found the Sorc on their own. At this rate I’m surprised that the meta hasn’t changed to exe every Inq claim on sight.</p>

<p>Honestly… I’d take that over the current setup anyway. I mean if inq is going to exist anyway. No class in the game has as blatently worthless results as the inq. A princess that just blanket assumes all killer/offensive’s are the NK would have a higher accuracy rating than an inq as it is right now… which wouldn’t be such a big deal… IF that weren’t the inq’s one frickin job.</p>

            <p>NKs are the answer to this. Sorc is an insane hard counter, just circle the prince and ppl die. As poss you counter knights on prince cuz you can throw ppl into the prince. Reaper can bypass heals and silence the prince so they can’t get any info that day.</p>
