    <title>[Bug] Game crashing upon opening scripted tutorial or entering a game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-game-crashing-upon-opening-scripted-tutorial-or-entering-a-game/25291</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
My game crashes to desktop whenever I open the scripted tutorial or after I pick a name in an online game. Reinstalling has not fixed the problem.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The game should not crash when entering a game or the tutorial.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Join a game or open the tutorial, and the game will crash after loading.

#### Comments:
As I cannot upload attachments here, I could upload my crash files over discord (Wortho#3133)
Here is a truncated version of my log, if it proves helpful. Could you explain to me what is going on here?
