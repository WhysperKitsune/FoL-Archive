<p>Simon ISO</p>
<p>Starts with a wall of catching up, and looking through it he claims super early one of his abilities, but then goes on to vote Bree. He does say hes less focused on reads, and it shows with how much mechanic talk is thrown out.</p>

<p>i agree with this.<br>
especially since he wants it today, when no town are dead<br>
i dont get the feeling that hammer effects are anything lasting; they’re either immediate or the night after</p>

<p>He does agree with Kai on not liking PKR, but has a distaste for Marshal and Tele from his posts like this</p>

<p>well tbf the people of this forum have a history with manipulating Universal and its my duty to not let that happen again, until they’re used to the whole thing</p>

<p>Defends Universal, but its kida based on Geydes recent clown fiesta, he was town that game</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> Overall a shit ton of mechanics talk and thats prob why i forgot him, I didnt see the mindmeld with FK physically in the ISO, so I guess either im blind or it was mixed in with the mechanics and fluff. But he did act similarly to clown fiesta in almost all regards. Meta wise I would clear in from null to townlean, but his lack of reads/interactions on like anyone but Marshal and Tele is like annoying.</p>

<summary>
Ici references Luigi's mansion again what a surprise</summary>
<p>So reading through everything here is my current reads<br>
Townleans:<br>
Solic: good town discussion, trying to get people to talk, and actively picking apart everything that people say<br>
Geyde: Pushing people, being a town leader. I see this is as his usual playstyle.<br>
Maxwell: I genuinely believe his AtE with Isaac’s death and feel his remorse for something he didn’t actually cause (it was isaacs fault). Now his interactions with Ici in the begining were weird, but i really gutfeel this town<br>
Wazza: The reaction test was dumb, but his plays trying to get info out of Isaac and Nerbins seems like towny Wazza even if it comes with a lot of unessescary language<br>
Squid: See this as town squid when they started giving their reads early and with talking on who to give the bomb to instead of just doing it behind the scenes. Overall the post that really sold it to me was the one where she didn’t defend herself, its just feels to genuine to fake<br>
Isaac: his flip said so<br>
Null:<br>
Maximusprime: no content <a class="mention" href="../../u/maximusprime.html">@MaximusPrime</a> plz come and play<br>
Celeste: I don’t really remember anything they have done other than vote Wazza, and saying Ici was a whiteknight whatever that means<br>
Eevee: Weird choice in friend, since they are the most voted person atm. Wants the bomb, other than that not much to read<br>
Nerbins: Not much but we know he has passives<br>
Soul: No content, and when someone pointed it out, they talked about pushing inactives being sometimes scummy<br>
Scumleans:<br>
Ici: His interactions where he seemed to try and pocket Wazza, Isaac, Squid, and Maxwell. Then he pushes Solic in what feels like you point out my flaws Imma vote you. In that regard imma vote you sir<br>
<strong>/vote Ici</strong></p>
</details>
<p>Notice the huge simmilarity in tone; halting, low-quality, use of colloqiaulisms to cover lack of content, to a much greater degree than regular DatBird.</p>
<p>blah blah my tonal meta is accurate<br>
blah blah blah boom bye scum</p>
