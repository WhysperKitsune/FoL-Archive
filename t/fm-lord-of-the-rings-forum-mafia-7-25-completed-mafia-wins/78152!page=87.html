<p>Focusing on Magnus over any of the other inactives is really weird, there were several people at this point who hadn’t posted at all (I think Magnus included? not 100 percent positive) and <strong>she doesn’t give a reason for singling him out in particular (though I do agree that if Magnus keeps not posting that’ll be a scumtell for him).</strong></p>

<p>So the thing is, when you claim Priest as NK <em>even once</em> no one will ever believe you again when you say your role is self-resolving. Obviously you can roll self-resolving roles as town but claiming to be self-resolving is NAI at best and I’m not going to let you randomly get away with it for no reason.</p>

<p>See the context of my Priest claim. I was an arsonist who only needed one more night to put the game past LyLo. Here I basically am forced to self-resolve or die.</p>

<p>Why would you ever say this as town? Unless you’re a Hunter-equivalent or something you’re basically saying ‘HELLO WOLVES, I AM IMPORTANT, COME NIGHTKILL ME PLEASE,’ which is obviously a dumb thing to do as a power role.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m really not liking Alice’s Iso here, it feels like scum!Alice trying to look contributive and solvey without actually being contributive and solvey, the random pings on specific people with no follow-up are scummy as heck from her in particular. I know I always scumread Alice but I’m pretty sure she’s actually scum this time.</p>

</aside>
<p>So people would stop acting so damn paranoid about me as I’ll never endgame here? If I’m asking wolves to kill me, then how can I be a wolf? Also, the pings that I made were for a reason. Solic and Boss were pinging the hell out of me with their posts so I wanted more follow-up from them.</p>
