&gt; **Only Appears in Unseen Games**
&gt; * **Mastery of the Arts (Passive)** - Immunity to Poison
&gt; * **Got your back (Night - Infinite uses)** - Guard a player, but only from occupation. Does not protect from an attack
&gt; * **Bet you didn&#39;t see that one coming (Night - 2 uses)** - Guard a player, if the player gets attacked, the attacker gets killed in their place. Displays the player&#39;s death note.
&gt; * **Shadow Form (Day - 2 uses after D2)** - Target a player (you may target yourself), they become immune to occupation and redirection until tomorrow.

***Win Condition***
* Survive


The idea behind this guy was kinda like a mercenary that can chose his own side; he can chose to either keep protection on the BD or keep his kill guard on the assassin or nk if you think they&#39;re about to get CS&#39;d

            <p>Tip for you.</p>
<p>Don’t give a neutral a ability that doesn’t help them complete their Win condition. Sure maybe BD won’t execute you yet evils will attack you cause you help bd by stopping occupation.</p>
<p>These all seems to be here for no reason and they really have no reason to actually be on here.</p>
