# Welcome to Cult in the Jungle Republic 3!
&lt;/div&gt;

This is a multiball setup where the mafia and the cult must compete against each other to win.

## Mechanics
Were back to mostly the same ruleset from CITJR 2, but with three differences:
• Days last 72 hours, and nights last 24 hours.
• Lynch is majority  **and plurality**. There is no day one lynch, and day one ends when all players have confirmed. **No lynching is not an option.**
• Both the mafia and the cult have a **day &amp;** night chat.
• Cultists win 1v1v1 scenarios, and equal numbered mafia and cult with no townies scenarios.
• There are no wills/journals.

### Night Actions Order
• The **[color=lime]Cop[/color]** investigates their target, finding out if they are a member of **[color=red]The Mafia[/color]** or not.
• The night kill targets of the **[color=lime]Anytime Vigilante[/color]** and/or **[color=red]The Mafia[/color]** become immune to being recruited by the cult.
• A **[color=magenta]Cultist[/color]** attempts to recruit their target. It will only succeed if they are a **[color=lime]Citizen[/color]** that is *not* the target of a night kill.
• The targets of the **[color=lime]Anytime Vigilante[/color]** and/or **[color=red]The Mafia[/color]** are killed.

## Rolelist
**[color=red]Mafia Goon[/color] x4**
**[color=magenta]Cultist[/color]**
**[color=lime]Cop[/color]**
**[color=lime]Anytime Vigilante[/color]**
**[color=lime]Citizen[/color] x12**

## Role Cards
&gt; ## [color=red]Mafia Goon[/color]
&gt; **Loyal (Passive)** - You can&#39;t be recruited into the cult.
**Factional Kill (Night)** - Each night phase, a mafia member may perform the factional kill. The player you target is immune to being recruited by the cult.
*You win when a majority of the living players are mafia, or when nothing can prevent this from happening.*

&gt; ## [color=magenta]Cultist[/color]
&gt; **Recruit (Night)** - The Cult may recruit a player at night. You may only recruit citizens. If you recruit anyone else or a nightkill target, your recruit will fail. There can only ever be at most four cultists, including dead cultists.
*You win when a majority of the living players are cultists, or when nothing can prevent this from happening.*

&gt; ## [color=lime]Cop[/color]
&gt; **Loyal (Passive)** - You can not be recruited into the cult.
**Investigate (Night)** - Each night phase, you may investigate one player. You will get results back in the form of Mafia/Not Mafia (Cultists appear as Not Mafia).
*You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.*

&gt; ## [color=lime]Anytime Vigilante[/color]
&gt; **Loyal (Passive)** - You can not be recruited into the cult.
**Shoot (Day/Night)** - Once per day/night cycle, you may kill a player. A day/night cycle is determined by the number in Day or Night. For instance, Day 2 and Night 2 are in the same day/night cycle. Night 2 and Day 3 are in different day/night cycles. You can not kill a player on Day 1. The player you target is immune to being recruited by the cult.
*You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.*

&gt; ## [color=lime]Citizen[/color]
&gt; Your weapon is your vote. You have no night actions.
*You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.*

            <p>Also I had this copy and pasted then I went asleep</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/poisonedsquid">@PoisonedSquid</a> I knew you were cop the whole time. I was trying to make you suspicious so mafia thinks they had a chance of mislynching you at lyio and no one would listen to you, hence me saying htm was clear.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if you were offended, I kept trying to hint it at you and that’s why I didn’t want to lynch you.</p>
<p>There was zero reasoning I could of added which is why I simply just refused to answer it, that’s why I said “if you were cop here’s a list” hoping you would understand yet you didn’t.</p>
<p>It’s why I kept asking if there was a nicer way to do it and that’s why I asked math. I didn’t mean to actually offend you and <span class="mention">@Noz_Bugz</span> it has nothing to do with ego it had something to do with keeping the cop alive so shut up. That was really rude for you to say</p>
<p>I knew math was actually a PR, I Town read marl so I said vigilante to shoot em that he is probably mafia, so he wouldn’t die to mafia. And I had to get the attention away from math, as I realized earlier Baz tried to convert him so I put the warnings to ignore whatever Baz said early.</p>
<p>I had to purposely act scummy to try to save the PR’s role however I did it rudely cause I didn’t know how to actually do it otherwise. Hence, it being a chess game. I had to think steps ahead.</p>
<p>Luxy being ignorant to what was happening and livicus as well made me Town read you, however you were certainly defeating my efforts at saving the PR’s.</p>
<p>Also that’s what Alice meant at y’all playing tic tac toe. It was like we were playing a different game then y’all were. It was fun, (annoying squid wasn’t though)</p>
<p>Also why I said if marl flips town from the vig shot lynch me, math wasn’t going to shoot marl there therefore I knew I was safe.</p>
