    <title>Prince needs a nerf</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/prince-needs-a-nerf/52082</link>
    <description>Prince is problematic now for a few reasons:

**1: The Prince is powerful with no means of defense**

This can lead to two scenarios:
* Prince just claims day 1, and he basically replaces the King, as he is confirmed and the Prince isn&#39;t. This makes it so that the King is irrelevant.
* The Prince can&#39;t out himself, because he is afraid the evils will kill him, if they have some measure to remove him that his hard to stop. This makes the game swingy, as if the Prince dies early, it&#39;s like if 3 blue dragon have died.

**2: The Prince is practically many classes combined**

While most of the time the Prince acts in certain ways, the fact is they are better than any number of classes than what the class is supposed to be good at.

Butler? Prince ignores immunity.
Physician? Even Reapers can&#39;t get past Prince.
Court Wizard? Does the exact same thing.
Psychic? Exact same function.

Basically Prince is a better version of all these classes, in addition to Execute.

**3: Another unconvertible for evils to deal with**

Prince is so powerful it needs to be unconvertible, lest the Evils have too much power. This makes it harder for the evils to convert people in general.

**My suggestion:**

&gt; # [color=steblue]Prince[/color]
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Killer[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Unstoppable
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Royal Blood
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Imprison: Select a player. You will jail them tonight, allowing you to speak with and execute them. Does not stop them from taking action, or prevent actions from being taken on them.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Execute: Kill the person you are jailing, bypassing Immunity and healing. If you would kill a member of the Blue Dragon, you commit suicide instead. 3 uses.

&gt; # [color=purple]Heir[/color]
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Offensive[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Unstoppable
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Royal Blood
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Imprison: Select a player. You will jail them tonight, allowing you to speak with and execute them. Does not stop them from taking action, or prevent actions from being taken on them. You will be unable to speak to the Unseen if you use this.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Lock Up: Occupy your jailed target, and prevent all visits to them. 3 uses.

Of course, Psychic would need to be changed to a different class, so I&#39;m just going to bring up a suggestion I have already made:

&gt; # [color=steblue]Psychic[/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon Social[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Astral Network: You may speak to anyone you have linked with anonymously at night. They can also talk to each other. Anyone in jail cannot hear or speak using the chat. This passive will remain if your class changes.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Focus Link: Reset the cool down for Alter Link. 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Telepathy: Send an anonymous message to everyone. 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Alter Link: Target player is immediately added to the astral network. If they are already in the astral network they are immediately removed. The network cannot have more than 4 other players at once. Unlimited uses. 1 day cool down.

&gt; # [color=purple]Illusionist[/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color=purple]Unseen Social[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Astral Network: You may speak to anyone you have linked with anonymously at night. They can also talk to each other. Anyone in jail cannot hear or speak using the chat. This passive will remain if your class changes.
&gt;
&gt; Passive: Skilled: You can use both night abilities in the same night.
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Focus Link: Reset the cool down for Alter Link. 2 uses.
&gt;
&gt; Day Ability: Telepathy: Send an anonymous message to everyone. 2 uses.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Alter Link: Target player is immediately added to the astral network. If they are already in the astral network they are immediately removed. The network cannot have more than 4 other players at once. Unlimited uses. 1 day cool down.
&gt;
&gt; Night Ability: Read Mind: Get a copy of your target&#39;s logs. Infinite uses.</description>

<p>Now why would you be caught by D2?</p>
<p>1: BS whisper king meta screws you over: This is a problem being addressed.</p>
<p>2: Drunk Deb’s you as reaper: Again. People complain about this too. They are justified in doing so.</p>
<p>3: Obs/Princess sees you kill: Sorc has magic cloak, Possessor makes someone else do the kill and. Reaper’s kill is on a delay making it harder to make the connection.</p>
<p>4: Obs peek: Its 2 shot, sus to use that early and worst case scenario you claim Alch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I don’t see people complaining about other n1 deads as much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s because the only class which is as swingy as Prince in terms of N1 deaths is NK. The only way for Poss to die N1 is Drunk HH + assassin. The only way for Reaper to die N1 is hitting bear/knight guard, being attacked by assassin and being attacked by Alch. Sorc can be killed N1 by Inquisitor and that’s already being treated as something swingy that should be stopped.</p>

            <p>You want the Priest to return?<br>
That will solve your problem for unfair deaths…</p>
<p>Where you get a broken ass class with a mean of defense and is unconvertable.<br>
You also get wait for Prince to die just for you to resurrect.</p>
<p>but yeah I over stress my points</p>

            <p>true</p>
<p>but I don’t see people complaining about other n1 deads as much.</p>
<p>Someone always has to die n1 and unfortunately, it is your Prince sometimes.<br>
Giving Prince 1 time night immunity will just become the Priest problem again.</p>

            <p>I have an idea.<br>
Make prince immune to death for the first two nights.<br>
However, make Prince also immune to healing(<em>including healing of Bleeding and Nightshade</em>)</p>

<p>Final Conclusion:</p>
<p>Stop being salty<br>
All of your suggestions are completely bogus and are all based on obvious salt.</p>

</aside>
<p>And thanks Braixen. You took the words out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Prince should not be changed. End of story.<br>
Prince being underpowered is the fucking point of a Jailkeeper style class.</p>
