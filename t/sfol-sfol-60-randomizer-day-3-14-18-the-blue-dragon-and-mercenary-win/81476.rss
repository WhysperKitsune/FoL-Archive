### Hosted by katze and Chloe


**Phase Length**
Day Phase: 48 Hours
Night Phase: 24 Hours
Day 1: 24 Hours, but no execution.
## Rules

1. Follow the [Global Forum Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first)
2. Follow the [Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules](https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules) 


## Gameplay

* Days last 48 hours, or until majority is reached for execution. Nights last 24 hours. The first day will last for 24 hours.
* All actions must be sent to the hosts - through your classcard, or scumchat.
* Unseen will talk through a special Discord server or forum message.
* The priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server or forum message.
* This game will be using current FoL balance changes as of 04/21  - Any changes made after this date will not be included in this SFoL.

## Executions

* To accuse someone say &quot;**/vote [player]\**&quot;
* Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.
* When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.
* No Lynch may be done by saying “\**/vote no lynch**”. This will stop the end of day plurality lynch from happening should it have more votes than any player.
* You may self-vote.

## Picking a New King

* If there are 4 players or less, a new king will not be selected.
* When the king dies a 12 hour period starts. In this, players may vote in their class PM for who they want to become the next king. You cannot submit day actions until after this period.
* Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned king. If votes are tied, a king election will be held the next day to determine it.
## Journals

* DM the host what you want on your journal. When you die, the last update to your journal will be revealed to everyone. Journals are limited to 1000 characters.

## [color= #e1ad21]Randomization[/color]
**This game features a ~~self-explanatory~~ feature called randomization! Please read the following information *carefully*:**
All classes except the  **[color = steblue]Prince[/color]**, **[color = purple]Mastermind[/color]** and all **Kings (Starting or Elected)** will have full randomization of Abilities and Passives, or the option to randomize select abilities if they are the **[color = purple]Assassin[/color]** or any **[color = grey]Random Neutral Non-Killer[/color]**

All **[color = steblue]Random Blue Dragon[/color]** slots will be randomly selected from a pool of all **[color = steblue]Blue Dragon[/color]** Passives, Day Abilities, and Night Abilities. Every class will have 0-2 Passives, 0-2 Day Abilities, and 1-2 Night Abilities.

The only exception for this full randomization is if a class rolls a Passive or Ability that requires a corresponding Ability in order to function. A list is provided below for Passives and Abilities that **must** roll together.

---
[details=&#39;Randomization Exceptions&#39;]
* **[color = steblue]The Alchemist&#39;s[/color]** Brew Potion &amp; Apply Potion.
* **[color = steblue]The Archer&#39;s[/color]** Multi-shot and Bulls-eye.
* **[color = steblue]The Court Wizard&#39;s[/color]** Arcane Empower will always roll alongside a Night Ability that visits.
* **[color = steblue]The Knight&#39;s[/color]** Armored &amp; Defend.
* **[color = steblue]The Maid&#39;s[/color]** Rumor, if rolled, will always be accompanied by Matchmake. However, Matchmake can roll on its own.
* **[color=#d23900]The Demon&#39;s[/color]** Haemophilia will never roll with **[color=indigo]The Sorcerer&#39;s[/color]** Day Abilities.
* **[color=indigo]The Sorcerer&#39;s[/color]** Walking Bomb &amp; Detonate
* **[color=indigo]The Sorcerer&#39;s[/color]** Bomb Swap, if rolled, will always be accompanied by Walking Bomb. However, Walking Bomb can roll on its own.
* If *ANY* of [color=black]**The Reaper&#39;s**[/color] abilities were rolled, the player will also receive the passive *Consume Soul*

Only one of the following can spawn: **[color = steblue]The Mystic&#39;s[/color]** Link Minds and **[color = steblue]The Priest&#39;s[/color]** Channel. 

The **Religious Fervor** passive is unobtainable, as it has no effect.

[/details]

---
## [color= #e1ad21]Class Naming[/color]
The name of your class depends on what **Main Ability** you roll. The posssible scenarios are shown below:
* If you have the Main Ability of **only one** Blue Dragon class, you will inherit the name of said class.
* If you have the Main Ability of **more than one** Blue Dragon class, you will inherit the name of the first Night Ability&#39;s class.
* If you do not have a Main Ability, you will inherit the name of your first Night Ability&#39;s class.

[/details]

---
## [color= #e1ad21]Neutral Killer Rolling &amp; Naming[/color]
In order to be completely transparent about how Neutral Killers are randomized, we have decided to make this rolling process public. For starters, the name of the Neutral Killer depends entirely on what **Main Ability** you roll. In this case, every Main Ability will have the power to kill. Secondary Abilities are not guaranteed to provide a kill. A list of Main Abilities and Secondary Abilities can be seen below:

---
[details=Main Abilities]
* [color=#d23900]**The Demon&#39;s**[/color] Funeral Pyre
* [color=darkblue]**The Possessor&#39;s**[/color] Puppet Strings
* [color=orange]**The Mind Flayer&#39;s**[/color] Brain Destruction
* [color=black]**The Reaper&#39;s**[/color] Reap
* [color=indigo]**The Sorcerer&#39;s**[/color] Magic Missile
[/details]
---
[details=Secondary Abilities]
* [color=darkblue]**The Possessor&#39;s**[/color] Possess
* [color=orange]**The Mind Flayer&#39;s**[/color] Shape Knowledge
* [color=black]**The Reaper&#39;s**[/color] Gather Darkness
* [color=indigo]**The Sorcerer&#39;s**[/color] Detonate
[/details]

---
[details=NK Rolling Process]
The exact rolling process for Neutral Killers is as follows:
1. **Passive 2**
Roll a d3 - If it lands on 1 or 2, you do not get a 2nd passive. If it lands on 3 - you receive *Mindstorm*
2. **Day Abilities**
Roll a d2 - if it lands on 1, you receive a single day ability. If it lands on 2, you receive two day abilities. Keep in mind, **[color=#d23900]The Demon&#39;s[/color]** Haemophilia will never roll with **[color=violet]The Sorcerer&#39;s[/color]** Day Abilities.
3. **Main Ability**
Roll a d5. Main Abilites are listed above.
4. **Secondary Ability**
Roll a d4. Secondary Abilities are listed above.
5. **Passive 1**
If *ANY* Reaper abilities were rolled in the previous steps, you receive *Consume Soul*.
Else: roll a d3
If it lands on 1 or 2, you receive a random Occ/Redirect/Death Immune Passive
If it lands on 3, you receive *Mage Armor*

**Neutral Killer winconditions will be decided using Will of the Mod - this is explained below in *Important Changes***
[/details]

---
[details=Example Neutral Killer]
&gt;# [color=navy]The Possessor[/color] :shield:  :fire:
&gt;[color=navy]**Neutral Killer**[/color]
**Cloak Of Mithras (Passive)**  - Immune to death at night, occupation and target changing. In addition you are immune to bleeding and will be informed upon being bled.
**Mindstorm (Passive)**  - Once per night you may guess a player’s class. If you are correct you will empower your Main Ability to bypass protections. This passive will be disabled if you guess incorrectly twice. Cannot Target the King, nor can target the same person after a successful guess.

**Puppet Strings (Night)** - Control a player and force them to kill someone. Can be forced to target themselves. :crown:
**Detonate (Night)**  - All players with a bomb active will explode bypassing death immunity. This does not count as a visit. - 2 uses :crown:
&gt;
&gt;_Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and the Unseen._
[/details]

---
## [color= #e1ad21]Altered Abilites and Mechanics[/color]
In order for this game to be a bit more balanced, and allow (almost) every player to get the full randomization experience, some abilities and passives have been changed, as well as a few new additions. These changes can be seen below:

---
[details=&#39;IMPORTANT CHANGES&#39;]

### Gamble
While randomizing Neutrals between each-other is nearly impossible considering the differing win conditions, it would be unfair if Neutrals did not receive any randomization at all. For this reason, **a new Passive has been given to all Non-NK Neutrals**. Players who roll Neutrals will be given the normal classcard, and can *choose* whether or not to gamble - it is completely optional.
&gt;**Gamble (Passive)** - At the start of the game, select any number of your **abilities**. Your selection(s) will be completely randomized into any non-killing non-unique ability (Blue Dragon &amp; Unseen). You may also choose not to gamble.

Example Neutral:
&gt; # [color=brown]The Sellsword[/color] :shield:  :fire:
&gt; **[color=brown]Neutral Offensive[/color]**
**Among Friends (Passive)** - Immune to death at night, once. This passive will not apply if attacked by a Blue Dragon player, however. You will additionally appear as a member of the Unseen to investigative abilities. 
**Contracted (Passive)**  - Immune to occupation and target changing.
**Gamble (Passive)**  - At the start of the game, select any number of your **abilities** . Your selection(s) will be completely randomized into any non-killing non-unique ability (Blue Dragon &amp; Unseen). You may also choose not to gamble.
**Magical Barrier (Night)** - Protect a player from negative effects and conversion tonight. Does not prevent attacks. - Infinite uses
**Follow (Night)** - Watch someone to see who visits them. - Infinite uses
*See the blue dragon defeated at any cost.*

---
Along with this, Assassin receives a more limited version of this Passive in which you can replace Hidden Blade and/or Silence. Players who roll or are promoted to the Assassin will be given the normal classcard, and can *choose* whether or not to gamble - it is completely optional.

&gt;**Assassin**
**Gamble (Passive)** - At the start of the game, or when you are promoted to this class, you may select Hidden Blade and/or Distract. Your selection(s) will be completely randomized into any non-killing non-unique day ability (Blue Dragon &amp; Unseen). You may also choose not to gamble.

Keep in mind: Upon *promotion* to the Assassin, you will be given the regular Assassin classcard, and be allowed to gamble if you so choose. You will *not* be given the classcard of the previous Assassin.

Example Assassin:
&gt;# [color=purple]The Assassin[/color] :crossed_swords: :shield: 
&gt;[color=purple]**Unseen Killer**[/color]
**Apprentice (Passive)** - If the Mastermind dies or is crowned King, you will take their place. This passive will pass on to the next converted player if you are crowned King. (Starting Assassin only)
**Gamble (Passive)**  - At the start of the game, or when you are promoted to this class, you may select Hidden Blade and/or Distract. Your selection(s) will be completely randomized into any non-killing non-unique day ability (Blue Dragon &amp; Unseen). You may also choose not to gamble.
**Pocket Dimension (Day)** - If you die tonight, delay it for 2 nights. This will delay bleeding in addition to attacks. - 2 uses
**Dark Rune (Day)** - Choose a player. If that player uses an ability today they will target themselves with it. - 2 uses
**Assassinate (Night)** - Kill a player. - Infinite uses :crown:
**2-for-1 (Night)** - Kill two target players. - 1 use (shared) :crown:
_Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm._

### Occupy/Redirection Immunity

**Any time an offensive night ability is used, the player will be occ/redirect immune for that night.**
**The following abilities have been altered slightly to accommodate to this change.**
[details=Offensive Abilities]
&gt; **Serve Wine (Night)**  - Occupy a player by getting them drunk. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color]- Infinite uses

&gt; **Concentrated Wine (Night)**  - Throw a party, occupying all players who visit you tonight (Bypasses occupy immunity). [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - 2 uses

&gt; **Debauchery (Night)**  - Force a player to target a second of your choice. (you won’t be immune to attacks or conversion if you force them to target you). You will only be seen visiting the first. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - Infinite use

&gt; **Happy Hour (Night)**  - Occupy a player, and disable any death or occupy immunity they have for the night. You will only be seen visiting the first. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - 2 uses

&gt; **Mix Rooms (Night)**  - Target 2 other players. Redirect all players targeting either of your targets to the other. You will be seen visiting your first target only. This cannot target the same player twice in a row. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - Infinite uses

&gt; **Serve Ale (Night)**  - Redirect a player to themselves. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - 1 Use

&gt; **Spike Traps (Night)** - Place a spike trap outside a player’s room. No one will be able to visit the player, and they will be occupied. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - 3 uses

&gt; **Snare Trap (Night)** - Occupies the target player for 2 nights (this night, and the next night) if they leave their room. [color= #e1ad21]You will be occupy and redirection immune while using this.[/color] - 2 uses
[/details]
### Chromomancer&#39;s Night Ability
Chronomancers’ night abilities have been merged into one ability.  This was done because both abilities require each-other to function, and both are night abilities. Meaning that rolling one would give you two Chronomancer night abilities, and that didn’t feel very fun.  **Keep in mind if the Chrono is converted they will get the ability corresponding to what slot Alter Time was in.**
&gt;**Alter Time**  - Choose your night action from one of the following.
&gt;* **Time Warp**  - Delays a player’s death for 2 days. This will delay ongoing bleeding in addition to attacks. You can prevent a death multiple times. Cannot delay unhealable attacks or suicide.
&gt;* **Distort Reality**  - Redirect all deaths that you have delayed to the target player. Can be healed and does not bypass death immunity.
### Possessor&#39;s Passive
**Both of Possessors’ passives have been combined.**  This was done simply because if the Neutral Killer only rolled one of the Possessor Passives, they would be at a major disadvantage.
&gt; **Driven (Passive)**  - Immune to death at night, occupation and target changing. In addition you are immune to bleeding and will be informed upon being bled.

### The Demon
The Demon&#39;s day ability *Haemophilia* is tailored around the ability *Funeral Pyre.* In order to make this work with *any* Main Ability, this ability&#39;s explanation has been removed from *Funeral Pyre*, and has been altered slightly. Funeral Pyre will now read as such:
&gt; **Funeral Pyre (Night)**  - Set your target ablaze, killing them.

While Haemophilia has been changed to this:
&gt; **Haemophilia (Day)**  - Increases the power of your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color] tonight. If Haemophilia is used, the target is immune to visits from others except you, and anyone who attempts to visit them is also killed by the flames. In addition, your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color] will bypass death immunity on the initial target and not count as a visit. - 3 uses, 1 day cooldown

Keep in mind: If Haemophilia is used alongside Puppet Strings, the flames will surround the *second* target, and the stringed player will not die to them as it no longer counts as a visit.
### Mind Flayer
Without alterations, the Mind Flayer&#39;s *Mindstorm* passive, as well as *Shape Knowledge* ability, both require the night ability *Brain Destruction* in order to function. In order to allow these to function with other night abilities, they have both been slightly changed:
&gt; **Mindstorm (Passive)**  - Once per night you may guess a player’s [color= #e1ad21]class name[/color]. If you are correct you will empower your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color] to bypass protections. This passive will be disabled if you guess incorrectly twice. Cannot Target the King, nor can target the same person after a successful guess.

&gt; **Shape Knowledge (Night)**  - Use an ability belonging to a player you have killed with your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color] on a player of your choice. You cannot use these abilities more than once, and certain abilities are denoted as not able to be used. For non-killing abilities, they may be done alongside your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color]. - Infinite Uses
### Fool&#39;s Passive
In order to accommodate for the possibility that a Fool uses *Gamble* and changes their night ability, the passive *Final Prank* has been altered slightly:
&gt; **Final Prank (Passive)**  - You may use [color= #e1ad21]your night ability[/color] 2 times after the day you get lynched.

### The Reaper
Without modification, *Gather Darkness* and *Consume Soul* require *Reap* in order to work. In order to accommodate to all Main Abilities, these have been altered slightly:

&gt; **Gather Darkness (Night)**  - Use your [color= #e1ad21]Main Ability[/color] on target player. In addition, choose to do a number of the following modifications. You will consume a soul for each modification chosen. Bypass death immunity or you are occupy/redirection immune for this night. - Infinite uses :crown:

&gt; **Consume Soul (Passive)**  - If you die at night with at least one soul, you will consume it and come back to life. (Does not work if executed by The Prince) You start with two souls. You will gain one soul on a successful [color= #e1ad21]kill[/color]. You are aware of the number of souls you hold.

### Neutral Killer Winconditions
As Neutral Killers are almost completely randomized, we cannot determine the wincondition simply based on the name of the class that is rolled. **We have decided to use Wisdom of the Mod** (mod discretion) to determine the Neutral Killer&#39;s wincondition. It will be selected based on the strength of the Neutral Killer that is rolled, as well as the overall power of the Blue Dragon. The possible winconditions are as follows:
* Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and the Unseen.
or
* Your objective is to defeat the Blue Dragon and the Unseen. If you are alive in the final four players and the Unseen has not already mechanically won, everyone else present that has not already won instantly dies.
