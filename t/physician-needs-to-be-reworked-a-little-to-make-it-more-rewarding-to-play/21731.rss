    <title>Physician needs to be reworked a little to make it more rewarding to play</title>

    <description>As it is now, every time I get Physician in game I feel like I&#39;m being punished. 

Most of the Physician players&#39; time in the match is spent healing people that usually are either thankless or suspect you because it is a class that also happens to be an okay scum claim right now. **This isn&#39;t how support classes should be in any game.**

I believe its night abilities are solid, but it could possibly use a day ability that assist the player confirm themself with. Perhaps a &quot;steroid/buff&quot; of sorts that kicks in during the night; either automatically healing wounds should that player be attacked or granting them some other kind of buff.</description>

            <p>Right now, phys is very powerful. You can save people from death from bleeds and poison, save them from death with no consequence.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you are also a third of a knight (and confirm able with psychic) when you use reanimate.</p>
<p>I think the one that needs a buff is knight</p>

            <p>actually as MM you don’t need luck</p>
<p>go back and edit the first few nights with later claims, add in your team mates, and examine results (which aren’t fool proof)</p>
<p>sheriff and paladin is easy, but might require you to bus a team mate</p>

            <p>Well physician is one of those roles that don’t get any info at night. Butler/drunks can know who are occupied immune. Knights first days are boring but once you can start cs people its really fun.</p>
<p>I loved the old Exhume, at least you could get some info there.</p>

            <p>Actually come to think of it Physician is the one role Princess can confirm isn’t converted</p>
<p>That still needs to be fixed</p>

            <p>Well true, to an extent, though I’d say with all roles of that type, you are more likely to get yourself killed trying to fit what an investigator might see, rather than get checked by a class that may not even be in the game, or that you might never trip the attention of.</p>

            <p>It’s not suppose to be confirmable. You want to be confirmed? Heal someone who is poisoned or hope your DK gets a solid kill…physicians are more than fine right now. If anything and this is a slim chance in he’ll but I would like to see healers be able to double target people to heal but only one goes through if they are successfull. Like a priority.</p>

            <p>Well, that’s another way of fixing the problem, I guess. And a viable “solution” to the problem seeing that it would broaden claims. It’s just bad right now being mostly dumped on a healer.</p>
<p>I also don’t believe class types are all that important. I rarely get found out by a Princess.</p>

            <p>The real problem is support classes one of the few pretty ok scum claims for say MM, assasain cult leader.</p>
<p>basically for roles that can be claimed without a near guaranteed contradiction to the living (or attempting to explain how everyone you interacted with is dead which is why no one is backing  you)</p>
<p>In categories<br>
NOPE unless you are the converted form of that role —<br>
The Butler (Offensive)<br>
The Drunk (Offensive)<br>
The Hunter (Killer)<br>
The Observer (Investigative)<br>
The Prince (Killer)<br>
The Psychic (Social)</p>
<p>Workable –<br>
The Knight (Killer)<br>
The Paladin (Investigative) The Sheriff (Investigative)<br>
The Physician (Support)</p>
<p>Feasable but luck required<br>
CW (anyone’s visited either of your claimed targets kinda gets ya)<br>
The Princess (Investigative) (that whisp makes it a bit risky)</p>
<p>We can’t shrink the workable list any further… if anything we need to expand it</p>
