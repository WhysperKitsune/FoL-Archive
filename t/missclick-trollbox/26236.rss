    <description>Hello, this is my first post here. :slight_smile:

I have noticed when I play Fool that if I missclick the trollbox ability when nobody can&#39;t speak, you lose the ability that day. That happened to me a couple of times. maybe I am a bit dumb :smile:

I would like that this could be improved. 

Thank you for your amazing game.</description>
