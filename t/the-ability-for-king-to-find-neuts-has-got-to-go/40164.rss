    <title>The ability for King to find neuts has GOT TO GO</title>

    <description>I posted this on Reddit, thought I should post it here too.  King has GOT to lose the ability to find neutrals, NK is already hard enough to play as it is, I don&#39;t need the 25% chance that I auto-lose just because King found out I&#39;m a fucking neut.  King checks must be binary like Sheriff&#39;s and Paladin&#39;s, SUS/NS</description>

            <p>King has guard,  and voting power,  but not vote control.</p>
<p>The power of the King should be that he can get people executed.</p>

            <p>If you think about, it doesn’t make sense for the King to have an invest ability at all.</p>
<p>There must be another way to make the King important.</p>
