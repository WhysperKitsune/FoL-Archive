    <title>Sheriff rework suggestion</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/sheriff-rework-suggestion/18525</link>
    <description>There was a thread yesterday about how sheriff is boring and too black and white. No need to put any pieces together which is what makes this game fun. I agree 100% sheriff is so boring. Here is my proposal. 

Investigation should allow you to pick a target to investigate and pick a night either the current night or a previous night. And then you can see who the target visited on the night you chose. That way you have to put pieces of the puzzle together and you can fact check people&#39;s logs and try to find the person who visited somebody the night they died. It&#39;s very similar to how a sheriff acts IRL. That&#39;d be a much more exciting role to play!</description>

            <p>Hmmm, are you sure this was never possible?</p>
<p>I guess it’s possible he may have just led the lynch on the second Knight claim and I’m not remembering correctly. Either way, it worked out for me.</p>

<p>I agree. Investigators are needed.</p>
<p>Current Sheriff is fine. I like it how distinct he is from Observer.</p>

            <p>Also the more auto-exes, the better.</p>
<p>If Sheriff, Princess, and Knight are already there, we only need to get a few more roles on board before most of the BD is “auto-exe”.</p>
<p>That means that we have good claimspace, and it will encourage thinking, better play, and, <em>gasp</em>, social deduction!</p>
<p>All around it’s pretty good.</p>

            <p>I have said this before but honestly all classes are boring unless it’s a killer. Most classes that don’t do something every night that is useful are considered boring. That is the game. I agree sheriff needs a slight rework  it not for being boring. It needs to be more deduction. Instead of a guaranteed unseen confirm or ns. It needs to be a group of 2 or more and it says one of them is unseen.</p>
<p>Also I saw a suggestion awhile back but they should be able to read journals to include private ones. Call it probable cause or something. On likes 4 times use.</p>
<p>Sheriff is also becoming auto exe like princess and knight in this meta because of Mms.</p>

            <p>Observer can only look at the current night. Say somebody suspicious puts up logs claiming knight saying the guarding king N3. Sheriff can then use investigate that night and choose that person and choose N3 and see if that person indeed visited the king that night.</p>
<p>Or let’s say somebody dies N2. Sheriff can check different people the next couple nights to see who they visited N2 and call them out if somebody did visit that person N2. He does detective work. You know the age old sheriff question “where were you the night so and so died” well this sheriff rework can find out. And like I said verify people’s logs after they post them. So sheriff is still basically as powerful as the current one, but is more fun and less just click and see.</p>
