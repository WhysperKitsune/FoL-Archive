    <title>Rules need to be made clear</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/rules-need-to-be-made-clear/8111</link>
    <description>I just played a game where i was merc. Cult were clearly losing badly, there was 2 cult left. My target just got converted and he told me about it. I decided to out him, so that i could get a new target and win with BD.
I did that and easily won with BD
If i didn&#39;t do that, i would surely have lost.

After the game, someone said he reported me for game throwing. I kinda laughed at him saying that i won the game.

But i went on discord to ask the mods, and to my surprise, its against the rules

They said that merc&#39;s win condition is protecting his target, so what i did is &quot;game throwing&quot;.

So my request is, make the rules more clear before banning people for unclear rules.

I understand that mercs betraying their contract can be &quot;Unfun&quot;, and could be made a rule, but it REALLY does not fit in &quot;game throwing&quot;, because what i did in my mind is the exact opposite of game throw. It was actually a really clever move that made me win for sure.</description>

            <p>The mods went further and said that bussing is not allowed in this game whitout the consent of the person. So for example, lets say you know 2 is gonna die from poison, and you out him saying hes cult, this is considered game throwing too and you get a violation, UNLESS 2 said he agrees to it.</p>

            <p>Okay, here’s our official statement:</p>
<p>If you are a Mercenary, you are expected to do everything to make sure your contract <code>at any given time</code> survives. Furthering their doom at any point in time is gamethrowing. If they’re going to die anyway, just keep quiet and not make it worse. Then get your 2nd contract and move on.</p>
<p>This means: Outing your 1st contract as Mercenary because they will die <strong>is</strong> gamethrowing. If you know they are going to die, don’t make it worse – but you <strong>can</strong> just wait until they die when there is nothing else you can do to help them and then get a second contract.</p>
<p>Also, if you go from Merc to King, then your win condition changes to just surviving (Neutral King), meaning you <strong>are</strong> allowed to Out your contracts <strong>after</strong> becoming the Neutral King.</p>
<p>Edit: The below post, about bussing only being accepted when it is with the consent of the respective players, is also valid. Bussing not accepted by the Person subjected to the buss is seen as outing your teammates intentionally.</p>

            <p>Are the mods saying this from direct feedback from the developers ?</p>
<p>Seems ultra lame in a deceit based game that only particular class has to put another players chances of winning above his own</p>

            <p>Yes its “game throwing” according to the mods. here is the main argument i told them:</p>
<p>I said that your win condition as merc is to see one of your targets survive. So if you know for sure that the first one is not gonna survive, its by your win condition to start working for the future target. But apparently that’s against the rules.</p>
<p>But the mods were nice and accepted to remove my violation. I told them i now understand the merc rule.</p>

            <p>So is this game throwing or not ?</p>
<p>Its difficult for me to stomach anything that is considered game throwing when at the end of the game you have won .</p>
<p>I also  like how mercenary it feels to sell out your contract  to ensure your profit.</p>
<p>Feels kinda thing Bronn would do .</p>
<p>I pretty much only guard my merc target if I feel I am under threat or he is target two .</p>

            <p>That’s exactly what i argued with them for around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Apparently, its kinda an unwrriten rule that its not allowed to think outside the box as merc. You have to do everything you can to defend your current target, completly ignoring what will happen once he dies.</p>

            <p>Why is throwing your contract under the bus gamethrowing in any way. If they’re about to lose and you can still win that is not gamethrowing.</p>
<p>You are a neutral, youare not on your contracts team. That is just good play.</p>
