    <title>Phys Possessed through Self Care</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/phys-possessed-through-self-care/73939</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Was Phys.  Used SC, got possessed.  Said I didn&#39;t heal because of classes not in the game.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I would heal and not die

#### Steps to reproduce:
Jump into a SC&#39;ing Physician

#### Comments:
If Possess penetrates heals, we need updates on that in the game if that&#39;s what happened.</description>

            <p>It used to be in the class card.   It isn’t any longer.  I thought that was because it was reverted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Possess now prevents the target from being healed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s been that way since this patch I believe, and is thus not a bug.<br>
However, I agree that it should be put in the class card for clarity’s sake.</p>

            <p>Ah, the classcard needs updating. I’m sure it is mentioned in the patchnotes that possess bypasses healing and most regular TOL players are aware of that, thanks for bringing that to attention.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now possessor should be on this list correct. That is something that would need to be changed</p>

<p>Neither does the info text when you die to it with SC up.  It lists: Court Wizard, Enforcer, Inquisitor and Reaper for reasons you didn’t heal.</p>
