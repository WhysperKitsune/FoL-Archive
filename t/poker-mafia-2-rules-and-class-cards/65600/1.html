<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> What is poker mafia?</font> </big></p>
<p>Poker mafia works like a standard mafia game, with a town faction, an evil faction and a few neutrals. However, in Poker mafia most players start without any abilities and instead must get their abilities by placing a bid on the <strong>Ability Pool</strong>.</p>
<p>(If you played the first Poker mafia game, you can skip to the “What’s new?” section).</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Tokens</font> </big></p>
<p><strong>Tokens</strong> are the main currency of the game, and they are used to place bids on the <strong>Ability pool</strong> or to buy tickets for the <strong>Roulette</strong>.<br>
All players get 5 tokens at the beginning of each day, and any unspent tokens will carry over to the next day. You can also get more tokens by winning at the <strong>Roulette</strong>, from <strong>Events</strong> or by <strong>Selling back</strong> your abilities.<br>
Besides normal tokens, there are also 2 types of special tokens that you can only get from certain events or abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Roulette tokens:</strong> These can only be used to buy tickets for the <strong>Roulette</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special tokens:</strong> These can only be used to place a bid on the ability pool. A special token will always get the highest bid on an ability against any amount of normal tokens.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Ability Pool</font> </big></p>
<p>Every day there will be an <strong>Ability Pool</strong> with a certain number of abilities. The ability pool works similar to an auction: every player can place any number of tokens on one or more abilities in the pool, and at the end of the day the player that placed the highest bid on each ability will get said ability. Please note that unlike most auctions, <strong>players who lose a bid will NOT get their tokens back.</strong> Also, every bid you place will be private and won’t be revealed to anyone.</p>
<p>The abilities on the pool will change every day, and the number of abilities in the pool will be equal to the number of living players minus 2, with a minimum of 2 abilities. In addition to those abilities, there will always be one extra <font color="gold"><strong>Golden</strong></font> ability. Golden abilities are really powerful abilities that only have 1 use.</p>
<p>To place a bid on the pool, send a message to the host saying which ability and the number of tokens you want to place, for example: “I want to place 5 tokens on ability <span class="hashtag">#4</span>” or “/bet 3 tokens on 4”.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Roulette</font> </big></p>
<p>During the first 24 hours of each day, the <strong>Roulette</strong> will be available. During this time players will be able to buy roulette tickets for 1 token each (you can buy as many tickets as you want).</p>
<p><strong>Available tickets:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gambling ticket:</strong> This ticket allows you to place a bet on the roulette. You can bet for a color (red or black), a number (between 1 and 3) or a combination of both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guessing the color correctly gives you 2 tokens for each ticket.</li>
<li>Guessing the number correctly gives you 3 tokens for each ticket.</li>
<li>Guessing both the color and the number correctly gives you 6 tokens for each ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can buy as many gambling tickets as you want, but you may only place one bet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rare tickets</strong>: Out of everyone that buys these tickets, only 1 of them will get a price. Only 1 of these will be available each day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Jackpot ticket</strong>: Every token used to buy tickets from the roulette will be added to the jackpot (roulette tokens count as normal tokens for this purpose). The winner ticket will get all the money in the jackpot. Jackpot starts with 5 tokens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Golden ticket</strong>: The winner ticket will get a golden ability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special ticket</strong>: The winner ticket will get a special token.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Daily Events</font> </big></p>
<p>Every day there will be a random event. Events give players new ways to get tokens or abilities. For extra info, see the “List of events” section.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Selling back</font> </big></p>
<p>If you don’t like one of your abilities you can sell and it will go back into the ability pool. People will be able to bid for said ability like normal, but the tokens from the highest bid will go towards the seller. Sold abilities will have keep the same amount of remaining uses. You can only sell abilities during the day.</p>
<p>To sell an ability send a message to the host telling him which ability you want to sell.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Using multiple abilities </font> </big></p>
<p>There is no cap to the number of abilities a player can have at the same time, but they can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, however every player can pay 3 tokens to use an extra ability. You can do this multiple times but it will cost you 3 tokens each time. You can’t use the same ability multiple times per day/night.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> What is new?</font> </big></p>
<p>If you played the first poker mafia, you already know the main mechanics. However, some stuff has changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>All classes are able to get abilities from the pool.</li>
<li>Godfather and all neutrals have been reworked.</li>
<li>Two more neutrals have been added: The Entertainer and the Loan Shark</li>
<li>A second NK has been added: The Elite (only 1 NK will spawn, however).</li>
<li>Townies and mafiosos will be able to choose a gift at the start of the game (see class cards for the gifts they can choose from).</li>
<li>Gambling events have been removed and replaced with the “Roulette”.</li>
<li>There are still daily events, but they no longer involve gambling (see the events section for more information).</li>
<li>All classes can use more than one day or night abilities, but they must pay 3 tokens for every extra ability besides the first one. (You can’t use the same ability multiple times).</li>
<li>Godfather no longer needs to use tokens to kill.</li>
<li>Godfather no longer buys abilities for his mafiosos, instead he can give them tokens.</li>
<li>Selling an ability back no longer gives you a fixed amount of tokens, instead you get the tokens from the highest bid.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/game_die.png!v=9" title=":game_die:" class="emoji" alt=":game_die:"> <big><font color="gold"> Special rules and interactions</font> </big></p>
<ul>
<li>Lynching a player will set the day timer to 12 hours. Players can keep discussing and placing bids on the ability pool, but won’t be able to use day abilities during this time. Players cannot sell back abilities during this time either.</li>
<li>Lynching a player ends the roulette immediately.</li>
<li>Bids are private and will not be revealed to anyone, except for some specific abilities or events.</li>
<li>You can place or change your bets at any point during the daytime.</li>
<li>Each night, a player will get <strong>ALL</strong> the abilities in which they had the most tokens.</li>
<li>If there is a tie for the highest bid, the person with the less number of non-starting abilities will get the ability. If that is also a tie, it will be solved by rng.</li>
<li>There are 8 different ability types: Support, Offensive, Social, Investigative, Killing, Gambling, Passive and Scum. There are also certain classes with starting abilities. These abilities will appear as “Special” to investigators.</li>
<li>The abilities are given to the player at the beginning of the night, which means they can use them that same night.</li>
<li>You can have more than 2 day and night abilities. There is no limit.</li>
<li>If you use all uses on an ability, you will lose said ability. This means investigators won’t be able to see that ability and you won’t be able to sell it. This also applies to “limited” passive abilities such as one-time death immunity.</li>
<li>You will know whether you got an ability or not at the beginning of the night. If you lose a bid, you will not know who got the ability.<br>
*To prevent angle-shooting, every player is able to delay their actions or bids by asking the host.<br>
*To help with fakeclaiming and prevent angle-shooting, players can ask the host for any flavor text such as “You were occupied last night” etc.</li>
<li>Every player is able to ask the host any questions regarding mechanics or interactions, but asking for info about the game that can be considered cheating or angleshooting might result in a modkill.</li>

          <p>Hmm,</p>
<p>Honestly, The Neutrals in this game are interesting, due to the events and token mechanics.</p>
<p>Gambler is your regular survivor, with a twist</p>
<p>Loan shark is trying to keep the game going long enough to get tokens to get wincon</p>
<p>Lep is JOAT evil neut.</p>
<p>Entertainer is basically RNG itself</p>
<p>Honestly, aside from Lep, Neuts are quite unique to this game, and i do like them</p>
<p>Loan Shark feels like an actual neutral role tbh.</p>
