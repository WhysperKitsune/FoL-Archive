    <title>Whisper Reading Ability&#39;s: Pros and cons</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/whisper-reading-abilitys-pros-and-cons/71469</link>
    <description>There are currently 4 distinct methods of whisper reading ability&#39;s that have been used in the game:

1. Targeted day spy - The user chooses a target with a day ability and sees their whispers for the rest of the day. This can be used on reaction and was unlimited use on the Noble and Aristocrat
2. Targeted night spy - The user chooses a target with a night ability and sees their whispers the next day. This ability required you to predict who was going to be whispering and was the least likely out of these ability&#39;s to give useful information. It was unlimited use on Noble and Aristocrat and was 3 use on Apostle. Possessor currently still has this ability.
3. Global Night spy - The user activates the ability and sees all whispers the following day. This ability takes timing but unlike the first 2 does not require you to know who the whisperer is going to be. It is less likely to give information than a day spy but can give more of it when it does. It is currently 2 use on Noble, Aristocrat and Apostle
4. Global Day spy - The user activates the ability and sees any whispers that happen for the rest of the day. This is the strongest spy ability by far being able to give the most information and requiring neither known timing nor known whisperer&#39;s. A weaker version of this concept that only sees 4 whispers was used by the Apostle.

All of these have strengths and weaknesses both internally and for the game. 

Targeted spy&#39;s are best when all of the whispers go to and from a single player. It does not work well when multiple independent groups are operating. However targeted spy does not care how long the target whispers for.

Global spy&#39;s are best when all of the whispering happens at the same time. It cannot get all of the information from whispering over meany days. Global spy does not care about how meany players are involved.

Day ability&#39;s are always better than their night ability equivalents because they can be used on reaction rather than requiring a prediction. Making the ability a day ability means it will rarely be wasted.</description>

<p>But if you used a day global spy <em>after</em> the crucial whisper, you would not have.</p>

</aside>
<p>isn’t that more of a choice though. As a day ability you can chose whether to use it the moment day abilities become possible to catch hypothetical incoming whispers. or save it until you think a juicy conversation is going on. as a night ability you only have one choice.</p>

            <p>If you want to be technically correct, day abilities are not always better than their night ability equivalents.  For example, Mastermind outs to Evil King in whisper and doesn’t whisper him again.  If you used a night global spy you would have caught it.  But if you used a day global spy <em>after</em> the crucial whisper, you would not have.</p>
