    <description>Just want to know if this annoys you, or are you fine with it.
It seems that every game you have to mass whisper to a king if he asks and if you don&#39;t, you are seen as &quot;suspicous&quot; sometimes even getting voted up for it. As well as the king could easily be evil and use that information against them. Maybe making Noble be able to see the king&#39;s whisper will fix this. This seems to defeat the purpose coming up with the a good claim and planning, because if you rushed to claim, most of the times it won&#39;t be as good.

Just want to know your thoughts.</description>

            <p>King telling everyone to claim to him in whisper or get voted up is fine (that’s good King play).  But I don’t like that King can order execute you at night, it seems like that should be replaced with a social ability.</p>

            <p>That is not what I’m trying to say.</p>
<p>I like the Noble’s ability. He has to choose a target, I think it should be buffed to where he can listen to two targets but that’s besides the point.</p>
<p>To hear EVERY whisper like spy, is a no-no.</p>

            <p>You guys are correct when you say the king is being played correctly, but the problem is if the king being played correctly is a healthy meta.</p>
<p>An extreme example being if there was an NK who could kill 7 people a night and who didn’t leave any traces of his visits and killed through immunity. He would definitely be played correctly, but that doesn’t make him good.</p>
<p>Again, the king is not that monstrously overpowered, but it still is unhealthy for the meta, I think, because it almost makes games decided solely by what faction the king is, and even then how smart of a player the king is. If the king is not the best deducer, he will easily seem evil to any experienced player.</p>

            <p>I’ll agree with the comment above me.</p>
<p>The king is suppose to be a leader, if he is not leading you, then you’ll think he’s evil for slowing you down, and you could executing.</p>
<p>We need to increase the number of fake claimable classes. since now, that number is very limited.<br>
The only classes that can fake claimed. and there are few a problems with all of them, these are</p>
<p>Phys, Sheriff, Paladin, Knight, CW’, Hunter, Princess…</p>
<p>---- Classes like Noble, Observer, Butler, Drunk are though to claim when you are evil and will be seen if you fake claim them</p>
<p>Classes like Merc, Alch, Inq and even Scorned can just get you executed for not being BD</p>
<p>Classes like psychic and Prince CANNOT be claimed</p>
<p>What we really need, are more classes that can be claimed by the evil members, to give them more space and more chance</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I highly doubt it… You limit it down to a single class and his converted form, you’ve still got something that is more likely than not bd sided. A noble isn’t the assasain, MM CL or NKs, So he’s probably pretty safe to have evesdrop… and besides that noble is often reffered to as “royal blood the class” so it’s a real time saver not having to re-do the whispers should the king happen to die.</p>
<p>Only real way to fix mass claims is to raise the fakability of fake claims. IE have less classes that MM assasain and NK would be idiots to try to claim, and more classes that are fakable. Of course the real problem is fakable classes are the ones everyone hates to be… because quite litterally not leaving a huge visible testable impact every time you use your ability, is generally hand in hand with your ability being boring, hence knight, CW, phys… are the most complained about being classes in the game.</p>
<p>Now you could try and say “whispers is the culpret” and make king unwhisperable… but I don’t see that really as the factor. The reality is a vocal mass claim would also do the trick just fine. The winning strategy still would be "have everyone claim on day 1-2… knights/phys’s focus on the prince. investigatives focus on the hard to test classes (like phys/CW etc…), king orders testable ones to… well pass their tests. Realistically by day 4 or 5… you could have just about the whole board solved.</p>
<p>So yeah, IMO the key is, to try and make it closer to half" the classes in the game, that are fakable in the way that sheriff. phys, knight are. (princess and CW are only half way fakable considering whisp and tornado are testable abilities)</p>

            <p>Letting Noble see the whispers made to King probably won’t change the meta, Kings will likely still ask for “classes or execute” regardless of the Noble being able to see whispers.</p>
<p>The only way I see this meta strategy changing is if execution gets removed from Kings.</p>
<p>Imo I’m fine with execution, It’s very easy to play around the king meta right now, just try and claim as early as possible to the King to avoid being executed for “not claiming”.</p>
