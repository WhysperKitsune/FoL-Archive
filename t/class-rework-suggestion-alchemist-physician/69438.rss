    <title>[Class Rework Suggestion] Alchemist/Physician</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-rework-suggestion-alchemist-physician/69438</link>
    <description>I have seen a lot of discussions about the power of Alchemist and Physician lately so I decided to post my suggestion here. 

This rework idea is an attempt to make Physician more enjoyable and engaging to play without making it a weaker copy of the Alchemist. Below are the basic concepts that I had in mind:

**[color=ligblue]The Physician[/color]**
-
&gt;**Type:** Support;
**Faction:** BD;
**Is Unique?:** No.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive Abilities:**
&#39;Remedy Studies&#39; - You are immune to Nightshade poison and bleeding. 
&gt;
&gt;**Day Abilities:**
&#39;Inoculate&#39; [1] charge - Make a player permanently immune to Nightshade and bleeding. Does not cure it. 
&#39;Quarantine&#39; [2] charges - You will be immune to death tonight.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Abilities:**
&#39;Heal&#39; unlimited charges - Heal a player, preventing them from dying tonight, and cure their poison/bleeding. 
&#39;Malpractice&#39; [1] charge - Poison a target player with a lethal dosage, instantly killing them. You can not target The King with this ability.

**Notes:** I would also propose to make Physician a guaranteed BD class would be a good change. That way you do not have to rely on Alchemist (who is inherently neutral) if they spawned as the only healer in game.
____________
[color=silver]**The Alchemist**[/color]
-
&gt;**Type:** Support;
**Faction:** Neutral;
**Is Unique?:** No.
&gt;
&gt;**Passive Abilities:**
&#39;Coagulate&#39; - You are immune to Nightshade poison and bleeding. 
&gt;
&gt;**Day Abilities:**
&#39;Stoneskin Potion&#39; [3] Charges - You will be immune to death tonight.
&#39;Contaminate&#39; [2] Charges - The first person that visits you tonight will become poisoned with Nightshade/will start Bleeding (depending on the game type) at the start of the next day. They will be notified and will die in 2 nights unless healed.
&gt;
&gt;**Night Abilities:**
&#39;Heal&#39; unlimited charges - Heal a player, preventing them from dying tonight, and cure their poison/bleeding. 
&#39;Emerald Potion&#39; [2] Charges - Assist your target for the night, making their attacks bypass Death Immunity. You can not target The King with this ability.

**Notes:** The notification for &#39;Contaminate&#39; would be identical to the notifications you get when you are poisoned/bled by an Assassin or Cult Leader (to avoid making the Alchemist instantly confirmable).

All and any feedback is appreciated.</description>

            <p>It would make phys survive reap, and also just seems out of place for phys to have.</p>
<p>I had suggested changing heal so it’s self-targetable twice and replacing self-care with exhume.  I think it’s a simple way to make phys more interesting to play that completely avoids any balance issues.</p>

            <p>It feels like this makes both Phys and Alch way too confirmable, as they’re currently good fake claims for scum. I understand that people want to have more to play with as the healer classes but being the healer in itself, concerning that there is poison/blood mechanics in the game, make both classes already strong enough</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To be honest I strongly oppose these changes.  Someone had suggested giving Physician an investigative ability like Exhume (learn cause of death of dead player) to make him for fun and engaging.  I think something simple as that would solve the boring problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Quarantine’ [2] charges - You will be immune to death tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is too strong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Malpractice’ [1] charge - Poison a target player with a lethal dosage, instantly killing them. You can not target The King with this ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is too strong as well, it’s coldsteel but you don’t suicide if you misuse it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Stoneskin Potion’ [3] Charges - You will be immune to death tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I support this, reducing Alch’s stoneskin by just one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Contaminate’ [2] Charges - The first person that visits you tonight will become poisoned with Nightshade/will start Bleeding (depending on the game type) at the start of the next day. They will be notified and will die in 2 nights unless healed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes: The notification for ‘Contaminate’ would be identical to the notifications you get when you are poisoned/bled by an Assassin or Cult Leader (to avoid making the Alchemist instantly confirmable).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alch will still be instantly confirmable, since the evil faction can poison/bleed a second time that day.  And if Assassin for instance claims Alch and says “visit me to get poisoned” he might get outed for pressing the nightshade ability 0.5 seconds too late, or too early.  We know how unfun these types of scenarios are with Reaper chill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Emerald Potion’ [2] Charges - Assist your target for the night, making their attacks bypass Death Immunity. You can not target The King with this ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don’t understand what’s wrong with letting Alch kill people himself?</p>
