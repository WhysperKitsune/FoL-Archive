    <description>*&quot;Wait, ici... YOU&#39;RE GIVING CHILDREN GUNS?&quot;*
&quot;Yes, so what\?&quot;
*&quot;What the fuck is wrong with you!&quot;*
&quot;The gun emoji is a water pistol.&quot;
*&quot;Never mind then.&quot;*

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 

# :gun: Kids With Guns :gun:
&lt;/div&gt;


## Rules 
1. All standard forum rules apply, as usual.
2. Do not communicate about the game outside the game, and don’t angleshoot.
3. Please be respectful to your fellow players. Keep your salt in until post-game.
4. Don’t post in big text or otherwise pretend to be a host of this game.
5. Have fun. 

## Mechanics

* Day Phases will last for 48 hours.
* Night phases will last for 24 hours.
* The lynch is decided by plurality only.
- [color=red]**Mafia**[/color] have daychat.

## Rolelist

- Werewolf flavor was confusing/annoying for some people, so I&#39;ll just use Mafia flavor

&gt; [color=green]**Innocent Child
&gt; 1-shot Vigilante
&gt; Vanilla Townie
&gt; Vanilla Townie
&gt; Vanilla Townie
&gt; Vanilla Townie**[/color]
&gt; 
&gt; [color=red]**Mafia Cleaning Suicide Bomber
&gt; Mafia Goon**[/color]

- Innocent child chooses to reveal at night, and is revealed the following day.
- Suicide bomber can activate at any time, but always kills during the day. If chosen during the night it kills 10 minutes after SoD.
- Suicide bomber cleans both themself and the person they suicide to kill.
