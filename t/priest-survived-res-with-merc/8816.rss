    <title>Priest survived res with merc</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/priest-survived-res-with-merc/8816</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Priest claimed to have been attacked (at least to us in dead chat), mentioned he had a merc that was not on duty the night he was attacked. Later in the game he revived prince, and survived.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Priest should have died during the revive.


#### Steps to reproduce:
I&#39;d assume be prince, get atacked, revive while being guarded by a merc.

            <p>Even if it is a bug, I like that that happened. What are the odds the priest gets a merc? If he does get a merc, that’d be an awesome combo to use,  Wish it was supposed to be that way.</p>

            <p>He said that his immunity was punctured (IE the first attack was not healed or protected from), When he revived he was saved by a merc. At least according to what he said in game.</p>
<p>The death by reviving is supposed to be unstoppable.</p>
