            <p>Oh. Since you are doing tactical kills I suggest making it faction wide rather than having it take an ability slot on every class in the faction</p>

            <p>Ok. First of all you need to do something about classes like CW relying heavily on the conversion mechanic to be useful.</p>
<p>Second of all you need to make sure your classes can fake ANY BD (besides Prince and maybe Mystic). So classes like confusing darkness just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>Third of all. You should make deadly darkness guaranteed and make Dark Dagger 2 target. I know that seems excessive but all factions have a KPN of 2 and this one should be no exception. The extra bleeds and starting members is counterbalanced by lack of conversions</p>
<p>Forth of all. You really should have a hard counter. They exist for a reason and they aren’t just there to make BD’s job easier. The hard counter is an important piece of claimspace that is important for direct accusations for classes like scorned, Sellsword, Fool and your own darkness late game. Feel free to make Dark Core investigative immune</p>
<p>Fifth, Dark cores passive should not work if NK is alive. He needs to have a chance too</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t do the King thing. It just outs King both to the darkness and to the BD (Allies is confirmable)</p>
