    <description># Finera
Spring 1834. The Train Station bustled with activity as the people alighted from the train. The western town of the falling petals was a sight to behold, nowhere else could you see the fluttering of the falling pink petals.

Upon stepping out of the station, a small town square would greet you, with a modest fountain decorating the centre. Several buildings surrounded the town square, ranging from a clothing store, groceries and the Armory. An inn can be seen by the left street, while the right street leads to the residential area. The town had that touch of humility and cosiness. The leaves danced in tandem to; the calm and gentle rustling of leaves softly echoes, the morning breeze.

Oh, the trail of students walking further north of the station exit, you could see a church to the left, and the opposite direction led to more houses, though it also led to the river stream, where fishing enthusiasts gathered. The white chapel acting as the town&#39;s church, wood lining its walls in stripes. The mixture of brown and white made it ever the more rustic, humility at its core. 

A stone pavement coats the road after passing the church, indicating a change of venue. The road splits into 3 here, with two dormitories on the end of the east and west paths. The gate can be seen further into the northern path. The concrete walls that adorn the school grounds are bright beige, with the gates made from strong steel. A secure site for military students to practice. 

There is a stand with people manning the stall. Behind them are 6 boxes set up neatly, with class numbers.

The morning is due. It is 0800.
The entrance ceremony begins at time 0900. 
Take your time to prepare. You are to hand over your weapons over to one of the student council members standing by at the gate.

A suitable soundtrack.

<h2>Fallair Station</h2>
<p>“Passengers. We are approaching the terminalus of the Imperial Railroad, Fallair. We hope that you had a pleasant ride with us. Please ensure not to leave any valuables or belonging on the train.”</p>
<p><em>Upon exiting… it’s a station similar to that of Finera’s, though just a tad bit more rustic. And of course, Instructor Herschel was already waiting outside…</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Instructor Herschel</h2>
<p>Commoner - Fallair - Instructor of the Fine Arts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Good evening, Class VI.” <em>She says in a sweet voice… Her short stature, coupled with her long, straight blonde hair, scarlet irises full of gentleness… Brings a respite from the usual rough ladies you’ve seen in school.</em></p>
<p><em>“HARAH YOU IMBECILES, YOU CALL YOURSELVES NOBLES? NOBLES AREN’T AS SLOW AS YOU LOT!”</em> A familiar voice rings inside your head… that memory of a quote for Classes I and II… you’d never thought it came from a dignified noble. Oh dear.</p>
<p>“Umm… let’s see… Ferris… Elise… Hunter… and James!” <em>She counts each student…</em>“It’s my first time out in the field study as well. Don’t feel so nervous.”</p>

<em>Quest Description</em><br>
