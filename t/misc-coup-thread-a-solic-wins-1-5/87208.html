<h1>Welcome to Coup, a card/board game based around lying, deceit and bluffing, hosted by <a class="mention" href="../../u/intensify.html">@Intensify</a>
</h1>
<p>You will be pitted up against 1 to 7 other players, in a race to be the last one standing. However along the way, you must find a way to trick others into believing your lies, while at the same time ensuring that others do not manipulate you into believing their lies.</p>
<p>This version of Coup is basically the original version, with 2 cards I made that are based off of Kickstarters exclusives, to spice things up a little for those familiar with the game.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Setup + The Deck</summary>
<p>Each player starts with 2 Influence Cards drawn from the deck and 2 coins.</p>
<p>The Influence Cards will be only visible to you and nobody else.</p>
<p>The deck consists of 3 copies of each unique card.</p>
<p>So the deck would look like this:</p>
<p>3 <strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong><font color="purple">Assassin</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong><font color="orange">Ambassador</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong> cards<br>
3 <strong>Inquisitor</strong> cards</p>
<p>The deck will contain in total 21 cards.</p>
<p>Setup can be modified and expanded if for some reason more than 8 players want to play.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Cards/Characters</summary>
<p>The cards you draw at the start of game (your Influence Cards) will allow you to perform special actions during your turn and possibly block other actions. You may declare to have one of these cards in order to perform the corresponding actions. These cards are:</p>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> - Gain 3 coins. Block <strong>Foreign Aid</strong>.<br>
<strong><font color="purple">Assassin</font></strong> - Pay 3 coins to make a player of your choice lose an Influence Card.<br>
<strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> - Steal 2 coins from another player. Block stealing against you.<br>
<strong><font color="orange">Ambassador</font></strong> - Draw 2 cards from the top of the deck. You may exchange any of your alive cards with the cards drawn. Return 2 cards back at the end to the bottom of the deck.<br>
<strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong> - Block an assassination attempt or stealing against you.<br>
<strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong> - When a player loses and has no more cards, you may claim <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong>. After claims and challenging, the coins are split among <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong> claim(s) (rounded down).<br>
<strong>Inquisitor</strong> - Gain 2 coins. Look at the top and bottom cards of the deck.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Gameplay</summary>
<p>Turns will take place in the order of the player list from top to bottom.</p>
<p>During your turn, state your action and the character claimed (if applicable) with a <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/exclamation.png!v=9" title=":exclamation:" class="emoji" alt=":exclamation:"> or putting it in green.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/exclamation.png!v=9" title=":exclamation:" class="emoji" alt=":exclamation:"> I want to do income and gain 1 coin this turn.<br>
<img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/exclamation.png!v=9" title=":exclamation:" class="emoji" alt=":exclamation:"> I claim Duke and gain 3 coins this turn.<br>
<font color="green">I want to do income and gain 1 coin this turn.</font><br>
<font color="green">I claim Duke and gain 3 coins this turn.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are allowed to bluff to have any card in the game and you may claim to have that card in order to do the card’s special action. You may also bluff to have any card as well for blocking an action. However, there is a risk to bluffing any card known as challenging (which will be explained later on).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1 has a Duke, but doesn’t like Player 2.<br>
Player 1 decides to claim Captain and steals 2 coins from Player 2 despite having a Duke.<br>
Player 2 loses 2 coins and is now sad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Certain actions can be blocked by other cards. For example, a <strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> may block a steal from another <strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> attempting to steal 2 coins from them. When you wish to block an action, state whichever card you claim and the block with a <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:"> or in red.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/shield.png!v=9" title=":shield:" class="emoji" alt=":shield:"> I claim Captain and I block your steal.<br>
<font color="red">I claim Captain and I block your steal.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Each player is attempting to eliminate the Influence Cards of all the other players. These cards are unknown to the other players, and players may bluff on their claims.</p>
<p>When a player loses an Influence Card, they choose which card to reveal. It no longer provides any use to the player and does not return to the court deck.</p>
<p>When a player loses all their Influence Cards, they are exiled and removed from the game.</p>
<p>The last player standing is the winner.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Challenging</summary>
<p>Whenever a player claims to have a card along with its action or block, you may challenge the claim. When a player challenges another player, they are basically telling the other player that they don’t believe their claim and think that they are bluffing.</p>
<p>Anyone may challenge a claim made by a player during that player’s turn.</p>
<p>To challenge someone, post whoever you want to challenge with a <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crossed_swords.png!v=9" title=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" alt=":crossed_swords:"> or in blue.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crossed_swords.png!v=9" title=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" alt=":crossed_swords:"> I challenge your Duke claim!<br>
<font color="blue">I challenge your Duke claim!</font></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When a claim is challenged, the challenge process will happen.<br>
During this process, there are 2 different players, <font color="orange">The Challenger</font> and <font color="red">The Accused</font>.<br>
<font color="orange">The Challenger</font> is the person who is accusing the person of lying and <font color="red">The Accused</font> is the person who is… well being accused of lying.<br>
<font color="red">The Accused</font> beings by revealing a card.<br>
If the card is the correct card they claimed to have, <font color="orange">The Challenger</font> loses a card and the action goes through. <font color="red">The Accused</font> shuffles the card they revealed to the deck and draws a new one from the top of the deck.<br>
If the card is the wrong card they claimed to have, <font color="red">The Accused</font> loses a card and the action is negated and does not happen.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>There are 2 players, player 1 and player 2.<br>
Player 1 has a <strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> and a <strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong>.<br>
Player 2 has a <strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong> and a <strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong>.<br>
Player 2 isn’t doing so great right now, so he decides to claim to have an Assassin and makes an assassination attempt against player 1.<br>
Player 1 does not like this, and instead of losing one of his cards to an assassination attempt, he claims to have a <font color="yellow"><strong>Contessa</strong></font> and blocks the assassination attempt.<br>
Player 2 does not believe the claim and challenges the claim.<br>
Player 1 cries like a nerd.<br>
Player 1 reveals a <font color="steblue"><strong>Duke</strong></font> and turns out he did not have a <strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong>.<br>
Player 1 decides to lose his <strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> after revealing it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Keep in mind that any claim of beholding a certain card can be challenged by anyone. This includes claims during blocks.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Actions and Blocks</summary>
<p>Here is the list of all actions you may claim on your turn. Notice that there are 3 actions that do not require you to claim a specific card in order to perform. These are <strong>Income</strong>, <strong>Foreign Aid</strong> and <strong>Coup</strong>. These are actions that may be performed by anyone as long as the requirements are met and can not be challenged since no claim of having a certain card is presented.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you must perform an action during your turn and you cannot no-action.</p>
<p><strong>Income</strong> - Gain 1 coin.<br>
<strong>Foreign Aid</strong> - Gain 2 coins.<br>
<strong>Coup</strong> - Pay 7 coins to host a coup against a player, making them lose an Influence Card. This cannot be stopped. You are forced to <strong>Coup</strong> at 10 coins.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> - Gain 3 coins.<br>
<strong><font color="purple">Assassin</font></strong> - Pay 3 coins to make a player of your choice lose an Influence Card.<br>
<strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> - Steal 2 coins from another player.<br>
<strong><font color="orange">Ambassador</font></strong> - Draw 2 cards from the top of the deck. You may exchange any of your alive cards with the cards drawn. Return 2 cards back at the end to the bottom of the deck.<br>
<strong>Inquisitor</strong> - Gain 2 coins. Look at the top and bottom cards of the deck.</p>
<p>Cards can also of course block other actions.</p>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Duke</font></strong> - Block <strong>Foreign Aid</strong>.<br>
<strong><font color="darkblue">Captain</font></strong> - Block stealing against you.<br>
<strong><font color="yellow">Contessa</font></strong> - Block an assassination attempt or stealing against you.</p>
<p>When a player dies, you may claim <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong>. After claims and challenging, the coins is split among the <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong> claims.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Discussion and Deals</summary>
<p>Anytime during the game, you may talk in the thread unless otherwise specified by the host to shut up. You are allowed to talk about anything as long as it follows the guidelines and general rules.  bluffing, talking about food, questioning other claims (but not actually challenging them with a <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/crossed_swords.png!v=9" title=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" alt=":crossed_swords:"> or in blue), cat pics, making alliances and self voting + ateing, those are all allowed, so have fun.</p>
<p>All discussion must be held in the game thread. You are not allowed to create private PMs to make deals or talk privately to another player.</p>
<p>You may also not show cards, give cards, give coins or anything else similar to this to other players. All your possessions are yours and cannot be given away for free.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Time Limit</summary>
<p>The time limit for your turn to perform an action is 24 hours. If you do not perform an action by the end of this, I will automatically default your action to <strong>Income</strong>. If you have 10 coins, it will be defaulted to <strong>Coup</strong> on a random player instead.</p>
<p>When an action is declared, there will also be a 24 hour period where players may challenge the claim, block it or pass into the next turn. By the end of this 24 hour period, the action will pass through unless otherwise proven to be fake via a challenge.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, if you wish to expand this time limit for a specific action, ping me and I will do so</p>
<p>In order to pass, post <strong>/pass</strong> in the game thread.</p>
<p>When a player dies, there will be a free 24 hour period for players to claim <strong><font color="grey">Graverobber</font></strong> or to pass.</p>
</details>
<p>Feel free to ask any questions, I will answer them.</p>

          <p>There’s 21 cards which are 3 copies of 7 different roles<br>
You’ll get dealt 2 of them.</p>
<p>Every turn you can take an action. Even if you don’t have the correct card for it.<br>
The aim is to be the last person standing.</p>
<p>The way to eliminate people is to make it so both of their influence points (the cards you’re dealt) are killed off and the ways to do this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The assassin role pays 3 coins and assassinates one of your influence cards and you don’t have a Contessa to block</li>
<li>When you take an action that requires a character card (Most actions require one), if someone challenges you, claiming that you don’t have that card and they’re right, you lose one.</li>
<li>If you challenge someone, then it’s wrong then you lose one.</li>
<li>If someone pays 7 coins they “coup” someone. This cannot be blocked. If you get couped you lose one influence.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you lose both, you’re out<br>
