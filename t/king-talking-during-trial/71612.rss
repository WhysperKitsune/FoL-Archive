    <title>King Talking During Trial</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-talking-during-trial/71612</link>
    <description>To make the King more Social I propose that during Trial (the first 30 seconds), the **King and The Accused are the only two people who can talk**. The reason for this is that you may want to ask questions, grill, scumread, bait and do more than just ask for logs and you can use it as a time to buy an open conversation where no one else can interrupt. It would also make the King more accountable by being able to answer the WHY they were voted up, and organize the next steps during the voting process. 

It would add some depth to the King, making them more of an arbiter and judge, being able to lead the trial in a direction before people start talking (which would be great for Evil and Good Kings in different ways).  While it may also indirectly buff the Distraction ability of the Assassin, which I feel is underpowered, it adds some more interesting interactions into the game and more design space to build on in future patches/content.

I feel that ultimately it would add a lot more to the King&#39;s Role in the game.
What do you all think?</description>

            <p>Fair point to mention. I think Distract is a whole other topic really but that’s good to keep in mind.<br>
Let’s assume for ease of argument Distract isn’t involved, just to keep variables down.</p>

            <p>I’m curious, do you think 20 Seconds of Trial is enough for this to even be a viable change or if this were to happen would you like to see the initial Trial time be upped to 30 seconds?</p>
