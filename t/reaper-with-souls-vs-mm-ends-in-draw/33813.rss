    <title>Reaper with souls VS MM ends in Draw</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaper-with-souls-vs-mm-ends-in-draw/33813</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Day before last day, there is Reaper, MM, Assassin, reaped Marshall.  Only 2 votes against reaper cannot start voting.  Night begins and Assassin gets reaped, new day begins with Reaper and MM alive, with Reaped assassin.  Nobody can be voted, so game ends in draw.  Reaper still has 4 souls.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Reaper should be able to empower reap and kill MM for victory.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Play reaper and somehow make it to the end

#### Comments:
It seems that soul count is not factored into determining a draw.  The draw seemed to happen because neither person could vote for the other, and did not factor in additional class mechanics.  Draw conditions with reaper involved need to be reworked.</description>

            <p>Same problem Reaper has with everything.  Maybe just let Reaper games play out since the auto-resolves always screws it up.</p>

            <p>It should have been a reaper win anyways. Mastermind eventually would need to use dirty work and turn into a non night immune assassin.</p>
