    <description>Exclusive Neutral killers !

So the new Neutral Killer could be anything they like , many suggestions have already been made .
So I could pay a couple of quid and when I was selected as the NK there was a chance it would be the New type , otherwise I just get the regular reaper/possessor role like everyone else . 

Exclusive Evil Team . 

So if the two guys selected as the starters for the Evil Team both have this DLC then theres a split chance the game starts as the new evil faction . They are green and do stuff a bit differently etc .</description>

            <p>Seconded, thirded and fourthed the concept of cosmetics only, I’d be happy to give more money to the devs. But the moment they start making cash shop items that even give the potential of higher chances of winning, I’m out of here. I’ll be happy to pay cash for limited time cosmetics, kill animations, accesories etc…</p>

            <p>Like <span class="mention">@JammySplodge</span> said give <strong>classes to everyone</strong> or dont implement them at all.</p>
<p>It’s different if we could get <strong>ONLY COSMETICS</strong> with real money.</p>
<p>I’m not supporting this idea at all that you can buy external classes/teams/etc with real money.</p>

            <p>i42 =/= EA</p>
<p>I’m fine with the micro transactions as you can earn it as well.  The day I see a DLC for ToL I will flip my shit.</p>

            <p>I guess for me the game is so cheap i worry about the devs living in tiny boxes and struggling to feed their pets .<br>
Just like to see some expansions or something to generate some more income</p>

            <p>Hell naw, cosmetics only.<br>
There are things in that category that can be expanded upon in the future, though, like cool locations/animations when you’re found dead in the morning, cosmetics that happen when you get executed, taunts maybe (that could only be used during trials or executions, like throw a tomato at the person), etc.<br>
But never core game mechanics behind a paywall, even if it costs gold.</p>

            <p>Why not just make them, like, 20,000 gold in this instance?</p>
<p>Still <strong>/nosupport</strong>, but like, lots of gold would be the BWCS</p>
