    <description>Changed. I changed the passive and some other stuff. Tell me if the passive is too over powered


*[color=blue]Court Wizard[/color]

**_Faction - BD_** 
**_Type - support_** 

**Passive 1:**
**_all knowing wizard_** - know if someone got converted. The next day it will say someone was converted 

**Day Ability 1**
**_Enhanced_** - select a player. The chosen player is allowed to pick up the two people for their primary night ability tonight (the unlimited night ability if they have one or the ability on the left). {they will not be notified of this action} (unlimited uses) (2 day cool down)

_Ex. CW pick physician. Physician can now heal two people instead of one._ 

**Night ability 1:**
**_Barrier shield_** - protect someone from negative affects. (Includes conversion) (unlimited uses)

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. I’ll be making changes soon.  <a class="mention" href="/u/shanenineone">@ShaneNineOne</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rezid">@Rezid</a>. The day Ability for the CW is meant to be powerful and it also has a two day cool down to counter that</p>
<p>What changes should be made to the day Ability for the court wizard?</p>

            <p>I don’t like the passive for CW. Basically means that CW can’t be scorned target. The day ability is nice, although I think it’d be better if they were notified, and then the two night abilities should just be combined, because the only other negative effect besides death and conversion is an occupy. So it’s just an occupy prevention ability. Sage would be good without the second night ability, and the unlimited uses on that other ability.</p>

            <p>Not sure I like how the night abilities are basically splitting up the current Barrier. I think part of what makes the current court Wizard feel so dull is that barrier, even if it’s a strong ability, doesn’t feel very strong in practice. We already had Barrier as it exists now target two people once before - the result was a class that was incredibly frustrating for evils to combat while simultaneously being very boring to play. I don’t think the solution here is to offer up two halves of the same power at night with different target counts.</p>
<p>However, I do like your day one ability, though I feel like it has the potential to be overpowered. (I.e. give a paladin two people to investigate in a night)</p>
