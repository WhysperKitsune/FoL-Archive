    <title>Day 1 to night 1 lag</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/day-1-to-night-1-lag/8724</link>
    <description>probably about 10 different instances now of Day 1 never turning into night 1 and my game is &quot;not responding&quot; and if I try to reconnect I&#39;m just sitting at the loading screen until I close the game again. Really hoping when that happens, it&#39;s happening to everybody in those games. So people aren&#39;t getting reported. :(</description>
