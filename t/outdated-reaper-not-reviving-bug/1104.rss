    <title>[Outdated] Reaper Not Reviving Bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/outdated-reaper-not-reviving-bug/1104</link>
    <description>I killed 4 people, 2 were alive and I died to a Knight trying to get another soul, I waited and I was not revived even though I had 2 souls avaliable to me. 

I was supposed to be revived with my kept souls.

1. Kill someone
2. Wait 2 nights
3. They die
4. Kill someone (they&#39;re a husk)
5. I die
6. Never revived (husk is completely dead)
