    <title>Possessor jump bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possessor-jump-bug/49393</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Possessor jumped to me. He died (for real) I also died and then both of our UI were broken. My text was the living font and not gray and I could select my ability&#39;s during the entire time. The poss saw the message for selecting a target whenever I did that. Some people claimed to be able to hear the possessor talk in the dead chat. 

When I was eventually lynched my logs were updated after I had edited them post death.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I should have been possessed or at least just died normally.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Have a possessor possess you.
???
#### Comments:
I was obs and It said I was attacked in addition to saying I was possessed.</description>
