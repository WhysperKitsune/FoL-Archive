    <title>Did you know there are 100&#39;s of &quot;social deduction&quot; games? If not thousands!</title>

    <description>This is one misconception I wanted to bring up: I&#39;ve seen some players ask ( or ... rudely accuse `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` ) why our game has similar gameplay elements of xx game: **We are inspired by the original 1986 werewolf/mafia genre, now evolving into the genre today called social deduction** with our own unique gameplay mechanics, story, and theme.

There are hundreds, if not thousands of the genre, originally played as a &quot;real-life party game&quot;, later split off into &quot;tabletop style&quot; or card games, among many other spinoffs.

You can learn more about some of the origins on Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)

Some other games of the genre include:
* [Forum of Lies](https://forum.imperium42.com/c/forum-matches/forum-of-lies/14) (our FREE forum variant)
* [Camp Cadaver](https://campcadaver.com/)
* [Heist Gone Wrong](http://heist.bonuslives.com/)
* Mafia Universe
* Werewolves Within
* Town of Salem
* Epic Mafia
* Deceit
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf
* Secret Hitler
* The Resistance
* ....and more

If you ever see someone claiming they are the first, **they are over 30 years too late** with an unlimited number of variations out there.

However, we ARE the first tabletop-style 3D social deduction game for PC, Mac and Linux that does not require a VR headset!.

Welcome to the awesome genre of social deduction! Now that you know, if someone says something silly like xx game did it first -- you can now respond that, well, _they did not do it 1st_ :D although I&#39;m sure every game of the genre has it&#39;s own unique properties that makes them special!

We just may be the first **medieval** themed social deduction game: I wonder .... does anyone know another?</description>

<p>I don’t believe anyone would have thought ToL would be a scam by looking at the Kickstarter page.</p>
<p>I DO think there is a big opportunity in the market for an alternative electronic social deduction game similar to ToS, and many others (obviously Imperium42) have realized this as well. Now it is a race to the top.</p>
<p>I like Throne of Lies. It’s a little quirky with its graphics and executions, but the gameplay is solid and no game is ever the same, allowing for a ton of replayability with relatively minimal effort.</p>

<p>No way, at the time we had a pretty professional trailer made. Our gfx looked like playdough, but it was very official and well-thought out with a giant Wikia. The Kickstarter, itself, took us over 6 months to plan and it was a beautiful ks page (<a href="http://ks.ThroneOfLies.com">found here</a>). Either way, I’ve never seen anyone so rude. For example, when I talked to Mafia Universe admins, they welcomed us with open arms – Thingyman, I believe his name was.</p>
<p>I think what happens is that we expose the roots of the genre while “other games” pretend they are the first of the genre. Perhaps this intimidates some people.</p>

<p>Now that you actually have a game, they might be more willing to work with you. Before, it only really benefited ToL, but now you have an actual player base.</p>

            <p>There’s someone named turdpile listed Tas a Duke in Discord. Not sure if it’s a coincidence, prank, or genuine, but one of the developer of ToS use Turdpile as their forum name. (They even make a flair in the forum after him)</p>

            <p>Nah, just a bit biased – We’re friends with Camp Cadaver and Heist Gone Wrong – we exchange mentions sometimes ;D it’s at the bottom of our Wikia’s “Social Deduction Partners”.</p>
<p>I tried reaching out my hand to “Secret Hitler” once during our Kickstarter and they “reported me to Kickstarter for spam”, lol. BMG I didn’t even try after I heard they are banning even mentions of us - pretty sure they don’t like us, since we seemed to have indirectly put them to work for updates <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> although if they DID ask, I’d be intrigued (it’d be good for business on both sides). We don’t hate them, by any means. We played ToS.</p>
<p>I reached out to Resistance and Epic Mafia before, but they never responded. I reached out to Deceit several times, but they flat out ignored me (that awkward moment when you get “read” receipts each time but not a response).</p>
<p>So weird about the social deduction genre – everyone is pretending they’re the first of the genre or something. As if cross promoting with another game “reveals” there are others. The genre is so niche that no one even knows about social deduction games – cross promo would help break that barrier.</p>
<p><strong>That said, if anyone has connections to other social deduction communities, I encourage you to reach out to them and let them know we’re open to cross promotions of the same genre ~</strong></p>
<p>^ I may start a new post with that last sentence</p>

            <p>Throne of Lies has a lot of things going for it –</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Medieval theme as Blade mentioned. This adds a unique flavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting day abilities. The day abilities in this PC environment can allow a lot of creative ideas to become reality. While the Alchemist’s Blur is removed for now, it added a unique effect not seen in any other games that I know of. These kinds of abilities can differentiate ToL from other social deduction games if done correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enthusiastic community. While small, everyone obviously adores the game.</p>
</li>
