          <p><strong>SFoL 58 – Last Stand of the Righteous</strong><br>
Starting early or mid December</p>
<p>Lore: The order of the Unseen have taken over the entire world now. Unseen from different lands have joined forces towards their common mission. Their previous enemies, the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantum respectively, are almost entirely wiped out. However, it seems one of these two groups of heroes has returned for a last stand against the Unseen empire. Can the hopelessly outnumbered heroes reclaim their homeland? Or will the unseen secure their rule of the land of Adiart for good?</p>
<p>Baseline Mechanics: This game is a combination of Return of the Blue Dragon and the inverse of Hand of Byzantum. There are 33 possible unseen classes in game, 17 from the Return of the Blue Dragon roleset and 16 from the Hand of Byzantum that I have reworked to be town classes instead of scum. Every unseen class from RotBD is here, but I only included unseen classes from HoB that I could pair with each one from RotBD and FoL, so a few HoB classes are missing as I only picked the ones that could be paired for conversion purposes. Unseen are the town faction and either the Blue Dragon or the Hand of Byzantum are the scum faction. Any neutral and neutral killer class from Return of the BD and Hand of Byzantum can appear, with slight alterations to some classes being made from me to compensate for flipping the town and scum factions. Both the Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantum are much more similar to the Unseen Faction in Forum of Lies than the Cult Faction in Forum of Lies, although they differ from each other in some notable ways.</p>
<p><strong>Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Both scum factions can have up to four members alive, with a cooldown of one night to convert a second or third member, and a cooldown of two nights to convert a fourth member.</strong></p>

<strong>Crushing Guilt (Night)</strong> - If a Hand of Byzantium-aligned player was executed the previous day, then you can select two players who’ve voted to execute and cause them to commit suicide by guilt, bypassing healing, night immunity, and not counting as visits. - Infinite uses<br>
