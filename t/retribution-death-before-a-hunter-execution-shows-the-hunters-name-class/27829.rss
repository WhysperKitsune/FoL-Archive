    <title>Retribution death before a Hunter execution shows the Hunter&#39;s name/class</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/retribution-death-before-a-hunter-execution-shows-the-hunters-name-class/27829</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

I&#39;ve seen this twice now. Exe&#39;d a Hunter during daytime, and the Retribution death of the first accuser shows the Hunter&#39;s name/class in chat instead of the Retribution victim&#39;s. The Hunter&#39;s name/class shows again after their exe, so appears twice.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Retribution death should show the Retribution victim&#39;s info in chat; Hunter death shows Hunter&#39;s

#### Steps to reproduce:

1) Accuse a Hunter
2) Exe a Hunter at trial
3) After the &quot;arrow kill&quot; sound, check chat.

EXP:  [Retribution Victim&#39;s Name] was a [RV&#39;s Class]
ACT:  [Hunter&#39;s Name] was a Hunter
