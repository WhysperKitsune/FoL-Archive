    <title>Access to the Death Note</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/access-to-the-death-note/36950</link>
    <description>Hello fellows !

So i wonder if it&#39;s possible to let the access of the death note even if we are a non-killer class ?

Why that ? Because i love the death note system, it can be very funny ! But when you are dead and cant do anything, its pretty boring... (the mini game where we have to guess who will die / be executed is not very funny in my opinion) 

So yeah, let the access of the death note for every class could be cool for practicing drawing skill ! :smiley:

Greetings !</description>

            <p>Noooo its not what i was thinking =(</p>

            <p>Yeah sry for my english guys <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>
<p>So MidnightKitties, the thing is, i personnaly dont care if my death note cannot be see from the other because i’am a non-killer class. It’s just for practice our draw skill. When you are dead with no psy alive, and you’r not a DK, its boring af… So yeah let access to the DN for every class just for have some fun with the draw, and for those who are not very good with drawing it’s a good thing for practice then !!</p>
<p>I think it’s a very realistic request who doesnt impact very much the game but its a little cool attention for players and drawers !</p>
<p>Also maybe add the purple and blue colors ? Like Blue for BD et Purple for Unseen <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

            <p><strong>/support</strong></p>
<p>Just put a little note at the top of the DN saying you aren’t currently a class that can use it.</p>

            <p>Seems like a good idea. Plus that way if you get converted into assassin you have a sick deathnote already made.</p>

            <p>If there was Death notes for non-killers it would be very pointless. No one would be able to see them. They only appear if the killer kills someone. and lets be fair not many people on ToL can draw very well, well i certainly cant draw for the life of me.</p>
<p>Like dont get me wrong sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>Sorry to shoot down the suggestion, also you put greetings at the end? Isnt that usually said at the start LUL</p>
