    <description>#### What happened?
Nothing gamebreaking. I got DCd from a game and reconnected. At the end of the game I noticed it said I started as assassin and ended as assasin. I actually started as a drunk. But when i disconnected and reconnected that was post conversion. 

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

Should have said that I started as a drunk 

#### Steps to reproduce: haven&#39;t. Not trying to purposely disconnect. 

#### Comments: not a terribly big deal but worth pointing out I think. The post game analysis shows your starting role as whatever your role was when you recconected.</description>
