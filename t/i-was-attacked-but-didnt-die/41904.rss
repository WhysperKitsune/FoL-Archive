    <title>I was attacked but didn&#39;t die</title>

    <description>#### What happened?
I was playing as the fool, on night 2 I used frame and I got the message saying &quot;You were attacked last night&quot; but I didn&#39;t die. I was not healed or guarded the King as far as I know, and I didn&#39;t get the heal or immune message.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I think I was supposed to die? Idk maybe I wasn&#39;t even attacked and the game just told me I was?

#### Steps to reproduce:
Im not sure what caused it, but I used frame that night. Also psychic linked that night in case that matters somehow.

#### Comments:
Here is a picture of the bug. Ignore the graveyard and my name in red, that happened after I was executed as fool.
