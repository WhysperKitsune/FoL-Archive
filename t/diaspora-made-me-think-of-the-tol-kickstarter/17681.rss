    <title>Diaspora - Made me Think of the ToL Kickstarter</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/diaspora-made-me-think-of-the-tol-kickstarter/17681</link>
    <description>I remember the countdown always on the Discord for the kickstarter and during lunch at school constantly checking how close we were and at lunch was when we were $100 away and I was so excited, there was like 2 days or something left and we ended up with 21k and I was super happy. I&#39;m posting this in off-topic because this game looks really interesting and it reminded me of ToL in the sense that it&#39;s an amazing project that is using Kickstarter to become fulfilled. Anyways, I&#39;m thinking this isn&#39;t advertising since it&#39;s not really a competitor and I did use the proper category, so pls no hit me mommy Alfa. but anyways yea, it looks really cool, you should check it out. it seems to be not getting the attention I think it deserves on KS /shrug so I&#39;m trying to promote it a lil&#39; bit and now I&#39;ve been sucked in like I was like ToL, rip my life again. O_O not like I ever had one though.

<p>By that logic, most Kickstarter games are like ToL, as they’re often very well made and very interesting projects</p>
