            <p>I mean</p>
<p>I knew who the NK was</p>
<p>I Nosy’d them to an NK kill</p>
<p>They were in fact the killer</p>
<p>At that point it was me, another confirmed BD player, the NK, and a Pretender remaining (since the Pret was my last match, Matchmake wouldn’t have given useful info)</p>
<p>So all it really did was let me copypaste ‘Nosy 2 to 3: VISITED’ like five times to make my point</p>

            <p>But why can you not pick BD classes</p>

            <p>it’s not a joke, but I forgot when i first posted something like this we had sort of agreed it would be better as a replacement for maybe maid nosy servants or something instead of a primary ability</p>
