Lore subject: The Scorned&#39;s night room

Lore: 

The Scorned is a curious personage from the start of their macabre crusade. Their room while it may seem was blessed with normality was never that way from birth. In fact it was a desolate room filled with only a bed and bland monochrome walls that reflect their inner polarised mindset. But one day the Scorned awoke to an idea. If they wished to know their enemy they should live like them. Despite their initial disgust at the other members of Adiart&#39;s court they began to steal furniture from the rooms of the departed or otherwise occupied. Hence why the Scorned&#39;s room should look the same as the rest of the castles it is in fact a perfect replica of your typical castle goers room by design. The Scorned must know and breathe every detail of their target in explicit and memorable detail. For only with understanding can the scorned truly act on their despicable obsession and yet also etch it into their soul. 

The Scorned&#39;s world is fake much like it&#39;s tolerance for it&#39;s fellow man. And one day when they all die, they will return to their world of black and white. Waiting for the next obsession to litter their abode with malice and obsession.</description>
