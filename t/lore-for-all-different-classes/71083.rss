    <title>Lore For All Different Classes</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m thinking about writing small tidbits of lore for every single class, I&#39;m just curious as to what you guys think of this sort of style.

Possessor Lore

I remember the children playing around the rancid sewage, giggling and telling ghost stories. A pale man, unfitting of our world, causing nightmares and sleepwalking. Normally I wouldn’t be interested in a fool’s tale. These are children after all. That was until I sent out my scouts. 

Our intoxicating servant, leaving his chambers to be let amongst the castle goers, with his eyes stripped away and a vacantly staring with mal-intent. The maids greeted him with kind eyes, but to no avail, he passed by them, bolting for the royal bedroom. As he entered, our good king smiled in approval as the butler grabbed his goblet. Beating his head in, over and over.

The morning came, we gathered in the court, mistrusting those who surround us. News of our king’s death spread like wildfire. The once lifeless butler now wept, crying over his majesties corpse. “Who did this?!” He pled loudly to the court. “What monsters could kill our King?!”

Come to think of it… some court members have been acting strange…
