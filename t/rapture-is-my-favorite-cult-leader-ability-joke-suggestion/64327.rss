    <title>Rapture is my favorite Cult Leader ability (Joke Suggestion)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/rapture-is-my-favorite-cult-leader-ability-joke-suggestion/64327</link>
    <description>Dear God it is not that hard to write Rupture instead of Rapture.
Rapture has a completely different meaning which is an intense feeling of happiness. Before you say BUT THE WORD IS A dinosaur. That is a Raptor.
Please stop spelling Rupture as Rapture it physically hurts me seeing how many people misspell this word as that.

Now Rapture is a grate Cult Leader ability because it is overpowered as how you can eat anybody alive by biting them with your Velocirapture. 100% guaranteed dayvig that is needed in this game. Cult would be the worst thing ever if this ability didn&#39;t exist.

Rupture the other day ability sucks because you can&#39;t do anything with it. Just leaves a target for 2 days while a blood vessel explodes. Man how weak instead of being bitten by a fucking Velocirapture. I pity those dumb CLs with Rapture instead of Rupture</description>

            <p>So what we need for the cult equivalent is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rapture (Passive)</strong> - If Mithras is summoned, you will be killed and your blood will be used to fuel the apocalypse.</p>

            <p>actually the intense feeling of hapiness is an archaic use of rapture, the beleif that the Rapture is an event before the second coming of christ where all the faithful are spared the apocalypse is the far more useed definition</p>
