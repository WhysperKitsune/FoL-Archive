    <title>Refutation of the idea for after winning goals for neutrals like scorned and inq who can win and still be alive</title>

    <description>Imagine a scenario in which inquisitor is given the goal after winning of killing as many magic users at night as possible, winning gold according to how many you kill.

If, before the sorcerer dies, inquisitor finds a magic user, how might this affect their course of action. Their thought process, if they like gold, will be the following:

-I make **X** amount of gold for each magic user I kill after killing sorcerer
-This magic user has a **Y** amount of chance (pretty low, given cult, CW, and the like) of being sorcerer
-BD can kill sorcerer without my help, decreasing my chance of getting the gold for winning and for getting the gold from killing magic users after winning by **X** amount (amount based on inquisitor withholding support)
-If this magic user is not sorcerer, by killing them now I am denying myself an opportunity for gold later

Depending on how late into the game it is, they will either decide to not take a chance and kill the magic user, or be greedy and save them for later.

For the latter, we see that the future goal of killing magic users has obstructed inq&#39;s chance of winning in the first place and either decreased BD&#39;s chances (if cult game) or increased it (unseen game with CW, psychic, etc.)

I don&#39;t think people should think about future goals, much like with conversion, and I don&#39;t want more rules regarding how you can think in the game like with conversion gamethrowing rules, so I don&#39;t want goals for neuts that already won</description>

            <p>But the key part is that if you lose, you get <span class="bbcode-i">noooothing</span> - you only get paid for killing magic users if you’ve won at the end.  So wasting your ability before you’ve found the Sorcerer is a terrible idea.</p>

            <p>Why not make it so that, if you win (and only if you win), you get gold for <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> magic users you killed, before or after you got the Sorcerer?</p>
<p>This seems to solve both problems.  You have no incentive to save them for later, but you also don’t have an incentive to play sub-optimally (because if you don’t win, you get no rewards.)</p>
<p>If you’re worried about it still making them side against the BD a bit too much, make it so they only get gold for evil / neutral magic users, and not for BDs.</p>

            <p>unless the reward for killing magic users is insanely high, I don’t think too many people are going to take the gamble you envision.  The difference between winning and losing is 30g.  If I have a magic user that is possibly the sorc, I’m not going to pass on that kill for the hope of winning some extra gold at the end.  Even setting aside that this magic user might be the sorcerer, there is also a chance this magic user will die from some other means before I get a chance to come back around and farm him.</p>

            <p>just make it so this “secondary goal” can only be acheived after the first.</p>

            <p>Imagine a scenario in which inquisitor is given the goal after winning of killing as many magic users at night as possible, winning gold according to how many you kill.</p>
<p>If, before the sorcerer dies, inquisitor finds a magic user, how might this affect their course of action. Their thought process, if they like gold, will be the following:</p>
<p>-I make <strong>X</strong> amount of gold for each magic user I kill after killing sorcerer<br>
-This magic user has a <strong>Y</strong> amount of chance (pretty low, given cult, CW, and the like) of being sorcerer<br>
-BD can kill sorcerer without my help, decreasing my chance of getting the gold for winning and for getting the gold from killing magic users after winning by <strong>X</strong> amount (amount based on inquisitor withholding support)<br>
-If this magic user is not sorcerer, by killing them now I am denying myself an opportunity for gold later</p>
<p>Depending on how late into the game it is, they will either decide to not take a chance and kill the magic user, or be greedy and save them for later.</p>
<p>For the latter, we see that the future goal of killing magic users has obstructed inq’s chance of winning in the first place and either decreased BD’s chances (if cult game) or increased it (unseen game with CW, psychic, etc.)</p>
<p>I don’t think people should think about future goals, much like with conversion, and I don’t want more rules regarding how you can think in the game like with conversion gamethrowing rules, so I don’t want goals for neuts that already won</p>
