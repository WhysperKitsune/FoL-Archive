    <title>New neutral class, The Mimic</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-neutral-class-the-mimic/10821</link>
    <description>The Mimic(Unique), Type: Special, Faction: Neutral.

The Mimic will be a neutral class that wins by **surviving** with either major faction and any neutral class alive except The Reaper and The Possessor, much like The Alchemist.
Being able to steal a day or night ability from most of the classes in the game, the day ability having **infinite uses** while the night ability only having **3 uses** to make sure you know who you are using it on not to waste it since you can steal a lot more night abilities and can easily determine a player&#39;s class/faction.
He is not immune to occupying or death at night.

I made this at 6 am with no sleep so you&#39;ll have to excuse me if this is a stupid idea, thought it sounded good at the moment.
Even if you&#39;re not happy with my version of The Mimic I hope to see something like it in the future! Maybe simplifying it by giving it a certain ability based on the type for class he steals from(Offensive-Occupy/Social-Find out class type/Special-???/Supporting-Heal/Inves-Find out faction/Killer-Kill)</description>
