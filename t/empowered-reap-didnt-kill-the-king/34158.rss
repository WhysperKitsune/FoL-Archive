    <title>Empowered Reap didn&#39;t kill the King</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/empowered-reap-didnt-kill-the-king/34158</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
N4 as reaper I used Empowered Reap to kill the king. I was linked by psychic that night too but made sure I had the general chat open where it said you will reap number 10 tonight. I got no messages about my success or failure about the reap and the night ended uneventfully. By that night Cult had only Cult Leader alive so none of the converted Cult classes could tamper with the reap or the information given to me. Neither the drunk or butler occupied me that night either (according to their logs). Only neutrals in the game were me as reaper and mercenary. There was no CW either.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to reap the king and get the message that I succeeded doing so, or get the message why I did not.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Reaper game where you attempt to empower reap the king. Have psychic link you the night of the reap.

#### Comments:
The bug itself could have been anything between the interactions of empowered reap (on king), psychic link or faulty notifications. I was unsure what to label the topic.</description>
