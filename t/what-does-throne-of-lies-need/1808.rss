    <title>What does Throne of lies need?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/what-does-throne-of-lies-need/1808</link>
    <description>Without a doubt Throne of Lies is a type of game that would need constant updates to keep people interested like new classes, New features, new mechanics etc..

So i made this thread so we can discuss what can be added in the future or what you think should be added.

1: **More neutral killers**
Right now the only good neutral killer is reaper, The possessor is mediocre at this point. i think there should be more neutral killer classes because they are one of the most fun roles to play as and they are lacking right now.

2: **Executioner type of class**
Right now, no one doubts investigative type roles and there is no confusion at all which makes things easier for The Blue Dragon and for balance we need an executioner type of class. 

3.  **New types of Kings**
The thing that made this game stand out to me was how the king system worked, I think more of them should be added.

What do you guys want to see in the future ?</description>

            <p>Well the title is kinda click bait. If you read what I said below is that I wanted people to list what they wanted to see in the future. It’s not bad to suggest what the fans would like to see implemented in a game they like.<br>
Yes a game does need constant updates no matter what type of game it is to keep people interested. Your time zone is to blame here, when I log in people already started games of 12-16.</p>

            <p>Does a game like Throne of Lies actually need a lot of new content to keep people’s interest? I would expect not. It couldn’t hurt for sure, but this game has an infinite amount of permutations in each and every game with the classes already in game.</p>
<p>What ToL really needs is advertisement via word of mouth.</p>
<p>Tell your friends about the game. Rave about it to ensure the success of this game and to further enrich the community… and to make it so I don’t have to wait 45 minutes to get into an alpha game.</p>
