    <title>Biggest Problem to the Health of This Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/biggest-problem-to-the-health-of-this-game/9913</link>
    <description>We need more neutral classses, **especially** some that can be beneficial to BD.

I&#39;m tired of day 2 king pointing at somebody and saying &quot;Not Ally&quot; and they all jump on somebody.

It should be a strategic decision. I want the king to have to have to think twice about killing a neutral player.

Then hopefully the &quot;NEUTS OUT&quot; meme would die.

It would also make all the neutral classes _much_ better to play.</description>

            <p>Well yeah I still think the BD king at least somewhat needs the ability, just on the basis that with no special abilities for the starting king, it just makes sense to kill the first king ASAP if he brings nothing to the table that the next king won’t have. For the most part the table as a whole has a 2/3 odds of being BD, while the king has a 1/3 chance of being BD, it’s a safe smart first kill.</p>
<p>That being said if it’s moved to just to detect unseen/cult. which don’t lose the second one of their members is detected. It’s a more beneficial all around gameplay mechanic. It isn’t utter what are the odds for a king to go 4 days without finding 1 neut/unseen. because he’s looking for 2-3/15 targets, instead of 5-9/15 possible targets. It isn’t unbelievable to not hit a cult, it is unbelievable to not hit a cult or a neutral.</p>

            <p>Definitely agree that the BD King should not have any investigative powers at all, let alone be able to find Neutrals. At the very least all Kings can see Neutrals as “Ally”.</p>

            <p>an idea… what if good king had the exact oposite problem evil king used to. What if good king could not differentiate BD from neuts.</p>
<p>IMO the main reason neuts out is such a big thing, is the king, he’s the one investigative that while you don’t know his alignment, you know with certanty he is an investigative.</p>

            <p>It depends of the situation. Let’s say your prince, you jail a random person, and he claims alch, i absolutly don’t advise executing him.</p>
<p>But if King finds a “not ally” person and that person claims alch, i think it makes sense to execute.</p>
<p>The big difference is, in the first scenario, the unseen/cult would probably claim some sort of BD role anyways.</p>
<p>But in the second scenario, it makes perfect sense for the unseen to claim alch.</p>

<p>You actually have a point. Games where people just blindly sheep the king every days and replaced him if they dislike him are boring.</p>
<p>But it remains that unless you have a very good reason, “not ally” reports should generally be executed.</p>

            <p>I’m wondering if it wouldn’t be better if Good King also got told BD/Neutral/Bad.</p>
<p>The problem is generally speaking, its better to just execute those “not ally” reports. Mathematically, its like 50% chance to be a bad dude, and even if its a neut, neut are exactly that, neuts, they’re not necesserily good for BD.</p>

            <p>Pretty much, though I’ve seen a shift away from “murder them all” on Alchs of late.</p>
<p>Best to out yourself to the King ASAP.  All Kings can use an Alch.</p>

            <p>Yeah people don’t have a problem with Alchemists themselves I don’t think, it’s just a very common fake claim for bad guys.</p>

            <p>It would make sense if Alch usually sided with BD, but for some reason they’re usually regarded as Kill On Sight (possibly because alch is a fairly common false claim).</p>

            <p>It also needs to be Offense/Killer so that “not allied, off/killer” doesn’t instantly mean murder them.</p>
<p>As it is Reapers have to pretend to be Knights and Butlers most of the time.  Then they get seen as not-BD and… they’re done for.  They can’t jump away if they buy time, they’re just screwed most of the time.</p>
<p>Alchs often end up being extra BD in my experience.  They heal people for the most part and occasionally snipe suspected Fools at night.  They’ll swap sides if it comes to it, but the math favors them helping BD most of the time, especially since Evil wants them dead so they can’t heal bleeds/poisons anymore.</p>

            <p>Definitely agree, but balancing will be hard, since the new neutral classes will be competing for player slots with BD and the other neutrals.  Also, the new neutrals would need to be, uh, neutral enough so that they aren’t effectively just extra BD members.  It’s important that they CAN be beneficial to BD without being forced to, because if they’re reliably in favor of one faction, that means that games that roll certain classes will be imbalanced.</p>
<p>Right now, the issue is that all of the neutrals are either hostile or potentially hostile to BD in one way or another (Scorned wants to get innocents killed, Fool’s goal benefits Cult/Unseen by delaying executions, Alchemist has little to offer BD and is [I think] a common false claim, Mercenary loyalty will shift if the person they’re protecting is converted [or was evil to begin with], and obviously Possessor and Reaper just want to kill everyone).</p>
<p>Neutrals are harder to come up with since they need to have goals other than “kill the other team” (we have two with a goal of “kill everyone” but making more of these would be detrimental to the goal in your post).  In general I like the classes we have now (the Fool in particular was a clever twist to the game that I really appreciated), but we definitely need neutrals that aren’t just unaffiliated evils.</p>

            <p>We need more neutral classses, <strong>especially</strong> some that can be beneficial to BD.</p>
<p>I’m tired of day 2 king pointing at somebody and saying “Not Ally” and they all jump on somebody.</p>
<p>It should be a strategic decision. I want the king to have to have to think twice about killing a neutral player.</p>
<p>Then hopefully the “NEUTS OUT” meme would die.</p>
<p>It would also make all the neutral classes <em>much</em> better to play.</p>
