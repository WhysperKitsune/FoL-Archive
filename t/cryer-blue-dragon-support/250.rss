    <description>Day Ability: N/A

Night Ability: Cry
3 times per game, you may cry out to another person. That person will visit you instead of whomever they targeted. If that person did not do anything, they will not visit.

Lore: You want everyone to live happily enough to where you are willing for anything to happen to you, rather than someone else take the hit. That person could be doing anything, from good intentions to evil intentions.
