    <title>Ritual Mafia 2 - Heretics and The Elementalist Win!</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/ritual-mafia-2-heretics-and-the-elementalist-win/72416</link>
    <description>## :skull: [color=darkred]Welcome to Ritual Mafia[/color] :skull: 
In Ritual mafia The Congregation (town faction) must fight against The Heretics (mafia faction) in order to gain the favor of their gods. How do you gain their favor? By sacrificing your own teammates on a ritual, of course!

Also every class has a high-risk/high-reward ability that can give your team an advantage if used correctly. However you must be careful, use it without thinking and you will face the wrath of the gods.

## :skull: [color=darkred]What&#39;s new?[/color] :skull: 
If you played the first Ritual Mafia, this is what has changed:
* Day 1 no longer has a Ritual phase. 
* Ritual votes are now done privately in the player&#39;s class cards instead of publicly.
* Several class changes and reworks.
* Medium is now Unique
* Inquisitor was nerfed and is now called &quot;The Minister&quot;
* All Heretic classes now have a new ritual ability: Ritual of Resonance, which allows them to keep talking in Heretic chat if they are sacrificed.
* New Traitor classes that replace the 4th Heretic. Traitors win with Heretics but won&#39;t join their chat. 1 Random Traitor will always spawn.

### :skull: [color=darkred]Gameplay[/color] :skull: 
* Day is divided in two phases: Ritual Phase and Lynch 
* There won&#39;t be a Ritual phase on Day 1.
* Ritual Phase lasts 24 hours
* During the Ritual phase people are able to vote for a person to sacrifice. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the phase will be sacrificed and their Ritual abilities will trigger.
* Ritual votes are done privately through your classcards.
* Someone will always be sacrificed during this phase, and if there is a draw or no one gets any votes then it will be decided by RNG.  
* &quot;The Ritual was interrupted&quot; message means that the player&#39;s ritual abilities were prevented from triggering because of an ability.
* Self-voting is allowed in both Ritual and Lynch phases.
* Lynch Phase lasts 48 hours or until majority is reached.
* You can submit the target(s) of your ritual effects at any point in time before you are sacrificed so the ritual effects take place immediately.
* If a lynch happens within the first 12 hours of the lynch phase and ritual targets&#39; haven&#39;t been chosen a grace period will be given to pick the targets.
* If the sacrificed player hasn&#39;t picked their targets on time their ritual ability will be skipped. If said player is a heretic, other heretics will be able to choose a target for them. Ritual of initiation cannot be skipped this way, and if no one picks a convert target for any reason it will be picked randomly.
* During the Lynch phase people are able to vote for a person to lynch. Once the majority has voted said person, they will be lynched. 
* Nights will be 24 hours long
* During the night you can submit your actions through your class card.
* You cannot target yourself with an ability unless stated otherwise.
* Players can only use one day ability each day and one night ability each night, unless stated otherwise.
* The Heretics will have a day/night chat.
* The most recent version of your logs will be shown when you die.
* You can submit deathnotes on kills. These can be text or pictures.
* There can be a maximum of 3 of each non-unique classes.
* There will be limited feedback. Most classes will only get &quot;You slept peacefully.&quot; or &quot;You died&quot; as feedback. The exceptions are the following:

[details=&quot;List of night results&quot;]
If you use an investigative ability and you are redirected (you will not know who you are redirected to): You were forced to target someone else.
_If an investigative ability fails because of occupation/prevention: You were unable to perform your action._
_If a Martyr uses Penitence for the second time on a target: Your target&#39;s class type is [class type]._
_If you receive a private message because of the Confession day ability: Someone sent you an anonymous message [message]._
_If a Medium uses Seance on a dead player: You got the following message from your Seance: [message]._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is not suspicious: Your target is not suspicious._
_If a Diviner uses Divination and the player is suspicious: Your target is a member of the Heretics!_
_If one or more of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;At least one of your targets is a member of the Heretics!&quot;_
_If none of your targets are Heretics when using Diviner&#39;s Change of Faith: &quot;None of your targets are members of the Heretics&quot;_
_If you successfully predict a death with Oracle&#39;s Prediction: You gained 1 extra use of All-seeing Eye._

### :skull: [color=darkred]Other mechanics and interactions[/color] :skull: 

[details=&quot;Other mechanics/interactions&quot;]
* Conflicting abilities will be cancelled. For example, two Enchanters trying to redirect the same player to different targets would cause said player to not be redirected at all.
* Enchanter can only redirect targeted abilities.
* Self-killing or suicide abilities cannot be healed or prevented in any way except being occupied or by Voodoo Link.
* Dying because of Voodoo Link counts as a suicide.
* Blood Mage will die with Drain Blood as long as they have collected corrupted blood, even if they haven&#39;t
* Traitors can also be converted with &quot;Ritual of Initiation&quot;. This will change their class to a Heretic class of the same type and add them to the &quot;Heretics&quot; chat.
* If a Witch Doctor dies to &quot;Blood for Blood&quot; instead of a Heretic because of Voodoo Link the Warlock will gain the effects of the ability
* If you are prevented from visiting one of your &quot;Change of Faith&quot; targets you will not be notified and get a result based on the remaining players.
* If you are redirected during &quot;Change of Faith&quot; you will know you were redirected, but not to which player and get a result based on the new target.
* If an enchanter redirects an ability that targets more than 1 player, only the first target will be redirected.
* If your limited use ability fails for any reason you will still spend an use.
* If a Chanel Spirit&#39;s target is changed the ability will fail.
* Communication abilities like Seance and Clergy are instant so you cannot be occupied/redirected while using them and they don&#39;t count as visiting.
* A target of Channel Spirit will not get notified when the effect ends due to conversion.
* The medium will visit the targets of the channeled spirit.
* If the last Heretic is sacrificed, Town will NOT win, since the conversion triggers immediately (unless their Ritual abilities are disabled somehow).
* If two Witch Doctors use voodoo link on each other and one of them dies, then both will die.
