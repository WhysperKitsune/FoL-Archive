            <p>The former is terrible if you compare it to the capabilities of the Sage for instance, who can also block or redirect heals, but more importantly he can block them from the MM without having to know who the invests are. Same accounts for Duchess, who can protect way better even by producing a false negative in invests’ logs. The Servant has to know who to block. Sage/Duchess don’t need that kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>No Unseen convert should stay a convert for more than 2 nights, so your Alcoholic argument is moot. Alcoholic is vastly better than Servant, just like Drunk tends to be seen as better than Butler, if it weren’t for Butler’s poison. That is exactly the thing I am advocating for the Servant needs. Something more than a lesser carbon copy of his unconverted counterpart.</p>
<p>Actually you can’t block OE or hunter’s wolf or prince execution, because the former two do not count as visits. You can only block the Knight’s CS, which both the Alcoholic and Sage can do as well, granted the Alcoholic needs to know the knight, but the Alcoholic can also debauch an outed healer. Sage can just tornado himself out of it.</p>

</aside>
<p>The ability to lock down invests and healers without revealing who you are. Other Unseen have caviots when trying, for example you can’t kill them at the same time with Poacher and you can only do it twice as Drunk.</p>
<p>Also you can tank attacks such as OE without suspicion. That’s very useful when you are accusing someone.</p>

            <p>Why is he a super strong unseen convert?? What does he do better than other unseen converts? Once he turns Assassin, he completely loses his proving ability and party is useless as a defensive skill, because the Servant usually needs to die, so that the MM can reconvert. The Alcoholic has a stronger occupation in the form of Happy Hour AND he has royal blood on top of that, which is hugely important, because that opens up convert slots. Literally all other unseen classes are unique in that they can do something different than their unconverted counterpart, so even from an uniqueness point of view, Servant is completely bland. His unconverted counterpart has more options than he has. Unseen also has no easy time killing BD king, because if they have a servant, they do not have something like an enforcer to pierce king’s guards. Typically they cannot do it with voting power, because that is only viable endgame and king has doublevotes. Poison from the assassin would be the same solution as this, so that should also not matter. I am not saying that Servant needs exactly king poison, but he does need something else. He is way underpowered compared to all other unseen converts, except Herbalist.</p>

            <p>Servant is literally a weaker Butler. No other unseen class is actually confirmed weaker than their unconverted counterpart. Servant needs more than this and I personally am always saddened if I have converted one.</p>
