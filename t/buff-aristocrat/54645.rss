<p>Only negative about this is that it is too similar to the noble.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>honestly I can’t say being too similar is a negative…</p>
<p>The biggest thing about noble is he’s got like 40 ways to confirm himself. and almost all of them are too the stregnth level that buffing or replacing them would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>IE the vote manipulations… half of their value is the ability to slip past bd… “prove yourself” as noble and then have a good shot at the throne if your buddies or the NK get the king. Obviously if it were made stronger, it would actually be weaker if people could tell it from the nobles ability.</p>
<p>snoop, is another possible noble test… people could put keywords etc… into their journals to test if you really are noble… and so that kind of has to stay.</p>
<p>only noble power that could really be buffed up… is maid spy could add multi targets or something.</p>

            <p>Noble is actually a must keep BD roie. Because of its snoop.</p>
<p>Most players tend to have <strong>NO</strong> logs or <strong>Double</strong> logs</p>
<p>With this ability. Noble can report back to the court with good information</p>
<p>Anyway to aristrocrat</p>
<p>Aristrocrat is useful to find important BD roles and to kill them. Only negative about this is that it is too similar to the noble. The aristrocrat can get unseen to win. is finding important players that could be useful to bd such as merc and alch. This case. If aristrocrat uses their 2 snoops before assassin. Then they can win</p>

            <p>Well I do have to say, as aristocrat, he is darn powerful in several ways… he’s royal blood, he’s “confirmable” to BD etc… Even as is I’ll fully admit, if I can find a noble as MM… While the noble may be only as strong as his bd counterpart… in the wrong hands those powers value is soo much greater. Once you know you have noble blood, you know there’s great benefits to killing the king. While you have the vote… your goal for majority is one less.</p>
<p>I remember winning one of my worse games ever (total crap luck, assasain caught day 2, 2 failed conversions in a row. But the possesor killed the king, and I paid close attention to the election to find a noble and princess (neither claimed on the election, and they drew). So I imidiately refocused my target to one of them… he managed to talk his way up to king the next day, and that was more or less enough to pull the unseen out of the jaws of certain defeat.</p>

            <p>I think Aristocrat is powerful just because they’re converted.</p>
<p>Usually, their abilities as Noble aren’t needed as it’s usually a BD majority.</p>
