    <title>Poss jump problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/poss-jump-problem/79758</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
The poss jumped and in the player list the jump showed as &quot;possessor&quot; in blue when it was supposed to show the disguise class. This happened a couple of games.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The player list should show the disguised class when the poss jumps.
#### Steps to reproduce:
Be poss. Disguise as BD. Jump someone.

            <p>To add to this, you don’t have to claim a BD class for this to happen. It also happens on other types of disguised classes.</p>
