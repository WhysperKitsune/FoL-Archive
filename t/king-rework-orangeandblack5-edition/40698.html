          <p>King is in an awkward spot.</p>
<p>It seems to be largely agreed upon that Allies isn’t condusive to fun gameplay when on anybody other than the evil King. Even in its current form, it acts like a stronger Princess, locking down claimspace in a way that affects how the scum have to act even if the Good King hasn’t spawned.</p>
<p>Some other aspects of his design could use a bit of love too - the removal of trials for a day is an awkward punishment for killing the starting Good King, and while Decide Fate is extremely powerful, people forcing you to use Royal Finger can rob you of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>As such, I have been working on the following suggestion for over a year now. It refocuses the King on its social and supportive aspects and generally streamlines its design in a way that is more cohesive overall.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><big><strong>The King</strong></big><br>
<strong>Random Special</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head of State (Passive)</strong> - Your vote counts as two until you use <em>Decide Fate</em>, and you can talk at all points in a trial. If you are the starting <strong><font color="steblue">Good King</font></strong> and you are executed, members of the Blue Dragon with royal blood will no longer gain extra votes to be King.</p>
<p><strong>Tenacity (Passive)</strong> - Immune to being occupied at night and immune to target changing. If you are the <strong><font color="darkred">Psychopathic King</font></strong>, this ability also makes you immune to death at night.</p>
<p><strong>Decide Fate (Day)</strong> - Decide the fate of a player on trial. This removes the extra vote from your Head of State passive permanently. <em>(1 use)</em></p>
<p><strong>Royal Finger (Day)</strong> - Resets all votes. Only you or your target may be voted for the rest of the day. <em>(2 uses)</em><br>
<strong>Replaced by:</strong><br>
<font color="grey"><strong>Hide (Day)</strong></font> - <strong><font color="grey">Neutral King</font></strong> exclusive. Nobody will be able to visit you tonight, regardless of immunities to occupation or preventions. <em>(2 uses)</em></p>
<p><strong>Guards! (Night)</strong> - Have a guard protect you tonight. You will be immune to death tonight. <em>(2 uses)</em><br>
<strong>Replaced by:</strong><br>
<font color="darkred"><strong>Order Execution (Night)</strong></font> - <strong><font color="darkred">Psychopathic King</font></strong> exclusive. Send a guard to kill a player. <em>(Infinite uses)</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Starting King exclusive powers (these replace the standard Guards!):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guard Escort (Night)</strong> - Send guards to protect your target from attack, making them immune to death, occupation, and redirection tonight. <em>(3 uses)</em><br>
If you are the starting <strong><font color="steblue">Good King</font></strong>, this also protects your target against conversion.<br>
If you are the starting <strong><font color="purple">Evil</font>/<font color="red">Cult King</font></strong>, you have an extra use, it makes your target appear as Blue Dragon to investigations, and you may target yourself.</p>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Guards! (Night)</strong></font> - Starting <strong><font color="steblue">Good King</font></strong> exclusive. Have a guard protect you tonight. You will be immune to death tonight. <em>(3 uses)</em><br>
<font color="purple"><strong>Allies</strong></font> <font color="red"><strong>(Night)</strong></font> - Starting <strong><font color="purple">Evil</font>/<font color="red">Cult King</font></strong> exclusive. Discover if a player is a member of your faction. <em>(4 uses)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I know it can look a bit intimidating all on one card, but if you take time to look at each King individually I think the benefits of this suggestion far outweigh its drawbacks. Here’s what that looks like in practice, with the unique parts of each card colored for clarity, and <strong><font color="#DAA520">yellow</font></strong> representing the starting Kings:</p>

<p>As you can see, the cards for each King type are actually pretty similar, with only the starting Kings having Assist added to their abilities and one other large change per (Head of State’s penalty for Starting Good King and Allies for Starting Evil and Devout Kings). They each have a renewed focus on their Social and Support aspects, which I feel will lead to better overall gameplay than their previous Killer and current Investigative formats.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading, I’ve been working on this for over a year now, so it does mean a lot to me. If you think there’s any further ways I can improve this suggestion, I’d really appreciate you letting me know.</p>

          <p>I like Head of State. It’s annoying to have to use royal finger.</p>
<p>I’m against Royal Summons, since it is pretty much like Prince, although you know who the Prince is.</p>
<p>Royal Court seems nice, since it doesn’t show evils who is giving you information.</p>
<p>Starting Guards blocking converts helps King, though not much. I think it works.</p>
<p>I’d personally just ditch Royal Summons, and then you can keep Psycho King mostly the same, just giving him Head of State. Overall pretty good.</p>
