            <p>This is a really interesting and in-depth thread and what I really love is how the Lone Wolf does not now whether a convert failed or not, and the converts do not know his identity, meaning the game would require much more thought and strategy. I hope it makes it into the game!</p>

            <p>prehaps change it into they cannot use here day abilities and you recieve there feedback instead for wording it would be a bit clearer what you mean (if it was also ment to prevent vote you need to add that in but as far as i could get it it was the first only)</p>

<li>The Minion is converted from The Butler AND The Drunk. They each have their respective passives/abilities however.</li>
<li>Thanks.</li>
<li>No one hears him but you and he doesn’t know.</li>
<li>You can copy ability 1 or 2. It will only have one charge however.</li>
<li>Thanks.</li>
<li>Gunna fix that right now.</li>
<li>Watchdog can poison people.</li>
<li>You misunderstood. It’s like a necromancer style ability.</li>
<li>The Ability will not notify the target??? What are you talking about?</li>
<li>1st Use = 1st Clue , 2nd Use = 2nd Clue</li>
<li>Indeed. Decided to leave Alchemist alone. Had plans for him so he would get converted.</li>
<li>TOTAL CHAOS FTW!!</li>
<li>They will get prevented and you get their abilities’ feedback. Change it or let it there?</li>
<li>Forgot to change them lol. Thanks for da feedback.</li>

<p>I don’t think the Devs want interaction between the living and dead, they’ve made sure to remove it from the game. This was because people would leave when they die when they shouldn’t.
