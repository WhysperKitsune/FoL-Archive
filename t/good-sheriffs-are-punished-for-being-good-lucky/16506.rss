    <title>Good sheriffs are punished for being good/lucky</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/good-sheriffs-are-punished-for-being-good-lucky/16506</link>
    <description>Was sheriff, scouted a guy and he got converted n1. After alot of accusations that I was scorned, in addition to me being voted up, we got him lynched day 2. N2 checked one of the non voters of the unseen (who also voted me up) which also came up as unseen. Lynched him day 3, was assassin. N3, I get executed by prince because he thought I was a gamethrowing/metagaming mastermind.
Needless to say, we lost the game to unseen.
People think sheriff is scorned before they get the unseen lynched, and mastermind after they turn up unseen, not proven? There has to be some solution to this! 
What do you guys think?</description>

            <p>I think what you described is an outlier and most Princes wouldn’t have done what he did.</p>
<p>I don’t blame people being suspicious of a very lucky Sheriff but I would hope that people would just investigate you and move on with the game.</p>

            <p>neutral just means they are not aligned with either faction.  not that they are morally good or bad .<br>
would it help you to cope with their abilities if they changed them to be called factionless</p>
<p>then you could invent a witty slogan like factionless means factionless …</p>

            <p>Neutral is just anyone who isn’t part of a faction. It says nothing about who they mostly help.</p>
<p>EX:</p>
<p>Inquisitor usually helps BD</p>
<p>NK’s Always hurt BD and usually Evils too</p>
<p>Fool and Scorned Hurt BD and usually help Evils</p>
<p>Merc Helps a specific player</p>
<p>Alch is the only true Neutral.</p>

            <p>Fool is pretty dumb to me. It’s win condition helps the evil and punished the BD but it’s neutral? Make it an evil class type.at least other neutrals have a choice to help BD minus scorned of course and NKs. Even the inquisitor can choose after winning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if in addition to not being able to vote the next day, killers wouldn’t be able to kill that night either? Would this be fair in punishing all factions for a Fool execution and make the Fool more of a “true” neutral?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>problem with that, is it isn’t a punishment at all… Killing a fool day 2, is a HUGE boon for BD… deaths are halted giving time for investigators to investigate, and giving breathing room to hold off on the executions until they have better leads to work with.</p>
<p>As much as I don’t like fool existing in general, I don’t think it can ever be tilted to the point where a day 2 claim “hey guys I’m fool, execute me today”, is a beneficial offer to take up.</p>

            <p>Fool covers the same Idea that Scorned does but less directly. It isn’t really necessary because the scorned exists and does it better but the fool is still fun to play and does its job (although not necessarily an important or even good job but still). I personally like the fool but I get that he isn’t that good for the game as a whole. I’m not particularly upset with the fool in the current patch due to the Hide ability making him much easier to find as fool rather than unseen or NK.</p>

            <p>I know it is. I acknowledged that twice now. I am saying that it is a necessary crutch at the moment. The ideal situation is the one Hippo mentioned. That being said that does not mean that the Scorned should be removed later if the player base changed (not that it would happen unless people stop joining) because not even a smart player would random accuse someone early game as unseen/cult. It just isn’t worth it until you have a full team or it is late game. Scorned has its place in the early game even with good players. The only problem is what to do after you win as scorned. Unfortionatly I don’t have an answer to that so ya. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>That’s a problem with the players, not with the game.</p>
<p>Scorned isn’t a fix to an issue, it’s a crutch.</p>

            <p>Ideally everyone would think to do this (like I said I made an entire post about it.). Unfortionetly people usually just bus one of their own. I would bus someone once as MM then late game accuse someone of being unseen. Since I am established to be creditable they get lynched and since it is late game it is too late for them to do something about it. GG no re. Unfortionitly the game does not have people doing that enough. They bus often enough but they rarely accuse anyone</p>

            <p>If we’re at max Unseen and MM has convert up I’ll often claim a random guy is unseen. He’ll die and it’s a win, I’ll die and we get to convert.</p>

            <p>The thing is that the evils never call anyone out as Unseen/(non-fool/scorned)Neut. It is either not worth it or the MM is busing someone instead. This means that a sheriff or obs calling someone out is telling the truth almost 100% of the time. The Scorned fixs this by simply being able to exist. Without the Scorned if the assassin is called out by a sheriff/obs claim then it doesn’t matter how good his claim is because the sheriff claim is never scum (remember unseen never accuse BD (even if this isn’t true it feels like it is and that is close enough) of being unseen). With the Scorned however there is usually at least 1 person out there who is trying to get BD accused and will claim sheriff to do so. I know that this is a meta problem that could be solved by having the unseen accuse BD as sheriff more (I made an entire post about it.) but the devs can’t directly control the meta like that without adding a class that punishes the BD for lynching them (aka fool/old poacher) which we already established is not the best idea to have a lot of.</p>

<p>Scorned decreases persuasion for everybody else though.</p>

<p>What if in addition to not being able to vote the next day, killers wouldn’t be able to kill that night either? Would this be fair in punishing all factions for a Fool execution and make the Fool more of a “true” neutral?</p>

<p>Scorned doesn’t make the game more about persuasion and lying, it reduces that effect.</p>

</aside>
<p>I mean, as a Scorned you literally have to persuade everyone and lie to hang your target, so it obviously increases that effect.</p>
