    <title>[Suggestion] The Exiled Queen (Unique)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/suggestion-the-exiled-queen-unique/37080</link>
    <description>&quot;She was not dead, she came back for... Power.&quot;
- The King

The Exiled Queen: Offensive Neutral Class
Goal: Step up and reclaim the Throne one more time!

Passives:

1- Im back!
If The Exiled Queen Steps up, she becomes que Queen, the Immune to death version of the King. The Queen cant be voted up for treason.

2- Failure
If the Exiled Queen cant get the throne back, she will commit suicide at the end of the game.

Day Abilitiy: Dark Potion: Makes you Immune to death tonight (3 uses)

Night Abilities:

Royal Check: Checks a player and verifies if they are Royal Blood members (Infinite Uses)

Betrayal: Kill a Player, does not work if you target non-royal members of the court. Does not kill the King. 3 Uses.


Strategy: Blue Dragon will not accept the exiled queen, since she can kill the Prince,Drunk, Princess and the Noble. You probably want to claim Alchemist 

Evil Faction/Neutral Killer can be Helpful for you, since they can kill Royal members. But watch out, evil can also step up!

Hope you like my idea! Thanks for reading!
