    <title>Buff Force Vote and Chill</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/buff-force-vote-and-chill/48375</link>
    <description>I think players who are forced to vote or chilled should &quot;abstain&quot; not be &quot;unable to vote&quot;.  This would not only buff political pressure and icy touch, but it would allow evils to fake-claim force-voted or chilled.  What do y&#39;all think?</description>

            <p>I just said it was implemented when only Order did it. It wasn’t clever strategy. It was just Nobles targeting random people with Order and those people getting executed just because of it.</p>
<p>I had forgotten it was a thing when I reimplemented vote blocking, so it’s going to removed.</p>

            <p>I mean, getting people wrongly executed <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be something Chill and other vote-manipulation powers can do.  That’s interesting and leads to clever strategies, as well as making BD make hard decisions (eg. “are they chilled or just faking it?”)</p>

            <p>Well it’s from back when Order was still a thing. At first it didn’t say they couldn’t vote, but people didn’t like it, so it was changed. Pretty sure it was due to the fact that it lead to people getting executed because they couldn’t vote.</p>
<p>Since there are more classes that block voting it can probably be removed.</p>
