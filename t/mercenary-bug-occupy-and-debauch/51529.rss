    <title>Mercenary Bug! - Occupy and Debauch</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/mercenary-bug-occupy-and-debauch/51529</link>
    <description>This happened on 2 separate occasions:
#### What happened?
I am mercenary as the title says and I stood by my target and my target claimed debauch. I asked him and how did he get debauched and he was puzzled but he told me he was debauched
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The drunk is supposed to get prevented because of my mercenary guard.
#### Steps to reproduce:
- Have a mercenary guard a target
- Tell the mercenary to guard
- And have a drunk debauch the target
#### Comments:
I find this a bug because mercenary visits should prevent occupation and target changing of the target, its like a prince jail.

#### What happened?
I was mercenary and I had a target. I stood guard by this target and the next day he claimed occupied.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
My guard was supposed to prevent occupation
#### Steps to reproduce:
- Find a mercenary
- Tell merc to stand guard
- Have a butler occupy their target
#### Comments:
This game just happened a few moments ago, but the drunk game was a few days ago. The first time I was like there was probably a mistake but the second time I thought it had to be a bug, this costed the cult the victory.</description>

            <p>I do not think so in all honesty. I mean the first time I would understand something like that could happen but the second time I would think otherwise.</p>

            <p>Are you sure the first time wasn’t a CW tornado?<br>
Also, are you sure the second time wasn’t from a butler party?</p>
