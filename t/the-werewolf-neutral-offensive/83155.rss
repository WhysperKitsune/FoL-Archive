        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I must say I kinda feel icky about Neutrals who focuses on killing. There’s already Cultseen + NK and only 8-9 BD depending on 2 or 3 neuts. Obviously the Werewolf could bleed Cultseen out as well but it feels like any game with a Werewolf just puts a lot more pressure on BD. With only Assassin/CL bleeding, a single healer can potentially keep up. Otherwise people will just die to bleeding a lot faster.</p>
<p>Additionally bleeding is very hit’n’miss depending on the amount of phys’es/alchs. I think with the bleed ability with a day’s cooldown it may also become a struggle for the Werewolf to actually win. And the win condition is to <em>live</em> to see two players die to bleed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Scent ability seems a bit strange - it can obviously be used to make healers redirect to you to ensure they wont heal the bleed, but that’s also pretty much spilling the beans then and there. Invokers can use this interaction to incriminate a BD but I think most of the time people will catch on to the Werewolf rather quickly - if nothing else when there’s more bleeds per day than should be.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also what’s the use of being permanently framed? You naturally appear Killer/Offensive to Flirt (with frame you appear Special/Invest), you appear incompatible to Matchmake with BD (framed doesn’t change this). Only exception is Sheriff/Paladin finding you as Cultseen. Oh and apparently also showing you visiting a killed target for Observer - forgot that last one.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what this is supposed to do for you other than make it extremely unlikely that you’ll live to see your win condition through to the end.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also this class has no good way to confirm themselves. They can claim Drunk that debs to themselves, but that just seems weird if you do that to supports all the time and makes you look like a SS. If you do it to invests it might just be the end of the road with a framed result. You might make NK/Assassin attack into you. I get you have one night of DI, but then you’re a goner next time.</p>
<p>I would not enjoy getting this class, and neither see it in a lobby.</p>
<hr>
<p>I suppose the entire idea you meant for this class is to focus around bleeding?</p>
<p>What if the Werewolf didn’t take much of an active part in bleeding targets but merely had a supportive subtheme to bleeds?</p>

            <p>Since this class gets countered by healer spawns, maybe something that disrupts them? Mass occ, unhealability, etc.</p>
