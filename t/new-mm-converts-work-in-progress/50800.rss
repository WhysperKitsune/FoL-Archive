    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-mm-converts-work-in-progress/50800</link>
    <description>**before you read, Please note that I am not looking to get these implemented into the game, this is just for fun. i get that this would be Overpowered, but this is 100% for fun**

Firstly, there is now a convert for Prince, Alchemist, Fool, and the Neutral Killers (Sorcerer, Reaper, Possessor). But they will still be convert immune, (Accept fool) the MM will have a new day ability called &quot;Bypass convert immunity&quot; (x2) which does as it says, the king and the inquisitor will be the only ones 100% unconvertable. 

Class: Kidnapper

Converts from: Prince

Abilities - 
Has the same ability set as prince, except can only execute every other night (1, 3, 5, 7) or (2, 4, 6, 8) and so on.

Class: Dominater

Converts from: Possessor

Abilites -

Day ability: Frame - Make a blue dragon or neutral player appear as unseen for a night

Night ability: Energy Transfer - Make one player target another (Can not make an unseen member target someone else)

Night ability: Harness Light - Make an unseen member appear as a different class, when they die they will show up as the selected class, and when an investigative class investigates them they will see what they would get for the class you selected, (Lasts for 3 days)

Class: Gatekeeper

Converts From: Reaper

Day ability: Paralyze - Makes the target incapable of speaking for the rest of the day

Day ability: Stalk - Make the target incapable of using their ability tonight

Night ability: Send To Abyss - Kill anyone visiting any of the members of the unseen (Max deaths per night is 3)

Will work on more later :slight_smile: Tell me if you like it so far!</description>

            <p>That is to OP, personally I don’t think it will be fun tbh</p>
<p>Kidnapper is terrible for BD, so playing as BD wouldn’t be fun</p>
<p>Converting NK would also be awful imo</p>
<p>The only things I would like are alch and fool converted forms</p>

            <p>Kidnapper would be so OP. Extra kills.</p>
<p>Also converting the NK would also be OP for Unseen</p>
