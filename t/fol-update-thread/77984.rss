<h1>Summary:</h1>
<p>Cowardly King was a legacy leftover back from survivor Alchemist that was then tacked unto old consecutive contract Mercenary. Two classcards for a niche king is unnecessary, so this was folded into one with only mild balance implications. In addition the classcards received some reformatting as to the order of neutrals/neutral killers/king variants. This used to be one section alphabetically and is now alphabetically per neutral with its king variant and one section with neutral killers.</p>

<h1>Summary:</h1>
<p>The Old Cult are a relic from the past where confirmability was a scourge. Now that confirmability has been rooted out, they can be updated to a version that is not only more loyal to current ToL, but also easier to understand and pickup. They function as a counterpart to the Unseen that relies on a strong base and actually benefit from keeping the converts alive over the originals in multiple ways. The converts have limited use abilities and the Cult Leader’s killpower gets refreshed upon being promoted. (Note here that Assassin’s usages are shared and this card doesn’t have that, by default uses aren’t shared)</p>
<p>In addition, some QoL updates to Hunter and Chronomancer. Hunter was nerfed too hard after it was made nonunique and can now be more faithful to the ToL version while getting back up to par with its Knight and Archer counterparts. Chronomancer suffers from limited feedback, maybe more so than other classes, so the additional restriction of self delaying not working is removed.</p>
