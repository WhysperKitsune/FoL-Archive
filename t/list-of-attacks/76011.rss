<p>These ones are standout in that healers will not be notified that the player was unable to be healed iirc.</p>
<p>I’d give them their special category due to distinction.</p>

            <p>I feel like the goal was to distinguish different types for clarification purposes, but yet: inquisitor is an unhealable attack and not a normal, which is logical; but paladin smite is both unhealable and normal, which is not logical. It is unhealable, not normal. And it can’t be empowered either.</p>
<p>Also I am quite sure the hunter bear is not a visiting attack - so if the observer follows the assassin who attacks a bearing hunter, it won’t show that hunter visited the assassin.</p>
