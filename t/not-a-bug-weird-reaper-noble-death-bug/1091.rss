    <title>[Not a bug] Weird Reaper/Noble death bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/not-a-bug-weird-reaper-noble-death-bug/1091</link>
    <description>####What happened?
In a gameplay, I, as a Noble was apparently Reaped but insted of me showing up dead, it was my other Noble comrade. **However**, i was talking in dead chat but didn&#39;t appear to be dead on the &#39;action phase&#39; of the chat, nor the names/numbers list. So, the Reaper did get his target correct but the display of the actions that took place were more then misleading.

**Screenshots:**

**Note:** William Forde never spoke to me, so maybe he was afk. Perhaps he couldn&#39;t see the chat, or that me and him were the same person (Same role, different names)?

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?
•My name was supposed to be highlighted in **red** next to the skull, not William Forde&#39;s name.
•The end game screen displays both **Andrew Atlee&#39;s**(Me) and **William Forde&#39;s** names in &#39;green&#39;, indicating that we were alive when **I** clearly wasn&#39;t.
So, appearence issue most likely? Seems like it, though I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a problem with the Reaper or Nobles. I haven&#39;t experience this kind of problem with the Noble role before.

####Steps to reproduce:
Coding, mumbojumbo. XD
 
####Comments:
I&#39;m not sure if anyone else have had this issue before. I don&#39;t want to spam the ReportBug section, but I feel every little helps, and i want this game to be smooth and clean of ugly imperfections like the one i&#39;ve experienced. :)</description>
