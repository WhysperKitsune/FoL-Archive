    <title>Small reaper rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/small-reaper-rework/72971</link>
    <description>Circle of Death used to be a great ability that was a counter to different plays (such as prince outing d1) and was an interesting way of killing multiple people at once if you can successfully predict who is going to be visited the most. It forced BD to split their protective and healing abilities amongst several people/days so that you wouldn’t lose all your physicians at once if sorc circled a guy. However, once this ability was moved to reaper, it has become totally unplayable since there is usually no point in wasting 2 souls to get an unpredictable outcome (killings-wise). So what if you probably change its cost to 3 souls but you also gain a soul for every person you’ve killed with this ability? (or 1 soul for 2 people, if that looked OP).  This will still prevent the reaper from using it completely randomly but instead reward him if his prediction on who is gonna be visited is correct. For now, dying from reaper’s circle is an incredibly rare thing which is never even taken into consideration, so people don’t play around it at all, and I think this or some other rework of this ability making it viable would encourage people to avoid visiting same target all together (how it was before). It doesn’t look like an OP buff for me because you will still lose souls in many cases such as: merc guard (who is likely to guard the same obvious target), sellsword stonewall (you will only kill SS themself), butler wine (unlike the old sorc, reaper is not occ inmune) and others. 

 Please share your thoughts.</description>

            <p>Hm, maybe you could have it refund the cost if you killed at least two people with it. That way, there’s no chance for it to yield a crazy number of souls, but it gives it a good niche to use if you believe somebody will be visited by several people.</p>

            <p>I once got 4 kills with a Circle of death because I put on a poisoned guy. I agree that the lack of soul gaining hurts a little - but the chance to gain so many kills makes up for it imo.</p>
