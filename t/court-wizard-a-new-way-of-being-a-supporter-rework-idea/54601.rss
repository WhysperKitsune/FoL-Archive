    <title>Court Wizard. A new way of being a Supporter! (Rework Idea)</title>

    <description>Day Ability [Enhance]: Enhance the night ability of a specific Player making one of their Abilities stronger. The enhanced player may decide which enhanced ability they want to use.
(Implying the receiving Player got two abilities.)

This would truly be a supportive Ability. But I&#39;m worried how it would be implemented. Every night ability in the game would have to be changed a little bit. And some roles might have abilities that can&#39;t be enhanced.

For example how to enhance the Prince? Give him a &quot;free pass&quot; to execute a BD, so that he doesn&#39;t lose his killing Power? Or make him unable to receive this buff, the same way as Mystic wasn&#39;t been able to link the Prince for a short period of time.

But looking at it the other way, it would give a huge opportunity for the CW to make good plays. He might have to think about which Player he should give his buff. Should he give it to the Sheriff, so that he can check two Persons at Night or to the Butler to give him two occupies at night or invite another Player to his Party while partying? Should he give it to the Princess to give her the exact class type of a player or get two flirts out or the Physician to heal two persons at night?

Those are some ideas how to enhance some abilities.

What if he buffs the NK or a Killer like the Alchemist or the Assassin when those persons persuaded him into thinking they are BD? He gives them a free extra Kill.

This would lead to the next question. Would he be overpowerd?
There are some ways to prevent that. Making him unique while making this ability 1 or 2 use. This would reward evil roles for fooling a CW.

In the end, this ability would add a new layer of deduction to him while keeping him a supporter. He would have more power while but not only distributed to him only but also to the person receiving his buff.

Since he would be a important role for BD he could maybe get another Day Ability to make him night immune for 1 or 2 nights.

His night abilities should stay the same since those are important and unique abilities fitting for a supporter!</description>

            <p>The way it’s listed RN is impossible to fake claim.</p>
<p>I’d not have an ability like this actualy give any definitive indication that it happened. For example an invest class would not be effected by frames or tailors. A killer would bypass night immunity and a Butler would bypass Occupy Immunity. No need to alert them that there was anything to bypass or that a CW helped them.</p>
