<p>Could abilities that interact with dead players be more viable if everyone who dies gets notified which classes are still alive that can interact with them?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. Dead interaction is an all or nothing thing. Because you either need enough of it to justify EVERYONE staying, or you don’t bother and let everyone leave. We already tried the former and it didn’t work. The latter is working just fine however.</p>

            <p>In this case, death interaction would work a bit better since players who have had pray used on them could be motivated to stay by being told they can be resurrected.</p>
<p>Could abilities that interact with dead players be more viable if everyone who dies gets notified which classes are still alive that can interact with them?<br>
I know I’d be more willing to stay if I knew that I could become a death knight or could report my last night results to a psychic.</p>

            <p>I think the idea is you ‘Mark’ people, and only they could be revived.</p>
<p>I don’t hate the idea, but it’s meh for me.</p>

            <p>I think death knight was a bit too powerful in the past so I personally wouldn’t try and bring it back.</p>
<p>While I agree with the problem Wolf pointed out, I also believe that this death knight sounds a lot more powerful and my problem is that it needed nerfing, not buffing.</p>

            <p>I remember when dk was brought back to court. Information from the dead was very valuable. Not sure about now (2 months since I last played) but phys was a POWERHOUSE and the unconvertible dks were really strong. Personally I wouldn’t bring back such a class.</p>
<p>Tell me what you guys think though. DK in the past. Was it good? Able to guard people in the dark. Was it good?</p>

            <p>Another thing I’ve noticed even though they are likely not gonna be brought back. Why make the reserrection a two part thing with infinte prays when you can only use reserrection once? Would be kinda pointless</p>
