    <title>[Bug]Did not die after killing someone with knight guard the second time</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/bug-did-not-die-after-killing-someone-with-knight-guard-the-second-time/73274</link>
    <description>#### What happened? I was knight, killed assassin night 1 with defend. Killed second assassin N2 with defend, I did not die even though I lost my &quot;armoured&quot; passive

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen? I should have died when I killed the second assassin

#### Steps to reproduce: I got conduited with someone N1, but defended someone else and got my first kill. I got my second kill while defending the person I was conduited with N2. Dunno if that had any impact but I rather add in case that had some effect due to weird glitch.

For some reason, I can only add 1 photo and not my output log so I will attempt to add a second screenshot of N2 in a reply to this post
