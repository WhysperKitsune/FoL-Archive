####What was SUPPOSED to happen?
The fullscreen option should make the game fullscreen when checked and windowed when unchecked.

####Steps to reproduce:
Run game in DX12, starting it non-windowed.

####Comments:
Not sure if it works correctly starting in windowed mode.</description>

            <p>Try unchecking it then press apply. When it shows the pop-up “Keep settings” you will get your windowed game. However, it looks like you can’t go back to fullscreen. Also, this happens in every version.</p>
