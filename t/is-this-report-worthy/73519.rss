    <title>Is this report worthy?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/is-this-report-worthy/73519</link>
    <description>I was playing a lot of TOL lately and was enjoying myself doing so. But i came across a couple of games where i was reported for my actions. I want to know if i can be reported for what i did.

In one of my games i was Hunter and jailed on N5. Then i was executed by the Prince due to not wolfing anyone. Afterwords i was then reportable by Prince and a couple of other players in the game because they said &quot;I did not prove myself as a provable class&quot; 

In another game i was playing as a phys. There was an outed alch so i whispered him saying to heal me if i heal him. We were good for a couple of nights and then during the day i was put on trail by the court. They wanted to execute me because they didn&#39;t believe that a phys would heal an alch. I was then executed and the Alch i was healing was the person pushing for me to be executed. Afterwords they said to report me because i was healing an alch and not BD members(The alch also reported me). More than half of the people in the game then reported me to my knowledge 

Should i have been reported for what i did.</description>

            <p>Dw I get called a “Retard” and that I need reporting for any mistake even when it isn’t even close to reportable and players who spam report and all that are normally bad players themselves that don’t even know what throwing is in the first place.</p>

<p>This isn’t too much a good play, but is worth buying time and favour of Alch.<br>
I don’t see the problem here.</p>

            <p>tbh, the ones reporting you should be punished for false reporting.</p>
<p>Nothing you did was reportable. They cannot tell you how to play your class. Forcing someone to play by a “meta” is stupid. There CAN be cases made for intentionally playing badly, but its EXTREMELY hard to prove, however, I dont even think you played badly.</p>
<p>Its like saying “Report the prince who exed you for exeing a bd with no proof” - Absolutely stupid lol.</p>

            <p>Definition of gamethrowing: “Trying to lose” or alternatively “Trying to against your win condition”.</p>
<p>Your actions are irrelevant. What matters is your intent which is very clearly to win (successful or otherwise)</p>
<p>Remember it is possible to gamethrow by accusing and executing the Mastermind as Blue Dragon at a time that benefits your faction</p>

            <p>For the hunter game: No, you arent obligated to prove yourself immediately. It is usually good to do so but is not required. Its also sometimes good to save wolves.<br>
For the phys game: No, unless BD were poisoned or had important targets that the alch was not healing. Because then you are intentionally not helping your team and letting them die. That is a case for gamethrowing but its probably not enough to warrant any punishment.</p>
<p>In short, you’re fine. Don’t worry.</p>
