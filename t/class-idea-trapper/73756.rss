    <description>Trapper
Unique Blue dragon support
Passive ability 1:key holder, not prevented on jailed targets
Passive ability 2:?, knows who is jailed every night

Day ability 1
Trapdoor:Places a trap on a target, when target uses Day ability it traps them, only restring ability to vote, target will be jailed thenight they are trapped (2 uses)

Day ability 2
Tunnels:Chooses if target can talk to other jailed and prince or not, prince switches between 2 like mystic if ladder(infinite uses) 

Night ability 1
Assisted execution:execute one of the jailed targets, if used when prince exes then prince retains use.(1 use)(available night 3)

Night ability 2
Rearm Trap:adds one use to trap

I kinda made this to be a prince helper, as with trap prince can get 2 people jailed at once and kinda gets an extra exe
Also this is the first thing I made so mistakes were likely made. Sorry
I also can’t really think of a name for second ability</description>

            <p>Prince doesn’t really need a hard buff at the moment, as it’s like the most powerful class in the game for blue dragon…</p>
