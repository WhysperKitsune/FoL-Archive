    <title>The Megalomaniac [Neutral Class] fanmade</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/the-megalomaniac-neutral-class-fanmade/71643</link>
    <description>This class might look weird but i tried to difine him by his lore as best as i could so balance might still be off here and there also i just make classes like this for one and i could prob think of way more wacky lore classes but for the next something i might want something that is balanced so i will try and work that out well enjoy the class.

**The Megalomaniac**

Neutral Offensive
**Determined (Passive)** - Immune to death at night once will kill this passive even when his class is changed
**Fake testament (Day)** - Fake a testament grating you royal right to the throne giving you the Royal Blood passive for the next day. - 2 uses
**Stalk (Night)** Discover if  the target is either **The Cult Leader**, **The Prince** or **The Mastermind**.- infinte uses
**Opress (Night)** Force a player to target you if its not a conversion prevent it and occupy him instead bypasses occupy immunity -2 uses

**Win condition:** Become  **The king** or a member of the unseen or cult and fullfill there win conditions 
if **The megalomaniac** becomes king he becomes a **Psycho king**

unseen version; The crazed lacky
**Driven (Passive)**  -  Immune to occupation at night and immune to most target changing
**Determined (Passive)** - Immune to death at night once
**Endurens Training (Day)** occupy yourself tonight - infinite uses
**Forage (Night)** forage for nightshade in the forest giving **The Assassin** an extra charge of Nightshade
**Combat training** Occupy **The Assassin** and give him an extra charge of two for one bypasses occupy imunity -1 charge

**lore** The Megalomaniac was born as a peasant son being the youngest of 5 he was always serving his parents and older brother but deepinside he knew he was ment for something greater and the first time he stood before the court he realised something. These fools dont even know there own man, there own family , there own children how can these person even rule the country! no wonder so many died in the war if the can&#39;t even do something simpel as recognising there own children then these fools are not worthy of the Throne.</description>

            <p>I might disagree with you there buddy it should be easier then it seems to fulfill these wincons since you just need to either find the evil and join there ranks wich you can even force them into with your opress and with Fake testament you should be on equal ground with the election with the other royal bloods he can even stay alive trough 1 attack giving him just that much more resistence to be granted he is not a alc or merc but hes wincon is easier and he is more of a treat of a Neutral Offensive if he becomes king as the new class offender but less wen not if you would know a wincon better then that or just a way for this class to do what it does better as i said i happly see what others think of it<br>
as a side node you can even find the prince using your stalk abillity wich can be very usefull info if a prince does not out himself and can be a real help to evils wich is also something to keep in mind friend</p>

            <p>Like I said. You could technically put down “You lose” as the wincon for all the difference it makes. So long as he can’t win without being converted or elected it doesn’t matter what you say his wincon is</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>your right with that how about i chanche his wincon into become the king or member of the unseen/cult and fulfill that wincondition instead? a little less theme but it would fit balance more since you are baisicly a empowerd butler going around occupy peapl (it has 2 uses need to edit that in moment) wich will most of the time would just get exucuted on sight since you cant perm use it you have a hard time claiming maby that should balance things out</p>

            <p>But conversion overrides your wincon by definition. If you are Unseen/Cult then your wincon is to defeat the blue dragon and if that isn’t your wincon then you are not Unseen/Cult</p>

            <p>because the CL is the leader of the cult and mastermind would simply be op 2 change into also your best bed will be becoming the king since pschyo king is a real treat for bd and useen/cult in dire need you can side with both evil factions aldo you want some of the mebers of it to die so you can take control its because i didnt want his theme to be conflicted i used those classes i am open to suggestion for another wincon around taking control i made this before pretender (atleast i scemed it already) it is simlair so it wont be used its like him only your wincon is a little bigger i am open for suggestion for chanche to or a hole different goal and class with the name so see what you would think this lore and theme would fit best friend</p>

            <p>Besides, killing the MM is much more detrimental than killing the CL… You shouldn’t make the “buff” vary on the type of game it is and just make it the same for all… Or maybe just make it so you don’t need to kill them at all, but instead get a HH type ability that occupies them through immunity</p>

<p>Instant loss for unseen? Just cause the megalomaniac was lucky enough to find the mastermind first? No thanks.</p>

            <p>because of the nature of the class i dont know if it should be offensive or killer but because it has potential to kill and do it well i will keep it as offensive/killer for now any suggestion or changes are welcome <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>This class might look weird but i tried to difine him by his lore as best as i could so balance might still be off here and there also i just make classes like this for one and i could prob think of way more wacky lore classes but for the next something i might want something that is balanced so i will try and work that out well enjoy the class.</p>
