            <p>I like the whole idea of the music, but just try to make its songs original. If I come up with anything I will let you know</p>

            <p>The ability proposed is actually a wall of fire that protects the unseen and not the other members of the court, and by that I described it as an “OP wall of fire” or maybe an improved protection by the enforcer. What is certain, though, is the lack of the necessary originality</p>

            <p>Wall of fire is used to guarantee assassin kills, not to protect unseen.</p>

            <p>There are some problems with the classes proposed. First of all, the Bard’s song of distraction should somehow be prioritized because otherwise the question of whether an assasin gets to use nightshade or not is decided by how fast he can click what is needed, something not fair. Secondly, the Song of Power is similar to the Court Wizard’s empower ability. Next, the Barron’s song of deceit is identical to the illusionist’s mind warp and two classes with an identical ability is not favoured. Finally, his song of preventing is an OP wall of fire, an ability used by the sage.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that there is nothing original in this classes and I am afraid this should not be put into the game as it undermines strategic gameplay and the impact of other classes that could possibly be in the game.</p>
