    <title>[Outdated] Double kill bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/outdated-double-kill-bug/1090</link>
    <description>####What happened?

Both a possessor and an assassin killed the same Butler. 

It showed [12] died by a Possessor and an assassin, and went through the phases (i.e. [12] was a butler)

THEN

It then showed [12] died by an assassin (ONLY, instead of both, but regardless this line trigged too) and went through the phases again. ([12] was a butler)

####What was SUPPOSED to happen?

The only thing that should show up is the first line.

####Steps to reproduce:

Both roles stated above kill the same target.
