            <p>I don’t see any real harm within that… I mean you could use a very distinct recognizable death note, but that still doesn’t reveal your identity, at least no moreso than any other choices you might make. If you are playing with people that can put a death note to a skin… don’t use that combination.</p>
<p>also OP only mentioned “export”. technically that would just allow you to look at and save deathnotes for later entertainment… importing is the debatable part.</p>

            <p>I actually suggested this a while back and thought it was a good idea, but Meta-Gamers and stuff where you were in a party before hand or game or something will make people recognize that it is you immediately.</p>
