            <p>You wouldn’t be able to convert AND Kill N1.</p>
<p>For cult that’s fine because they have the double kill. But this faction doesn’t have that (not even 2for1) so it’s not.</p>

<p>if you have no points at the start then your N1 get’s fucked up.</p>

            <p>If you really want to make sure they will end up pressed for points then 1 per night with 3 points to start is technically sufficient to sustain the core abilities, but having 2 per night means you can also sustain a single convert (a 4th convert can be sustained with continuous rituals). Using the 2 point ability’s and the day abilities would still create point shortages.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok another issue, this one more common.</p>
<p>This faction doesn’t get enough points to use their ability’s properly:</p>
<p>Convert+Kill = -3<br>
Ritual+Kill = +2<br>
Convert+Kill = -3<br>
and so on.</p>
<p>Each night is on average -1 points. If that was from the faction as a whole this wouldn’t be a problem, since it leads to interesting resource management challenges. However the problem is that it means the key actions alone are unsustainable. Using day ability’s convert ability’s ect means you will run out of points far too quickly, which makes them practically unusable.</p>
<p>Luckily this has an easy solution. Give the Bishop the following passive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prayer (Passive) - The Christis gains 2 points at the start of every night. If your class changes you will keep this passive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then reduce the starting points to 2 so that they can’t easily build up a surplus early on (they will have 4 points by the start of N1) and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Having the passive be kept helps in 2 ways:</p>
<p>1 - It means the Bishop becoming King is an amazing boon for the Christis since that means they can have 4 points per night instead of 2 from the passive (since someone else promotes to Bishop as well)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2 - This solves the issue I brought up with the Bishop becoming a Crusader with no points.</p>

            <p>oh I was also meant to make crus be able to turn into a bishop during the day aswell.</p>
<p>similar to a suicide button.</p>
<p>as points might deem it impossible.</p>
<p>points need some testing to see if they are too much or too little at times</p>
