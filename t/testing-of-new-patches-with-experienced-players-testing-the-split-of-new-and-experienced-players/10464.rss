    <title>Testing of new patches with experienced players, testing the split of new and experienced players</title>

    <description>I posted this in Discord, hoping to get here more ideas, answers, opinions and general exposure. Excuse my bad English.

What do you think about releasing bigger Patches first in a closed audience of experienced players, to check Balancing, Bigger Bugs etc. over, e.g., steam invite / beta program ?  I would be willing to join that audience.  I mean with the increasing amont of new players everyday, now the game is difficult if for example things like &quot;missing class cards&quot; (even if fixed in some minutes) happen as an example. (it is already difficult enough to play with new players in general, as everyone can confirm I bet)

Advantage for experienced players is, they will help imrpove the game, make it easier for new players by checking balancing and clearing bugs first, and they will have more fun playing this game (without new players if they want to)

ALso that will make new players be more likely with more new players, as more experinced players will be joining the &quot;beta testing of patches&quot; :smiley:

its a win-win guys

You can also see it as a Test for the planned splitting off of new players and exerpienced players into two separate player bases.

What do you think?</description>

            <p>I think you have to be a beta tester, unless a dev decides to invite you for some other reason</p>

Any chance to get an invite to test-server?  Or how do we know if we have been chosen ?</p>
