    <title>Making the Unseen Different</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/making-the-unseen-different/53616</link>
    <description>Let me begin by saying that this isn&#39;t something I expect to be implemented in its current form, as many tweaks would doubtless need to be made. Now then, allow me to present ... the new Unseen.

Assassin:
Traits:
(Starting Assassin only) Man Behind the Curtain - When the MM dies, you become the new MM.

Day Abilities:
Poison - Unchanged

Night Abilities:
Assassinate (3 uses): Attack a player tonight.
Paralyze: The player will be occupied, bypassing occupy immunity.


The MM is unchanged except that when you become the assassin you get one extra use of Assassinate.
Additionally, the conversion cap is REMOVED COMPLETELY, so the Unseen can have as many members as they please. The cool-down on Convert remains however.


So, let me give you the reasoning behind this, as it was prompted by two main things. Firstly, the Unseen have difficulty killing the BD if the Neutral Killer dies early on, so they have a strange incentive to keep him alive, even though he&#39;ll often out or kill the MM. Here, you want to keep BD around so that you can hide among them and convert the best classes; you win by having more Unseen that BD and systematically exing them all, not necessarily by killing them all.

The second reason is that Unseen and Cult are pretty similar, and Cult is stronger. The really cool thing about Unseen is that each class has unique converted abilities. The problem is that you can only have one convert who isn&#39;t MM/Assassin at a time, so you don&#39;t really get to take advantage of it; this takes far more advantage of careful conversions to collect the key roles from BD.

Finally, let me just go over why I chose the abilities I did for the Assassin (like limiting the kills). 
The Assassinate ability is limited to distinguish the Unseen from Cult; Unseen converts, killing only when they must. As such, the Assassin has three kills to take out key players such as the Prince or King. Impending Doom replaces Poison, allowing more counters, but being more effective at forcing the guardians away from the King/Prince. Additionally, it can be used to force the King to delay a night Execution; after all, he can&#39;t guard himself while exeing. 

Let me know thoughts/suggestions</description>

            <p>no, no no no no. 3 kills?? Thats just…unnecessary. Scum needs a KPN of around 1 to be semi viable or have something else going for them (Brotherhood being able to controls votes and converting quickly. This is an Fol faction not a ToL one but the mechanics of FoL are near the name)</p>

            <p>Replacing poison is absolutely not a serious option, and you should remove that so the rest of the suggestion can be considered.  Large numbers of classes and interactions completely depend on poison’s existence.  Physicians and Alchemists don’t need the severe nerf that this would imply, while turning the Assassin’s night ability into four <span class="bbcode-i">automatic</span> extra kills (without the dependence on killing healers first) would make the game much less interesting.</p>
<p>Total opposition to this as long as that’s part of it.</p>

            <p>I agree that the unseen and cult could use some changes to make them less similar, but not the suggested changes.  The assassin’s KPN doesn’t need to be limited, the unseen should be more focused on killing while the cult is focused on conversion.  Also, the unseen is stronger than the cult.  The only advantages the cult have are being able to infinitely convert, and having 4 members.</p>

            <p>How does limited kills make them different from the cult? The only part of this I support is making the replacement method swapping out the starting assassin once whenever the MM dies instead of an arbitrary time limit.</p>

            <p>That’s because of their low convert cap. If you count a convert as a kill, they’ll be getting one ever-other night, in addition to whatever’s the assassin’s doing. Also, if you have trouble with the number of uses, shout out numbers; I’m not really committed to them.</p>

            <p>Not sure why you say Unseen get 4 extra kills. People hit by impending death can be save pretty easily with a heal, guard, or jail. The fact that they’re attacked that night is to make up for the fact that more people can stop it compared to Nightshade. Furthermore, Assassin’s kills are limited, so he can’t even attack every night.</p>

<p>As for the convert cap, it’s an important balance mechanism that would make the Unseen always stronger than the Cult.</p>

            <p>Let me begin by saying that this isn’t something I expect to be implemented in its current form, as many tweaks would doubtless need to be made. Now then, allow me to present … the new Unseen.</p>
<p>Assassin:<br>
Traits:<br>
(Starting Assassin only) Man Behind the Curtain - When the MM dies, you become the new MM.</p>
<p>Day Abilities:<br>
Poison - Unchanged</p>
<p>Night Abilities:<br>
Assassinate (3 uses): Attack a player tonight.<br>
Paralyze: The player will be occupied, bypassing occupy immunity.</p>
<p>The MM is unchanged except that when you become the assassin you get one extra use of Assassinate.<br>
Additionally, the conversion cap is REMOVED COMPLETELY, so the Unseen can have as many members as they please. The cool-down on Convert remains however.</p>
<p>So, let me give you the reasoning behind this, as it was prompted by two main things. Firstly, the Unseen have difficulty killing the BD if the Neutral Killer dies early on, so they have a strange incentive to keep him alive, even though he’ll often out or kill the MM. Here, you want to keep BD around so that you can hide among them and convert the best classes; you win by having more Unseen that BD and systematically exing them all, not necessarily by killing them all.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Unseen and Cult are pretty similar, and Cult is stronger. The really cool thing about Unseen is that each class has unique converted abilities. The problem is that you can only have one convert who isn’t MM/Assassin at a time, so you don’t really get to take advantage of it; this takes far more advantage of careful conversions to collect the key roles from BD.</p>
<p>Finally, let me just go over why I chose the abilities I did for the Assassin (like limiting the kills).<br>
The Assassinate ability is limited to distinguish the Unseen from Cult; Unseen converts, killing only when they must. As such, the Assassin has three kills to take out key players such as the Prince or King. Impending Doom replaces Poison, allowing more counters, but being more effective at forcing the guardians away from the King/Prince. Additionally, it can be used to force the King to delay a night Execution; after all, he can’t guard himself while exeing.</p>
