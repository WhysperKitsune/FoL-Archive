    <title>[Class Suggestion] Priest and Heretic (Social)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-priest-and-heretic-social/9863</link>
    <description>So people really seem to like Maid Spy.

However, putting it on Noble muddies an otherwise streamlined class. By bringing back the Priest as a Social Class, this problem can be helped significantly by dedicating the Noble to vote control and the Priest to whispers and social protection, two areas no Social class truly covers in any meaningful way.

Here&#39;s my basic idea for that Priest. Linked below, you will find my Noble suggestion, which no longer has Maid Spy. I think this has a lot of potential to fix a bunch of issues in one go, so please let me know what you think of both of these suggestions. Thanks.

&gt;# **[color=steblue]Priest[/color]**
&gt; **[color=steblue]Blue Dragon[/color] Social**
&gt;
&gt;**Confessions (Passive)** - Each night you will hear the confessions of a random player. They may speak to you, but you will not know who they are or be able to respond.
**Devout (Passive)** - Your voice may not be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, Trollbox, etc. will not work on you)
**Contrition (Day)** - You choose who you will speak to for Confessions tonight - 2 uses
**Anoint (Night)**- Protect your target from any Social manipulation tomorrow (includes Decide Fate) - unlimited uses
**Intercession (Night)** - You may choose a player to intercede with, allowing you to hear all whispers they send or recieve until you select a different target (you may not target the King) - unlimited uses

&gt;# **[color=purple]Heretic[/color]**
&gt;**[color=purple]Unseen[/color] Social**
&gt;
&gt;**Hearsay (Passive)** - As long as you are alive, the Unseen will have a seperate chat tab with which to talk during the day.
**Dogma (Passive)** - Your voice may not be tampered with. (Icy Touch, Distract, Trollbox, etc. will not work on you.)
**Impersonate (Day)** - Your next whisper will secretly appear to be from your target, they will secretly be unable to send or recieve whispers until this occurs - 2 uses
**Inquisition (Day)** - Your target will confess to you tonight - 2 uses
**Indulgence (Night)**- Protect your target from any Social manipulation tomorrow (includes Decide Fate) - unlimited uses
**Trespass (Night)** - You may choose two players to spy on, allowing you to hear all whispers they send or recieve until you select a different target (you may not target the King) - unlimited uses

&gt;# **[color=steblue]Noble[/color] and [color=purple]Aristocrat[/color]**
&gt;https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-noble-and-aristocrat-social/28119

Points of potential improvement:
-Confessions is unique and cool, but not very effective at any single task in most scenarios. Contrition and Inquisition, however, are much more likely to be useful.
-Do you prefer unlimited, single-target whisper reading, or limited, multi-target whisper reading?
-Open to further suggestions/improvements. Don&#39;t be afraid to be harsh!</description>

            <p>Well yeah, priest did come first.</p>
<p>Why have a weaker version of Psychic’s ability?</p>
<p>Also gives you knowledge of the cult/unseen as well. Even if you hear “Class?” it’s an indication it isn’t evil (although I suppose this could turn into meta game), but still. I also feel like nothing should intrude on Evil privacy, or the Prince’s for that matter.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s too weak if it is anonymous though, unless the entire class is based around it(which it isn’t, but I would be fine with the RNG if it was).  Plus it also doesn’t fit the theme of your priest, which is hearing whispers.  Maybe give the confessions ability to another class and make it based off of that?</p>

</aside>
<p>Not really.  If you use it on a suspected cult/unseen, then other players probably suspect them to, which means that they’ll get killed soon.  And if they use the ability randomly, it will be wasteful since it only has 2 uses and not a lot of players have night chats.</p>

<p>Where I find that risky is outing the existance of a servant, marshall etc… Maybe faction could be an option though. IE BD/unseen/neutral. That way you could allow the guy to at least know he isn’t being driven on a direct bogus accusation.</p>

            <p>Don’t let this hear night chat. That makes it too easy to find cult/unseen.</p>
<p>I think the ability list is well suited to replace Psychic. I feel Psychic Mind Link is too similar to Imprison, but confessions is a great substitute. The confessions distinguish it, and I don’t think the class would be good without it, even if it is weaker than Psychic.</p>

<p>RNG is bad.  The only things which should be determined by RNG are the class you get and scorned/merc’s targets.  Just remove this, psychic already has a similar ability.</p>

<p>If you remove confessions, then change this so you will hear your target’s night chat tonight(You will only hear them, not anyone else they talk with).  And replace inquisition with this as well.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The Priest not knowing who they are hearing confessions from benefits only evil classes. That means evils can lie about their identity, feed them false information, etc. I think the class would work perfectly without Psychic and Prince, if not better than the both of them, but it is just inherently weaker than both of the above.</p>
<p>I personally would prefer this above either of them, but Psychic and Prince make it very weak.</p>
