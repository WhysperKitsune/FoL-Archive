    <title>Shadow Faction and Class</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/shadow-faction-and-class/45222</link>
    <description>2 of this class would show up:

&gt; **Dark Lord(Shadow Special)**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Soul Shield: Consume a soul to stay alive
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 1: Consume: Replace your target with your partner. Their class will be based on the target&#39;s class type. Costs one soul.

&gt; **Phantom (Shadow Social)**
&gt; 
&gt; Day Ability: Shadowy Alteration: Force your target to vote for your second target. They may not change their vote.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Stalk: See your first target&#39;s whispers the next day and force them to kill your second target.

&gt; **name needed (Shadow Offensive)**
&gt; 
&gt; Passive: Spectral: Cannot be occupied or have their target change.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Control: Occupy your first target, and kill your second target.

&gt; **name needed (Shadow Investigative)**
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Examine: Learn your first target&#39;s class. Kill your second target.

&gt; **name needed (Shadow Support)**
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Alter: Make your first target think they were attacked and healed. Kill your second target.

Random idea I had. I really love possessor.

Notes: CW can stop Consume. All killing abilities steal target&#39;s soul. The whole faction shares souls.

Also it probably needs a day ability or something to put it on the same kill rate as Cult or Unseen.

&gt; **[color=LightBlue]Lightbringer (Blue Dragon Investigative)[/color]**
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability: Repel the Darkness: Check if one person is a Shadow. If they are, destroy one of their souls.
&gt; 
&gt; Night Ability 2: Shine: Occupy your target. If they are a Shadow take away all of their souls. 1 use.</description>

            <p>The point is it doesn’t need it. If one dies, the other reanimates it. It’s an alternative to conversion.</p>

            <p>Just give it more classes ffs. We need at least one class of each type, something to stop most methods of confirming through Ability’s. A promotion system. A Faction counter ect.</p>

            <p>For now I have it so both would be the same class. It would probably be cooler if there was some sort of duality, but this works for now.</p>

            <p>The standard faction kill rate is 2 KPN. This is already really strong for an NK. He does not need a day ability.</p>
