    <title>Apostle&#39;s &quot;Cult numbers&quot; doesn&#39;t work when someone is on trial</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/apostles-cult-numbers-doesnt-work-when-someone-is-on-trial/34901</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
Apostle cannot use Cult Numbers when someone is already on trial, has to use it beforehand since the ability button becomes greyed out when someone is on trial.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Noble can use his noble twin ability which is basically the same thing when someone is on trial, I think apostle should be able to use it too.

#### Steps to reproduce:
Try to use Cult Numbers when someone is on trial.

#### Comments:
I&#39;m not sure if this is a bug or intended, but the fact that it works differently than noble while being pretty much the same ability seems like a bug to me.</description>

            <p>Yeah, the voting abilities are nigh-on useless for people that have them since they can’t be activated once voting starts.  And voting can start before you could even click on the ability as an added bonus.</p>

            <p>No, the ability greys out as soon as someone is put on trial even if you haven’t used any day abilities. I submitted this around a week ago and I haven’t played recently so I don’t know if it still happens.</p>
