    <title>Yet another Pretender overhaul idea</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/yet-another-pretender-overhaul-idea/77986</link>
    <description>**Objective:** Become the King by any means necessary. You still win *even if you die after taking the throne.*

**Passives:**
Royal Blood: Same as live (during elections for a new King, votes for you count twice)
No Allegiance: If you become the King, bad things happen.
&quot;Bad Thing&quot; Possibility 1: All players lose 1 charge from their limited-charge abilities.
&quot;Bad Thing&quot; Possibility 2: All players who voted for you lose 1 charge from their limited-charge abilities.
&quot;Bad Thing&quot; Possibility 3: One player who voted for you, picked randomly, is executed during today&#39;s trial. The player randomly picked can only be a member of the Blue Dragon, the Unseen, or the Cult. A &quot;second trial&quot; will not be held.
&quot;Bad Thing&quot; Possibility 4: You become Immortal (even Death Immune piercing attacks cannot kill you) and no one can vote for you to go to trial.
&quot;Bad Thing&quot; Possibility 5: Trials can no longer be held for the remainder of the game.

**Day Abilities:** 
Troll the King: Make it look like the King says something. They will not see the message. (note that you can only make the King say something, unlike Fool/Scorned&#39;s version of Troll Box) In addition, silence the King for 20 seconds.
Ballot Mixing: Reverse the King&#39;s vote during a trial. They will see their vote as normal and not be informed their vote was switched unless your switch caused the decision to swing in a different outcome.
Examples of Ballot Mixing:  4e-4p vote. You switch the King&#39;s Pardon to Execute and now it&#39;s a 5-3 vote; he&#39;ll be informed he was swapped and see Execute. 1e-6p vote. You switch the King&#39;s Pardon to Execute, and it becomes 2-5; everyone else will see he voted Execute, while he&#39;ll still see he voted Pardon.

**Night Abilities:**
Hired Help: Enlist the aid of a hired Alchemist, who will heal you tonight. 3 charges.
Kinslayer: Attack the King. If they&#39;re being guarded by a Knight, you will not attack and will not lose a charge. 2 charges.

My idea here is that the Pretender is *not* someone that anyone wants in power because of the bad things. The bad thing that happens could virtually be anything, but as a side idea, what if there was a list of bad things and either the Pretender picked one, or it was just randomly chosen? Whatever the outcome, it&#39;s sure to cause chaos for everyone else, but you don&#39;t care since you just won. Also the list of bad things are just suggestions; it could theoretically be anything.

You just need the King throne; you don&#39;t actually need to keep friends once you get there. But unlike live, you lose your death immunity (in exchange for a few heal charges) and lose any way to actually help the BD, making it much harder to get the throne (whereas today you just play Immune Princess and the BD roll over and give you the throne, then you need to keep the evil players&#39; trust so they don&#39;t kill you). That said, the Troll the King ability is an upgraded Troll Box that also has Distract tied to it. It will be easier to make the King look bad and either lose trust or get executed.

TL;DR: Now no one wants a Pretender in the King&#39;s spot since it will cause chaos and potentially even bad things for the evil faction. Pretender&#39;s much harder to get the throne without any way to &quot;help&quot; the BD, but it&#39;s much easier to get a King out and make them look suspicious.</description>

            <p>Like yes, SS wincon as King isn’t the only way to accomplish what I’m saying and probably isn’t even the best. It’s just the easiest. But something that makes BD want to kill Pretender and incentive for Pretender to not want that to happen is needed.</p>

            <p>Pretender King is to Evil King as Scorned is to normal scum.</p>
<p>Evils COULD make invests more sus by accusing people. But they don’t do it enough so we have scorned instead.</p>

            <p>ok yeah this thing is SUPER busted and the main parts have already been said but this also makes the pretender unfun and difficult to play. part of the reason bd let pretenders live(and that’s only sometimes) is because they can either pretend to be princess really easily and can help them catch evils</p>
<p>why would they let the pretender live if they provide no upside, can turn on them easily, and have these game breaking mechanics(which mostly hinder the bd)? exactly, they wouldn’t, and i’d highly recommend getting rid of rng.</p>

My whole point was that bad things happen WHEN Pret gets elected. That’s what you’re trying to avoid: You don’t want the Pret elected in the first place and doing so intentionally would be as gamethrowing as intentionally upping-and-executing a Fool as BD.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s just it. Pretender and class idea’s like it are intrinsically tied to the King role. You can’t have an election end in someone being elected but not have the King role get involved at some point, so you are going to have to deal with the fact that a successful Pretender will end up being King at some point.</p>
<p>Unlike with Scorned and Inquisitor this isn’t inherently bad, and unlike with Fool the Pretender is still alive.</p>
<p>So no it’s not after the fact. The Pretender King is DURING the fact. That’s when the Pretender is making her move, she’s in power and now she’s using it and it’s up to the BD to catch that (or think they did if it’s a BD King).</p>
<p>It’s like if Scorned won the second her target is upped. Yeah she convinced people that they were suspicious but how she has to get them to follow through with that and actually execute them.</p>
<p>Sure you’ve became King but so what? Why should BD care about a Pretender King? If she hasn’t outed already why would she not do so now and then be a boring Kingmaker that no one wants when she could be an interesting psudo-EK that potentially no one suspects, and thus acts as a way for elected Kings to be more easily pushed by scum when a Pretender doesn’t spawn.</p>

<p>The issue is that if Pretender King doesn’t have an agenda then there is no reason for BD to suspect an agenda due to her possible existence.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But that’s after the fact. The whole point would be to not let it get to that point (similarly to how I never exe on trials unless I’m sure they’re not a fool/people usually let Prince handle obvious fool/evils). The only difference is the King role compared to Merc/Inq. I don’t see why this is any different outside of the King role.</p>
<p>All I know is <em>something</em> has to change with Pret. Its current iteration is a jumbled mess and makes no sense. It’s not even different from a Neutral King, outside of just having less guards, plus it has Princess’s Flirt (and everyone always votes for Pret anyway), making it way too passive and easy of a role. It’s boring.</p>

<p>I don’t see the problem in having Pret King just winning on the spot</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The issue is that if Pretender King doesn’t have an agenda then there is no reason for BD to suspect an agenda due to her possible existence. Since even if the King does turn out to be a Pretender, there isn’t anything BD has to do about that after the fact.</p>
<p>With Fool he’s already dead by the time BD has been tricked.</p>
<p>Scorned has already fulfilled their purpose of making investigatives more sus by winning.</p>
<p>Inquisitor and Merc have non-comparable functions</p>
<p>And Sellsword can’t win before the game ends and is exactly what I am proposing as an alternative to alch wincon</p>

</aside>
<p>They were examples. You could make them anything, but a bad thing should happen if Pret is elected instead of “oh we now have a Neut King”. No trials was more or less a bit extreme. I highly doubt that would ever happen.</p>

<p>The reason I posted the same thing twice is because the possibilities are basically a joke. All of the abilities confirm that pretender is now king which makes fake claiming pretender useless, as well as the fact that possibility 4 is broken and possibility 5 LITERALLY makes the game unplayable for blue dragon.</p>

</aside>
<p>See above. Pret also shouldn’t be a claim, though that’s more that there’s no good claims for evils to begin with, especially Killers.</p>

<p>Also this is a very easy pretender to win as.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Really? I see it as more difficult. Sure in the current meta of “yeah vote up the Pret” it’s easy as hell, but once we have a “fool” of sorts for the King spot, I highly doubt it’ll be so easy when you have literally no way to actually give real logs. Blood test, the one thing you can use to claim “Princess” is gone. I doubt most will vote up an unconfirmed S/I with fake logs.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s currently counter to nothing really except it has King stabs. Once you get the throne though… nothing happens. It’s an extremely passive role (even more passive than Alchemist for crying out loud) that is IMMUNE until it gets the King spot, then you pray the evil faction doesn’t kill you. It’s boring and stupid. The main goal should be getting that throne, but there needs to be something bad that happens to everyone else if you do get it, otherwise, we just have live again where you always vote up Pret, but now they auto-win.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel like if you removed any other win condition, they’d be a lot more chaotic from person to person. I don’t see the problem in having Pret King just winning on the spot, similarly to Scorned/Fool/Inq/Merc and technically SS (basically, EVERY other Neutral but Alch).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why shouldn’t someone be able to fake claim pretender?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because ideally that’s the equivalent of claiming scorned. The entire point behind the class is to make elected Kings less trustworthy. Which means the Pretender itself must not be trustworthy.</p>
<p>It’s also why she DOES need to have a win condition beyond becoming King. Otherwise she just resolves as a BD King half the time like right now. Even if there is an artificial punishment for electing her that doesn’t change the fact that she isn’t making elected Kings any more scummy unless she herself has reasons to harm BD once she is Kinged.</p>
<p>That’s why I want Pretender King to have the SS wincon. So she can want to hurt BD once Kinged by definition thus ensuring that she will side with Evils and ensuring the BD will want her dead and thus will kill an elected King that they think is a Pretender.</p>

            <p>It’s suppose to be a counter to the king, not be a counter to the whole king elections. Also I think the easiest way to solve this is to just give people a reward for killing the pretender if they are king and see if the pretender can still convince people to let them live</p>
<p>I think it would be more interesting then just out right denying anyone the right to claim pretender</p>
