    <title>Reaper kills do not should total souls after reap</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/reaper-kills-do-not-should-total-souls-after-reap/79740</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I played as reaper, and the message in the chat window after I reap someone always says &quot;you now have 0 souls&quot; after a successful reap. Note that I was granted the soul, its just a visual bug in the chatbox.

Also, at the end of the game, it showed me as winning twice. There was a Sellsword (who was dead) who also won with me. So, when the game ended, and it was allowing us to select the MVPs, it showed in the chat box: Me (reaper), the SS, then me again

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

After a reap, it should show  my new total number of souls.

#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Be reaper
2. Reap someone
3. Check chat window when night is over and it will show the incorrect message

#### Comments:

To clarify, two bugs here.
1 - visual bug when reaping someone always displaying &quot;0 souls&quot;
2 - When I won as reaper, it showed me twice as the people that were victorious</description>
