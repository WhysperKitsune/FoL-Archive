    <title>Basing New NKs on already-existing abilities</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/basing-new-nks-on-already-existing-abilities/73788</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to pretend a new NK is a real possibility and try to classify (very succinctly) the style of the current 3 NKs and then try to identify some new styles which could inspire a new NK:

- Identity Theft &amp; Remote Control (Possessor) 
- Time Bomb (Sorcerer) 
- Dead seem alive / Alive seem dead (Reaper - referring to reap and chill)

There is of course the Plaguebearer concept also: 

- Contagious Infection (Plaguebearer) 

Werewolf, Serial Killer, and Arsonist styles are merged with previously listed classes.

Here is a list of what I believe are attacks which one could base an entire NK around:

- Butler Poison
- Old Merc&#39;s Rebound (could take revenge upon anyone who prevents you also)
- Extortion (privately notify a player they will die unless they perform a certain action) 
- Snare Trap (victim dies if they do anything tonight, but aren&#39;t warned beforehand) 
- Hunter&#39;s Arrow (entwine the fate of two players, if one dies or is executed, the other dies also)
- I might update this list

I think a new NK would be cool, actually I always like when new classes are introduced.</description>

            <p>Considering that your definition wasn’t provided and you were using the name of a different role with a different definition how the hell do you expect anyone to get the right idea?</p>
<p>Also that’s just a subset of arsonist who is about delayed kills</p>

            <p>Your version of plaguebearer does not exist anywhere and is thus undefined. Do not use it to describe anything until you have given it a specific and public definition</p>
