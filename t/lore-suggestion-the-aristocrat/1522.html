The Aristocrat appears to have left his mark throughout our fair homeland. His form of writing appears to be how he’d talk. A risky move, but very effective at conveying a message.</p>
<p><em>In hindsight, this name-calling is quite beneficial. Call me an Aristocrat if you so desire, I believe the rich should rule over the poor, but unlike what the Nobles will tell you, that only applies once there are no poor.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>It is a little strange that an Alchemist can enter as an honored guest, but end up drinking her own potions for breakfast within three days, isn’t it? Maybe, just maybe, go along with me here this might sound a little bit crazy, but maybe there needs to be some change.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Allow me to be your… Treasurer. Those who do not resist will see themselves swimming in rivers made of only the finest gold and jewelry. If not, well then I suppose your tears also make a good pool for yourself. You might just get a little blood in it.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Comments/Explanations</strong></p>
<p>This helps to give a reason as to why the Black Rose do what they do.</p>
<p>I read the lore of the (Unseen) king very closely, and what I found was he was depicted as a man with a heart of darkness, but that wouldn’t explain how the Mastermind converts people so easily. There has to be some reason he can shake up loyalty to the Blue Dragon. Perhaps the Blue Dragon is an oppressive force, or is making a fatal mistake that goes uncorrected due to arrogance.</p>
<p>Look at the Lore for the Court Wizard and Sage. It is here that the Wizard accuses the King of treason, but after his conversion he is more calm. Perhaps it is because he now knows the truth. Perhaps in that (game) timeline the King is either afraid for his life, pointing his finger at every little thing, or he is a member of the Unseen himself, feigning ignorance for the purposes of evil. But is the Unseen truly evil?</p>
<p>Who knows? Look no further, citizens.</p>
<hr>
<p>I did some more postulating of the game’s structure…</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon ARE liars!</p>
<p>You see, if you look at the King’s various forms (BD-N-UN)</p>
<p>And the various roles, you’ll actually see the Deep-State Shadow-Government Aristo-Oligarchy going on within the secret society of the Nobles.<br>
Three Nobles (typically the max amount for an oligarchy) that have tons of money</p>
<p>The King isn’t even barely trusted (See every game where they question the king early on)<br>
Blue Dragon King literally has to prove himself as loyal to the system of government every time an invasion happens<br>
Neutral King has had enough pretending and just wants to leave<br>
Unseen King wants to reform the government</p>
<p>The “Aristocrat” is literally just a derogatory name for a Capitalist who took over the financial structure for a remake of the castle once the Unseen take over. In fact, most Unseen names are just derogatory remarks or words with negative connotation instead of legitimate occupations…</p>
<p>Knight- <strong>Enforcer</strong> (That just sounds bad)<br>
Observer-<strong>Nightwatch</strong> (Nightwatches or “lookouts” make sure no-one watches during a crime)<br>
Princess-<strong>Duchess</strong> (There’s no Duke. There is only a Prince. Therefore Duchesses are bad.)<br>
Mercenary-<strong>Sellsword</strong> (Mercs are neutral, but look at Sellsword. That sounds like someone who would trade honor, morality, and everything just for  a few shillings, while a Mercenary just has a job.</p>
<p>All of the bolded Unseen titles spell ENDS. The Blue Dragon fear the Unseen because their superior logic trumps the Blue lie, and will spell their doom if they aren’t shut down.</p>
