    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/make-rebound-bypass-everything/42166</link>
    <description>**Hi!**

**Rebound** is practically a Useless ability, not only has 1 use, but you can get occupied, redirected, killed by knight, and so go on.

You cant use it.

So, how to fix it? easy:

**Make it bypass everything.**

For being a ability which you use once every 30 games it needs to be powerful.

**Thanks for reading!**</description>

            <p>Making mercenaries occupy immune is a straight nerf in my opinion as that puts them in the possible NK category and makes sorcerer’s job easier to fake being a mercenary to evil. They will also lose their occupy immunity if converted to ritualist, so overall really this will hurt mercenary players win rate in my opinion.<br>
Occupiers need to do their job too and you cannot just make almost all classes occupy immune.</p>
<p>Rebound thematically is not even important to the Mercenary as a support role and I rarely find myself making use of it in my Mercenary games. Having it have some of the suggestions above also allows Mercenary to kill the king. Something which I find extremely undesirable.</p>
<p>Mercenary is one of the classes that I hardly lose with. If you really feel it’s a weaker knight, you’re just not using the social aspect of the game to its fullest extent. Mercenaries will generally be left alone, by either side, as you have at least one other player pulling for you to live, your contract. More than that they can choose their allegiances as the only class, barring neutral king, in the game freely, by allocating their second contract.</p>

            <p>Yeah but usually when you’re using rebound it’s because you’re out of guards. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Possessors dont usually jump until later in the game anyway.</p>

            <p>The OP is correct in one aspect; You need to get pretty creative to have her rebound be useful. So I feel like passive occupy immunity fits a bit more.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s an argument for another topic though. It’s indisputable that the king should be on a slightly higher power level than Merc, though.</p>

<p>I disagree with making Rebound bypass everything. A fucking random neutral shouldn’t have similar power levels to the king.</p>
<p>However, I am in favor of making the Mercenary occupy immune.</p>
