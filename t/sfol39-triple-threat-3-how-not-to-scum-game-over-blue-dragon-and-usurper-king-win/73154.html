<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<li>If the current trial would overrun the remaining day length, the day ends immediately upon it’s conclusion</li>
<li>Trials will use up a minimum of 24 hours of daytime - even if they are resolved faster than that.</li>
<li>All actions must be sent to the mod.</li>
<li>Unseen and Cult will talk through a special PM chain</li>
<li>The priest will speak with the dead through a separate Discord server.</li>
<li>All classes will be used and will be used as they are found in the Class Cards Thread. (Exceptions specified)</li>
<li>Once day limit expires, if a trial is in progress, only the accused may speak. Everyone else can only post votes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Executions</h2>
<ul>
<li>To accuse someone say “/accuse [player]” or “/vote [player]”</li>
<li>Votes saying Execute or Pardon before the target is on the stand will not be counted.</li>
<li>Should the votes reach the majority, that player will go on trial. They can give a defence, and the rest of the players must vote Execute or Pardon on the thread.</li>
<li>Players can discuss while the target is on trial.</li>
<li>No one is able to use day powers when a trial is in session. The only exception is the king’s Decide Fate or actions that have no noticeable affect during the day</li>
<li>Every trial will go on for 24 hours maximum.</li>
<li>The day timer does not stop when the target is on trial.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Picking a New King</h2>
<ul>
<li>If there are less than 4 players a new king will not be selected.</li>
<li>After a king’s execution the day does not end, an election shall be held right after.</li>

<li>If only 1 person steps up when the day ends that person becomes the king</li>
<li>If 2 or more people step forward everyone votes on who should be the next king in their Class Card. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the day becomes the king. If the votes are tied whoever stepped up 1st becomes the king</li>

<li>There will be limited Feedback. Only Classes performing a killing action, Special and Investigative will know they were occupied or redirected. Also, any action that bypasses an immunity of a class will result in feedback to that affect.</li>
