    <title>You all realize executing the Assassin/Converted Unseen during the day helps Unseen right?</title>

    <description>If you&#39;re hanging the Assassin during the day but don&#39;t know who the Mastermind is, all you are doing is allowing them to convert somebody else at night and cause more chaos as one of your precious confirmed BD players may now be evil.

Converting somebody counts as a kill. It is technically BETTER than a kill because it adds to the evil majority.

If you find the Assassin, occupy him until you can kill the Mastermind.</description>

            <p>Tell me about it, there used to be a regular copy-paste I always saw in peoples will explaining that if you find the assasain early you need to block/jail him while looking for the rest of the unseen. I’m still looking to find the text of it because whoever wrote it, put it far better than I was able to.</p>
<p>I spent almost my entire time in the graveyard one game trying to explain why I opposed killing the assasain we found on day 2 (drunk hit him). I think it took almost the entire game before I was able to explain it to people.</p>
