    <title>Paladin Wtf Sher</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/paladin-wtf-sher/3552</link>
    <description>My suggestion is simple. Make paladin more useful. Ever since, well, both paladin and sheriff become convertible convertable.. They&#39;ve seemed less beneficial, as well idk just seems like it lol.

So here&#39;s my suggestion: add an ability to sheriff and paladin that allows one use to revert an unseen or cult to back to BD. Could he one use idc I might be tired and this may not be a good idea but hey. I&#39;m  tired might as well. 

Anyways, I think this should be added for sheriff and paladin to be able to convert or rather unconvert, because they&#39;re essentially the counter measures against unseen and cult and they&#39;re, well, they&#39;re supposed to be their worst enemy yet I feel they lack true purpose in a game that surrounds conversion.

And as for the roles like Assassin and stuff, blue dragon equivalent is kind of knight tbh. So Assassin - - &gt;knight and same for apostle. But then mm and CL would he immune, lol wouldn&#39;t matter the converted to bd would snitch probably. Oh shit didn&#39;t think about that, looks like the Assassin better kill that damn traitor. Poop oh wait nvm.

They could just take cyanide pills. If you&#39;re mm or CL you could use an ability called Cyanide Release which forces the traitorous swine to pop a pill killing them instantly. One time use.</description>

            <p>This will never work.</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> work for a new faction that puts it’s members into separate night rooms and they don’t know who each other are, so they can’t betray as much.</p>
<p>but not with unseen or cult</p>

            <p>It plays really well, because now BD need to use their other resources (CW) and their can be multiple.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but either this for in my opinion I don’t know why sheriff and paladin aren’t convert immune anymore. They were anti cult and unseen and then they suddenly change their mind.</p>
