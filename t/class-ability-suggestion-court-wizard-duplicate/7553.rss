    <title>[Class Ability suggestion] [Court Wizard] Duplicate</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-ability-suggestion-court-wizard-duplicate/7553</link>
    <description>I have played the game for some time bow and I have never played a single game as court wizard with almost to 80 games played. But out of my time played i have noticed that court wizards are almost killed by BD because they are low impact and its almost a deathsentance to play it. The shield on 2 people to stop the conversion is a good ability but the frost wall seems like it never has an impact. I have a new idea on a mage skill that may lead to more interesting interactions and they will make court wizards fun and have more of a noticeable impact in the game. 

Skill ability: Duplicate. (Nighttime only) 2 uses
Description: makes a duplicate image of a chosen character and illusion that is too real to tell if it&#39;s fake. This illusion becomes the target of any targets for convèrsion/attacks/occupies for 2 nights. If it&#39;s attacked the duplicate is killed but send information back to the court wizard. (Now the information sent could be like the info gathered by the EXHUME ability the physician has just generic info like killed by assassin but not revealing any more info then that, or it could be the specific target and number of the person that hit.) 

Each of the 2 duplicates have a 2 night duration and if they are converted attacked targeted the information that person receives is that it went through no problem. It throws off the cult because they obviously don&#39;t have a new convert and let&#39;s them know there is a court wizard in play

Lastly court wizard should be unique. And if they get converted then they turn into sage but still receive any info about however many duplicate are still in play. 

If we are feeling really extream then if the CW gets turned give him the ability to detonate any duplicate killing anyone the dupe was attached to.

Now I&#39;m open to discussion on if this is op op or if it could be tweaked and optomized.</description>

            <p>The Court wizard is a very powerfull class in my opinion, The problem is, while you can barrier the investigator classes (every one who wishper the king) and make them unconverable, most of the games, you’ll just end up get converted yourself, after you almost single handedly won the game to BD yourself by preventing conversions.</p>
<p>Thats exetremly anoying.<br>
I would add a night abilty that you can barrier yourself instead of 2 others, like 3 uses or somthing.</p>

            <p>How bout making it a 1 night and 1 day abil? It would work on assassins poison, hunters retribution, etc during the day too? That way it wont last 2 nights but you still get the benefit of an uber shield (of sorts)</p>

            <p>It was described as a redirect so occupy immunity would stop it. I guess we could ignore that at make it considered a prevention instead or something.</p>

            <p>Nighttime only is cool. Would that be considered a redirect? They are targeting what they think to be their main objective. The original is not involved and the original would not receive any information about actions taken. Everyone would use those abilities on the perceived target and receive apprioate responses ie. Target was attacked, target was converted,target was debauched etc. Don’t know if that would be impossible or hard to prove as claiming you helped somebody</p>

            <p>The duplicate is at night and under what I said you would not know who did it. In otherwords the possible results are:</p>
<p>Your duplicate was triggered by a:<br>
MM<br>
CL<br>
Assassin<br>
Reaper<br>
Possessor<br>
Knight<br>
Alchemist<br>
Mercenary<br>
Sellsword<br>
Drunk<br>
Butler<br>
Servant<br>
Invoker<br>
Fool</p>
<p>No other classes could trigger it and you don’t even stop all negative activity’s.</p>
<p>As for the 2 night thing that is just</p>
<p>N1: Use duplicate on someone. The decoy is active<br>
N2: The decoy is active<br>
N3: The decoy is not active anymore</p>
<p>It basicly just protects 1 person over 2 nights instead of 2 people over 1 night.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reformat. But that is the gist. The copy becomes the target of anything meant for the original, one thing I was unsure about would be the prince. Because it would technically target the clone. Could be somthing like in the rare case that happens either just ignore the copy and jail the original or jail the clone and have the court wizard talk through the clone. But that may bee too crazy.</p>
<p>Also,to add onto the 2 nighttime duration it would be pretty op for the wizard to protect 2 people from conversion every turn and have 2 duplicates watching over 2 others in the late game. The CW would have some ramp up time (roughly 3-4 nights to gather info then they end up protecting half of who’s left.</p>
<p>But the copy would relay any information besides exact people back to the CW.  This is the biggest part that could be up for change. Imagine in the day if your clone gets poisoned by assassin. Getting a message about a target getting frozen by a reaper, or a person getting trollboxed. It’s a lot of info that can be thrown at the CW. Getting exact info would be so broken.</p>

            <p>Just to format it better</p>
<p>Duplicate - Give your target that will trick anyone trying to convert, kill or occupy your target to preform it on the decoy instead, destroying the Decoy. The if the decoy is destroyed you will know what class triggered it. The decoy lasts for 2 nights (2 uses)</p>

            <p>I’m not so sure on the balance side of it. I like it, the 2 night duration is the part I’m unsure of though. I do like the rest of it.</p>
