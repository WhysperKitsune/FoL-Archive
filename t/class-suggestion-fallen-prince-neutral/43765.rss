    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-fallen-prince-neutral/43765</link>
    <description>Lore: The king did not want to choose sides anymore, he decided that his life is more important than the kingdom. After he made this decision the King became neutral in the battle against BD and Unseen. The Prince noticed that his king wasn&#39;t helping BD anymore. He demanded of his father to step down and let him take the throne. The king grew in anger that day. Later that night the king sent a guard to go kill his son. A brutal slash dead center through the gut made the poor prince fall to his knees. As the Kings guard left, another shadow appeared. After the prince regained his focus, he noticed that all his wounds were cured. A friendly alchemist came to his aid saving his life. The next morning there was talk of another killer. Eventually they put the alchemist on trial. As he tried to defend himself, the king wasn&#39;t having it. He decided that his fate was death and killed him in fear of dying. The prince heard of this and had enough. He fled the kingdom swearing of revenge on the Future. The King had a new son growing up to become the new prince.

            <p>I feel like the Prince’s jail should override the evil Prince’s. BD should not be forced to fake claim.</p>

            <p>Sorry, that goes along with the first part in parentheses.</p>
<p>If it works so that the jail goes off and the prisoner is talking to themselves, then the prince could conceivably have a “successful” jail even if they are jailed. But if they chose the evil prince and it “failed”, then they don’t know that it failed.</p>
<p>This is important as the evil prince can then claim “I was jailed and prince didn’t say anything” next day and fly under the radar. If the prince knows that his jail failed, he would know his jail target was the evil prince.</p>
<p>If the jail always fails when the prince is himself jailed, then that part would not apply.</p>

            <p>How do you not know that your jail is unsuccessful? If you are in jail then your own jail obviously didn’t work.</p>

            <p>“Survive to see all Kings and players with royal blood killed” might work well enough for a twist on the typical NK.</p>
<p>To compensate for his easier victory condition (relative to other NKs), give him limited uses of execute.</p>
<p>Also, let either prince jail the other, which cancels the latter’s jail (alternately, the latter’s prisoner ends up talking to themselves without knowing that their jailor is absent). If the princes jail each other simultaneously, only the evil prince is successful (good prince won’t know that his jail was unsuccessful)</p>

            <p>I did suggest having a second night Ability that lets you kill someone that isn’t jailed by you. Thanks advantage of not using it is that Execute cannot be stopped.</p>

            <p>Hey I have an idea. What if it jails someone at night, but the player knows it is Fallen Prince. You may execute anyone, even if not jailed, That way you can gain information about Cult/Unseen from BD, since they will be inclined to let you kill evils. This also helps it walk the line of balancing the Cult/Unseen and Blue Dragon.</p>

            <p>Well the idea is that if he is NK then you are dead anyways and he will find out in your will what you were going to say.</p>

            <p>Maybe good as NK. The problem is that no one will talk to Prince, which ruins the class.</p>

            <p>Offensive version: Seems extremely disruptive.  Makes it harder for BD to coordinate with actual prince.  What happens if prince and fallen prince choose to jail same person?  So this is essentially a scorn for kings?  What is purpose of jailing king if you can’t execute him?</p>
<p>Killer version: Certainly seems fun.  You gain info from each of your victims.  Perhaps make it so fallen prince loses his executes if he axes a neutral player?  Not sure if he should have the ability to attack people other than who he jailed tho.  Since his jail ability can identify the prince, this would seem a pretty strong way for princes to die even more regularly.</p>
