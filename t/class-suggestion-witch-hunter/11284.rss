    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-witch-hunter/11284</link>
    <description>Witch Hunter . (Neutral Investigative)

Passive 
Determined : The Witch hunter is driven to route out the witch and see her burnt , he cannot be occupied .

Night Ability 1 : WitchHunt : Discover if someone is possibly a witch ( possible witchs are female)

Night Ability 2 : Burn the Witch (3 uses ) Kill someone you believe to be a witch , if the target is a witch this bypasses night immunity . 

Win condition : See the witch Dead .

Notes : Each charachter would now in addition to everything else have a gender . If a game starts with a witchhunter , 1 random female charachter will in addition to their normal class , be a witch.
Witchs are night immune to death and receive a notice at the start of the game that they are also a witch .

Butler - Male
Court Wizard - Male
Death Knight - same as before raised
Drunk - Male
Hunter - Male
Knight - Male
Noble - Male
Observer - Male/Female
Paladin - Male
Physicain - Male/Female
Prince - Male
Princess - Female
Psychic - Male/Female
Sheriff - Male
Fool - Male
Scorned -Male/Female
Mercenary - Male/Female
Possesor - Male
Reaper - Nothing ( will show as not female )
All starting Evil( assassin ,mastermind, cult leader etc ) - Male/Female ( determined only for starting evil , converted players keep original gender )

Players cannot change gender during a game , the only exception being the possesor will remain the same gender as the body he inhabits , if he somehow inhabits the witch , he will become the witch .

Reasons you would want to Kill the Witch Hunter : If you are female , you will be a target .
Reasons to keep Witch Hunter alive : his reports can be quite informative , which would likely mostly benefit BD , the prince is likely safe as is the starting king , also there is a chance that if the good guys are not the witch then a key bad guy could be the target witch .</description>

            <p>I wasn’t really going on the male female being based on the pictures , Because I am greedy with my suggestion and want to create loads of extra work . It would be cool if there was a male and female picture available for the relevant class.</p>
<p>I have updated Merc to  include a female possibility <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>The witch would have its normal win goal , if the witch was a member of the unseen/cult they would win with those , if the witch was a member of BD then would win with BD .</p>
<p>The witch isn’t a class in itself , more of an additional mark on that player . Similair to a merc contract or scorned target but in reverse , because the target knows they are the witch but the hunter dosent</p>

            <p>I was thinking the  message would be<br>
player 1 is a female so could be a witch.<br>
and<br>
player 1 is not female so cannot be a witch . So reaper would be on this message category</p>

            <p>Other then that I think you need to give reaper a gender since other wise reaper games are gonna end quickly with a witch hunter.</p>
