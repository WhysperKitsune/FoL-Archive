    <title>[Class Suggestion] Return of the Noble</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-return-of-the-noble/23537</link>
    <description>Noble was removed because of a Hearsay that did not work as intented and because people thought Noble was too primarily focussed on vote manipulation.

My suggestion is to have him return with his old (but slightly nerfed) Spy Maid ability instead of 1 vote manipulation ability.

            <p>More broken than the unlimited choice between spying and hiding your whispers?</p>
<p>I think all will be good with one limited use spying ability.</p>

            <p>Isn’t it thought? First of all anyone whispering to you doesn’t know about the spy, Second of all it doesn’t actually negate the usefulness of maid spy. It is still just as useful if you are using it on someone other than the king and if you figure out who the king is going to whisper to then it is even better because rather than being uncertain the thinks he is definitely not being watched.</p>

I completely forgot the Royal Blood passive! Of course that should stay. Added it.</p>
<p>I think being able to use Spy Maid D2 is very strong. It both gives you some vital info on other BD and gives you an opportunity to declare Noble all with 1 ability.</p>
<p>D3 increases the chance that Noble is converted (either Aristocrat who also has Spy Maid, or Apostle who has Eavesdrop), so him breaking in a BD chat still gives you the info, but the Noble will be trusted a little less by those BD.<br>
I wouldn’t be opposed removing this restriction though and see how that goes. (the fewer restrictions = the more clear the rules = the better the game)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nuclearburrito">@NuclearBurrito</a><br>
No, that would be too much of a nerf. King should be in the dark too. Just requires a bit more thought from King when whisping.</p>

            <p>I agree Noble should be added back in to the game. But there’s no reason Maid Spy should be restricted like that.</p>
<p>Also, it totally needs the Royal Blood passive, too.</p>
