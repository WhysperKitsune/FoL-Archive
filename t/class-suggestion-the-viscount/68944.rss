    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Viscount</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-viscount/68944</link>
    <description>So here&#39;s my take on the **_oh-so incredibly original and creative_** usurper/king hardcounter/royal soc neut class idea or whatever you call it.

&gt; # [color = &quot;grey&quot;] The Viscount [/color] :shield:
&gt; **[color = &quot;gray&quot;] Neutral Social [/color]** 
**Megalomaniac (Passive)** - As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King. Becomes the Decadent King instead of the Neutral King.
**Green-Eyed Monster (Passive)** - The Viscount is immune to death at night. During the day the Viscount can also read the whispers to and from the King.
**Political Pressure (Day)** - Force a player to accuse another player and prevent them from voting further. - 2 uses 
**Troll Box (Day)** - Choose a target player and whisper a short phrase into the troll box. It will appear as if that player said it. - Infinite uses 
**Intercept (Night)** - Prevents the King from being able to hear whispers from your target. - Infinite uses
**Subterfuge (Night)** - Redirects the King’s night action to a selected target while bypassing his immunity to occupation and redirection. - 2 uses 
*Live to become King for at least a day.*

Crowns into:

&gt; # [color = &quot;grey&quot;] The Decadent King [/color] 
&gt; **[color = &quot;grey&quot;] Neutral Special [/color]** 
**Inept Government (Passive)** - In the night after the Viscount is crowned, if not executed, all faction checks will always return Blue Dragon and healing will always fail. After winning, the Decadent King cannot accuse anyone of treason, loses his King abilities, vote in trials, and will not be factored in for the voting count required to put a player on trial.  
**End of a Dynasty (Passive)** - If the Decadent King dies after the day he was crowned ended, then there will not be any King elections to replace him.
**The Royal Finger (Day)** - The King&#39;s next vote for treason will count twice. - Infinite uses
**Decide Fate (Day)** - After the final vote, the King can veto the votes and decide if the fate of the person defending themselves. If the King decides to execute, the player on the stand is executed. If the King decides to pardon the player on the stand, they can&#39;t be accused of treason again that day. 1 use
&gt;*Live to become King for at least a day.*

In short, his entire kit revolves in helping him accomplishing his wincon:
* Night immunity as neuts are SOL if they are random night-killed early.
* Royal Blood as it&#39;s downright impossible to become King if not a Royal in most matches.
* Troll Box as it&#39;s absolutely necessary for a Social Neutral.
* Whisper reading to dis-encourage the King meta and also allows him to claim Noble or Princess or can be used to further frame the King. 
* Political Pressure to allow him to fake being a Noble and casting doubts on Noble claims.
* Intercept and Subterfuge as a means to screw around with the King and framing them as evil.
* Decadent King passives that makes him explicitly an anti-BD neutral and to require them to outright trick the Blue Dragon rather than striking deals with them.</description>

            <blockquote>
<p><strong>Intercept (Night)</strong>  - Prevents the King from being able to hear whispers from your target. - Infinite uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should remove these and the other Noblesque abilities to prevent Viscount from confirming himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Green-Eyed Monster (Passive)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had to look that one up to see what it meant, lol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subterfuge (Night)</strong>  - Redirects the King’s night action to a selected target while bypassing his immunity to occupation and redirection. - 2 uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is unnecessary and too powerful for the class.  It’s not going to be fun as King getting killed when you tried to guard yourself because your counter redirected you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inept Government (Passive)</strong>  - <font color="red">In the night after the Viscount is crowned, if not executed, all faction checks will always return Blue Dragon and healing will always fail.</font> After winning, the Decadent King cannot accuse anyone of treason, loses his King abilities, vote in trials, <font color="red">and will not be factored in for the voting count required to put a player on trial.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think if we remove the parts in red it would be a better class.  This way, newly elected evil or neutral kings can pretend to be decadent. The possibility of a decadent claim actually being evil or neutral would be enough incentive for BD to not want to elect a a Viscount claim.</p>

            <p>I like the fact that he can redirect king’s order execution. That would help evil kings kill an important target and claim that the Viscount redirected them.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’d still be more prudent to vote another confirmed BD as King instead of letting a Decadent King rise up.</p>
<p>A Viscount gives a punishment to BD, prevents people from becoming King, and effectively leaves the game once they win, so allying with a Viscount would only be a good strategy in the most extreme circumstances.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The issue here is that a having a King typically goes to BD’s favor as classes with RB are almost always BD and they’re often needed in the case of a lynch, along with the 3 guards. Plus, the Inept Government passive will mess up BD the next night. It’s not 100% evil, but more often than not a Decadent King will screw BD over rather than help them.</p>

</aside>
<p>Both penalties for voting the Viscount as King apply if and only if the Decadent King isn’t executed the same day that he is crowned. Originally I intended for him to automatically win upon becoming King, but I changed it to requiring him to survive the day as the previous iteration would have no counter-play if the Viscount was the last royalty standing, which is why he didn’t have the Finger before. Now it’s pretty much needed as he can be mechanically confirmed to be Decadent.</p>

<strong>Inept Government (Passive)</strong> - In the night after the Viscount is crowned, if not executed, all faction checks will always return Blue Dragon and healing will always fail.

<p>In short, his entire kit revolves in helping him accomplishing his wincon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Night immunity as neuts are SOL if they are random night-killed early.</li>
<li>Royal Blood as it’s downright impossible to become King if not a Royal in most matches.</li>
<li>Troll Box as it’s absolutely necessary for a Social Neutral.</li>
<li>Whisper reading to dis-encourage the King meta and also allows him to claim Noble or Princess or can be used to further frame the King.</li>
<li>Political Pressure to allow him to fake being a Noble and casting doubts on Noble claims.</li>
<li>Intercept and Subterfuge as a means to screw around with the King and framing them as evil.</li>
<li>Decadent King passives that makes him explicitly an anti-BD neutral and to require them to outright trick the Blue Dragon rather than striking deals with them.</li>
</ul>
