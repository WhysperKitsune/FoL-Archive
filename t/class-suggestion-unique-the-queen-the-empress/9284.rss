            <p>With the Savior ability… problem I see with this is:</p>
<p>the Queen putting in her logs n3 - Savior King</p>
<p>D4 queen dies. Confirmed evil king.<br>
It’s already hard enough to win as evil king :/.</p>
<p>The ability sounds amazing though. It could cause a lot of arguing over the queens death and wether or not she was killed, or died from saving an evil king. I am pretty sure that was the aim of the ability, but like i said, I think evil king is hard enough already</p>

            <p>I would love to see the Queen added to the game, along with Empress convertable, like we talked about the gap between Queen and Empress in discord, Unseen could have promised the Queen more lands to reign over thus converting her to Empress.</p>
<p>25-50% spawn chance sounds fine - only Unseen games?</p>
<p>The slap would allow the duchess to blame that the Queen is evil or the Empress that the Princess was converted, i feel like that would be great addition to the game.</p>
<p>So overall, the abilities sound balanced, yet fun to play.</p>
