            <p>yeah sure, that sounds reasonable</p>
<p>edit: done, although I called this new one “Jinx” because I liked Charm being the name of the passive as “Spell of Focus” doesn’t sound as good imo</p>

            <p>I don’t know, to be honest. But as it is you literally cannot die unless you’re hit twice in a row. It’s extremely tank-y, and I feel that there should be some level of skill involved. Maybe move the kill transfer to a one-shot “Hex” night ability (it could probably not be used up unless you’re attacked if you want, also rename the current Hex to Charm). That would change the game from “keep cursing and hope they don’t survive to tell” into "when should I use my Hex instead of my Curse?</p>

<p>Literally what I said. I’m aware ToL has really high-power roles, but avoiding death and countering the Knight in this way might be too much.</p>
