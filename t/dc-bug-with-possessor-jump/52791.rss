    <title>DC bug with possessor jump</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/dc-bug-with-possessor-jump/52791</link>
    <description>I had a DC in the loading screen and when I came back in the game, it was the beginning of D2 and I saw a dead psychic in chat but on the right side it showed up as a dead possessor.
