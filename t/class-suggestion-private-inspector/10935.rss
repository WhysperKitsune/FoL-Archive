            <p>I would love to see this class come into fruition to be honest. However, the name would most likely have to be changed to go along with the kingdom theme. And the goal would most likely to find all other neutrals or survive to the end. The Unseen/BD would both love to exe you if you arent on their side. No defenses would make this a valid goal.</p>
