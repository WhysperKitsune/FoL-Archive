<p>I wasn’t talking to him, I wasn’t complementing him, I wasn’t doing anything that can be considered pocketey and if you’re reading these posts and coming to the conclusion that I’m pocketing Conroy then that’s the first sign that you’re going into my ISO with a conclusion in mind, and even though you dropped it as it has no merit, you should be aware that what you’re saying here doesn’t make sense in the first place</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I found it to be pockety, it’s inference and based on your attitude mixed with the intent of the post, I felt like it didn’t make much sense to come from a Town to talk about their townread, but now that I know about the threadstate because let I remind you I was a fucking replacement and haven’t read everything, I now realise why posts like these were made so frequently.</p>

<p>When I say that I’m playing by PoE I mean that I’m using the method of starting with the entire playerlist, and pulling players out and into a pool of townreads as i find them as villagers, which leaves behind a clump of players who are the most likely to be wolves by Process of Elimination (PoE)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Chloe, I’ve been on this website and I’ve been playing FM for almost 3 years, I know what playing by PoE is as it’s the most frequent thing I just use, process of elimination is a thing but I misunderstood what you meant by “PoE Player”, what I thought you meant was that you were a player who is frequently in the PoE.</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe this game isn’t as easy as it seems until we chop through the players who are doing nothing. If the game doesn’t end (or get close to it) then it gets harder<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I find this to be unjust, you can’t just pick and choose a bunch of players and think you’re correct and have little to no worries about being incorrect. You’re acting how Conroy did earlier, you can’t just push your possible failures aside for a later date.</p>

<p>Pigeon was mostly in his townmeta throughout D1 of Ciconia at least to my knowledge, what I was basically saying is that if you were reading him meta wise, you’d think he was town in that game, and if you thought he was town via meta there, have that lack off meta isn’t a point in his favour.</p>

<p>Townreading someone isn’t pocketing them<br>
The way a townread is formed and presented <em>can</em> be, if your goal is to appeal directly to that person and get them on your good side<br>
I wasn’t doing that and I can’t tell if you think the word pocket means something that it doesn’t mean, or if you’re genuinely seeing things that don’t exist</p>
<p>And “especially coming from a player who’s good at this”<br>
I will say, once again, that I am not, and do not plan, on tryharding this game<br>
I want a chill game where I can sit back and not lead and not put in a ton of effort unless it’s necessary</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To me, it felt more like a bashed repeat of “I townread this, I townread that”, of course like I stated above I hadn’t read the thread so I had no idea what state this game was in townread wise, so my thoughts just make me think “Wow, there are way too many townreads and way too little scumreads coming from this player” which I’d suspect anyone for, not just you considering you’re a good player. I don’t plan on tryharding this game either, hell I didn’t plan on being here or trying at all, but I got nothing better to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>I will say, I’m not planning on being aggressive or a dick towards you or anyone this game, so don’t be it towards me, I can understand getting annoyed but avoid the passive aggressiveness as much as you can, it annoys me more than an outburst towards me.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../u/cream.html">@Cream</a> what’s your read on me?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To sum it up, I’m a little conflicted. I think you have town things going for you, but also things that make me go meep.</p>
<p>Something that I really like relates back to when I asked you about your null slots on Cent, Vulgard, and Chloe. Later on, you actually bothered to look through those three people that you had doubts on and evaluate them. Shows intent to actually solve. I do however, think your re-eval of Centuries was a little weak (<span class="hashtag">#860</span>), given that that reason has already been brought up before but it’s still valid. Your take on Vulgard is a little better and brings in new perspective.</p>
<p>Your take on Chloe feels a little weird. You think she’s wolf and defending LHF to get towncred. Alice brings up a point about how Chloe approached pigeon isn’t how wolves defend LHF and brings in an example from Ciconia (<span class="hashtag">#877</span>). Instead of re-evaluating based on this new point Alice brings up, you essentially plug your ears and dismiss Alice’s point due to not being there at Ciconia. You then engage in whataboutism, as you then bring up how Chloe’s defense felt unnatural and the timing was off. (<span class="hashtag">#880</span>)</p>
<p>If you’re town, I ask that you re-evaluate with an open mind.</p>
