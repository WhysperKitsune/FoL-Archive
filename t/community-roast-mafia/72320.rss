            <p><strong>SeththefuckinKing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral Cryptic</strong></p>
<p>He’s the King of Pro Mafia and has a very unique play style. Not much people can say they actually admire the guy but they definitely respect him. He has very good solves and PoE but he does it differently then others so it isn’t always recognizable how he reaches the conclusions that he gives.<br>
Definitely a Top Skilled Player with a surprising not a Strong Player look Via game thread which is rather interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Ability</strong>:<br>
<strong>You have A Gun you can use once Each day and you wanna use it because your really good at solving!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>:<br>
Kill At Least 1 Scum and 1 Town using your Gun in the Game.</p>
