    <description>Court Wizard - BD Support

Day Ability:
Magic Barrier (Unlimited uses) - Protect one player from being target changed, converted, or occupied. Stays on target until changed. Works like a mix between current Magic Barrier and the Sheriff&#39;s Scout ability.

Night Ability 1:
Harden skin (Unlimited uses) - If targeted player is attacked, they are instead caused to bleed, and will die in 1 day. Both of you will be informed of this. This bleed is unaffected by the physician&#39;s inoculation.

Night Ability 2:
Ice Wall (2 uses) - Prevent all visits to your target tonight.

Comments:
Magic barrier is useful, but having to use up all your nights to use it just felt bad. Half the time it did nothing. Making it a day ability keeps the strength without making it feel like you&#39;re wasting days. I feel like both the night abilities keep him as a protective support, but keep them different to other current BD supports. At the moment there&#39;s no BD support that can prevent visits, but there&#39;s a neutral one. The delayed stabbing is helpful, but still requires a healer. The no overlap with inoculation is to prevent fringe cases where an inoculated BD with a pocket CW is unkillable + unconvertable with minimal effort, or even 2 inoculated CWs making eachother immune to everything.



Sage - Unseen Offensive

Day Ability:
False Barrier (unlimited uses) - One player will get messages as if they have a magic barrier, but occupy and target switching effects will still go through. The target will believe their abilities went through as normal.

Night Ability:
Guiding hand (Unlimited uses) - Force a player to target another player with their ability

Night Ability 2
Fire Wall (2 uses - matches with Ice Wall charges used before conversion) - Prevent visits to your target for everyone except for Unseen sided players (Unseen, EK, and Sorcerer)

Comments:
Clarifications for false aura:
- If a target is changed, they will be informed that an attempt was blocked. They will receive the results of their new target, but will be told it relates to their original one. (e.g. Sheriff is investigating the Assassin. Sage has swapped them to the Princess. Sheriff will be told the Assassin player is BD, as they assign the Princess results to the Assassin). 
- If the player is occupied, they will be informed that an occupy attempt went through, but was blocked, and it will seem like their ability went through as normal, with no outcome if possible. (Knights will be told they guarded, Phys will be told healing was not required, Observer will be told their target visited noone etc.).
- If an outcome is necessary, they will receive feedback as if they had investigated themselves. (Princess will get Special/Invest, Sheriff will get non sus). 
- Killers will be told &quot;you attacked XYZ last night&quot; but no attack will happen.
- Non-Sage targets who occupy or target swap a false barriered player will believe their occ/swap was prevented

Guiding hand and False Barrier have obvious synergy between eachother. Fire Wall can be used on any target (BD or Unseen) so can be used offensively or defensively. The switch to Offensive role, instead of Support, has happened before, with Knight/Enforcer, and Phys/Herbalist.</description>

            <p>It’s only just as confirmable as a Physician/Alchemist is. It’s dependant on hitting a kill target at the right time.</p>
<p>If you’re referring to magic barrier, then same issue effects, but either way, it could be changed to not give messages to the protected player that they were protected from an effect. False Barrier could be changed to “Hazy aura” or something, so it just hides the fact that that player was occed/target switched, rather than telling them the effect was blocked.</p>

            <p>It is a worse heal, but Physicians can’t protect against conversions or occupations.</p>
<p>The general idea I had is that this CW can keep a confirmed BD safe to a limit, but not enough to keep a player completely safe all game on his own. The delayed death means that they have to depend on healers to save them, or worst case scenario, CW keeps a confirmed BD alive for an extra turn than usual.</p>

            <p>He’s not really. The only way to know it’s him is if his target is attacked. No BD can really trigger than so he’s impossible to test.</p>
