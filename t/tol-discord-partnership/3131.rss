    <description>How has the Throne of Lies Discord server not been partnered yet?
 According to:
https://discordapp.com/partners
The average partnered Discord Server is a mere 157 members.
![image|690x149](upload://5jdmySsThIZH4bRAoTCE8MW4qM6.png)
The ToL Discord has at least that many ***active*** members on the ToL Discord, in all there&#39;s 3411 members!
![image|676x437](upload://4gbw2YrkWeBkQiLAXCwV0WwxTHJ.png)
I mean, like come-on! I know for a fact @í42-Xblade stated he had previously applied the server for partnership- and it was denied. We had less members at that time (around 2k), but there were still a lot of people! *I mean, come on!* What is the Discord Staff Team on?!  My basic question, how, not why, but HOW hasn&#39;t the Throne of Lies Discord been partnered as of yet, like ****COME ON****.

The gif tells no lies, COME ON MAN. What&#39;s up with Discord to deny an application of a server of this magnitude..?</description>

<p>Frankly, a petition an’t gonna do shit. Discord is a private business, and they decide who is a, Hypesquad member, Discord partner, etc. They can legally ignore this petition.</p>
<p>Look what XBlade said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps they are waiting for us to catch up on social media?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This what I think cause the denial, the lack of social media presence Honestly it’s not emojis in roles and names, they have to make sure your legit, social media is a good way to check.</p>
<p>NOTE:I have applied for Hypesquad and was denied, (Big shocker, I didn’t really care), I have no clue what the partnership application entails, this is going off of what I have heard.</p>

            <p>We got denied at 3k users on Twitter + Discord: Ask Discord – we furiously promote Discord and have dramatically more users than the average partnered Discord server. Perhaps they are waiting for us to catch up on social media?</p>

<p>Keep asking people to join and +1 our social media ~ one day, we’ll get there</p>
