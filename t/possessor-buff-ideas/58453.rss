    <title>Possessor Buff Ideas</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/possessor-buff-ideas/58453</link>
    <description>Possessor, was supposed to be the NK that got the biggest benefit from the removal of dead interaction. However, it&#39;s still the worst NK, due to the worst win rate at 7% (confirmed).

And now with the Noble Changes coming most likely in the next patch, Poss loses another potential fake claim, the Noble. 

I think we should think about buffing the Possessor, and I have some ideas here. 

Disclaimer: These are not only mine, some are also from others, including @NuclearBurrito @NightX @orangeandblack5   

**IDEAS**

1. Increase the uses of Possess back to 3 from 2

Possessor was really versatile with 3, as you could jump multiple times, leaving your old body when you felt you were becoming suspicious. This just increases the flexibility of the Possess ability, and it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a late-game crutch.

2. Make Possess bypass healing

This isn&#39;t an implausible idea, as the Reaper&#39;s only night ability, Reap, always bypasses healing. However, Possess is a cornerstone to the Possessor, and without it, the jumping mechanic is harder to use.

3. Include &quot;Hidden Occupation Immunity&quot;

Like the Mastermind, Possessor could also hide its occupy immunity, so that it can use more fake claims than just the average Hunter or Butler claims that most NK fall to.

4. Some Day Ability to Cancel or Silence Votes

Reaper, even though it doesn&#39;t have night or occupy immunity, has a higher win percentage because of its special abilities: Icy Touch and Gather Darkness. I feel that Possessor could also take advantage of an ability like that, to disrupt communication or action during the day.


So a proposed rework could be as follows:

[quote]

**[color=gray]The Possessor[/color]**

_Passives_

**Blackened Shield:** 
Immune to death, occupation, and redirection.

**Driven:** 
Can use both Day Abilities in the same day.

_Abilities_

**Siphon Aura:** (D) (2)
Choose a player. Their passives will be cancelled for today and tonight. (Works during trials and king election) (No notification)

**Bind Aura:** (D) (3)
Choose a player. They cannot use Day Abilities for the rest of the day. (Does not work during trials and king election)

**Puppet Strings:** (N) (oo)
Choose a player. Force them to attack your second target. Any player you controlled into attacking others will have their whispers visible to you for the rest of the game.

**Possess:** (N) (3)
Choose a player and a class to disguise as. You will possess their body and become them. Bypasses Healing.

Note: If the possessed player had any Passive or Immunity, such as Royal Blood or Poison/Bleed Immunity, you will keep it.

[/quote]

So what Siphon Aura does is remove someone&#39;s Royal Blood, Occupation Immunity, Poison and Bleed Immunity, and most importantly Night Immunity, but also prevents them from using Day Abilities. It may seem a bit OP, but this sort of flexibility could be what Possessor needs to be buffed.

Note: King&#39;s Guards will still make a player whose aura was siphoned to be night immune.</description>

            <p>Possess is possessor’s empowered kill, not puppet strings.  Also, reaper can bypass healing normally and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>

            <p>Maybe make that the last person that you successfully possessed to attack another will always pardon you the next day if you are upped. Or maybe if there’s less than 4 people left the person you last possessed will not be able to vote you up.</p>
<p>This could help especially end game where the possessor has no way to control the votes, unlike the reaper and the sorcerer.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I love this. It actually makes fakeclaiming as a current Noble viable for the Possessor while also making the jump into the King a safe move. I’d also add 3’s effect to Blackened Shield as it’ll stop Butlers and Drunks from outing you. (I would actually also do this to Sorcerer as Drunks and Butlers should not have such strong investigative potentials that they can out the NK.)</p>
<p>Though, here are a few suggestions from me for the new Possessor in regards to whispering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A) Puppet Strings: Players who have been controlled during any previous night will have their whispers shown to the Possessor.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B) Driven: Now allows the Possessor to read all whispers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A buff from the current Puppet Strings in order to match the new Noble. By late-game the Possessor shouldn’t have much troubles finding at least one whisper due to A’s Puppet Strings, or B at any phase of the game, and thus a Noble fake-claim would still be viable. Reading whispers is necessary for the Possessor as otherwise Possess could be easily countered by the reading past whispers/password tactic. Plus, the current whisper meta can be mitigated or even countered if any Evil with a reliable whisper-reading ability is added.</p>
<p>And another part relating to royalty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C) Possess: The Possessor will gain Royal Blood if their target was originally royalty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is essentially a way to prevent auto-confirmation via stepping up or outing the Possessor if they possessed a royalty. Plus, also allows more depth for Possessor&gt;Psycho King strategies</p>
