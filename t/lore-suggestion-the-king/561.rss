Lore Subject: The Crown of the Cult

Lore: True to his subjects and loyal to a God. The King as cultist must Shepard his wayward flock into the loving embrace of Mithras. He is not evil nor malicious but disappointed in the path his children and court take. With the sage wisdom of his beloved Cult Leader he sets about amending the ways of his sceptical subjects. After all a King must look out for his people and the only fitting future for his kingdom is to join with Mithras lest a fate far worse befall them all. The disappointment the King endures does not mean he is without mercy however. His subjects are given every opportunity too join his righteous path. Only in their refusal is their life forfeit and they will serve either as blood or as body.

Comments: I noticed the King didn&#39;t have an entry if he should spawn as a cult member. I took the idea that a cult King would retain the importance of the kingdom but also believe the only way to save it is through Mithras&#39; grace. The King as a cult leader should be deluded and truly believe he is doing the best for everyone.</description>

            <p>The king can start as cult if a cult is present in the game. It’s like Br and such, the king will be a random faction and well cult should be included in that pool, otherwise it would be unfair, for if the cult knows the king cannot be one of them they can kill them right off the bat <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Actually, I’m not sure there can ever be a cult king. Someone correct me if I read the wiki wrong, but from the main page under the heading <strong>The four factions</strong> it states that “The Cult will start with only The Cult Leader.” This means the king cannot start as a cultist. In addition, the current king is immune to conversion, and since no cultist is considered nobility, an existing cult member cannot claim the throne either.</p>
