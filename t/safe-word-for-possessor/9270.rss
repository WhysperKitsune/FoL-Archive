    <title>Safe word for possessor</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/safe-word-for-possessor/9270</link>
    <description>Played as alch last game. Got down to 4 players. Possessor jumped that night. Now 3 players. King couldn&#39;t decide who was the possessor so nobody got voted. Possessor used king to kill me that night. From now on if there is a chance of possessor in game I&#39;m whispering a safe word to the king so I can prove I&#39;m not the possessed one.</description>

            <p>Keywords always work.One time it was me,a psychic,an alch,and a king left.<br>
I tell prince in psychic chat “The keyword is apple”<br>
The possessor then jumps bodies.<br>
I ask them for the keyword.<br>
The “prince” doesnt know it and gets hung.<br>
Keywords help against the possessor.</p>

            <p>If king doesn’t understand what I’m talking about I’ll assume he was the one taken over. Although I thought he was immune to that</p>
