    <title>Sorc Day Ability - BLIND (unable to read chat)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sorc-day-ability-blind-unable-to-read-chat/77798</link>
    <description>&gt;# Blind
&gt;**Day Ability** - 3 uses
&gt;
&gt;Prevent a player from reading chat for 20 seconds.

I think Sorcerer really needs a day ability analogous to Chill and Mind Control.

A Blinded player could continue to see chat, but for the 20-second duration it would be censored.  Then afterwards, they could go back to see what was said.

Kind of like the opposite of Silence.</description>

            <p>It’s not hard to prefix your chat with a number once everyone knows it’s a sorc game.  Which if the ability is effective, they will.  You see people share posswords in poss games.</p>
