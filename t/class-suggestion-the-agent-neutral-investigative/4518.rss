**Light Step (Passive)** - The Observer&#39;s Follow and the Princess&#39; Wisp will never detect you. Additionally, you won&#39;t set off Hunter or Poacher traps, and you are night immune.
**On The Run (Passive)** - If investigated to determine your faction, class type or exact class, the investigator will know that you are The Agent, and your secret documents will be revealed. This publicly names all Royals and their *starting* class. Also, if you die your documents will be revealed. - 1 time only.
**Keen Eye (Day)** - You will know who the target player visits and who visits them tonight. - Infinite Uses.
**Secret Conversation (Day)** - Tonight you will secretly talk with a target player. They will not know who you are, only seeing your name as The Agent. - Infinite uses.

**Hide (Night)** - Hide in a player&#39;s room tonight. All visits to you will be redirected to them, and you will learn their exact class. - 3 uses.

            <p>I had in mind that Discovery would be used if you found out who an Unseen/Cult member was through Hide, and then gave them the information through secret conversation to assist them if you wanted to. But I do agree with the night immunity, that could ruin you too easily.</p>

            <p>This class should probably be night immune since it can automatically lose N1 if it is killed or investigated by a Princess, Observer, or King. The Agent has a high chance of losing immediately with investigations already, but dying also makes them lose. This would be a class where if you win, it’d be largely due to luck.</p>
<p>I would rarely ever use Discovery, and instead be using Hide. The risk of not hiding and getting investigated is too high. I don’t particularly care who the Prince is if I’m neutral.</p>
<p>I like Keen Eye because it allows you to fake an Observer well.</p>
<p>Neutral Investigatives have proven to be difficult to pin down. What should they be doing? That’s the problem with mine and Unknown’s suggestions as well - they’re just <em>harder</em> survivor classes.</p>
