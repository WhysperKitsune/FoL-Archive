    <description>* When someone attempts to occupy a Blue Dragon player who is occupy immune, the latter receives no notification.

&gt; This allows evils who are pretending to be an occupying class (e.g. the Butler) to use occupy immune players they are aware of to fill some nights in their logbook.
Evil occupy immune players still receive notifications as normal so that they can react accordingly.

* When a Drunk uses Happy Hour on a player, the latter is only aware of having been occupied.

&gt; Right now Happy Hour gives a unique notification to the target player, which makes it extremely easy for Drunks to confirm themselves. This change would allow at least classes with some redirection abilities (e.g. Ritualist) to attempt this claim.

* When a player is successfully healed, they receive one notification no matter how many classes healed them.

&gt; Right now, healer classes (Physicians and Alchemists) are extremely easy to prove. As soon as a player gets poisoned or is bleeding, every healer can just visit them and they will instantly know how many healer classes are left in the game.
With this change, fake healers can share the credit for heals.

* Make the Psychic Unique again.

&gt; I feel like this should need no explanation. Not only is the Psychic an extremely powerful class, especially coupled with certain classes (e.g. it can confirm the Physician&#39;s reanimation, discover who the Possessor jumped into, etc.), but it is a class that can instantly confirm itself with its plethora of unique day and night abilities. Only the Illusionist can fake claim it and even then only for a short period of time, since it can&#39;t link.

* Remove the abilities of classes that have already won.

&gt; I feel like this is just a small band-aid for a much deeper problem (having players with no objective influence the game is frustrating for everyone). However, *at the very least* I feel like you should remove their abilities after their victory.
This would prevent the Inquisitor from outing/killing the Cult and the Scorned from auto-confirming themselves after their victory (by trollboxing someone).</description>

            <p>Yea I have similar ideas about less ‘‘confirmation’’ for classes. Still my biggest pet peeve is that NK’s can only claim alchemist or Inquisitor these days with the King’s power being so strong.</p>

            <p>Don’t look at changes with mindset of “this is a nerf, this is a boost”. You should look at the overall balance of the game.</p>
<p>Right now, claimspace is extremely limited for evils in the game. This is a problem. Especially for classes like NKs that can’t rely on their team winning for them.<br>
If you have only two classes that can be fake claimed, you can just win by executing anyone with those claims, without even worrying if they are evil or good.</p>
<p>This change takes nothing away from BD classes (all the abilities still work the same way), it just takes away some free information that <strong>notifications</strong> are currently giving away (most of the time I bet this wasn’t even intentional).</p>

            <p>BTW this is a Mafia game that does’nt relies on people behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can change your nick names every game so noone can say “when he is good he plays diffrently”. Noone can look at your body language, its all about logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst games are the games that you can discover evils just with investigations. Claims and logs are much more healthy and fun for the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>while I do think some of the classes are impossible to fake, I would love to see some new fakeable classes instead of removing the current.  For example, last patch drunk/cw were very easy to fake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way to balance your suggestion is to increase trials per days, and increase the remaining time after one of the players gettting exed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>But does cult/unseen really need a buff? u just nerfed like 4 BD classes.</p>
<p>I hate your psychic suggestion, this is the most fun class for me. maybe just let the psychic keep his<br>
day abilities as cult too? Or make psychic not unique but guranteed?</p>
<p>BTW try not to out yourself as psychic. when I get converted as psychic I just change my claim</p>
<p>I don’t know whats the stats, most of your suggestions are healthy but if unseen/cult win rate is high enough then a buff should be added with those nerfs. For example: BD can get a new prince if he dies early. like MM.</p>
