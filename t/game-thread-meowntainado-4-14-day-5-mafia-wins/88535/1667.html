          <p>look, I’m not saying that you made up those reads on the spot when we started pushing you, I know that’s not true</p>
<p>I just think it’s suspicious that you come back to the thread 15 minutes after I turn you into a major wagon after being gone for nearly 12 hours and declare that you think the wolfteam is exactly the three people voting you and no one else, including none of the players you’d previously suspected who aren’t voting you, and apply literally no additional thought to this beyond repeating arguments you’ve already said</p>

<p>Alright, I am reasonably sure I’ve gamesolved here. I don’t want to call it too early and it definitely relies on preflips and me being correct, but I want to put it out there so its there if I die. I am very open to discussing what I’m going to say here because I want to make sure I’m not tunnelled on someone like Cabbage. Without further ado, let’s begin.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Cabbage</strong></p>
<p>Let’s begin with Cabbage, I initially disliked their day 1, they felt extremely robotic to the point where everything they said felt extremely crafted. They got slightly better as the day grew on, and were defended by Arete on the basis that they were alts (with Arete possibly faking/not faking genuine frustration about not be able to read alts based on tone).</p>
<p>Lets go through their ISO:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Immediately starts an OMGUS vanity push on Emilia which seems extremely fake. The reasoning is poor and cabbage tries to remove any suspicion for pushing back on Emilia instead of other people who voted Cabbage because Emilia had a reason to vote. Emilia is 100% an easier mislynch than hippo in most regards, and cabbage knows this because they are an alt.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, I’m back!</p>
<p>Reading back on the thread, a couple of things stand out to me.</p>
<p>I’m suspicious of Marshal immediately wolfreading Princess Daisy. I’m not entirely following the alt speculation, and even if Marshal somehow does have meta against this slot, I’m not sure how they could have a read of such confidence from… 9 posts. I think Marshal just knows Daisy is scum here and acting to gain town points.</p>

<p>This is such a bad reason to wolfread Marshal and is just extremely worldbuildy. In what world does Marshal so obviously bus a teammate 2 hours in?? That’s so unnatural.</p>

<p>My answer is that my opinion on Emilia hasn’t changed, and rather it worries me more that people seem to townread Emilia too easily. Nothing in her ISO deems any kind of townread in my opinion, and rather there are some actions that are indicative that she is mafia.</p>
<p>As for Eli, I’m at a similar position except I don’t think Eli has done anything outright scummy; people (I think it was Marshal?) immediately cleared Eli for existing and participating, which I still have a hard time accepting.</p>
<p>The last part was about a readlist - yes I do know what those are, but at this stage of the game, everyone is so clumped together any kind of tiering would be meaningless. All I can say is that I think Emilia is the most scummy and myself the least.</p>

<p>Reading back on the thread, I see little justification for people suddenly wanting to vote aelin - they have done little to insicate themselves as either alignment. Furthermore, Luxy claiming that Aelin’s alignment is somehow connected to mine is also unjustified; their vote on me appears to be mostly a joke for not responding to them soon enough.</p>
<p>I’m surprised that between the two that people seem okay with voting today - Aelin and Gorta - people want to vote Aelin rather than Gorta. Unlike Aelin, Gorta has shown themselves to be scummy. The largest example of this is their reasoning for voting me; they seem to parrot others in the thread that I am scummy for worrying about the postcount, and does not really consider any other factors in voting me.</p>
<p>Lastly, this suddem influx of votes on Aelin has only made me suspect Emilia more. They claim that I am their only scumread, and yet they seem okay with shifting their vote to Aelin, who happens to be voting me, with little justification. This makes me think that Emilia does not really believe in their scumread of me and just wants to vote out a villager.</p>
<p>Thus, I’d like to <strong>/vote Emilia</strong> (<a class="mention" href="../../../u/chloe.html">@Chloe</a> <a class="mention" href="../../../u/sulit.html">@sulit</a> ) at this time.</p>

<p>Their reads are incredibly shallow, going through each player and reading them based on one, maybe two things they’ve done.

<p>Returning to the topic of yesterday, I hope everyone realizes now that what I had been trying to say for a good part of yesterday is true: Aelin was voted by wolves with little reasoning other than claiming she was in her wolf meta. This sort of read, either town or scum, is a lazy way to slap labels on individuals, and those that exercise it are more likely scum than town.</p>
<p>With that said, I would like to invite everyone to join me in voting Emilia.</p>

<p>They were the most egregiously voting individual yesterday, joining a flash wagon on Aelin and remaining there for the day with absolutely no explanation. It makes no sense that Emilia continued to vote Aelin, since I - one of their top scumreads - was a viable execution target yesterday. This proves that Emilia simply voted whoever was most convenient and did not care much about the votes yesterday.</p>

<p>Before we go into everything I want to say, I want to cover my read of Arete. Although I do disagree with Hippolytus that posting immediately after the day starts is scummy (since I’ve done it as well before, albeit with considerably less words in my first post), I believe that the content within their first post today shows the disingenuousness of their read on Marshal.</p>
<p>Specifically, their first point on why Marshal is scummy - “useless questions and comments to try to look town that don’t actually do anything” - does not actually point to any scummy behavior. The posts that Arete mentions is more emblematic of Marshal trying to create discussion and poke the people into action, so it is unfair to say that they were not doing anything; in a slow game in which little more progress can be made with the given posts, Marshal’s posting could not be seen as not doing anything. Arete bloating this into a reason to scumread is definitely disingenuous.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay this post is actually decent, their push on Arete here makes sense and its cabbage’s first push on someone that isn’t LHF. It’s definitely what I was thinking about Arete as well, though I was really hoping Arete was town. However, despite an actually decent reason to scumread Arete, they still continue to hard tunnel Emilia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next I’d like to address my take on Emilia, since that is the reason Wendy is pushing me.</p>
<p>First, near the start of the game when I initially started scumreading them, I had read them for something minor - voting me at the start of the game. It appeared to me as if Emilia wanted to execute a townie, and went to the first example she could attack. Although I knew at the time (and still know now) that the lead was small and possibly wrong, it was the only lead I had. I reasoned that the behavior was more likely scum than town.</p>
<p>But if you read my posts from that time on, I do not spend as much time accusing Emilia; instead, I talk to other individuals (namely Marshal, because they were prominently in the thread at the time) about their townread on Emilia. Because I had a suspicion on them, I did not want people to townread Emilia so easily; my posts are focused on asking people the reasonings behind their townreads and critiquing those reasonings, hopefully getting my audience to think more critically about Emilia’s alignment instead of relying on a very simple meta.</p>
<p>As for why I disliked people townreading Emilia more than townreading Eli, a player that I have said is in a similar place to Emilia, is that I have not found anything questionable from Eli. So although I disliked the fact that people (especially Marshal) are willing to townread Eli so easily, I had nothing against them so I let the townread slide. However, I had found objectionable content from Emilia at the time and have found more as time progressed, so I wanted to question people enough so that they wouldn’t take the lazy route of assuming that Emilia was town from “meta” and not actually reading into her posts.</p>
<p>As a side note to a side note, Ketsuban was included in my list of questions to the meta-readers since as an alt, I was unsure what kind of evidence they had to support any notion of meta-reading that slot. (This was before Ketsuban’s identity was revealed, I believe.)</p>
<p>After my reads have developed this far I left the thread for some time, and returned to find that three people had voted Aelin in quick succession (posts <a href="../../game-thread-meowntainado-12-14-day-2/88535/850.html">850</a>, <a href="../../game-thread-meowntainado-12-14-day-2/88535/852.html">852</a>, and <a href="../../game-thread-meowntainado-12-14-day-2/88535/857.html">857</a>). This in some way confirmed my scumread on Emilia, because up until this point Emilia had claimed that I was scum. Because I knew I was town, I assumed that this was Emilia not caring about which wagon to be on and just choosing whichever one had people she was comfortable with; this is seen by her complete lack of reasoning and simply agreeing to the new trend set by two pretty loud players. Although Wendy claims that Emilia moving her vote is indicative of us both being scum, I would rather suggest to see that both wagons (Aelin and myself) were both town, since if I had been scum with Emilia they would presumably find a better excuse to move. Them not giving any reason whatsoever is indicative of apathy, which is not an emotion one feels when their voting motivation is to defend one’s teammate.</p>

I honestly think if you’d town you’d come across way less agendery and focus less on self-preservation here. <strong>Cabbage does not take a whole game approach until told to by others, he constantly focuses on pushing these two points alone until he is called out for it.</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>Overall, Cabbage has been hyperfocussed on LHF players from the start of the game. He says he has scumreads on strong players, but does not follow these up and continues to push on players who would be an easy mislynch. These reads on players like myself don’t change his view of the weaker players and his reads appear in a vaccuum, not in the context of the game and a team. His scumreads are of individual players and he doesn’t consider how they’d fit together, indicative of mid-level wolf read faking. His read on Marshal was extremely worldbuildy and made no sense, especially as Marshal flipped town. Day 2 he pushes an agenda by repeatedly stating the two things that will keep him alive, wagons are T/T and Emilia is a wolf. He doesn’t take a look at the whole game at all, even when prompted by myself (he made a few reads in isolation again) and continues to focus either on Emilia and gorta, both LHF who are easy alternatives to himself. his focus on self-preservation is extremely wolf-like, as a wolf needs to survive a lot more than a towny does, and he never takes a look at the game as a whole. <strong>In other words, his entire worldview comes from a wolf faking his reads.</strong> The Marshal night kill makes a lot of sense, as marshal was the main pusher on cabbage and would defeat his agenda the next day. Marshal was otherwise scumread and would probably have been a good mislynch target from Arete. Also he was the counterwagon to a town member, and should just be lynched for good mafia play, and he definitely should not be allowed to endgame. Overall, cabbage has an extremely high wolf-equity and should be the lynch for today.</p>
<p>In order to split this up, I am going to make another post on the other player I definitely think is scum.</p>

<p>Marl/Eli/Emilia/Hippo all fall into the ‘I’m pretty sure this is V from meta’ bucket. the first two are more confident than the latter two because their meta is fresher + more polarized but I think it’s unlikely for any of them to be Mafia, I can elaborate on any of these if it would be helpful although I think this is mostly pretty consensus minus Hippo. I guess I should explain Hippo probably, but basically in FAM (+Evolution Mafia which was longer ago) I felt that he was trying to basically just skate by by shitposting and barely solving in the early game, whereas here his posting is basically the exact opposite, mostly solving and almost no shitposting.</p>

<p>Marshal’s pushes this game have been sketchy as heck, her push on Arctic is less bad with the explanation she gave but her push on Daisy was just extremely ???, she’s also been relying nearly exclusively on meta to make her reads which is wolfy as it’s easier for wolves to make fake metareads than basically any other type of fake read. I know I said this was going to be on non-Marshal people but I changed my mind. she’s also been like ‘oh no, gamestate is so dead, it’s so easy for wolves’ but not really doing much to actually change it.</p>

okay so, after that EoD I went back to re-read Marshal to try to figure out if I was just being biased and her Iso is actually wolfier than I thought, I’m going to try to keep this short/only focus on the really important points so that it’s not too long to read also because I think she probably kills me and I don’t want to write a 5000 word wolfcase that I’ll never get to post but this isn’t even all the wolfy stuff she did, just the most major things

<p>I just think it’s suspicious that you come back to the thread 15 minutes after I turn you into a major wagon after being gone for nearly 12 hours and declare that you think the wolfteam is exactly the three people voting you and no one else, including none of the players you’d previously suspected who aren’t voting you, and apply literally no additional thought to this beyond repeating arguments you’ve already said</p>

<p>I feel like this sequence of posts was pretty disingenous. Gorta’s suspicions have been said by him multiple times, he just has trouble articulating them. I feel like Arete is trying to make it seem worse, and it would make sense that he sees the people voting him as scum as he is LHF.</p>

<p>Arete is mafia tbh- If you kill me, kill them next <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png!v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> They should not be allowed to talk themselves out of it.</p>
<p>Im too unhappy to case them but I think they’re trying to force a w read of me even after having their points disproven, I outright admit arctic read is played up for reactions, and for the GGhana read they literally go from “Marshal pushing gghana when she should have known alts cant out themselves is wolfy” to “Marshal had no way to know that it was gghana, shes therefore mafia” to “I believe marshal did know it was gghana” (but still wolfreads me for it anyways, and has yet to explain how its bad with the context i did know it was ghana)</p>
<p>So wtf is the actual “bad pushes” that they see on me lol. If they dont see anything wrong with my arctic one or gghana one. Their entire w read is predicated on that, they are dangerously close to actually d1ing me, but the two “bad pushes” they named have both been disproven and arete has admitted it in both cases yet im still their most confident wolf read and a very risky d1.</p>
<p>So realistically I think the slot should die a quick and fiery death but for some reason you guys think you can read me so I doubt i have the clout for that.</p>

<p><strong>Btw this would explain the Marshal kill in one post. Marshal’s suspicions on both cabbage and Arete were strong. his kill otherwise makes no sense.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, Arete, although not as individually scummy as Cabbage, has strong partner equity there. Marshal was hardpushing Arete’s slot and she felt the need to push him back and to have a strong entrance. I do agree with some of her posts, however, she is a strong player and perfectly capable and faking real reads when she needs to. The rest of her ISO is sometimes shading cabbage and other times defending them, in a very partnery manner. Her pushes on gorta align with cabbage, despite gorta’s best attempts to defend himself. I honestly think gorta might be town here. I don’t like the way she misrepresents gorta and I feel if she was town she’d treat him better.</p>
<p>The way cabbage and arete treat each other, by sometimes scumreading one another, and others times defnding one another only makes sense if they’re both wolves. Also Arete is a better player than to not lynch the counterwagon to a towny here I think.</p>
<p>Overall, we should lynch cabbage then Arete <strong>if</strong> cabbage flips Mafia, although Arete has decent mafia equity herself.</p>
