    <title>Exeing GK before d3</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/exeing-gk-before-d3/73523</link>
    <description>Hey all, I have no problem with most of the other classes, but King needs a rework. Maybe change the spawn rate again, but dont tell anyone what it is this time. My most recent 20 games Ive had have had this happen in 10 of the games - Instant King hanging on d2 or 3 with reason being : 40% EK. That is WAY to high of a kill rate for exeing kings that soon with no proof. 

There needs to be a FAR higher penalty in the first 3 days for exeing a good King.

My thoughts are to add the penalties of Exeing a fool to the King if hes Good after the first 3 days.
Before the first 3 days, add the Hunter penalty + Fool penalty to the GK. 

Example abils could be - 

Captain of the Guard - During the first 3 days, the Captain of the Kings guard will kill the first person to vote guilty on a good king if the king is executed.

Traitor to the King - Any BD executing a GK is issued a betrayal warning from the court, reducing ALL of their activatable abilities by 1. This also applies to new Kings.



Im not sure if this is the best way to solve this, Just throwing out a possible solution. The main problem is the insta-vote of kings before d3 just on the off chance that they *could* be evil. The penalty right now just isnt enough to stop the vote up.</description>

            <p>Back to the thread, you never know when a pretender is present so you aren’t giving pretender any credit to get rid of king early on. After all it’s their job to get king exed and become king</p>

            <p>Only if it is not in their best interests, then town should realize and then change it. But if it is working for Town no need to fix it for Town. If it is more effective I might adapt this strategy myself tbh</p>

            <p>All for it, if town want to kill king and put a more confirmed person on the stand it’s their poragative let them meta the pulp out of the game to do what is necessary. That is what the game is for strategy. Town is using the best strategy possible to win the game, it may hurt user experience from King’s perspective but town did nothing wrong imo,</p>

            <p>More trials is better. But make sure that you decide if you are counting a game before it starts to control for confirmation bias. Better yet play all of the trial games back to back</p>

            <p>By statistics I mean you play out at least 10 games in full (or until the starting King dies) and record the day the King is executed (if ever. Night kills don’t count) and his faction. Then we can determine the average day the King is executed and how much of an impact his faction has on this. We can then compare it to the average time of a random non-King player being executed for comparison</p>
