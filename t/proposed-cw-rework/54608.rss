    <title>Proposed CW Rework</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/proposed-cw-rework/54608</link>
    <description>Tornado and barrier are both dodgy to confirm, I&#39;d say that&#39;s the key problem with CW right now.  It&#39;s just a &quot;lul cw claim, ez exe&quot; claim, even if you are CW.

So I propose barrier be tweaked to target one person, inform that person, and &quot;displace&quot; them, so that they can&#39;t be targetted by anything except attacks.  This essentially makes a more informative barrier, while people like Sage can still use it offensively in some respect to prevent people being healed. 
This would effectively be renamed to **Displace**.


As for tornado being used defensively to maybe defend people, how about tornado gets replaced with a **time barrier** of sorts, with limited uses, that makes any actions against a person apply the night after instead, and also informs the CW of what got caught in the barrier, or just attacks.  That way you can try to keep ahead of the curve in some way, and also can confirm that they are CW if a healer does actually end up healing someone from that attack which got caught.
Sage in this case could get an ability to maybe store those used attacks/abilities and then target them onto someone else the next night for offensive/healing other unseen capabilities.
Or, even let CW use the stored abilities too.  So it&#39;s a defensive class with a bit more umph to what it does.

Additionally, a day ability, **Magic Trace**(two uses), which can be put on a person to show who they target with a night ability when they do(if they have abilities that can target people, so prince&#39;s execute for example wont show any target, nor will something like Hide, and as they have no target, CW wont see that.)
When I say show who they target, I mean as they click the number, not as the night ticks over.  So CW might even see their own death coming.

Additionally, make it unique again.</description>

            <p>I’d rather CW be slightly confirmable instantly than hoping someone visited one of the two people you tornadoed.</p>
<p>Drunk/alcoholic is confirmable, butler/invoker is confirmable. CW just isn’t without hoops.</p>
