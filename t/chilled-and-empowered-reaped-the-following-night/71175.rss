    <title>Chilled and empowered reaped the following night</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/chilled-and-empowered-reaped-the-following-night/71175</link>
    <description>I got chilled as a king, and the following night got empowered reaped after i had guard on myself..

Doesnt make sense because reaper can&#39;t use both of his day abilities the same night.</description>

            <p>Seems to be a bug where reaper can use multiple day abilities each day. Or, at least, it seems like a bug since it wasn’t announced in the patch notes.<br>

            <p>well yeah, one tip on sorc… don’t worry about the inqs investigative abilities. The sorc’s day abilities make actually doing checks a complete waste of time for the inq. Inqs will either stab based on day chat, or just wait and hope BD does their job for them. With 2 guaranteed false positives and 2 false negatives, making the actual checks is silly.</p>

            <p>Well I won my first Sorc game ever after returning to the game after 4 months claiming Alch cause I thought it was Magic User and no one suspected me. So I guess luck and how experienced are the players you are playing with are a major factor.</p>

            <p>Hunter never is a reasonably claim. After n3 people will at least want you to wolf someone, also if obs see you visiting someone your claim can easily be seen as fake. The strat to say Hunter so no one votes you is bad</p>

            <p>Honestly the only claim a NK can reasonably do is hunter because people would be scared to vote you and kill you. It only backfires when there is another hunter claim but eh at least you can get rid of them by voting or poss jump.</p>
