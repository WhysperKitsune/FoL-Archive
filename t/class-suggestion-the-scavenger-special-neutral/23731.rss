    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Scavenger; Special Neutral</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-scavenger-special-neutral/23731</link>
    <description>**The Scavenger &gt; Special Neutral**
**Conversion Immune**
**Win Condition**: Survive (Same as Alchemist)
Lore: I&#39;ll take that one... and this one.. and especially that one....

New Mechanic introduced with The Scavenger; &#39;Borrow&#39;
&#39;Borrow&#39; allows The Scavenger to use abilities that weren&#39;t originally his. The same penalties still apply with corresponding abilities, such as Cold Steel if the Scavenger kills a BD, he will die. 
Abilities that cannot be borrowed:
&gt; Convert/Brainwash
&gt;NK killing abilities (Reap, Possess ect.)
&gt;Prince execution/jail
&gt;Scout
&gt;Sacrifice
&gt;Chill

**Passive 1:Pure Chaos!**
The Scavenger can use two &#39;Borrowed&#39; abilities per night as well as one of his own basic abilities.

**Passive 2: But I&#39;m Not Ready!**
The Scavenger is immune to death and occupation for the first 2 nights.
_^This is to allow The Scavenger to Borrow some abilities to increase his chances of survival.

**Day Ability: Give me that!** _2x uses_
The next day ability used by another player will also give you a charge.

**Night Ability 1: Mimic** _Unlimited uses_
Observer a player, gain a charge of whatever ability they use. Usable the following night.
If observing an ability that cannot be &#39;Borrowed&#39; you will be meet with the message : _A lowlife like you could never understand an ability like that..._ 

**Night Ability 2: Scavenge**  _3x uses_
Target a dead player, choose an ability you wish to take from them. (Taking Hide from a Fool, Ice Ward from Court Wizard, ect.)
_^Should be used on abilities that will keep you alive the following night to get towards your end goal_

The Scavenger brings an interesting way to play ToL, rather than impaired by only using one of your abilities, you can use up to 3 every night. Correct use of abilities it crucial to ensure that you survive to the end. The Scavenger can fake realistically any class he wants to if he gains enough charges of a specific ability to prove it.</description>
