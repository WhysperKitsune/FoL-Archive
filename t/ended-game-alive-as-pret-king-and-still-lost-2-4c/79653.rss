    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ended-game-alive-as-pret-king-and-still-lost-2-4c/79653</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I was made King as Pretender and still lost at the end: https://imgur.com/a/l80n6s1

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I was supposed to be amongst the winning people. Only cult got the win.

#### Steps to reproduce:
I guess get kinged as pret and wait it out?

            <p>Pretender King <em>(and Sellsword, as your image shows them losing despite BD losing)</em> not winning as intended is already known and should be fixed soon ^^</p>
<p>Is it possible you have logs from this game?</p>
<p><code>%userprofile%\appdata\LocalLow\Imperium42 Game Studio\Throne of Lies\</code></p>
<p>If you haven’t launched your game again since, can you upload Player.log here? If you’ve launched once since, can you upload Player-prev.log here?</p>
