    <title>Why do we have &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Wildcard&quot; types?</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/why-do-we-have-special-and-wildcard-types/2854</link>
    <description>**The current Special classes in the game are;**

King
Mastermind
Cult Leader

According to the ToL Wiki, &quot;Some classes are one of a kind, such as the King or Mastermind, that doesn&#39;t fill in on any other type.&quot;

This feels off to me. The King absolutely fits in with being a Social type class. He manipulates voting (the social Psychic also has an ability relating to voting) and must communicate via whispering to identify his allies. 

The Mastermind can also be called a Social class. He&#39;s literally adding a member to his small society, changing the dynamic of the scum team and adding a new person to night chat. Certainly Social enough.

Cult Leader is the same deal, except he can also be considered a Killer class. His identity is certainly skewed, and is probably the only true candidate for a Special type since he is a hybrid. 

**The current Wildcard classes in the game are;**

Fool
Scorned

According to the ToL Wiki, &quot;Wildcard classes are self-interested subjects who only supports themselves.&quot;

An interesting note is that the Mercenary is NOT considered a Wildcard, and is actually a Support class. This feels off because they don&#39;t care about &quot; supporting&quot; either faction winning over the other - they just need their target to stay alive. While seemingly vested in a common goal, they truly only care about their own goal. Merc is certainly self-interested, and that is why Merc claims get hanged so often. The Support type feels right, but by its own goal and win condition, it certainly should be a wildcard, yet it is not.

The Fool _should_ be considered a Social class not only because of his Trollbox (RIP, but it will return) but because he HAS to talk in order to progress his goal of getting hanged. Quiet players are typically targeted by Scum because they tend to be important roles trying to lay low. I&#39;m not saying quiet Fools don&#39;t get hanged, but it is much more rare. Clever trollboxes can create chaos and incite a hanging.

The Scorned, again, can be thought of as a Social class because without accusing his targets of anything, he cannot easily achieve his goal. His night abilities are odd. I can&#39;t necessarily call them social abilities. But the Scorned usually must interact with players and his target directly in order to win.

**So what about Special and Wildcards types?**

Remove them from the game. Replace each Special and Wildcard class with Social type (maybe give the Cult Leader killer instead). 

**Why?**

They&#39;re inconsistent and superfluous. Removing them opens up more future design space for abilities that involve player&#39;s class type. Admittedly, changing class types doesn&#39;t impact the game very much right now because the Princess and Invoker are currently the only classes in the game that involves discovering a player&#39;s class type. However, there are may be other classes in the future which can take advantage of the fact the scum faction leaders always show up as Special, and Fools and Scorned&#39;s always show up as Wildcard (Maid, anyone?)

We might as well change &quot;Special&quot; to &quot;definitely scum&quot; and &quot;Wildcard&quot; to &quot;definitely neutral&quot;.</description>

            <p>Another point to talk about is the rule of Neutrality – “I side with BD (…until I don’t have to anymore.)”</p>
<p>Is a Neutral King a “good” king if they provide no assistance to BD but still win because scum was curbstomped? I wouldn’t consider that a “good” outcome.</p>
<p>This is why I love the change that made King immune to execution for the first few days – it was always advantageous to eliminate the King to remove doubt and put up a BD. At least with this change, the King will have time to prove their allegiance and maybe BD will be too distracted to hang the King once leads have sprung up.</p>

            <p>I dont know specifically about the situation on ToL, but i <em>will</em> agree with Sketch in that human psychology does tend to want the underdog to win, and as such when given the choice between underdog and non-underdog teams, most people would chose the underdog team to win.<br>
in terms of FoL/ToL, personally, I’d go with loyalty over underdog, and even sometimes over winning, if i/my word is challenged enough</p>

            <p>Short Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Long Answer: If Neutral Kings broke even exactly 50% of the time between helping BD vs. Scum, that means out of a large sample of games the chance of King being good is exactly a coin flip.</p>
<p>My assumption is that Neutral kingmakers tend to side with scum. Any negativity bias I could have in this matter is negated by the fact that I’ve been the scum in those games to enjoy the favor of the kingmaker. I’ve played enough ToS and enough ToL to understand the significant psychology behind allowing the underdog to win.</p>
<p>Now, it’s difficult to say exactly what constitutes an “evil” neutral king vs a “good” neutral king. The issue is that a neutral king’s thought and decision pattern will be vastly different than any other player in the game because it is extremely malleable to the shifting environment.</p>
<p>I’ve seen plenty of kingmakers side with BD. But I would bet money that if Imperium42 somehow could gather the raw data of 1000 games or so and let us process the W/L ratio between BD and Scum in games where it came to the final 3, I would bet money the scum would win.</p>

            <p>I have seen many a king make in ToS; the survivor (or already won exe) can be swayed in the mafia v sk scenario that “More people win if you let us win”.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I played a game as assassin vs last knight, with a losts corned turned neut king by BD. I was converted and pushed for him to get king. However, they still decided to side with BD, the ones who let her win ( if you wonder how she did this, she game them a guard)</p>
<p>I personally would have guarded myself. Solo victory would have been cool.</p>

            <p>Hmm are you sure of that?<br>
What’s your own behaviour?<br>
Because that influences your samples…<br>
Do you only feel that?<br>
Or do you KNOW that?<br>
I think I sided with BD fairly often, but I have a priority list(with number 1 being obviously survival)</p>

            <p>Whatever title you want to give neutral king is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The point remains that human behavior sways neutral kings to give the win to evils in kingmaking situations more often than town. I’ve seen this time and time again. This means neutral king has greater than a 50% chance of siding with evils when possible.</p>
<p>Whether or not it gets to the kingmaking scenarios depends on how strong BD is at the moment, but psychology sways kingmakers to evil sides much more often, especially if it is a NK.</p>

            <p>I think that fool should be offensive myself. Mostly because I don’t get why wildcard is even a thing. I mean, does the Reaper look out for others? Of course not!</p>

<p>Hmm the first one is well… lets just say its a hindrance for the fool itself. It doesn’t help the fool at all, quite the opposite!<br>
But yeah, you can put it into offensive as well I guess… which would eliminate Wildcard as a category…<br>
and it wouldnt even disrupt the Princess- the result would be the same, just like with the Scorned…</p>

            <p>hmm yeah but they gave false info about <strong>someone else…</strong><br>
Anyways, we could remove Wildcard, and put Fool into Offensive or Special…but removing special… nope… not a good idea.</p>

<p>prevent others from voting.</p>
<p>that sounds very offensive to me. On top of his occupying players, fool is neutral offensive.</p>

            <p>Hmm I can’t agree with you on <strong>self</strong> framing<br>
Self framing is definitely wildcard-y, because it can’t target anyone else, it’s supposed to get the fool executed, and investigators or fake investigators are not being extremely sus if they accuse a Fool(because everyone knows that the Fool can trick them)<br>
Occupation is of course offensive in nature. And yes part of it could be considered Offensive. The goal is however heavily wildcard-y. While Scorned usually uses Framing to get someone else hanged, fool uses it to protect itself from being princekilled… and it is a major ability… right… or not?<br>
Hmm that’s the golden question. Well, let’s say it is played like one. Fool means in the current meta occupying. However I am beginning to doubt this is a good idea. Fools who claim(even in Prison) butler rarely win. That claim is either being believed or being not believed in which case it normally leads to “Probably fool. Prince execute at night/Knight CS this/Hunter wolf this”. Unexplained occupations are even more suspect and lead to a fool suspicion as well. Hmmm… What’s true is that the Fool could get into Neutral Offensive. Possibly. But yeah the Fool is a <em>special?</em> kind of class anyways: Two of their(supposed) abilities are not helping very much and can be straíght out detrimetal easily(box, occupy)<br>
the next one is an “I win” button if it works, at least usually… and the passive abilities are not really helping either… quite the opposite: they are harmful. Occupy immunity means being called out for that and that ain’t cool. Prince? Yeah no. Hunter? Yeah no. Most occupy immune evils are well, the Fool or the Possessor… and again Prince if alive will take care of them.(and it cant be butler if you dont claim this on stand anyways) And it doesnt help you greatly either. And the Poor Fellow is the reason why no BD wants to hang fool soo… ya.</p>
