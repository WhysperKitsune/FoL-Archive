    <title>Something I will say. (Leaving forever?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/something-i-will-say-leaving-forever/77997</link>
    <description>&gt; [color=red]**This ALSO applies to Town Of Salem.**[/color]

 So as you all know. I have decided to leave the discord of my own reason. (No use responding there.) and now after consideration. I have decided to leave the full on game and will be removing this game from my library at [date=2019-09-14 time=17:00:00 timezone=&quot;Pacific/Auckland&quot;]. This doesn&#39;t just mean i&#39;ll be forever gone. Its just the factor that reasons like toxicity and stuff are making me choose to leave. 

Necessarily I don&#39;t dislike the community as a **whole**. I just decided and have experienced the pain of being personally attacked, not just by some players, but by some well known people. I have also lost the experience in playing social deductions effectively. But there were some changes to the system I would have liked to happen. But i&#39;ll not talk about that.

The lack of playerbase has also contributed to some of these issues and I have enjoyed part of my time part of the Throne of lies community.

As I liked the game, Personal reasons and The above reasons had ruined it. Thank you all.</description>

            <p>I’m not saying its not reportable or punishable, but if “I got told once the r word twice” is so much toxicity for you that you are leaving a game, you might not should play multiplayer games <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"></p>

            <p>Me not having fun because I dislike a lot of changes is a personal preference, you can’t  demand me to enjoy brilder merc or Pretender ect. I will always want contract merc.</p>
<p>Complexity was fine because honestly not a lot was changed to make the game easy to understand for newer players the glossary isn’t detailed, the tutorial is bad.</p>
<p>Toxcity while yes you can report it, it doesn’t always solve the issue.</p>
<p>and yes people recongnizing me and killing me n1 is out of spite because that person hates me.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Old Cult was better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What cult are you talking about?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contract Merc, Neutral Starting King</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s personal preferences tbh and not really problems in my eyes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Streamlining</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah… while it’s nice to have more clear interactions, the complexicity was fun</p>
<blockquote>
<p>King election</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pretender is a class made to counter the King. Good idea bad implementation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble Gossip Meta</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="hashtag">#BlameKapeForCurrentMeta</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toxicity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait… what?? Where? You know yourself you can always report that. I don’t see an increase in the toxicity <em>at all</em>, it even got less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People recognize and kill me n1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well… well… welcome in the club <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Almost everyone who is recognizable in any way gets targetted more. If you think you’re a target, try to play the game with golden armor + judge, mod or dev title <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"><br>
Nah, my solution for that problem is, either play together with friends, or go incognito once in a while.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a lot of people hate me and make fun of me in the community before for mistakes in game, generally I can handle it but I personally can know what your going through</p>
<p>My biggest issue with the current game is it’s only half as fun as it used to be a lot of things I like got removed OR things I dislike got added</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall Cult just doesn’t feel like a “Cult” faction based more on converts, yes hot take but old cult was better</li>
<li>Contract Mercenary my all time fav class was removed.</li>
<li>Neutral Starting King, While not as balanced, do we really think a random ek/gk is “balanced” this was a fun class that was challenging yet rewarding.</li>
<li>Removal of complexity like the occupy changes, mind warp changes even things like bewilder being removed.</li>
<li>Classes that ruin the King election system like Pretender</li>
<li>Noble Gossip confirms are worse then WKM</li>
<li>Alot more things that are minor and just bog down the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t even factor my issues with the toxicity that has been going on, I have someone who stalks me and kills me n1 if I am in game with them and have been spotted, I have a lot of issues with current Tol, So I understand you.</p>
<p>Right now I have been playing a little less, Not going to quit likely but personally just had a lot of struggles with Tol</p>
