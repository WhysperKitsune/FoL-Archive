            <p>I don’t want the artists to feel bad. Maybe could have a player art day/contest (come up with a better name) where the portraits are boslof ones and other submissions, and go back to the real portraits the next day? The artists work is respected and not wasted, player artists get to do fan art, and people get a good laugh looking at submissions to vote for winners?</p>

<p>Don’t say that a thread that has no way to dissagree, is trying to bring that back in exchange for the legitimately awesome art that someone’s worked hard on is NOT a joke.</p>
