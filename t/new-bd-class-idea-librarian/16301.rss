    <description>BD: Librarian

Day ability: Quiet Down: only the Librarian can speak for 10 seconds, anonymously (2 uses)
Night abilities:
Messenger: Send a secret note to up to three players that they recieve at the beginning of the next day. (infinite uses)
Document Glance: Read the journal of a player (3 uses)

We already have a library not in use as someone&#39;s room for use a death screen. This idea came about from seeing the Marshal&#39;s ability to read journals of other players and wanting to see more of it.</description>
