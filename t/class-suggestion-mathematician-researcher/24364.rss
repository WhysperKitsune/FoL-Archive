            <p>I would like to point out that you yourself are asking the question. “Would his ability work IF he targeted this other person?” on to your question:</p>
<p>1: It would return success. He got a non BD result. Same for sheriff and paladin. The frame works on you too after all</p>
<p>2: Yes. Null visits return as failed.</p>
<p>Would also like to clarify that if a butler/drunk/whatever occupys your target directly you are uneffected but if your second target is a butler using party then it would always return as failed unless they are occ immune.</p>

            <p>Okay, so Calculate counts as visiting your target. And targeting a player who has 2 night abilities will base itself on whichever one they use that night.</p>
<p>If you target an Observer and they use peek on a Fool who is framing himself that night, will Calculate return a success for you?</p>
<p>If you target a Hunter who chooses to do nothing that night, will you just get a failed message?</p>

            <p>I feel like there are a lot of variables here with the Calculate ability. What if you check a Fool who hides that night or a Court Wizard who uses Ice Ward. Are you just going to get a message saying that the ability they used wouldn’t work on whoever the target was you picked, or would you get something more specific saying “this ability cannot be used to target others” or something. What happens when they don’t use an ability? Does it just tell you that?</p>

            <p>I guess it would be:</p>
<p>Sacrifice: succeed if the other person is attacked</p>
<p>Cold steel: Succeed if the target would die from the attack.</p>
