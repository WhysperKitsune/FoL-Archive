<p>Cloned is town but still should be leashed.</p>
<p>Zone is probably town due to how cautious they’ve been with the double vote.</p>
<p>I do think at least 1 scum member has pushed me simply because I have already acknowledged how good backup is for town and I feel they would see the same as me.</p>
<p>Gorta seem ok, doesn’t really stand out much. I mean I remember them posting like 5? Times total.</p>
<p>Nutella has been pinging me as off but like maybe I just don’t know their style well since I’ve not played much with them. I’d put then as a 4 or 5 on my tiered readslist.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> Chloe is town. But not sure. Would be a 6 or 7. (Likely 6)</p>

<p>Atm my top town / towncore is Zone and Cloned.<br>
And that makes me feel really weird lol.</p>
<p>Since I normally struggle to read Cloned but have felt confident here. And I know my reasoning on Zone isn’t too strong but like, good use of PR is something which I’m looking out for and I’m seeing it in action</p>

<p>Since Dat wants me to expand on my takes… here goes nothing I guess:</p>
<p>Cloned town<br>
Zone town<br>
Min town (not wolf with TMI)<br>
Gorta null, not scummy.<br>
Nutella scumlean<br>
Chloe town</p>
<p>This time like most of the time, what I’ve said can be attributed a lot to gut.</p>
<p>Zone town read is because of the way they’ve been using their double vote, it’s been in a really townie way as a bonus for pressure rather than as a weapon. Zone’s reaction when I was on 4 votes early on was just pure to me, a snap unvote and just trying to figure out wtf was wrong. They’ve been questioning things but not being overly vocal nor trying to hide in the shadows, it’s the right level of commitment and attention.</p>
<p>Cloned has had an open mind instead of pushing an easy ML on me. Also they’ve been cooperative when it comes to us discussing “leashing” them and whatnot. They also have explained why certain things make them feel off instead of low efforting which I feel they’re able to as a wolf (I recognise they can do this as town too but it feels less performative)</p>
<p>Min was literally a tonal read. Since someone at the time had said “Min might be wolf and they have TMI” and I disagreed with that based on how Min was talking.</p>
<p>You had me gut read early on and I got Eli as scum from there. I don’t exactly retract this sentiment because I feel like they’ve been trying cheap views like “X roles are dangerous” and reading off there which is somewhat similar to what I was doing but like I re-eval’d and I feel like Eli wasn’t suspected at all for that.</p>
<p>Gorta had like 5 posts. I don’t think any fair conclusions can be drawn from there. However, I will recognise one thing. A valid comparison (albeit weak) for why Gorta is scum is that Gorta posted more in the Thing Game but I don’t think it’d have been a good view overall.</p>
<p>Nutella and me butted heads earlier on hence me having them as a scumlean at the time as I thought they were trying to get people on their side a bit and their reasons for pushing people such as me were a bit weaker than they might’ve been as town. Just like with Eli before, I don’t exactly read it as wrong now.</p>
<p>Chloe just kept doing random things which I feel W!Chloe wouldn’t do? Said they were being pocketed and then voted me. Said Min might be TMI’ing me but didn’t vote Min…</p>

But adding my reads <em>and</em> mech.</p>
<p>I’d vote in my scumreads aka Eli/Nutella.<br>
And based off role, I’d vote Nutella.</p>
<p>Just so we can test Eli to give info tomorrow.</p>

<p>Idk how to feel that in general I agree with this reads list.<br>
But I’d change Gorta… and I know that Gorta is someone that’s hard to read based off inactivity so I can’t even say it’s too wrong.</p>
<p>I want to think that Mist is town and that we’re seeing eye to eye but like I don’t think the readslist is too out there from what everyone else has said</p>

<p>Hi its me dat,</p>
<p>Heres 3 easy steps on why PKR should be exe</p>
<ol>
<li>Coming out with insta gut scumread and never pushing it, but instead tries and get policy exe on cloned for role.</li>
<li>Just lack of content in general. Especially since hes not even voting anyone right now.</li>
<li>Dat is the captain now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for coming to my ted talk</p>

Thanks for all you’ve shown us<br>

Come sit next to me<br>
Pour yourself some tea<br>
Just like grandma made<br>
When we couldn’t find sleep<br>
Things were better then<br>
Once but never again<br>
We’ve all left the den<br>
Let me tell you about it</p>
<p>The choo-choo train left right on time<br>
A ticket cost only your mind<br>
The driver said, “hey man, we go exe PKR”<br>
Of course we were willing to pay</p>
