    <description>I will keep updating these.

**The Negotiator(Blood Dragon)(Unique)(Social)**

**Passives** 

**Quick-Adapter:** After getting occupied once you will be immune to occupation 

**Pen Beats The Sword:** If the King executes you with(Determine Fate or Order Execution)King won&#39;t be able to use his abilities for a day(Basically next night and next day) 

**Lone Wolf:** Anyone that visits you with a &quot;non-aggressive&quot; except for Invests action will be blocked(Meaning only attackers and Invests will be able to visit you)

**Day abilities**

**Secret Letter**: Whisper a player without anyone seeing it(Four uses)
**Diplomatic Ban**: You will block your target&#39;s whispers for that day.(Two uses)

**Night Abilities**

**Talk them out:** If the selected player gets converted during that night you will convert them back.(Two uses)(You will be notified of this act but you and the unconverted player won&#39;t see the unseen/cult
 
**Unlucky spot:** If the selected player gets attacked during that night you will be able to save them in exchange for your life. The player that attacked you will be announced to the rest of the players. (Infinite uses)

**Lore:**

Negotiator was appointed by the king at a young age because of his accomplishments, he was the youngest government official in the kingdom&#39;s history. Negotiator was an ambitious man but he always cared about his people more than his ambition. He didn&#39;t like politics but he had to get involved in politics to help his people and when he got into politics he realized he couldn&#39;t trust anyone but himself. 

**The Envoy(Unseen)(Unique)(Social)**

**Passives**

**Adapted:** You will be occupy immune.

**Experienced** You will be immune to death once
 
**Still An Official:** After your death, your class will be seen as a Negotiator

**Day abilities**

**Secret Letter** Whisper a player without anyone seeing it(Infinite Uses)

**Diplomatic Ban** You will block your target&#39;s whispers for that day.(Infinite Uses)
Night abilities: 

**Paperwork:** Occupy a player with paperwork(Infinite uses)

**Trick** Make a player that they were converted and unconverted by Negotiator(Two uses)

**Lore:** 
As Negotiator grew older he learned that he couldn&#39;t help his people by playing with nobles, doing paperwork drinking tea with royal members, he needed something stronger and that was when Mastermind approached him. Mastermind said that under Unseen reign everything would change forever. Negotiator trusted Mastermind and to prove he was a changed man, he changed his title to Envoy.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>About Pen Beats The Sword. If a Negotiator gets executed by King’s execution king will lose his abilities for a day. If a Prince executes a Negotiator it will be like executing a BD and will remove his executions.<br>
Basically Negotiator isn’t immune but if you kill him you will suffer the punishments. Like a hunter’s arrow.</p>
<p>Lone Wolf ability is to make the Negotiator weaker. No one can save him from death if somebody attacks. If you try to visit Negotiator it will say prevented but I will change “Not aggressive” to “Not aggresive but invests can visit”<br>
And add Lone Wolf to Envoy.</p>

            <p>It does both Negotiator and Envoy will have the same ability. I just can’t decide on which to use. Silence a player for a day or block a whisper. Which one is better in your opinion?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hmm.<br>
First Problem Pen Beats The Sword. I will simply remove (King’s and Prince’s executions will not be wasted) or just make the Negotiator a normal BD so all of prince’s exes go to waste when he exes a Negotiator</p>
<p>Second Problem Secret Letter. You are right about that part. Player shouldn’t know about the secret letter.</p>
<p>Third problem Talk Them Out. The selected player will know they were converted and unconverted such as<br>
[You were converted into Cult/Unseen]<br>
[A Negotiator converted you back to Blood Dragon]<br>
The selected player won’t know about the unseen/cult when they are being converted because everything will happen in the same night.<br>
Or simply make them conversion immune like you said.</p>
<p>Fourth problem Out of Ink. I really don’t get the problem but I can change that into Experienced: Makes you immune to death once.</p>
<p>Fifth Problem Diplomatic Confusion: Yes, that is the thing. It will reveal the Envoy but at the same time it can save the game if used right.</p>
<p>Fifth Problem Great Plot: It will be like a force vote but it will reveal a random RB. I think I should make it like a Trollbox, the selected target won’t know they voted for king. Though I find this ability the worst.</p>
<p>Sixth problem Expert hunch. I can change the two target thing into one random non-unseen member, prince and starting king.</p>
<p>Seventh problem. He has no ability to fake negotiator but he is quite powerful late game.</p>
<p>I am waiting for suggestions also I added the type.</p>
