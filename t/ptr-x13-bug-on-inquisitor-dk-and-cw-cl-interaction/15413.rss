    <title>PTR x13 bug on inquisitor, DK and CW/CL interaction</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/ptr-x13-bug-on-inquisitor-dk-and-cw-cl-interaction/15413</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

[PTR x13]
 #1 Night2: CW [12] used Tornado on 10 and 12. 10 is Inquisitor. Cult Leader [9] used Eradicate on 2 and 12. Visit on 2 got prevented. 2nd part of Eradicate on 12 did not get redirected to 10 and killed 12.
#2 Death Knight can &quot;pretend&quot; to accuse players and spam the chat.
#3 Inquisitor win is shown as Scorned win at the end of the game.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

#1 2nd part of Eradicate should be redirected by Tornado to 10 and 12 will survive.
#2 No chat msg, when Death Knight tries to accuse someone or DK should be blocked from accusing.
#3 Inquisitor as a winner.</description>
