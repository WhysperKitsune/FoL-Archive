    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Herald | The Marshall</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-herald-the-marshall/1796</link>
    <description>#[color=lighblue]**The Herald** (Blue Dragon Killer)[/color]

_Passive: Immune to Occupy + Unique_

**Night Ability 1: Duel (3 uses)**
Visit your target and duel them.
If you kill a member of the Blue Dragon, you will lose this ability and your class will be revealed to all.

Not sure how I feel about this now: _If they have no Immunity to Death, you will kill them. If they are Immune to Death on this night, you will die._

**Day Ability 1: Martial Law (3 use - 1 day cooldown)**
Slide a weapon to your target. If they&#39;re attacked within the night, both they and the killer will die.

# [color=purple]**The Marshall** (Unseen Offensive)[/color]

_Passive: Immune to Occupy + Unique_

**Night Ability 1: Perimeter (1 use)**
Go with the Assassin tonight. You will keep watch as the Assassin does his job.

    If an Observer was watching, they will die. 
    If a Knight was protecting the victim, you will die instead of the Assassin.
    If the victim was a Princess who Will O Wisp&#39;d, it will send the alert to Unseen members only.
    Anybody else visiting will die.

**Day Abilty 1: Dagger (2 uses - 1 day cooldown)**
Hand a member of the Unseen a weapon. If they are visited tonight, the visiter will die. (Includes being jailed by Prince)

## Notes:

My initial thoughts creating this Class was to add more classes that are Killers who are immune to Occupy. Adding more Claim space for NK too, Possessor could claim the Herald class (being Killer+ImmuneOcc)

I took to the Interwebz to find decent names for the names.. Pursuivant being a Knight in training. Herald being a high class Knight and Marshall is essentially just.. well, another form of High class Knight.

_I could be wrong and made a Fool of myself. But I&#39;m confident I&#39;ve gotten it right._</description>

<p>Not liking the “Includes being jailed by the prince” part. Maybe if the prince jails them, but not executes them, like a ToS serial killer?</p>

            <p>#<font color="lighblue"><strong>The Herald</strong> (Blue Dragon Killer)</font></p>
<p><em>Passive: Immune to Occupy + Unique</em></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: Duel (3 uses)</strong><br>
Visit your target and duel them.<br>
If you kill a member of the Blue Dragon, you will lose this ability and your class will be revealed to all.</p>
<p>Not sure how I feel about this now: <em>If they have no Immunity to Death, you will kill them. If they are Immune to Death on this night, you will die.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Ability 1: Martial Law (3 use - 1 day cooldown)</strong><br>
Slide a weapon to your target. If they’re attacked within the night, both they and the killer will die.</p>
<h1><font color="purple"><strong>The Marshall</strong> (Unseen Offensive)</font></h1>
<p><em>Passive: Immune to Occupy + Unique</em></p>
<p><strong>Night Ability 1: Perimeter (1 use)</strong><br>
Go with the Assassin tonight. You will keep watch as the Assassin does his job.</p>
<pre><code>If an Observer was watching, they will die. 
If a Knight was protecting the victim, you will die instead of the Assassin.
If the victim was a Princess who Will O Wisp'd, it will send the alert to Unseen members only.
Anybody else visiting will die.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Day Abilty 1: Dagger (2 uses - 1 day cooldown)</strong><br>
Hand a member of the Unseen a weapon. If they are visited tonight, the visiter will die. (Includes being jailed by Prince)</p>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>My initial thoughts creating this Class was to add more classes that are Killers who are immune to Occupy. Adding more Claim space for NK too, Possessor could claim the Herald class (being Killer+ImmuneOcc)</p>
<p>I took to the Interwebz to find decent names for the names… Pursuivant being a Knight in training. Herald being a high class Knight and Marshall is essentially just… well, another form of High class Knight.</p>
<p><em>I could be wrong and made a Fool of myself. But I’m confident I’ve gotten it right.</em></p>
