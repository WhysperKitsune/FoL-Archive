    <title>[Faction + Game Mode Suggestion] Knights of the Round Table</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/faction-game-mode-suggestion-knights-of-the-round-table/39626</link>
    <description>This is a suggestion for a game mode AND classes. I know this is a &quot;big deal&quot; but I wanted to write the suggestion down someplace - so please, yes, I know this won&#39;t be added. XD

This would ideally be &quot;brief&quot; play, a bit more &quot;casual&quot; than a normal round -- while also providing a new flavor of game play.

----

The premise:
- 1 King
- 1 Scorned or Fool
- 10 Knights of different colors (read on...)
- 2 Squires
- 1 Green Knight

Explanation of existing classes:
- King acts normally. He can be Good, Neutral, or Evil. Has same abilities.
- Scorned/Fool acts normally. He must be executed or execute targets to win. Has same abilities.

----

New Neutral Killing Class:

- **Green Knight** (Neutral Killing) - A strange knight from a strange land, who wishes to destroy the Knights of the Round Table. **Based on the Green Knight from legend.**

Passive 1:
**Removable Head** - You are immune to the first murder attempt against you.

Passive 2:
**Kid-Friendly** - You will know the identity of your Squire(s) at all times.

Day Ability:
**Generous Offer** - The player you choose will become a Squire allied with you that night. (Unlimited use, but only usable if no other Squires are living.)

Night Ability 1:
**Beheading Blow** - Kill a player. If they are saved, they will begin bleeding. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 2:
**Butcher&#39;s Blade** - Kill a player and all who visit them that night. (3 uses.)

----

New Neutral Class:

- **Squire** (Neutral) - A reliable and trusted ally to a good or evil master.

Passive 1:
**Faithful Sidekick** - You will be allied with a random Knight. You will know their identity, but not their class.

_^ One Squire will automatically be allied with the Green Knight, and one will be allied with a randomly chosen good Knight._

Passive 2:
**Lethal Legacy** - If you are allied with the Green Knight, you will become the Green Knight upon his death.

Day Ability:
**Alter Allegiance** - Become the Squire of the chosen player if your previous master dies. (Unlimited use.)

Night Ability 1:
**Soothing Balm** - Heal the player you are allied with. Cures bleeding and prevents murder. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Hide &amp; Seek** - See the classes of players who visited your master, hiding your own visit from the other Squire. (Unlimited use.)

----

New Blue Dragon classes, AKA &quot;Knights of different colors&quot;. [b]There are exactly 2 of each color in the round.[/b]

- **Blue Knight**

Passive:
**True Blue** - You will know the identity of the other Blue Knight.

Night Ability 1:
**Brother in Arms** - If both you and the other Blue Knight use this ability on the same night, you will protect each other from attacks, killing your attackers. If either Blue Knight doesn&#39;t use this at the same time, no effect takes place. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Cold Steel** - Kill a player. If they were an ally, you will instead take your own life. Can&#39;t be used until Night 3. (Infinite use.)



- **Red Knight**

Passive:
**Battle Scars** - You are immune to bleeding.

Night Ability 1:
**Concealed Dagger** - Cause a targeted player to bleed. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Cold Steel** - Kill a player. If they were an ally, you will instead take your own life. Can&#39;t be used until Night 3. (Infinite use.)



- **Yellow Knight**

Day Ability:
**Get Along** - Select two players. They will be prevented from visiting each other at night. (4 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Live to Fight Another Day** - Hide at night, preventing visits to you. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Cold Steel** - Kill a player. If they were an ally, you will instead take your own life. Can&#39;t be used until Night 3. (Infinite use.)



- **Gray Knight**

Day Ability:
**Hammer Swing** - Clobber a target player, preventing them from using any night abilities that night. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Accusing Glare** - Determine a fellow Knight&#39;s color. If you check a Neutral class or fellow Grey Knight, you will be &#39;prevented&#39;. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Cold Steel** - Kill a player. If they were an ally, you will instead take your own life. Can&#39;t be used until Night 3. (Infinite use.)



- **White Knight**

Passive:
**Chivalry Lives** - You cannot be converted to the Green Knight&#39;s Squire.

Day Ability:
**M&#39;Lady** - Use a Princess&#39; Wisp to tell you who visits the player you guard that night. (2 uses.)

Night Ability 1:
**Sacrifice** - Protect a player, giving your life to kill their attackers. Bypasses death immunity. (3 uses.)

Night Ability 2:
**Cold Steel** - Kill a player. If they were an ally, you will instead take your own life. Can&#39;t be used until Night 3. (Infinite use.)

----

So, a summary of what we&#39;re left with, here...

- The &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; are 10 players in 5 class groups of 2.
- All the Knights can use Cold Steel. Let the chaos commence.
- The Green Knight and his assigned Squire need to kill enough good knights to win.
- The King is trying to figure out WTF is going on and who to help.
- The Scorned is trying to get their targets or Fool tries to get exe&#39;d, as usual.
- The Squires are trying to heal their masters... or find new ones.

- The Blue Knights are confirmed to each other and can work together.
- The Red Knights are the good killers. Hopefully they don&#39;t YOLO!
- The Yellow Knights are the ones who block visits and attacks.
- The Gray Knights are the investigators.
- The White Knights are the protectors.

- At any time, one of the good knights might be &quot;converted&quot; to the Green Knight&#39;s new Squire. Provided no other Squires exist, of course.

- It is necessary to not only kill the Green Knight, but his Squire.
- In an ideal game for the good guys, they find and kill the Squire, then the Green Knight, while the &quot;Good Squire&quot; still exists so the Green Knight can&#39;t repick.
- In an ideal game for the Green Knight, the Fool/Scorned causes problems, there&#39;s an Evil or Neutral King, and the Knights of the Round Table &quot;accidentally&quot; Cold Steel each other, etc.

----

Now, I&#39;m aware there are probably problems, here. Let&#39;s discuss how to fix them rather than dismissing the idea, though -- because frankly, I&#39;d love to see more game modes for ToL. Some things to extend the game beyond &quot;normal&quot; lifespan of playability.</description>

            <p>I got so bogged down figuring this all out (as best I could) that I forgot ToL has 16 players and not 15. XD</p>
<p>What if the 16th was the Black Knight (though I also have a separate Black Knight class suggestion posted in the past) who wins by killing 3 different color GOOD knights at night?</p>
<p>IE: Black Knight has to personally murder 4 diff. colors.</p>
<p>That chills open claims immediately, but it’s still on the table for later game if the Black Knight wins. (You wouldn’t want to say: “I’m a Red Knight, who’s the other one?” because Red Knight would have it easy, knowing both Red Knights. Kill one and avoid the other after.)</p>
<p>Black Knight would have a passive that makes his kills fail against neutrals, like Sorcerer’s one that prevents killings that aren’t “right”.</p>
<p>As for the “bypasses immunity” thing, copy/paste from the actual Knight class got me there.</p>
<p>The “King is always neutral” thing is fine, as well. I’ll edit a lot of this once I think over the wording, etc. My only worry is “Vote King, Neuts Out.” will be a thing.</p>
<p>Here’s my previous Black Knight suggestion, for the random dude who’s interested: <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-black-knight-neutral-killer/3632" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-black-knight-neutral-killer/3632</a></p>

            <p>2 killers would be better for this type of game mode in my opinion, as with the day chat muted, there is little that a scorned or fool can do, meaning it would truly be a game of social deduction of 11 Knights, against 2 Green Knights (can be allied, or not) and the 2 Squires, with the King to judge them all.</p>

            <p>I still think there should be an opposing faction.</p>
<p>Searching for one killer will be kind of boring.</p>

            <p>Maybe have King as a Neutral King all the time? Maybe the only gamemode where he’ll exist.</p>
<p>Then the Green Knight could appeal to the King while the others have reason to mistrust what the King says during the day.</p>
<p>And the King would also have to look to save himself if he thinks the Green Knight is going for him.</p>

            <p>Mass Confirming would be too easy, so what if it’s like this:</p>
<p>During the day, only the King may talk freely.</p>
<p>When a player is on trial, they may talk only during their defense time.</p>
<p>Have it so the Green Knight gets a passive that they can always talk to their squire at night and during the day.</p>
<p>The Black Knight and the person they meet with will be able to talk at night. (Like a separate Psychic tab)</p>
<p>The Blue Knights will be able to talk to each other at night.</p>
<p>This makes a really different game where you can’t really on so much your own talking, but more on the King and social deduction. And this way, you can use the accusing to sort of hint that this person should be put up either to</p>
<ol>
<li>say something important or</li>
<li>get lynched</li>
</ol>
