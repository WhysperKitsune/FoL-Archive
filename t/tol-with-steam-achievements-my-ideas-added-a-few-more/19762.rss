    <description>Hi! Im **Alan#7191** !

Throne of lies can use achievements for steam, so the players can get a chance to collect every single one of them!

Here is some archievement suggestions:

**Plan B:**
Start a game as Neutral Killer, then win it being the Psycho King.

**Golden Prince**
Use your 3 execution charges without killing any Blue Dragon member.

**Just one is boring**
Change class at least 3 times in one game 

**Dont mess with my target**
As Mercenary, protect your target from being attacked and make him pay with Rebound in the same game

**Evil Desire**
Win as Cult Leader/Mastermind without getting any other member dead in the game (Evil King counts as member)

**Expert Killer**
Kill 4 people in the same game without dying

**Nope**
Get occupied/redirected 3 times in the same game and get immunity

**More fun with friends**
Play a game with 3 or more friends

**Soul Collector**
Collect 6 souls as Reaper

**They never saw that coming**
As Sorcerer, use Circle of Death to kill 2 or more players in 1 night.

**Did you really say that?**
Use trollbox on someone as the Fool/Scorned and get them killed by the court in the same day.

**Loyalty is rewarded**
Get protection from the king 2 or more times in the same game

**Peace is winning**
Win a game as a Killer class without killing anyone

**Totally not deliberate**
As Butler, Poison the Evil King and make him die by that

**Gotcha!**
Find 2 or more Cult/Unseen members in the same game as the Paladin/Sheriff

**Who needs chemistry?**
Win a game as Alchemist without using Stoneskin potion

**Expert Deceit**
Get accused of treason 2 or more times and get pardoned in the same game as an Evil faction

**Revenge is mine**
As Scorned, get both 2 objectives killed by the court

**EDIT: New achievement ideas!**

**Survivor**
Stay alive until Day 10

**We cant lose the hope**
Win a game as BD with both the Prince and the starting Good King already dead

**Cold Killer**
As a Knight, cold steel 3 non-Blue Dragon players in the same game

**Neutrals united, never beaten**
Win a game as neutral, but all the other neutrals also have to win (BD and Cult/Unseen needs to be defeated by the NK)

**Unstoppable**
Win a game as Blue Dragon with no Blue Dragon deaths (Good King included)

**Red court**
Have 4 Cult members and an Evil King alive at the same time

**Violet court**
Have 3 Unseen members and an Evil King alive at the same time

**That was fast**
Win a game on Night 1 or Day 2 as any class (Scorned,Fool and Inq allowed)

**Beer Tank**
As a Drunk, redirect attacks to you 2 or more times in the same game

**Bad luck Bryan**
Die Night 1.

**I need healing**
Get healed 2 or more tiems in the same game

**The doctor is in**
Heal Nightshade/Bleeding 3 times in the same game

**&quot;Okay maybe it’d be best if you were satisfied with what you have already! SECRET ACHIEVEMENT**

Be Blue dragon, then Unseen class, then Assasin, Then Mastermind, Then Assasin And finally Evil King in the same game.

Hope you liked my idea. I would appreciate your feedback
Also if my english is bad im so sorry, Im from Argentina :) and i love the game.

**EDIT: Fixed some achievements, thanks for the feedback on discord :D**

Good Night!</description>

            <p>the only one i can see as strictly bad is ‘Peace is winning’ but in that, you’re an NK, and you’re not really letting anybody down by being bad as an nk, and plus, you can still steer yourself toward victory via the social aspect of the game</p>

            <p>i disagree, almost none of them steer someone toward strictly bad gameplay, just different.<br>
that one, dont bus people and try what you can to keep them from dying, but it isnt the end of the world</p>

            <p>I like the idea of having achievements in the game. Since the dev team is so small, I am not sure how soon they would have resources (time) to do it though. But at a certain point, for sure.</p>
<p>Since this is a team game, I’d stay away from achievements that would motivate players to produce weird and bad gameplay such as</p>
<pre><code>200 IQ play
Win as Cult Leader/Mastermind without getting any other member dead in the game
</code></pre>
<p>Especially experienced ones who could be more into achievements - to chase them instead of play to win. I like most of the neutral ones. The faction based ones need careful thinking through.</p>
