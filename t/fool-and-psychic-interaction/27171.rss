    <title>Fool and psychic interaction</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/fool-and-psychic-interaction/27171</link>
    <description>So I am relatively new to this game and am unsure if an interaction is intended or a bug so thought I would ask here. I was psychic and use my ability to type psychic link and the fool trollboxed me. Is the trollbox supposed to be able to appear as a psychic link in this case if I didn&#39;t send a message first?</description>

            <p>I remember watching a video on YouTube where the same thing happened.</p>
<p>The YouTuber was a Fool and he trollboxed the Psychic while he was typing his message for Telepathy. The trollboxed message appeared as the Psychic’s telepathic message but was invisible to all players except for the Fool himself (and possibly the Psychic, as you are confirming).</p>
<p>I’m guessing this is a bug and not the intended effect.</p>
