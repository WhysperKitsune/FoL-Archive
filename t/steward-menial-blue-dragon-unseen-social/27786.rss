    <title>Steward / Menial (Blue Dragon / Unseen Social)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/steward-menial-blue-dragon-unseen-social/27786</link>
    <description>**Introduction.**
The Steward and Menial are a social class that I created to get more social classes into the game. We currently have one functioning social class in BD, its converted class in Unseen, two neutrals and that&#39;s it. We will get two more **IF** the Noble and Aristocrat ever come back. That fact got mixed with the huge amount of NK ideas and killer/offensive ideas I stumbled upon today. So I started working on something social and I actually love this idea. Please take your time to read the details, as I tried to explain it the best way I could. Help me improve it if you want. I&#39;d love your feedback.

**Passive: Call Bell.**
The Steward / Menial is able to communicate with the king at night. If either is linked with the psychic, the Steward / Menial will withdraw back to his chambers. Being jailed also denies communication.

[details=&quot;Call Bell Details&quot;]
When I think of it, I don&#39;t imagine the Steward being physically present in the king&#39;s chamber (When I say Steward, please understand that the same applies to the Menial. I will focus on just saying Steward for the rest of this suggestion to make it simpler.). You can either put it like Prince or Psychic to make Steward&#39;s name not appear, just saying that Steward said something or just place his name normally. I don&#39;t think it really changes anything.
[/details]

**Day ability: Room Service. (Unlimited uses)**
This ability is only usable after you have used all of your abilities or after the Prince and all Psychic are dead. As soon as the day starts, everyone in court will receive a message that the Steward is avaiable. The Steward can select a target to be able to speak to him at night. However, this will only work if the target has Royal Blood.

[details=&quot;Room Service Details&quot;]
This day ability was created to tackle the absence of either the Prince or any Psychic, which would before render this class kind of useless. This issue was brought to light for me by **NuclearBurrito**, so thanks again! Not having any Royal Blood would give a message to the Steward and not display the Steward&#39;s avaiability to everyone.
[/details]

**Night ability 1: Dungeon Cleaning. (Very limited uses)**
The Steward will go to the dungeon to perform his cleaning duties. The Prince will be notified of his presence, however, the arrested will not. He will be able to hear and see everything that happens. He will not be able to talk to the king that night.

[details=&quot;Dungeon Cleaning Details&quot;]
The Prince will always get the message that a Steward is present, even if it&#39;s a Menial there.
[/details]

**Night ability 2: The Graveyard Shift. (Very limited uses)**
The Steward will go to the graveyard to perform his cleaning duties.
Any Psychic using link that night will be notified of his presence, their targets will not. The Steward will be able to hear everything they speak but will not hear the dead. He will not be able to talk to the king that night.

[details=&quot;The Graveyard Shift Details&quot;]
Like Dungeon Cleaning, the Psychic will always get the message that a Steward is present. I think it would be too overpowered if the Steward could also hear the dead, so I made it in this suggestion that he can&#39;t.
[/details]

**Comments.**
His win condition is that his alliance wins.
I initially thought about a day ability called &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; with very limited uses as well. It would work kinda like the old Noble who could hear whispers. I also thought of giving him the Private Matter day ability, so a Menial could talk to the unseen. All of those ideas I took out of this suggestion without a clear reason why. I just thought it looked better without it, even though the first day ability stated here matches the idea of this class a lot. If you can stop a second to imagine it, it would be like the members of the court talking openly while the maid served the food. She hears everything and they mostly ignore her presence.
One of the things I like the most about this class is that it would help a lot in those games where the king has no lead day 5. There would be no possible way the king doesn&#39;t know a thing with such a class pouring information into him. It would also help the king a lot to have someone to trust 100%. You KNOW he&#39;s your ally and therefore you can share information and ideas with him, just like Unseen and Cult do. Most of the time the king has to go through dozens of whispers alone and try to figure something out. He wouldn&#39;t need to anymore. 
By the way, this class would obviously be unique.
Thank you all for your attention. Have a wonderful day, evening or whatever!

**Changelog.**
Starting class will always be Steward regardless of king&#39;s alliance.
Humble Blood passive was taken out.
Added the day ability Room Service.</description>

<p>Ok I’d be happy to. So my thought process is that if I am a Steward who is part of the BD, I don’t need to check up with the Prince in prison as he’s 100% trustworthy and won’t use it. Just me though. However, as a Menial, it would be really useful to listen in on the Prince’s conversation even for one night. So that’s why I thought that the visit should be hidden from the Prince.</p>

<p>Ok so, the message would be displayed as soon as the Steward stepped into the dungeon. Just like the “A Psychic linked you” message. The Prince would receive something along the lines of “The Steward has stepped in to clean the dungeon.”</p>

<p>The chance of having no Prince, Psychics, Princesses, Drunks and maybe Nobles back (in the future) is very little. Yes, as the game progress to late game, less and less of those will be alive in the game. But by that point, you will already have tons of information and it will just be a matter of discussing with the king who to kill and who to keep alive.</p>

            <p>I like the idea a lot, and we do need more Social classes in general. But wouldn’t having a confirmed person on your side be a bit OP? And I think that having Menial be present when there’s an Evil King means that there could be up to 4 Unseen at the start of the game, which is a bit extreme. In my opinion, I think that the Steward should always start as a Steward, and always be able to talk to the King, but that he is convertible to a Menial, with the same passives but different abilities.<br>
This means that the Steward is like the King’s own interrogator, but he won’t know his faction.</p>

            <p><strong>Introduction.</strong><br>
The Steward and Menial are a social class that I created to get more social classes into the game. We currently have one functioning social class in BD, its converted class in Unseen, two neutrals and that’s it. We will get two more <strong>IF</strong> the Noble and Aristocrat ever come back. That fact got mixed with the huge amount of NK ideas and killer/offensive ideas I stumbled upon today. So I started working on something social and I actually love this idea. Please take your time to read the details, as I tried to explain it the best way I could. Help me improve it if you want. I’d love your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Passive: Call Bell.</strong><br>
The Steward / Menial is able to communicate with the king at night. If either is linked with the psychic, the Steward / Menial will withdraw back to his chambers. Being jailed also denies communication.</p>

<p>When I think of it, I don’t imagine the Steward being physically present in the king’s chamber (When I say Steward, please understand that the same applies to the Menial. I will focus on just saying Steward for the rest of this suggestion to make it simpler.). You can either put it like Prince or Psychic to make Steward’s name not appear, just saying that Steward said something or just place his name normally. I don’t think it really changes anything.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Day ability: Room Service. (Unlimited uses)</strong><br>
This ability is only usable after you have used all of your abilities or after the Prince and all Psychic are dead. As soon as the day starts, everyone in court will receive a message that the Steward is avaiable. The Steward can select a target to be able to speak to him at night. However, this will only work if the target has Royal Blood.</p>
<details>

Room Service Details</summary>
<p>This day ability was created to tackle the absence of either the Prince or any Psychic, which would before render this class kind of useless. This issue was brought to light for me by <strong>NuclearBurrito</strong>, so thanks again! Not having any Royal Blood would give a message to the Steward and not display the Steward’s avaiability to everyone.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Night ability 1: Dungeon Cleaning. (Very limited uses)</strong><br>
The Steward will go to the dungeon to perform his cleaning duties. The Prince will be notified of his presence, however, the arrested will not. He will be able to hear and see everything that happens. He will not be able to talk to the king that night.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Dungeon Cleaning Details</summary>
<p>The Prince will always get the message that a Steward is present, even if it’s a Menial there.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Night ability 2: The Graveyard Shift. (Very limited uses)</strong><br>
The Steward will go to the graveyard to perform his cleaning duties.<br>
Any Psychic using link that night will be notified of his presence, their targets will not. The Steward will be able to hear everything they speak but will not hear the dead. He will not be able to talk to the king that night.</p>
<details>
<summary>
The Graveyard Shift Details</summary>
<p>Like Dungeon Cleaning, the Psychic will always get the message that a Steward is present. I think it would be too overpowered if the Steward could also hear the dead, so I made it in this suggestion that he can’t.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Comments.</strong><br>
His win condition is that his alliance wins.<br>
I initially thought about a day ability called “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” with very limited uses as well. It would work kinda like the old Noble who could hear whispers. I also thought of giving him the Private Matter day ability, so a Menial could talk to the unseen. All of those ideas I took out of this suggestion without a clear reason why. I just thought it looked better without it, even though the first day ability stated here matches the idea of this class a lot. If you can stop a second to imagine it, it would be like the members of the court talking openly while the maid served the food. She hears everything and they mostly ignore her presence.<br>
One of the things I like the most about this class is that it would help a lot in those games where the king has no lead day 5. There would be no possible way the king doesn’t know a thing with such a class pouring information into him. It would also help the king a lot to have someone to trust 100%. You KNOW he’s your ally and therefore you can share information and ideas with him, just like Unseen and Cult do. Most of the time the king has to go through dozens of whispers alone and try to figure something out. He wouldn’t need to anymore.<br>
By the way, this class would obviously be unique.<br>
Thank you all for your attention. Have a wonderful day, evening or whatever!</p>
<p><strong>Changelog.</strong><br>
Starting class will always be Steward regardless of king’s alliance.<br>
Humble Blood passive was taken out.<br>
Added the day ability Room Service.</p>
