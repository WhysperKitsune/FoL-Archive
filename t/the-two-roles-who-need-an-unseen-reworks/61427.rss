[details=&quot;Poacher&quot;]
**The Poacher**


**Passives**

Isolation - Immune to target change and occupation

**Night Abilities:**

Savage Hound - Cause a player to bleed(1 use)

Spike Traps -  same as normal

Why Changed:
Without an ability to wolf another player,  poacher can be easily figure out, and without target immunity it can make it easy for a drunk to say they are not Hunter, spike trap can now be used to get a confirmed kill ( that is why uses has gone down to stop unseen from keep getting confirmed kills).
[/details]
[details=&quot;The Illusionist&quot;]
The Illusionist

**Passives**

Day Abilities:
Telepathy - same as normal.(2 uses)
Private Matter - same(2 uses)
Night Abilities:

Mind Warp - Make a player receive incorrect feedback about their abilities.

Why changed:
Mental Blur is too situational, and tells BD their is a confirmed converted Mystic, making the ability a risk with no good pay off. Psychic is good, because it let&#39;s Unseen communicate with each other, and allows Unseen to help a member when jailed.

* This is Great! Perfectly Works needs no fixes.
* This could improve the game, but needs a few tweaks before being perfect.
* This would only worsen the game, needs a lot of fixes.

            <p>Illusionist is hard to balance. I don’t have any ideas to change Mental Blur, its like a BM ability, nothing more.</p>
<p>Hunter is alright however. Redirection Immunity is a boon.<br>
But… if you add a Wolf… to the converted Hunter, all the Hunter really has is “lul throwing class monkaS”. And besides, the Unseen do not need an additional poison. That kills in 1 day. Huh.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Even ignoring the “no dead interactions” clause, the ability would be almost useless for illusionist. You can only get an illusionist with a dead member if you wait a full day after converting the illusionist. Most players simply won’t want to wait. And that’s if they have information valuable enough to share at all. Even if you don’t make it the main focus, it’ll be like illusionist’s current secondary ability and go virtually useless.</p>

<p>First of all. No dead interaction.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why?  The only issue that I see with it is that they become useless if the dead leave, but that can easily be fixed by making it not a main ability.  And it’s fine on evil classes.</p>

            <p>Ok maybe let’s start from beginning:<br>
Illusionist: Even if Mental Blur need to replaced giving her ability worst version of Aristocrat’s Abillity which isn’t good replacement.<br>
Poacher: He’s is fine at the way he is. Period.</p>
<p>Talking about specific buffs to particular roles, we should focus on weaker converts like Alcoholic or Duchess.</p>
