    <description>I think we should be able to send whispers during trials; this is kinda annoying. Sometimes we need to send a whisper and I don&#39;t really see any reason why we shouldn&#39;t be able to do that during the trial.</description>

            <p>You can whisper during trials, just not while the person is mounting a defence, right?</p>

            <p>Well yeah we do have whispers, with /w # message. And <a class="mention" href="/u/moleland">@Moleland</a> even though it’s not like a  huge issue it’s still kinda annoying; many times I was whispering to someone someone gets up for trial and I just lose my whisper. It’s not like high priority, but it would be good to enable them during trials too.</p>

            <p>That could happen anyway (I Don’t say I’d like it), since whispers are in-game, we just don’t have whispers during trials</p>
