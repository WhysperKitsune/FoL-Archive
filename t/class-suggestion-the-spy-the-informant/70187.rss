<p>All of my career I have tried to make this<br>
But to no avail…</p>
<p>Hey now , you’re a neutral<br>
Get your glasses on , Investigate!<br>
Hey now , you’re a neutral<br>

<p>I’d remove or change this, to be honest. This doesn’t really belong to an investigative class, aside from it this is pretty good.</p>

</aside>
<p>A pro-BD non-survivor class shouldn’t need death immunity. Remove the night immunity.</p>

<p>Add some limitations here otherwise you essentially have an additional Sheriff/Paladin as a day ability.</p>

</aside>
<p>A bit too strong here. Since this class is aligned with BD then he shouldn’t get that accurate investigative results. See how the Princess gets more generalized results than the Duchess or Seeker and whatnot.</p>
