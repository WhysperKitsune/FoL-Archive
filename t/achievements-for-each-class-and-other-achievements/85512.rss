    <title>Achievements For Each Class (And Other Achievements)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/achievements-for-each-class-and-other-achievements/85512</link>
    <description>Not saying it should be the exact same but something like the achievements from that other social deduction game that begins with a T. Maybe like you have the main achievements like get 1 win as this class so each class has one achievement but there are also other achievements that you can get for doing certain things as some classes or having something happen. You know? Also maybe the reward for completing an achievement could be 100 GP or something (also with the percent completed on Steam). Also maybe some achievements can be more rare then others by its task or just you know people not getting it.</description>
