A message will be announced that &quot;the king has put an extra vote on (x).&quot; This works even if you are not accusing anyone.
**Decide fate**
Immediately become open king, otherwise the same
**Guards!**

            <p>I just thought it would fix a bunch of the problems with people just exing king if he doesn’t find an evil, and maybe allow a removal of the allies ability all together</p>

            <p>Knowing who is king is what makes him Special. Removing that would be too big of a change. Making a new game mode for it might be refreshing though.</p>

            <p>No, I don’t like this idea and here’s why:</p>

            <p>Not a terrible idea, but I think the current iteration of a public King is a core identity in Throne of Lies and sets it apart from other social deduction games.</p>
