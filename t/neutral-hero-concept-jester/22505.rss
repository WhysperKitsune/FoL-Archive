    <title>Neutral Hero concept: Jester</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/neutral-hero-concept-jester/22505</link>
    <description>Made this for fun, don&#39;t take this too seriously, but I tried to balance him fairly:

![jester|690x359](upload://fjnN7krhiLtLKhNGKEeO5PM2iaZ.jpg)

**Skill finer details:**
* Jester is immune to convert
* You can&#39;t use Jester&#39;s Dance on yourself or the King
* You can&#39;t use Persuade on the King
* Fool&#39;s Errand reveals the attacker to the person being attacked only
* Fool&#39;s Errand does not protect against attacks that bypass death immunity, but will still reveal attackers

**Why would this class be good for the game?**
* Adding another Neutral that can benefit the BD will make them think twice before executing neutrals
* Neutral Killers are all occupy immune, making them easy to identify. Adding a beneficial neutral, occupy immune neutral indirectly helps neutral killers by giving them another alibi
* There are currently no offensive neutral classes in the game, why not make one?

**FAQ**

 &gt; Isn&#39;t a Jester and Fool the same thing?

Sort of, but I view it like this- the fool is more of a buffoon, the Jester is more of a medieval entertainer. Yes, they&#39;re sort of similar lose-wise, but don&#39;t get caught up in it.

&gt;Isn&#39;t his infinite use ability a bit too strong?

It&#39;s intentionally quite strong because he doesn&#39;t really have a lot of great ways to survive. Unlike Alchemist he can&#39;t go death immune 4 times- only twice.

&gt;Why would the BD want this guy alive?

Mostly, they would want him alive because Fool&#39;s Errand helps him identify threats, and the Jester and the BD both are incentivized to neutralize killers, so they have that in common. The Jester can also help the BD using his day abilities if he so chooses. Also, he&#39;s convert immune class, which instantly gives him value to the BD.

So, what do you think? Would you find this fun to play or not?</description>

            <p>You can’t say it’s a JOAT<br>
When you could classify every class in the game as a JOAT</p>
<p>Anyway, seems pretty good, thought the wincon could be better imo. Not sure what else to say, only Surivivors aren’t that interesting.</p>

            <p>I think this class should have an ability that stops them from being hung.While your not necessarily a hindrance and could be a help,there’s no reason to keep you alive.I think this class should have a passive called final act where  the person who killed you cannot use their abilities for 3 days.(If your hung it will be the first voter.)I also believe that persuade and practical joke aren’t necessary as if you have final act you don’t need these.Also for a neutral survivor that offensive something that might cause chaos is a day ability called tune of legends that makes whoever you targeted become night immune that night(infinite uses)(Cannot target self)Now this might seem OP because you could make prince invinceable.The thing is the evils could just kill you to get to the prince so it makes jester’s walk the line between BD and evils.Another day ability that would help is require help-3 uses-It makes it so that if any healers are alive they must heal you and if there aren’t any alive then you heal yourself.This is to stop you from dying to poison/bleed and causes chaos as healers may not be healing who they want to heal because they are healing you.(Also if I’m being honest final act is a move in Darkest Dungeon from the Jester so it fits the lore)</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I do however think Persuade is too strong and confirms the class too much imo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the Jester dilemma though, you can use Persuade to confirm yourself, or you can use it to kill someone who attacked you, but you can’t do both- and you can only use it once so you have to really use it carefully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The night ability’s are great and all but does an offensive survivor really need vote manipulation that powerful?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that he has to use his day abilities to survive because he doesn’t have a lot of protection at night</p>

            <p>I suggest removing or reworking practical joke and making Persuade make all votes on a target count for 2 rather than what it does now.</p>
<p>Also btw the reaper is not occ immune.</p>

            <p>The night ability’s are great and all but does an offensive survivor really need vote manipulation that powerful?</p>

            <p>I love it, seems pretty balanced actually, I do however think Persuade is too strong and confirms the class too much imo</p>

            <p>I like this.  The day abilities, to me, are what the last iteration of the noble should have had, but it makes more sense on a neutral.</p>

            <p>Made this for fun, don’t take this too seriously, but I tried to balance him fairly:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6b518abf59cbb4c09fa7fd0446ecf3f6f342bdc1.jpg" alt="jester" data-base62-sha1="fjnN7krhiLtLKhNGKEeO5PM2iaZ" width="690" height="359"></p>
<p><strong>Skill finer details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jester is immune to convert</li>
<li>You can’t use Jester’s Dance on yourself or the King</li>
<li>You can’t use Persuade on the King</li>
<li>Fool’s Errand reveals the attacker to the person being attacked only</li>
<li>Fool’s Errand does not protect against attacks that bypass death immunity, but will still reveal attackers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why would this class be good for the game?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adding another Neutral that can benefit the BD will make them think twice before executing neutrals</li>
<li>Neutral Killers are all occupy immune, making them easy to identify. Adding a beneficial neutral, occupy immune neutral indirectly helps neutral killers by giving them another alibi</li>
<li>There are currently no offensive neutral classes in the game, why not make one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t a Jester and Fool the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sort of, but I view it like this- the fool is more of a buffoon, the Jester is more of a medieval entertainer. Yes, they’re sort of similar lose-wise, but don’t get caught up in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t his infinite use ability a bit too strong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s intentionally quite strong because he doesn’t really have a lot of great ways to survive. Unlike Alchemist he can’t go death immune 4 times- only twice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would the BD want this guy alive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly, they would want him alive because Fool’s Errand helps him identify threats, and the Jester and the BD both are incentivized to neutralize killers, so they have that in common. The Jester can also help the BD using his day abilities if he so chooses. Also, he’s convert immune class, which instantly gives him value to the BD.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Would you find this fun to play or not?</p>
