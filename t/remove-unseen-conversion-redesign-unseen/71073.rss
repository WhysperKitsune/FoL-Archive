    <title>Remove Unseen Conversion. Redesign unseen</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/remove-unseen-conversion-redesign-unseen/71073</link>
    <description>My suggestion is simple.
Remove conversion entirely from the unseen faction.
Give them 4 starting members, no recruiting. Let the mastermind fulfill a different function

Bold, I know. Might sound crazy. But I think the current design is bad.

For a start, very few really like conversion. It&#39;s a terrible mechanic mostly. You&#39;re enjoying the game and then you get ripped out of it and forced to suddenly adopt an entirely new mindset. Getting into character once is hard enough, doing it again midgame is pretty jarring, and many people simply fail at it.

Second, there&#39;s already cult. They do converting. Why do we need two factions that revolve around conversion? It makes the two not feel very different from each other.

Thirdly, and perhaps most annoyingly to my mind. It seems like you - the developers - don&#39;t like conversion either. It&#39;s getting gradually chipped away at. Sheriff scout, Wizard&#39;s Clear Mind, and now the king&#39;s fealty ability. Not to mention dividing the previously convertible mercenary into two unconvertible classes.
All of these changes over the past months have had the net effect of making the Mastermind play experience worse and worse and worse. Greatly increasing the chances that a conversion will fail, for one of many reasons. 

It leads to frustrating games that are highly luck based. You can&#39;t just pick someone you want to convert, any revealed person is likely to be protected against it. Often you just have to pick a quiet target and pray that they&#39;re convertible, useful, not afk, and can suddenly adapt to being a new class. And that their converted class isn&#39;t one that&#39;s immediately proveable.

I think converting is just not fun. For most people, in either faction
I&#39;m not saying all those corrupted class versions need to go away though, just swap the unseen from a conversion based strategy, to a strategy based on using their initial numbers. Give them a starting party of Mastermind, Asasssin, and two randomly selected corrupted classes.

As for the mastermind themselves, give them a broad array of investigative and hampering abilities to make them a useful asset. And more significantly, to allow them to convincingly fake a broad variety of roles</description>

</aside>
<p>Make a new third faction similar to the Coven in ToS… A faction centered on controlling people for specific targets or goals. (similar to possessor, not quite the same)</p>
<p>Maybe make their win condition something unusual, like collecting things from specific BD classes that need to be used in a ritual in order to achieve the win condition? Eh I dunno, actually sounds like more work than when I first started thinking about it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>CW, Sheriff and Paladin are only the most direct examples. The other classes are still made with conversion in mind when determining both overall power and the acceptable amount of confirmability.</p>
<p>For example between maids, sheriffs (or whatever this factions equivalent is), drunks, observers and the King there would be far too many investigatives for just a set number of classes to handle even if 1 or 2 of them appeared BD. And then you have things like the NK’s being stronger and more anti-death (because conversion can get past them so it has counterplay). Overall having 4 starting members and maybe some extra powerful ability’s would not be worth the lack of confirmation reversal, safe player removal (kills are relatively risky) ect.</p>

            <p>Agreed. Simply make a new faction without conversion. Adds more layers to gameplay as well which is always nice. Plus new classes!</p>

            <p>I just wanted to note, Conversion isnt a unique mechanic in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>Town of Salem for example has the Vampires who have a conversion Mechanic. (I havent played this in 2 years so maybe its gone since then?)</p>
<p>Anyway, I do like the mechanics of conversion and dont think there really needs to be a change atm. I DO agree however, that the devs are nerfing the conversion mechanics too much with all these new class abils specifically tailored to stop it.</p>

            <p>but then you have the issue of… massively nerfed KPN, classes with useless ability’s, classes with ability’s that are now too strong (due to lack of conversion keeping them in check) ect.</p>
<p>The entire game is balanced around conversion, if you remove it then the game needs to be redesigned accordingly.</p>

            <p>How about keeping conversions in unseen games but have some games that starts without a Mastermind, but with 4-5 other unseen</p>

            <p>Okay but like I already said conversion actually does have massive problems that are completely unavoidable. Pretending otherwise is pointless.</p>
<p>I do agree with you, however, that ToL has carved out a niche for itself because of its conversions, and that removing them from the core game would be a bad idea. Not because there aren’t issues, but because the game stands apart from the crowd due to embracing the positive side of conversions and attempting to deal with the negatives as best it can.</p>

            <p>Well, I personally think Unseen conversion is important.<br>
As many people stated this game’s unique quirk is conversion, so saying the Devs don’t like that makes no sense whatsoever. It makes it stand out from many other mafia games, giving it a spot on the market as a twist on the classic.</p>
<p>Also, I’m very confused. You’re saying conversion is luck based, as a complaint to a mafia game which is based on conversion. If you don’t like it, then there are so many alternatives you can play. I’d suggest town of salem if that’s what you’re going for.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nanako">@Nanako</a> may I ask <strong>why</strong> you don’t like conversions and why you thought that asking for removal of a <strong>core</strong> mechanic in this game is a good solution? There are many people who have joined this due to the unique mechanic we have as a community. So why, for the few, is it a problem that should be taken away from all of us?</p>

            <p>Ok, I kinda exaggerated. What I should’ve said is it doesn’t need something as intense as getting rid of it for unseen altogether. I’ll edit that now.</p>
<p>Update - edited</p>

<p>Conversion as a mechanic isn’t bad. Sure, it can be annoying to be converted into a loss, but it’s not really a problem that needs addressing.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wait what</p>
<p>You can’t just write off major issues like that</p>
<p>Conversions <em>are</em> a problem, but this game is clearly trying to minimize the consequences of sticking with them rather than eliminate the root cause. That doesn’t make them not a problem!</p>
