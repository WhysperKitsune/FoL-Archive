&gt;**Warlock**
Neutral Killing
**Passive one: Fiendish resilience**
Immune to death a night. 
**Passive two: Seamless**
You appear as the king&#39;s faction when checked by him via allies (BD for good, unseen/cult for evil, neutral for neutral). When an observer window peaks you, they will see your faction as blue dragon.
**Night ability one: Animate dead**
_(infinite uses, 1-day cooldown)_ Gain a use of Hush, and gain a charge of Hold parliament. *Seamless* and *Fiendish Resilience* will be suppressed for the night. 
**Night ability two: Mind Blank**
(infinite uses) You will be informed of the names and classes of everyone who visited you tonight; if no one did, you will instead be informed of the names and class types of everyone who visited you the previous night. If you are poisoned or bleeding, you will heal yourself. In addition, you will be immune to occupation the following 2 nights (though for that time any occupiers will think their occupation was a success)
**Day ability: Hush**
_(1 use)_ Your impenetrable gaze will silence your target for the rest of the day, and one of your skeletal minions will kidnap them at the end of the day, occupying them for the night and killing them. If they survive the attack, they will be silenced the next day as well.
**Day ability: Hold parliament**
_(costs charges equal to the number of players including yourself still alive)_ The game instantly ends, with you as the sole victor (scorned may still have won, as could fool; alchemist loses; mercenary loses unless you are there target)

Goal: survive to use &quot;Hold Parliament&quot;

I think this would have to be in place of a neutral killer when it is present

animate dead gives use of hold parliament because you are holding parliament with a bunch of undead corpses</description>

            <p>remember, he does still have Hush, so with given strat of earlier of animating every second night, they are akin to the hardship NK felt with old cult of killing one person every second night</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You are right now that I think about it.  Since there is not an NK actively killing people, the game will take much longer to narrow.  That may present a tough balancing act since unseen/cult sort of rely on NKs to rack up the kills.  Warlock is therefore less useful in general to evils.</p>
<p>How to counterbalance that so it isn’t a major detriment to evils?  For one, maybe warlock becomes evil king?  Maybe warlock spawning guarantees a full complement of neuts?</p>

            <p>I was thinking that it might be OP, but remember it isn’t the easiest to stay alive long as NK. In cult game with warlock, about 1 person dies per night (don’t know how much people would die to execution). if you gain a charge about every two nights, you will prolly be a threat around d5?</p>

            <p>Interesting idea.  Seems potentially OP to me and would seem to get a lot of evil kings executed for bussing the warlock.</p>
<p>Can hush be used on king?  When does hush lock journal?</p>
<p>So the gameplan is animate dead on odd nights and mind blank on even nights.  If you are not occupied the first two nights, you will be occ/poison/bleed immune thereafter due to mind blank.  What you are trying to avoid is an attack or king/obs check on odd nights.  You would actually welcome bleeding/poison since  you could ask for heals on odd nights and reduce risk of attack.</p>

            <p>If i animated dead and then next night used it and had no visitors, I would know previous night</p>
<p>it is important because many nights will be spent animating dead given the goal</p>
