&quot;This is an example rolecard!&quot;

# [color=green]Exampler[/color]
**Town Example Role**

You are an example role, featuring in many Forum Mafia original posts. You lead the way in being a way to show that Ici is changing his rolecard format again, and that he may or may not be copying the standard MS Upick rolecards. sigh

**Look at my format! (Example)** - Your rolecard will be published publicly before the game even begins.
**Don&#39;t worry this ain&#39;t in the game (Non-existent)** - You don&#39;t actually exist in the game.
**Here&#39;s how to vote someone! (Common Abilities)** - You may vote during the day.

**You win if all threats to the town have been eliminated**
