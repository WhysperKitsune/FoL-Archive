    <description># [color=lighblue]The Paladin[/color]

_&quot;I will end the blood god&#39;s injustice and I shall smite those that have forsaken our Blue Dragon.&quot;_

The Paladin in her youth was but just a young sweet girl. No one would have expected her to become such a powerful figure among the court. 

At a very early age, she had nightmares of demons and creatures making their way into the Castle. People thought her to have been the first possible attempt at a brainwash by Mithras. It is that which made her mind stronger against any attempts at Brainwash. 

She possessed a strong ability to find who were among the Cult and since Mithras had already tried to tempt her, the blood god would not do so lightly again. It was then, she adorned the name, The Paladin of Castle Adiart. Through swift justice, she would go forth to battle against those that praise Mithras and those that would spill blood in their name.</description>
