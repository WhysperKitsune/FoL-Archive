    <title>[Class Suggestion] Reworked Noble and the Aristocrat</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-reworked-noble-and-the-aristocrat/33596</link>
    <description>Hey, random person who dropped here! Hope you have an awesome 2018!!
Here&#39;s a kind of new look to the Noble. 71,42% of the skills used here already exists in the game, with the exception being Noble&#39;s Passive 2 and Day Ability 1. However, just those two make all his kit really different. I have the opinion that, currently, Evil Kings are with a higher win rate than they should. Bringing the Noble back should be enough to tip that balance back. Especially because of the two new abilities. Only one of his day abilities may be used per day (just saying it to avoid doubts regarding that).

The Noble [Blue Dragon - Social]

Passive 1 - Royal Blood [Only usable upon the death of a king]:
As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.

Passive 2 - Guilty As Charged:
If the Noble successfully uses his day ability to accuse and execute an Evil King, he will take his place immediately, guaranteeing a Blue Dragon ruler for the Kingdom. However, if the executed King was a member of the Blue Dragon, the Noble will be executed with him, accused of high treason against the crown. There is no aftermath from the execution of a Neutral King.

Day Ability 1 - Unworthy of Ruling (Single use):
If the Noble so chooses, he may start a vote against the King. The chat will display a special message saying that the Noble is accusing the King of evildoing. This ability makes it so that the number of votes required to get the King to trial is halved (rounded up).

Day Ability 2 - Noble Twin (2 uses):
The Noble&#39;s votes count twice during that day. This skill may be activated during a trial.

Night Ability 1 - Royal Decree (2 uses): 
Make a player immune to accusations during the next day.

Night Ability 2 - Maid Spy (3 uses):
During the next day, all whisper to and from your target will be shown to you.

The Aristocrat [Unseen - Social]

Passive 1 - Royal Blood [Only usable upon the death of a king]:
As a Royal, you can put your name forward for nominations to become the next King.

Day Ability 1 - Political Pressure (2 uses): 
Force a player to accuse another player and prevent them from voting further.

Night Ability 1 - Royal Decree (2 uses):
Make a player immune to accusations during the next day.

Night Ability 2 - Maid Spy (3 uses):
During the next day, all whisper to and from your target will be shown to you.</description>

            <p>Yeah I don’t think the Noble should have that day ability, just make it so that if the Noble is the first to accuse the King, this scenario will play out. And without Noble Twin, Aristocrat will always be called out.</p>

            <p>The problem I see with this is it makes claiming Noble impossible, as you can use Unworthy of Ruling to without a doubt confirm yourself as a Noble (not converted, at that).</p>
