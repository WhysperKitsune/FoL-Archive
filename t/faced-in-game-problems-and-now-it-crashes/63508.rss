    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/faced-in-game-problems-and-now-it-crashes/63508</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
After the update a few days ago whenever I join a game my name is not highlighted in green anymore and at night I&#39;m in a random room alone even if I&#39;m part of the cult, unseen or in jail, as well as when I&#39;m cult or unseen the members are not highlighted either but instead shown in a box above the normal players one. I tried taking screenshots but the game just won&#39;t allow me anymore. Today when I tried play the game won&#39;t load and tells me &#39;the game crashed&#39; with the specific folder that caused it and that I should contact a developer. 


#### Comments:

I tried uninstalling the game and steam as well but the same problem remained.</description>

            <p>If it’s crashing when you start the game up, then it means it’s probably an issue with your OS. Usually updates to the OS will fix it.</p>

            <p>Well make sure your drivers and OS are up to date, because that is cause of a lot of crashes.</p>

            <p>It seems to be trying to start in Vulkan and failing. If you’re not choosing to use Vulkan on startup, then your graphics drivers or OS likely need updated.</p>

            <p>It feels like a lot of games are crashing now. There were 3 (possibly more) crash reports in the past day. Probably has something to do with the update.</p>
