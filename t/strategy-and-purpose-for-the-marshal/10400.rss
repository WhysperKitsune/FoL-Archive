    <title>Strategy and Purpose for the Marshal?</title>

    <description>Ello all...I was wondering how exactly you are meant to play the Marshal. I know what the abilities do and how they work...but I&#39;m not quite sure how you&#39;re supposed to use them, well, usefully.</description>

            <p>The Marshall can almost claim anything since he has so much information at his disposal. Use this advantage to claim classes you wouldn’t normally risk claiming (Psychic, Hunter, Drunk) since they require specific information that could be found in their journals. You can get mislynches on fairly confirmable BD classes in this way and CC unique classes with reliable information.</p>
<p>Remember - getting executed as a Marshall frees up your Mastermind to convert again. Even if your mislynch fails and you are killed, you are still allowing the MM to eliminate another threat the following night. Consider CC’ing somebody important if your MM is still under the radar.</p>

            <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>The general idea of the Marshal seems easy actually…but I can see that choosing the right targets is harder than one would think. Definitely looks very important and game changing. Seems like it is very underrated as well, from what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>I should really enjoy playing as Marshal too; what you described is a type of gameplay that I like.</p>

            <p>Play it to find VIP targets. Prince’s are usually quiet; check the chat log – see who hasn’t talked much that is not Unseen. Consult journals belonging to dead Butler’s and Drunks – see who was noted as occupation immune.</p>
<p>After you’ve a couple of good targets, use your Snoop skill on them. I’ve found many a Prince this way and the following night had the Assassin target them.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can also use snoop to find Neutral Killers as well using a similar strategy as the above. If someone was occupation immune and they’re claiming something like Observer in their journal, there’s a good chance they’re a Possessor or Scorned.</p>
<p>It’s all intelligence gathering by utilizing other variables with the process of deduction with your own logic.</p>
<p>Marshall’s are capable of pinpointing someone to the very class they play unlike any other role. Never underestimate them.</p>
