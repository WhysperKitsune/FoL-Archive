    <title>[Class Suggestion] Acolyte</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-acolyte/40288</link>
    <description>As someone who loves playing Cult, I have always been bothered that Invoker is converted from 4 classes, 2 of which do not fit the theme at all. I&#39;m speaking of Knight and Hunter, who somehow go from Protecting/Killing people to Occupying them. 
My idea of an Acolyte is a class that specializes in interacting **directly** with your Cult Leader, empowering him at your own expense. 
It is also supposed to reward cooperation and analysis within the Cult. 

My suggestion, as follows:


**Acolyte:**

**Type:** Support;
**Win Conditions:** Defeat the Blue Dragon and any neutrals that seek to do you harm;
**Faction:** Cult;
**Converted From:** Hunter, Knight;
**Unique:** No;

 **Day Abilities:**
   &#39;Forbidden Ritual&#39; [3] charges - Allow the Cult Leader to communicate with the dead Cult members and make them Occupy Immune for the night. Those who attempt to occupy the Cult Leader will believe they succeeded.  Prevents you from using your other abilities tonight.

**Night Abilities:**
   &#39;Undying Devotion&#39; [2] charges - If your Cult Leader is attacked tonight, make yourself Occupy Immune and force the attacker to target you instead. Bypasses target change immunity. 

**Passive Abilities:**
   &#39;Final Revelation&#39; - After you die, all Cult members will be able to see their visitors for the next night. If you are killed while using &#39;Undying Devotion&#39;, Cult members will see their visitors for the next 2 nights instead.


**Notes:**
1: The notifications you would get from &#39;Undying Devotion&#39; are:
_Someone caused you to target [x]._
_You attacked [x] last night._
Where [x] would be the Acolyte.

2: &#39;Final Revelation&#39; will work whenever you are killed, sacrificed or executed during the day.</description>
