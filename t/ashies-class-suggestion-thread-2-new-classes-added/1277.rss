            <p>Great ideas, but there are some changes that I feel are in order</p>
<p>Watchdog- Day- Threaten- 2 uses- Verbally threaten a player. Their night ability will be disabled during the next night, and you will be able to use it if you wish. (That way it helps claiming)</p>
<p>Watchdog- Passive 2 - Specto- You will know the names of any players who visit Black Rose members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Morticians could also appear during a cult game. Morticians would probably spread like rabbits. Paladin is immune to convert. Therefore, if a paladin kills a mortician, it would not be converted.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There can only be a maximum of 3. Paladin would just be OP if it could kill Cult (already struggling) and Moritcians. I agree with making Paladin immune, but I’m not so sure about Sheriff, especially since other roles can find Black Rose as well (although I know Sheriff only appears in BR games)</p>

<p>I quite like this idea.<br>
While it’s strong, it certainly has potential I’d say.<br>
The concept is interesting.</p>

<p>Thanks! I tried to come up with a good concept for hours, and I came up with this.</p>
