    <title>The Throne... Of Lies... Returns. [Roleplay Thread]</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/the-throne-of-lies-returns-roleplay-thread/74672</link>
    <description>It was a glum day in Adiart. The sky was a bland grey , filled with clouds pouring rain onto the earth. The rain splashed everywhere over the city, drenching all the citizens who decided to be out, and their possessions too. 

Droplets of rain appeared on the window. The stained glass window in the throne room of Castle Adiart, the home of the Blue Dragon, a faction known by everyone for it&#39;s amazing defences and influence. it&#39;s entire legacy told on this one window.

And the King, Leonard Lionheart observed, absentmindedly. This was a familiar routine to him, to step off his throne to admire the window behind, and the distorted view of the kingdom behind that. It was a perfect view for him, encompassing much of Adiart in one view. He smiled as he looked around at the peaceful land, even less active due to the weather.

Focusing back on the stained window, he saw an image of a valiant knight, high and mighty, his sword raised. The king instinctively mimicked the pose with a chuckle, but then realising where it pointed at. 

The throne. A throne that he didn&#39;t deserve. A place where he shouldn&#39;t be. A civilisation he shouldn&#39;t need to run. But a land he must rule over, no less. Leonard sighed, and left the room.

Outside the throne room, he saw his son, Lars. Seeing his father, he quickly rushed over to say something, but his father dismissed him before he could speak a word.

&quot;Leave me be. I&#39;m going for a walk. Tell the guards and nobles I want to go alone, for once. I will be back... just. Leave me be.&quot;
Lars reluctantly nodded and rushed off.

The king sighed and headed down stairs to exit the castle. He did not care to take anything to shelter himself against the rain, for he just wanted to leave, and have some alone time.

And so, the castle was temporarily left without its ruler...

It seemed like a normal rainy day...but who knew what was to pop up.</description>

<p>Well. That was unexpected. He did enjoy Vilhelm’s company, more so than anyone else he has encountered in his lifetime, but was that <em>love?</em> When does friendship cross the line and become line? Perhaps he hass been in love this entire time, but just didn’t know what he was feeling. <em>Well, there’s only one way to find out,</em> he supposes as he leans in and kisses him back.</p>

            <p>Iyvel. Destroyed by the light, on their two deaths. He looks at the paladin which symbolized both what he hated and feared the most. Even Mithras do not wish of the destruction, even the devil he served upon in the old days didn’t chase him desperately giving orders.<br>
He wondered if Khevetar was still alive. Most demons and even devils only received a name when they needed to be adressed as a separated way of their folk. The same reason that all demons and devils worth summoning had them.<br>
In general, almost all of curses of a demon carried through generations of the same family line. The foolish humans often thought it was related to bloodlines, but the demonic concept of inheritor is more of those who is not a son by genes but one who followed the same ideals.<br>
All paladins were to be hated because they were Marlvith, by this line of thought. They expressed the relations of inheritance in their own names of those who were deemed worthy enough to possess them, covering the concepts of inheritance and creation over their prefixes and suffixes.<br>
He wondered if Khevetar was still alive, though.</p>
<p>Running, the paladin enters in chase. His Lord also communicates, but he weaves out the words as his body by reflex stopped suddenly while he was drifted on thoughts. Their fine reactions had brought him to the border of the abyss, where without their reflexes he would be certainly past the border.<br>
He looked back at the paladin in a savage fury, feet touching half the void and half the land. Having they probably going to strike, a glimpse formed itself on his mind. He formed somewhat of a plan, but now could only count on their agility to dodge the next blow at the border of the abyss. If the paladin hit with force, which was likely, she would be thrown forward by the weight centralized in the blade. Not enough to fall into the abyss, though.</p>

            <p>The memory of the spider struck back at his memory that was slowly going back and forth on the recent events as his demonic mind usually did in background. The battle memories also getting on it involuntarily was also a trace gained by the extent of his free will.</p>
<p>Uniting both, he noticed that both times the spider died were pretty similar in nature. Apparently it regenerated automatically at an unknown speed that could last anything between one second to 245 years, as the demon was sealed not long after the slaying of their mount in the only book Marlvith had at the camp, the diary of expeditions wrote by the scribe who made the expeditions enter in history.</p>
<p>He was still slightly worried by the use of the rust demon shaped as a spider, Iyvel, though. The creature itself was a gift given to him by Mithras, or better, trusted on his hands. Its merely summoning could have meant a debt to pay, or the reason for the calong of the blood. Demon, who actually are you kidding. Your own existence is a debt to Mithras, one that you hide the taxes and pretender that never happened.</p>
<p>Similarly, he hided his tears to focus on getting out the way of the sword and to start running immediately his neck diverted from the path of the blade. Death was a luxury he couldn’t afford, even if unknowingly now running into the direction of the abyss.</p>
