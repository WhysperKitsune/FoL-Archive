    <title>Possible Will-o-Wisp Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/possible-will-o-wisp-bug/26552</link>
    <description>#### What happened?

Night 1 - I&#39;m (16), the Princess. I Will-o-Wisp the King (6).
It said that (1) and (8) visited me that night.
It also said that a Mercenary stood guard outside my room that night. My Mercenary was (10).
Apparently that night, (8), the Court Wizard, swapped me (16) and (1).
However, the Prince (15) had jailed (1) that night.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?

I believe it would only have said that 10 visited me? I&#39;m not entirely sure.

#### Steps to reproduce:

Laid out in &quot;What Happened&quot;

#### Comments:

This was a cult game but I don&#39;t think there was an Apostle. I specifically remember there being a Seeker and a Cult Leader but I can&#39;t remember the other dead cultist classes. Either way, the Mercenary&#39;s Stand Guard ability says that it prevents others from visiting their target. Would that prevent an Apostle from using Mind Warp on them?</description>
