    <title>[Class Suggestion] The Conjuror - Neutral Offensive</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/class-suggestion-the-conjuror-neutral-offensive/38703</link>
    <description>The Conjuror [Neutral - Offensive]

Day Ability 1: Induce Paranoia (3 uses)
Make it so that the target believes he was poisoned by the assassin or bled by the cult leader. This effect lasts for two days, like the real poison/bleeding. If a healer decides to heal him, the healer will be notified that a heal was not required, but his healing will end this effect.

Night Ability 1: Now You See Him (Unlimited uses)
Hide a targeted player for the night. All those who targeted him will be redirected to the first player alive above him on the list. This skill does not redirect toward the Conjuror.

Night Ability 2: Labyrinth Paradox (3 uses)
If your target decides to leave his room to visit someone, he will instead visit himself.

.

So, yeah, that&#39;s my suggestion for a new Neutral class! There is currently no Offensive Neutral class, so this could be it. His win condition, like most Neutrals, is to survive the game. What I like about this idea is that he is similar to the Alchemist as far as Neuts In, Neuts Out goes. He&#39;s a potential threat to the BD but a potential ally at the same time. Having a Conjuror &quot;guard&quot; important members of the BD, like the Prince, is priceless. However, if the Conjuror so chooses, he can make sure no one gets healed, almost EVER.
Tell me what you guys think about this! I really hope you like him!</description>

            <p>What’s his win conditions? Survive? If so then none of his abilities help him do so. Although I guess if you put yourself to town and protect people with the now you see me Ability then you could survive by making alliances. Although again we do need more neutrals in the game as of right now</p>
