    <title>[Class Suggestion] Witch (NK)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-witch-nk/51056</link>
    <description>Changes -
- frame now makes the victim appear as a magic user
- phase 1 changed from appears as a magic user to cannot vote
- &quot;stone mist&quot; is now &quot;enslave soul&quot;


The witch is slow paced Neutral Killing class, That observes the chaos breaking out as the kingdom slowly crumbles to pieces.

The witch is a magic user, meaning the inquisitor can come into play, the inquisitor now also spawns in when there is a witch in game, **and no there cannot be a witch and a sorcerer**


**Passive: Soul Potion** - Immune to death, poison, and bleeding

**Day Ability: Frame** - Make a player appear as unseen/cult tonight, also appears as a magic user to the inquisitor

**Day Ability**: **Molten Potion** (x2) - Force a player to drink a potion that makes them slowly rot, this has three phases, The molten potion can only be healed by an Alchemist or Physician in the first phase, if it&#39;s not the first phase, the Healer will push them back a phase.
**Phase 1:** This happens the first day/night they drink the potion, the player cannot vote.
**Phase 2:** This happens the Day/night after the player drinks the potion, the cannot use any of their abilities.
**Phase 3:** This happens three days after they drank the potion, they are unable to speak. tonight they will die if not healed.

**Night Ability: Drain** - Make a player die the next night, Cannot be healed

**Night Ability: Enslave Soul (x3)-** Use a dead players ability on someone</description>

            <p>Phase 3 should include not being able to vote. Frame should include looking like a magic user and this should be removed form molten potion phase 1. Frame should include a scout frame to make that fallible.</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>Does the frame count as a visit? Cause if you’re seen visiting 2 people that’s pretty suspicious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities are semi unoriginal. First night ability is just reaper except they can talk. Second is just sorcerer circle on self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still think sorc/inq is better probably and they would know if they were targeted by Molten Potion right? So why would Inquisitor attack them unless they were redirected?</p>
</li>

<p>the inquisitor can come into play, the inquisitor’s new goal is to live to see the Sorcerer OR Witch die.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you saying that the Witch can spawn with other NKs in the game, bringing the possible NK Count to two? Or are you suggesting that Inquisitor be able to spawn in both Sorc Games &amp; Witch Games?</p>
