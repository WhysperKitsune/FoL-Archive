    <description>## [color=green]Welcome to Forum Mafia game[/color] [color=red]Enemy[/color] [color=green]Within[/color]

 [Color=steelblue][I]The year is 2027, United Nations have formed anti-terrorism coalition called UNATCO to battle against terrorist groups across the globe. 25 years later however...National Secessionist Forces or also known as NSF have commited raid against UNATCO headquarters but failed to take out entire commanding structure and are hiding among us as loyal and obedient. Unfortunately for us, the top agent of UNATCO have defected from our cause and present hazardous danger to us so it is your job to apprehend the NSF terrorists and neutralize the agent.[/i][/color]
