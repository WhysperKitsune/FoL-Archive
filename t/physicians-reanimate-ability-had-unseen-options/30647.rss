    <title>Physician&#39;s Reanimate ability had unseen options</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physicians-reanimate-ability-had-unseen-options/30647</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
At night, a physician had options to reanimate an unseen (and possibly cult) player.
#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
Only BD should be an option.
#### Steps to reproduce:
1) Be a Physician
2) Check reanimate options after unseen death. Sometimes, I found that physician revive options changed between nights during this glitch, so it may take multiple nights
#### Comments:
There may be other requirements that I simply don&#39;t know as it&#39;d be tricky to re-create this repeatedly expecting the same results.

<p>The Herbalist can make dead players appear as a class other than their own. So if you had the option to select only real BDs, you’d instantly be able to tell who was defiled.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure this was changed on purpose a while back so that the Physician (and previously the Priest) couldn’t immediately tell who was defiled by the Herbalist.</p>
