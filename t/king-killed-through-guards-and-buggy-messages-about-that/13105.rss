    <title>King killed through guards and buggy messages about that</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/king-killed-through-guards-and-buggy-messages-about-that/13105</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I guarded myself as a King, but was killed by Assasin or Sellsword. I also got a message said I was immune, but still died.

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
King had to survive or receive correct message about why did he die.

#### Steps to reproduce:
I attached 2 screenshots where you can see all you need: confusing message, King&#39;s death and list of all player&#39;s roles.

            <p>I should have mentioned that I accused MM in previous day and Sellsword seemed to be contracted to MM, so Sellsword could attack me last night. So both Assasin and Sellsword could attack me last night.</p>
<p>Butler was already dead by last night. Also I think Butler can’t occupy King.</p>

            <p>Alchemists previously had a bug where their emerald potion could kill possessors through their passive night immunity with no extra warning or message. Perhaps that’s what’s happened here?</p>

            <p>It looks like you were attacked twice that night, as per the two attack msgs.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t look like any of the killing classes had the ability to bypass immunity so I’m at a lose. I was going to guess butler occupied you but it would have said do. Sorry that I can’t be of assistance in this case.</p>
