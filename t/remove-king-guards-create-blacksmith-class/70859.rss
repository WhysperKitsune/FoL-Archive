    <title>Remove King Guards, Create Blacksmith Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/remove-king-guards-create-blacksmith-class/70859</link>
    <description>The title is pretty self-explanatory and someone already suggested a Blacksmith class, but some people like to read class suggestions and it&#39;s fun anyways :stuck_out_tongue: 

&gt; # [color = &quot;steblue&quot;] The Blacksmith [/color]
&gt; **[color = &quot;steblue&quot;] Blue Dragon Support [/color]** 
&gt;
&gt;**Lend Armor (Night ability)** - Make someone death immune for the night.  Can target yourself twice. (Infinite uses) 

This would also help Mastermind and death immune neutrals to fake claim armored.</description>

            <p>Yeah tbh tho the only things it covers for heal is possess/reap and those nks might not even be in game. While heal covers things that are guaranteed which are poison/bleeding.</p>
<p>If the Blacksmith was in a Sorc game he would be a weaker phys.</p>

            <p>Isn’t this just a weaker phys?  The only advantage this has is against reaper, but that is easily bypassed by empower reap.</p>

<p>This is wrong. Giving someone death immunity covers things a Physician’s heal can’t like Reap</p>

            <p>Also would king just have OE as a night ability or would there be another ability to replace guards? (I have a feeling that king will most likely die n1 now due to NKs)</p>
