    <title>Class suggestion: The Hermit (neutral offensive)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-the-hermit-neutral-offensive/31683</link>
    <description>Hello, here is an idea about a neutral offensive. The idea is, this guy just want to live his life in peace, and retaliate to people annoying him.

Passive: If you get executed by trial, bleed the first one to accuse. If you get executed by prince, bleed him.
Passive: Occupy immune.
Night ability: Cure yourself from bleeding or poison. Unlimited.
Night ability: Occupy and bleed anyone trying to visit you tonight. You are death immune. 3 charges.

Its a bit rough, but would that work out? A little bit of Hunter, a little bit of Alchemist, and something to consider when executing neuts.
The cure ability is so he doesnt need to rely on healer, but he can&#39;t use both ability the same night.</description>
