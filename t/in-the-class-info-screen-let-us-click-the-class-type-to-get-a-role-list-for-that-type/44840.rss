    <description>Basically:  Clicking the &quot;Killer&quot; icon on eg. the class card for The Assassin should bring up a list of all killer roles.

It&#39;s incredibly annoying to play a role that detects types, since there&#39;s no easy way to review the types at a glance.

Perhaps also add a link to a &quot;magic&quot; list from the Inquisitor, and (in the description of abilities that detect types) turn the word &quot;type&quot; into a button that brings you to a list of all the types, which can then be clicked to see the roles of the chosen type.</description>
