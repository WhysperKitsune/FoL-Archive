    <title>Physician and Herbalist Visit Bug</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/physician-and-herbalist-visit-bug/39556</link>
    <description>I was Princess and I willo-wisped, and only saw 1 visitor but was attacked but healed. I believe the Night The Physician heals someone successfully but also gets converted covers his visit during that night.

Here is a quote from Preston Harvey on steam forums to back this up:

“Actually I am pretty sure it is true. one time I had been healed by a phys and a alch and they both ended up trying to execute eachother because it only told me once. it went the alchemists side when it turned out the physician was converted the night he had healed me“</description>

<p>This is actually irrelevant. They would only get 1 message no matter what. It was recently changed to be like that.</p>
