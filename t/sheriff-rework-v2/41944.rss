    <title>Sheriff Rework v2</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/sheriff-rework-v2/41944</link>
    <description>[details=&quot;Why sheriff needs a rework&quot;]

* Being unique and guaranteed makes it very hard to fakeclaim.  And sheriff is a class that should never not be fakeclaimable, as it becomes overpowered if it&#39;s confirmable

* Scout only affects the MM.  Abilities shouldn&#39;t only affect one class(Yes, I know that MM is guaranteed.  However, it still becomes useless when the MM is dead.)

* Being unconvertable is bad.  The only BD classes that should be unconvertable are prince and the king.  There are too many unconvertable classes as is.

* Surveillance makes the sheriff confirmable, and sheriff becomes overpowered if it is confirmable.

* Surveillance is overpowered.  It&#39;s not uncommon for only 1 or 2 players to visit a player.  And this doesn&#39;t fit sheriff&#39;s theme.  Sheriff is not a tank

<p>I agree with that, window peek should just be changed so it discovers the classes that visit your target.  The current window peek doesn’t fit with the theme of observer anyways.</p>

            <p>Finding neutrals should be hard but not impossible. For example unlike the king an observer using peek early game is suspicious and the fact that he is a non-liniar Investigator means that him finding you is almost never a random check. King however had 4 checks and was practically forced to check early thus making random neut checks much more of a problem. A sheriff with unlimited neut checks worked into his main Ability would definitely be a problem. However a limited high skill Ability that MIGHT be able to find a neutral is fine.</p>

<p>That was part of it (the most serious part, yes).  But I feel that detecting neutrals was also generally bad for the game.  “NEUTS OUT” is really not a good meta when most neutrals need to survive in order to win and can be randomly detected as early as N1.</p>
<p>It also slightly decreases claimspace, which is always bad.  (Without neutral detectors, neutral claims become theoretically more reasonable because NKs have no particular reason to make them, making them less suspicious - not by very much, since there’s still reasons the BD might distrust them, but generally I think a “lynch neutrals instantly” meta is bad for the game.  In particular I feel that Alchemists getting insta-lynched is a sign something is wrong, since they’re supposed to be somewhat BD favored because they limit the Cult / Unseen’s poison / bleed.)</p>

<p>Sheriff would still be easily claimable, even more so than the old one since it can appear in both unseen and cult games.  Maybe it could be reduced to 2 or 3 uses to balance it?</p>

</aside>
<p>Trust me it would. If you make it work on BD then its OP.</p>
<p>Hear me out:</p>
<p>At the start of the game starting N4 finding some random Unseen and killing them doesn’t help too much. You are either trying to A: Find and lock down (not kill) the assassin. B: Trying to find and kill the MM or C: Trying to find and kill the NK/other neuts.</p>
<p>With this ability you could determine which unseen class someone is rather than just that they are one. It also can find NK and verify neut claims late game.</p>
<p>The idea is not to use this as your primary means of information gathering (your main ability does that job just fine) but rather to get detailed information on a possible scum. AKA this is for knowing what to do with someone who you already think is scum. The only reason why this doesn’t have unlimited uses is because then it would just be a better EI for early or late game. If 4 uses makes it too weak maybe it could be unlimited with a 1 day cooldown?</p>

            <p>Basically this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nighr Ability 2: Targeted Search - Choose a non-BD class. You will know if that is your targets class. (4 uses)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MM returns false on MM N1-3. Same for a cultist effected by brotherhood.</p>

            <p>Seriously. Finding Neuts should be difficult. Personally I’d make EI be an evil or not evil check like it is now and then have a 4 use secondary Ability then checks if someone is a specific non-BD class from a list of all of them.</p>

            <p>I propose this Sheriff Rework:</p>
<p>(Evil includes Unseen and Cult, but does not specify)</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The Sheriff</p>
<p>Blue Dragon Investigative</p>
<p>(Can be found in Unseen and Cult games, Converts to Marshal)</p>
<p><strong><em>Passives</em></strong></p>
<p>Constable: Is immune to conversion by the Mastermind until Day 3. (Can still be seen as becoming Investigative by Foresight)</p>
<p>(Slightly buffs the Cult against the Unseen in converting the Sheriff)</p>
<p><strong><em>Abilities</em></strong></p>
<p>Scout: (Day) (oo)<br>
Choose a player. You will be notified at the end of the night if they were converted.</p>
<p>Case Trial: (Day) (1)<br>
During a trial, determine if the accused player is Evil or not. Will still be affected by Frames or Mind Warps from last night.</p>
<p>Expert Investigation: (Night) (oo)<br>
Choose a player. You will see if they are Evil or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Marshal will be the most recent one, with Probe and Expose.</p>
<p>Having a Sheriff being convertible, not unique, but also with Case Trial, means that he can be fake claimed once again by Unseen and Scorned, as well as possibly Cult.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Buff the NKs then. And this is easy to fakeclaim so people won’t usually believe a sheriff claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not talking about balance.  I don’t like what neutral detectors do to the game and I don’t think they should exist.  If you want to buff Sheriffs, do it in another way, but “NEUTS OUT” is absolutely terrible for gameplay and I never want to see it return.</p>
<p><strong>Hard no</strong> on that part.  Detecting neutrals is awful, unfun, leads to boring gameplay and you haven’t even given the slightest indication of why you think it would be a good thing.  I don’t care at all how powerful or weak individual roles are - I don’t even care that much about win rates.  But detecting neutrals is horribly unfun and defeats the entire purpose of having neutral roles in the first place by encouraging mindless, stupid “NEUTS OUT” gameplay on the part of the court.</p>
<p>Remember, Unseen / Cult are part of a faction.  If you get randomly found by the Sheriff / Pally, well, your faction can still win, especially if you gave them good groundwork before getting caught.  If you’re a neutral?  You’re screwed, totally at random, and there’s nothing you can do.  That’s not interesting or fun.  No BD role should ever detect neutrals, fullstop.</p>
<p>(Obviously, though, I think Sheriff should be convertible and non-unique so they serve as claimspace for evils.  I just don’t see any advantage at all to allowing Sheriffs to detect neutrals, and I have no understanding of why you would even remotely consider adding such a terrible idea to an otherwise-workable suggestion.  We finally managed to get rid of Allies, and now you want to give it to someone else?  No.)</p>
