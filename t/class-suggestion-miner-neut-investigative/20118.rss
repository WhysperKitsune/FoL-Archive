    <title>[Class Suggestion] Miner (Neut/investigative)</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/class-suggestion-miner-neut-investigative/20118</link>
    <description>**Day Ability 1:**
**Odor** x1  - your body odor causes a commotion in the court - all chatting is silenced for 10 seconds. 

**Night Ability 1:**
**Tunnel** - listen in on target player’s whispers.
**Night Ability 2 (Optional)**
**Dig** x3 - dig a hole and go into hiding - can not be targeted this night
Lore:
Miners are rare, their goal is to play an indirect neut roll providing support for whichever faction they choose.  They seek peace and harmony within the kingdom, while avoiding confrontation, and daily tasks - they would rather work and avoid the court. 
Comments:
Victory - survive/ all killer classes have been killed

note reaper deaths would be moved POV from table in a similar manner to make it a possibility of reapers or miners in play.</description>

            <p>Odor only serves to prove the existance of the Miner, and I see no other tangible benefit. That makes it a bad claim, and therefore already a poor Neutral role.</p>
