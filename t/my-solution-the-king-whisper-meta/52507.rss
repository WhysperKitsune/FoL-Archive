    <description># Cult

Guarantee a starting Apostle, and allow Cult Spy to target the King. Also possibly increase usage to 4, so it can be used a bit later in the game as well.

# Unseen

Give Mastermind the following ability:

&gt; Day Ability: Covert Spy: The Unseen will hear all whispers to and from the King today. 2 uses.

This way any attempt to mass whisper claim will lead to the evils knowing any information whispered, thus making people nervous to whisper to the King.</description>

            <p>Don’t forget. As MM you now have all the claims. Sure your assassin is behind but you remain ahead. Have your Assassin suicide accuse and then convert whatever you need from the claims you got.</p>
<p>Loosing your starting assassin is worth learning everyone’s claims.</p>

            <p>With the Mastermind thing, all Unseen can hear and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>And even with Apostle, you secure a good claim for yourself.</p>

            <p>That’s correct, but if the whispers occur D2, they are only shared N2, and evil are a day behind even prepping their claims AT ALL, AND at the same time they have to check with each other so as to not have contradictory claims among themselves.  The time presume is very high on evil to get that done before d3, and they will already be susp for NOT having claimed D2.</p>
<p>If they did whisper a claim d2, your proposed change does not change anything as you intend.</p>

            <p>If you know who claimed what, you can avoid having your claim in a set that is impossible, like 3 Knights.</p>
<p>And it will prevent important classes like Prince from telling king their class at all.</p>

            <p>How does that counter the king having a list of claims and simply selecting the CCs to put up for exe?  Potentially, there are about 6 methods to process CCs: in court, by prince, by king exe, by knight CS, by alch yolo, and by inquisitor by night 2.</p>
<p>This change just wouldn’t work.  Evil have only just had the chance to share the info they learned at that point.  The player might not have even finished transcribing it themselves.</p>
<p>Put another way, they know who is claiming which role, but given they took part in the whispers and submitted a claim, knowing what the claims are won’t keep them from being selected by the king’s CC method, nor can their claim evolve according to who dies when.</p>
<p>Anyone who stalls from whispering would be susp, because it would become obvious they were waiting to find out what info was whisped the king d2/3.  We see that now in the current whisper meta:  “X didn’t whisper me a claim - vote them up!”</p>
