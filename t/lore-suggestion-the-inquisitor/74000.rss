&lt;div align=center&gt;

&lt;big&gt;**Call of the Inquisition**&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

----


Our scouts in the [CONFIDENTIAL] area of [CONFIDENTIAL] have informed us of the presence of heresy.

Just as the Lord once commanded his servant to strike down the idol, we call upon you now to banish these demons from the land of [CONFIDENTIAL]. Only once these Heathens are gone may the land be free from corruption.

As King [CONFIDENTIAL] and Queen [CONFIDENTIAL] have stated, you are under no necessity to eliminate anyone else, but may do so in order to keep your cover. The Lord will judge them for their actions.

These demons have been reported to be steadfast in their resistance to convert. Thus, I have deemed, their lives forfeit. You may use any means necessary to eliminate them.

May the Lord be with you in all your struggles.

**Attached to this document are the known occupations of these villains.**

* ~~A Leader of a Local Cult. Has been reported to own idols of false gods.~~
* ~~A Physician. Known Protestant.~~
* ~~A Noble. Has been publicly heard testifying against the Church’s practices.~~</description>
