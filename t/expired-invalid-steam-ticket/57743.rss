    <title>Expired/Invalid Steam Ticket</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/expired-invalid-steam-ticket/57743</link>
    <description>I signed on to Steam, Throne Of Lies began to auto update. Once it finished, I opened the game. It came to the login screen with my previous account name &quot;LoraBorealis&quot; (On Sunday, I changed my name in game to &quot;AndJelly&quot;). When I select &quot;Sign-In with One-click&quot; (My only real option) - it then says &quot;Expired/Invalid Steam Ticket&quot;. 

My steam is up to date, I legally purchased the game myself, it wasn&#39;t gifted to me - so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s happening because &quot;LoraBorealis&quot; doesn&#39;t match the &quot;AndJelly&quot; that I changed my name to?

If that is the error - do I have to try and change my Steam name - or can you revert my in-game name, as I&#39;d like my Steam to remain the same (I think it costs money to change, which I&#39;d like to avoid).

Any help you can provide would be much appreciated! I stream ToL and would like to be able to play! :slight_smile:

            <p>It’s a steam issue. Steam API is offline. Nothing we can do, just wait for them to get it back up. Join our discord to get notifications about it @ <a href="https://discord.gg/tol" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://discord.gg/tol</a></p>
