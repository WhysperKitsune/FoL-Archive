    <title>Incorrect message about result from physician night ability</title>
    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/incorrect-message-about-result-from-physician-night-ability/80180</link>
    <description>#### What happened?
I played phys and when I healed a guy game said that I was redirected to myself, but healed another guy. See screenshot: I&#39;m 5 (phys), tried to heal 8, but redirected to myself and healed 9 (according to in-game message). 9 confirmed heal.
![bug|690x388](upload://b3UVwLG3r4womVmgzkkfskUNyEj.jpeg)

#### What was SUPPOSED to happen?
I guess message was supposed to tell me that I was redirected to 9, not to myself.

#### Steps to reproduce:
I don&#39;t know how exactly this happened since that was cult game and i didn&#39;t know how cullt players used their abilities at night. This could be a result of several redirections from cw / drunk / ritualist / invoker. Also I was heathen (I don&#39;t know if this is important).

#### Comments:
This happened today (patch 2.5b)</description>

            <p>Good idea.<br>
You were redirected to someone, someone is Unseen! Nice lead, let’s exe someone.<br>
So all cw and drunks would be even more evil then unseen themselves.</p>

            <p>What if we kept this for balance reasons.</p>
<p>Like you knew you were redirected, but not to who.</p>

            <p>The “you were redirected to yourself” feedback is a visual bug. You were simply redirected to 9.</p>
