    <title>New Keywords and References suggestion (QoL)</title>
    <link>https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/new-keywords-and-references-suggestion-qol/79937</link>
    <description>Basically, the Current use of Keywords, while decent, should be expanded a bit. Here is my suggestions:

# New Keywords

* **Investigate** - Refers to Abilities that are used to gather information about the target. Does not imply any specific mechanics by itself but can have special interactions. Used by: Maid, Observer, Princess, Sheriff, Paladin, Duchess (bat eyelashes), Handmaiden, Marshal, Mastermind (foresight), Nightwatch, Seeker, Starting Evil King (Allies), Inquisitor, Pretender. Referenced by: Frame keyword, Tailor Keyword (more on that)
* **Tailor** - Makes a player appear as a member of the **Blue Dragon** to **Investigative** abilities. Used by: Mastermind (In the Shadows), Duchess (Dark Wisp), Timesnatcher (Dark Dimension), Ritualist (Brotherhood). Not referenced. 

# New Keyword References
* Defend (Knight): Current - &quot;Defend target player, trading your life to kill their attackers. You and anyone you kill, will be unhealable&quot; -&gt; New - &quot;Defend target player. If anyone tries to **Attack** them you and any attackers will die. Any deaths caused this way bypass death immunity and are unhealable&quot; 

Note: Current wording implies you will be unhealible even if the target is not attacked, since the ability does not contain a conditional statement anywhere. 

* Reap (Reaper): Current - *unhealable, **Reap** target player, Killing them and leaving behind an empty body for 1 day&quot; -&gt; New - &quot;**Attack** target player with an unhealable strike. If successful you will **Reap** their soul, acquiring it and leaving behind an empty body for 1 day&quot;

Note: Current wording implies that Reap is not an attack and does not specify that you gain a soul by using the ability (while it is implied, it&#39;s important enough to be spelled out explicitly). 

Will add to this as I come up with anything else.</description>

<p>Sorry I don’t think I’ve ever heard this as a keyword and I don’t think it would stick. How about “Deframe” or “Conceal”?</p>
