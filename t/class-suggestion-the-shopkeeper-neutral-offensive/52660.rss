    <description>**The Shopkeeper** - Neutral Offensive
Goal: Gather 200 Gold.

**Passives:**

- **Savings:** Every time you successfully sell something (your night ability works) you get 50 gold. However, if you don&#39;t sell anything (your night ability fails), you lose 50 gold instead. You can&#39;t get negative gold. Shopkeeper starts with 50 gold. By gathering 200 gold, you win the game. After a victory, you can keep playing but all your night abilities are disabled. 

- **I&#39;m just selling things:** Immune to death at night once. Immune to target changing and occupation. 

**Day Abilities:**

- **Bribery:** Force a player to visit you tonight. Works similar to Drunk&#39;s debauch. Costs 50 gold and the payment is given back at the end of the night to you if you successfully force your target to visit you. Choosen target will not know about the target change.

- **Placeholder Job:** If you&#39;re out of gold, this ability is available to use. Makes you unable to do anything tonight and gives you 50 gold at the end of the following night. You will hide from any visiting you player that night.

**Night Abilities:**

- **Fake Potion:** You will sell _Fake Potion_. This will occupy any visiting you player. Ignores occupy immunity. If this ability fails (No visitors), you will lose 50 gold. If you successfully sell at least one _Fake Potion_, you will get 50 gold (per person) instead. Cannot be used if you have no gold left.

- **Confusion Potion:** You will sell _Confusion Potion_. This will cause any visiting you players to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities. If this ability fails (No visitors), you will lose 50 gold. If you successfully sell at least one _Confusion Potion_, you will get 50 gold (per person) instead. Cannot be used if you have no gold left.

**Comments:**
Basically i wanted to make a Neutral Offensive class, since we currently lack this kind of &quot;combo&quot; in the game. I don&#39;t know if this class is balanced or good at all, so i&#39;d like to hear your opinions about it and what should i change or add.</description>

            <p>Day one: I’m prince please heal/guard/follow me.<br>
Night one: Confusion Potion<br>
Day two: thanks for guards, guard again please<br>
Night two: Fake Potion</p>
<p>gg you win. Or just out as shopkeeper and ask phys/knight to keep guarding you until you win or someone is poisoned/bleeding and you’ll vote BD(especially bleeding as cult does mostly nothing N1 and N2). Seems too easy to win IMO.</p>

            <p>I made him Offensive not Support or Social because his abilities are mostly about disrupting other people’s abilities like Butler or Drunk and not about supporting like Alch or Phys does.</p>
<p>He has Drunk’s debauch that is a day ability, he has Butler’s Concentrated Wine (Party) that occupies anyone visiting them while also ignoring occupy immunity.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to put under a second night ability so i just made a thing that would count as “Offensive” the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Confusion Potion: You will sell Confusion Potion. This will cause any visiting you players to receive incorrect feedback from their abilities. If this ability fails (No visitors), you will lose 50 gold. If you successfully sell at least one Confusion Potion, you will get 50 gold (per person) instead. Cannot be used if you have no gold left.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So it gives incorrect feedback but only to people who visit you?</p>
