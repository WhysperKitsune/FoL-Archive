    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve got some more free time now and have decided I&#39;d like to design a SFM or mash now, but I&#39;m requesting help. I&#39;m going to do something fire emblem, either from one of the older continents or from three houses which im getting on launch in four days. I&#39;m familiar with lore but have no idea how to do anything right mechanically. If any current host would ever be willing to mentor/help co-design something with me, that would be appreciated, thanks.</description>

            <p>Id be willing to help, since I love me some fire emblem (Blue Lions btw), not the greatest at designing these since I havent really finished the one I have slowly working on, but if u need ideas, a fresh set of eyes, or maybe some more help on it I can certainly try my best, to help ya</p>

<p>I can’t, because I’m busy with other things unfortunately.</p>
<p>You can also start and see where it gets, because it gets reviewed anyways, so any changes could be done then. <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
