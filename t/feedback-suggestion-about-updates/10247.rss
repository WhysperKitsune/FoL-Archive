    <link>https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/feedback-suggestion-about-updates/10247</link>
    <description>So I haven&#39;t played since just before 1.0.6 patch was released so there&#39;s a lot of changes that have happened.

I want to say thank you for all the work into balancing and adding features, So much has been done and i love all of it. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any class that is unreasonable, boring or useless anymore.


So i have got 1 suggestion that was just something i was a lil disappointed at when i saw which was the fact that all my gold that i spent over 80 hours getting doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore as you can just buy it in a click of a button. Now I&#39;m all for cosmetic micro-transactions so my suggestion is to have a separate shop and currency with cooler things in that you can buy with micro-transactions while leaving the regular items as they were. I remember being in a lobby a while ago and people were exited (including myself) to slowly get all the items in the shop but now its kinda meh. I would at-least like some other form of long term goal that someone else cant just get instantly.

Ideas for the hypothetical micro-transaction shop could be hats, special effects around your character, jewelry,special fonts,coloured names,unique looking player models,Dying/Killing unique SFX among additional weapons and armour. 
(I realise you are just a small team, I am just spit balling here)</description>

            <p>Yes, I am in agreement that adding some stuff that can’t be bought is a great idea.</p>

            <p>having rare item chancing in certain scenarios could be a good addition to any model but i wouldn’t put the idea of skin crates on the table. I get that some people want anything to be possible to obtain but to me it makes everything you get seem worthless and meaningless. CSGO is different in many ways but to me I don’t care about the skins as my goal is to rank up and improve but in ToL there’s nothing else to achieve, its only gold and cosmetics.</p>

            <p>Oh I see, Well i can only speak for myself so I’m not sure what others think of either systems but I hope if he keeps it like this that there is just something that i can work towards like even a leveling system where the levels mean/do nothing and its just a number that cant be bought.</p>

            <p>I personally like CS GO’s model, where all cosmetic can be earned in game, but some of them are really rare, and you can literally buy the rare ones if you want.</p>
<p>But tbh, as long as it only effects cosmetic, i don’t really care what the devs do lol</p>
<p>I only consider it shady when the devs sell gameplay advantages, and i really doubt those devs would do that.</p>

            <p>No, I understand.</p>
<p>It’s just that I’ve been discussing the potential merits of a split-currency system with Xblade for a while (I don’t particularly care which way they go, personally), who has always stood by the idea that all in-game items, even if they are cosmetic-only, will continue to be earnable through in-game actions alongside being purchased. This is assumed to be a consumer-friendly move, and given the backlash against Town of Salem switching to a split-currency move it’s hard to disagree (although I will note that much of that criticism is misplaced).</p>
<p>Yet here comes a consumer arguing that what is assumed to be the most consumer-friendly option is actually detrimental to their enjoyment of the game and asking for the alternative system.</p>
<p>I find the whole situation quite amusing.</p>
