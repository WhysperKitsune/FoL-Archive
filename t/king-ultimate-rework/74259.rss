<p>What about a tribute-like ability, where King can transfer uses of limited-use abilities from one player (with their permission) to another?</p>
<p>This would be beneficial to all King’s regardless of faction, although maybe not to the extent necessary. The donors &amp; recipients would decide exactly which ability to tribute / receive a use of.  So that nobody but the player themselves would know whether the tribute use was a day, night, good, or evil ability.</p>
<p>Or how about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Census (Night Ability - 2 uses)</strong>: Learn the number of living Blue Dragon players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><s>Or even something crazy like, delete Mystic and give “Link Minds” to King.</s></p>

<p>No.  If Poss wants to SAFELY be King he needs to get elected, no shortcut.</p>

            <p>/Semi Support</p>
<p>I hate order execute personally as a king ability, there isn’t need for a second prince and I feel like there are already enough killing abilities OE never really worked with king hence it getting removed, still be better then allies lmao.</p>
<p>But I really like the king point change it’s so annoying that king is forced to point to up claims when it should be up to the BD to decide if it’s ek trying to dunk a powerful class or not. instead of being sheeps.</p>

            <p>Yep hunter is social, you need to learn classes in order to use wolf efficiently, and in order to use Hunter’s Mark efficiently you need to learn sus classes, and learn player’s classes in order to protect them. Note I wasn’t saying hunter was social I was saying in order to play Hunter well you need to  be social.</p>
<p>Also Little bird does nothing except telling unseen classes to convert, and that’s it. BTW OE is a good ability idk what you did with OE but OE is too scare evil’s, besides it works with little bird what do bd do now anyway claim out loud, so wouldn’t evil’s know anyway? So it doesn’t help any issues.  it can also be used in order to frame player’s evil king could say “I attacked 6 last night they were immune” and then bd would “sheep” and up them get them exed. OE can be countered  making sure you don’t look too sus, so as long as you are interactive up evils  you should be fine/</p>

            <p>Have you been around the game ever since OE or allies?</p>
<p>OE created a problem meta where “you don’t claim to king you die” scenario. King is not a killer class and never should be.</p>
<p>I hate allies too, mind you. But unless you have a miracle problem which hasn’t been done before, feel free to share. Whispering can’t be the solution anymore due to little birds. It isn’t a barrier, you can claim if you want, but you’re mostly likely gonna get converted afterwards.</p>
<p>hunter is social ahahahah ahahaha.</p>

            <p>Well there is cult games were there is a possibility of no apostle, and little bird is more like a barrier then an out right new meta. Allies doesn’t work never has, never will do, it’s basically a stronger sheriff, which is already pretty strong. The main reason is to make king more like new hunter in which he has to be social and take risks.</p>

            <p>2 words.</p>
<p>Little birds.</p>
<p>Nobody’s claiming to king anymore. Therefore he needs to do something on his own to help himself.</p>
