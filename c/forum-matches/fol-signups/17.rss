<p><em><strong>Dungeon Master is a turn-based proxy fighter royale… or something.</strong></em></p>
<h2>

Each player will spawn in a different grid with a preset loot pool.</h2>

<h2>
<a name="movement-4" class="anchor" href="#movement-4"></a>Movement</h2>
<p>Each round, you may choose to move 1 tile in any direction, including diagonally. You may also choose to stay in your current grid for another go at your loot pool. Every round, player locations will be shown on the map.</p>
<p><strong>ALL ACTIONS CAN BE LOCKED AND WOULD BE MASSIVELY APPRECIATED BY THE HOST IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PROCESSING SPEED.</strong></p>
<h2>
<a name="looting-5" class="anchor" href="#looting-5"></a>Looting</h2>
<p>After you move to your tile, you will have a chance to loot your tile. There are four different types of items; Physical, Magical, Defensive, and Support, as well as four different tiers; Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary. You will be able to submit three looting actions by default.</p>
<p>The center squares of the 4x4 and 3x3 maps will have higher tiered loot than the outskirts on average, while the corners will have the lowest tiered loot.</p>
<p>Rooms will be made if there is more than a single player on a tile in order for the tile to chat. There will also be a main thread active at all times.</p>
<h2>
<a name="equipment-6" class="anchor" href="#equipment-6"></a>Equipment</h2>
<p>Each player will start out with 4 Champions; A Gladiator, a Rogue, a Healer, and a Mage. You will be told which items you have looted from your square, and at this point, you can now equip your items to your Champions. Gladiators and Rogues have an affinity for Physical items, Mages and Healers have an affinity for Magical items, and Rogues and Healers have an affinity for Support items.</p>
<p>Defensive items are broken up into Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Heavy Armor. Only Gladiators can equip Heavy Armor. Healers can not equip Medium Armor.</p>
<p>Each character can equip 2 of any combination of Physical, Magical, and Support items, and 1 Defensive Item.</p>
<h2>
<a name="battling-7" class="anchor" href="#battling-7"></a>Battling</h2>
<p>Gladiators are strong against Mages, Mages are strong against Rogues, and Rogues are strong against Gladiators. All 3 are strong against Healers, but if a Healer is in the fight, their partner becomes strong against both other types of fighters. If two Healers are in the fight, their effect cancels out. Players will get told who is on their tile, their living Champions, as well as the Champions’ health. They will then fight in 2v2 fights with their Champions.*</p>
<p>Gladiators start with 100 health, Mages and Rogues start with 85 health, and Healers start with 80 health. Champions who are strong against another Champion will deal 1.25x damage to that Champion type, and will take 0.8x damage from that Champion type. The Healer passive will negate any opposing teams’ strengths against their partner.</p>
<p>Players will then submit 4 rounds of actions, or a ‘set’, for each character they pick. Character affinities will multiply their respective items’ effects by 1.25x. This stacks additively with strengths rather than multiplicatively.**</p>
<p>If there is only a single player on a tile, instead of a battle phase, they will instead be able to loot a single extra item.</p>
<p>*If there are 3 players on a tile, then they will engage in two separate 2v2 battles. If there are 4 players on a tile, they will be split randomly into single 2v2 battles. This pattern will continue for all odd/even pairings.</p>
<p>**This means that a Gladiator with a Physical weapon would do 1.5x damage to a Mage rather than 1.5625x damage, for example.</p>
<h2>
<a name="actions-8" class="anchor" href="#actions-8"></a>Actions</h2>
<p>There are four types of actions; Attack, Heal, Support, and Evade. Only Healers can Heal. Gladiators can not choose to Support. For each type of Attack action, you must also submit a preference list of what type of character you would like to attack. Evasion will halve the damage you receive from a turn.</p>
<p>For example, a set from a Gladiator could look like:</p>
<p>Attack [Healer, Mage, Gladiator, Rogue]<br>
Attack [Healer, Mage, Gladiator, Rogue]<br>
Evade<br>
Attack [Gladiator, Healer, Mage, Rogue]</p>
<h2>
<a name="calculations-9" class="anchor" href="#calculations-9"></a>Calculations</h2>
<p>Attacks will be calculated starting with a 2d10 for Gladiators, a 3d8 for Rogues, a 4d5 for Mages, and a 1d10 for Healers, and then weapon bonuses will be added (and listed with the item when you pick it up.) After that, Defensive bonuses will be calculated based on the Defensive stat of the item, and then finally, Strength modifiers will be added to get the final damage.</p>
<p>Critical Hits are achieved when you roll the highest number for your base attack (10 for Gladiators, 8 for Rogues, 5 for Mages, and 10 for Healers), and do double the damage.</p>
<p>For example, a Mage attack against a Rogue could look like:</p>
<p>Attack [4, 2, 1, 10] = 17<br>
+1d8 Item [5] = 22<br>
+1d8 Item [3] = 25<br>
Opponent Defense 1d10 [9] = 16<br>
Strength Boost [16x1.25] = 20</p>
<p>This would do 20 damage against a Rogue.<br>
Numbers will be rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>Only Healers have access to the Heal move. This Healing will be done based on a 1d20, and can go above the original health cap up to 150%, and then item bonuses will be accounted for. Healers can heal either themselves or their partner.</p>
<p>Health stats will be updated at the end of a turn based on the cumulative health total. So, if a Rogue with 10 health takes 15 damage, but is then healed for 20, they will survive with 15 health.</p>
<p>It is up to the players whether they want to have this be hosted on Forums or on Discord. Both options have pros and cons for me, but will probably not effect gameplay.</p>
<h2>
<a name="deathslosing-10" class="anchor" href="#deathslosing-10"></a>Deaths/Losing</h2>
<p>Whenever a Champion ends a turn with less than 1 Health, they will die. A player loses and is out of the game when all 4 of their Champions die.</p>
<p>In the event that no players die within, like, a reasonable amount of turns due to intentional avoidance, the host reserves the right to just fucking nuke people lol</p>

Example Rolecards</summary>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="green">Vanilla Crewmate</font></h1>
<p>You have no special abilities of your own, but can vote and talk freely.</p>
<p><em>You win when all threats to the crewmates have been eliminated and there is at least one crewmate player alive.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="red">Fortnite</font></h1>
<p>Your partners are [x] and [y]. You may talk to them during the day and night.<br>
During the day, you must submit a list of 3 players, which can change throughout the day. At the start of night, the list is made public in-thread; if the Impostors choose to nightkill, the target must be one from the list.</p>
<p><em>You win when at least half of the living players are fortnite, or when nothing can prevent this from happening.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="brown">Impostor</font></h1>
<p>Your partner is [x]. You may talk to them during the day and night. You also have a factional kill which must target a non-Impostor player. However, the target must be one from the list posted in-thread (if there is no list, then you may choose freely). If a day ends in No Execution, then this factional kill becomes mandatory.</p>
<p><em>You win when at least half of the living players are impostors and at least crewmate role remains, or if you obtain full majority, or when nothing can prevent this from happening.</em></p>

<li>Fortnite or Impostors win if they obtain a full majority of living players, or if they make up half <em>and</em> at least one Crewmate role is still alive.</li>
<li>If Fortnite and Impostors ever make up equal numbers, with no Crewmate roles left alive, then Fortnite wins. Fortnite also wins if a day phase begins with one Fortnite, one Impostor, and one Crewmate.</li>

            <p><em>Going to the police was a mistake. A shifty figure has been following you for blocks, and you swear people on the street are taking notes as you pass by. You hide around a corner waiting for an ambush, only to see that shifty figure speeding off in an Aston Martin. An old war buddy calls in a favor to look up the license, and… no. No no no no no, how high does this go? The Reds don’t have this kind of influence, not yet, who’s behind this? That’s when you hear the knock.</em><br>

<summary>
Character List</summary>
<p>Character just means role; the character types are Townsfolk, Outsider, Minion, and Demon.<br>
Townsfolk and Outsiders are good-aligned to start, Minions and the Demon are evil-aligned to start.  There are no neutral parties in Ravenswood Bluff.<br>
[Brackets] denote abilities upon setup; for example, if it says [+1 Outsider], then I replace 1 Townsfolk with 1 Outsider.</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorstebluetownsfolkcolor-5" class="anchor" href="#colorstebluetownsfolkcolor-5"></a><font color="steblue">Townsfolk</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Wiretap</strong></font> - You are 1 of 2 wiretap characters, but do not know which.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Domestic Wiretap</strong> - You start knowing two allied players. When they both die, you learn their characters tonight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Foreign Wiretap</strong> - You start knowing two opposing players. When you die, you learn the Evil character tonight.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Double Agent</strong></font> - The Demon sees you instead of a Minion. That Minion recieves no starting information.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Sleeper</strong></font> - You think you are an in-play Minion, and neither of you recieve starting information. If you are “mad” about being the Sleeper, you learn the in-play Demon tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Jurist</strong></font> - Each night, choose a player and learn their character. Good living players register falsely to you.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Freelancer</strong></font> - Each night, choose a Good character. You learn that it is 1 of 2 players, if in play. If not in play, you recieve arbitrary info tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Blacklister</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a character (not yours, not a Traveller). You learn its nearest Evil character, if in play. If not in play, you recieve arbitrary info tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Black Ops</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn if you whispered the Demon today.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Populist</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn a character who was “mad” about being the Populist today.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Diplomat</strong></font> - Each day, you may whisper the storyteller with two other players (not Travellers, different from yesterday) &amp; broker a deal between them. If either player breaks the deal, they malfunction until dawn.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Eavesdropper</strong></font> - Each day, you may visit the Storyteller to learn something about each player you whispered today, in no particular order.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Symbologist</strong></font> - You have 3 Townsfolk abilities, but 1 malfunctions. You also register as the functioning Townsfolk.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Truther</strong></font> - If you die at night, choose a character and learn all players with that character.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Ambassador</strong></font> - You are immune to all abilities and do not count towards the number of living players. One Good player starts knowing the Ambassador is in play.</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorsteblueoutsiderscolor-6" class="anchor" href="#colorsteblueoutsiderscolor-6"></a><font color="steblue">Outsiders</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Libertine</strong></font> - You start holding a Drunk character token. Each night (but not the first), it moves to a player the holder whispered today. You think you are a Townsfolk until the Drunk token moves.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Drunk character is an Outsider with the ability “You do not know you are the Drunk. You<br>
think you are a Townsfolk, but your ability malfunctions.” It cannot start in play. Note that the Demon is still the Demon, even if they are holding this token.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Activist</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), a player dies unless a living player was “mad” about being the Activist today (even if you are dead.)<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>MAD-Man</strong></font> - Each night, choose another living player (not a Traveler) to hold the football. If the holder is executed, you drop The Bomb and lose (even if dead).<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Sympathizer</strong></font> - A Townsfolk is Evil and registers as a Defector, but does not know. You have their ability, and the Demon knows them.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Defector” is a character. (Ex: Jurist can see somebody as a Defector). It doesn’t actually have any ability, because you can only register as one, and it cannot be in-play.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="colorredminionscolor-7" class="anchor" href="#colorredminionscolor-7"></a><font color="red">Minions</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Agitprop</strong></font> - - Each night, choose a player and a statement. Tomorrow, if that player is “mad” about denying that statement, they might be executed.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Templar</strong></font> - If you nominate a Good player you did not whisper today and they are executed, Evil wins.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Chairman</strong></font> - Once per game at night (but not the first), choose an Outsider player: they swap characters and alignments with the Demon. [+1 Outsider]<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Brainwasher</strong></font> - Townsfolk might recieve the incorrect character in setup (their abilities work normally).</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorreddemonscolor-8" class="anchor" href="#colorreddemonscolor-8"></a><font color="red">Demons</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Comitern</strong></font> -  Each Comintern knows one other Comintern. Each night (but not the first), a Comintern might die. Evil wins only when all Good players are dead. You register as a Minion too. [Most players are Comintern]<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Draconis</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a character: if in play, that player dies and an Evil player becomes their character. If not in play, a player dies.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Seclorum</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn the character of everyone you whispered today, then choose a player: they die.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Kabal</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a player: they die. If you win, if an Outsider was most responsible for their team losing, they switch teams and win with you. [+1 Outsider]</p>

<summary>
Travellers</summary>
<p>Travelers are special and powerful characters with different rules than normal citizens.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Traveler characters are publicly known.</strong> If a player joins the game as the United Nations, for example, everyone knows that they are the United Nations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traveler alignments are unknown.</strong> Because Traveler characters are known, the question regarding them becomes which side they’re playing for. Travelers are more likely to be good than evil; general practice is that one in three Travelers is evil, but it is possible for there to be only one Traveler in a game and that Traveler to be evil. Evil Travelers will be told who the Demon is when they enter play; Good Travelers will be told nothing. The Demon and Minions will not be told if a Traveler is good or evil.<br>
Note that if the Comitern is in play, Evil Travellers will only be told so, and will not be told any Comitern.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traveler players may join or leave the game at any time.</strong> This game is designed for live play, and the Travelers are designed to accommodate players who arrive late or must leave early. If you would like to play, but cannot join at game start or do not think that you can stay around for the end of the game, then you may consider playing as a Traveler character instead of a normal citizen. However, I will not allow Traveler players to sub out (since the nature of their character is designed for them to simply leave if they cannot play), and if a Traveler player has left the game, they may not rejoin later. I will additionally ask that players who would consider joining as Travelers after the game has started notify me of this before the start of the game; I will compile a list of these potential Travelers and people not on this list by the start of the game will not be allowed to join as a Traveler. If a player wishes to join an in-progress game as a Traveler, I may bar them from choosing certain characters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travelers with a night ability act before any citizens.</strong> Their abilities will be resolved absolutely first.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travelers are not executed; they are exiled.</strong> An exile is different from an execution in a few key ways.<br>
-An exile is not considered an execution, meaning that a game can see the exile of a Traveler and an execution in the same day.<br>
-An exile is not affected by any abilities affecting nomination, voting or execution.<br>
-An exile may be called for at any time, by anyone, even if that player is presently unable to nominate, and a player who calls for the exile of a Traveler may still nominate if they have not already.<br>
-Dead players may vote on the exile of a Traveler, and they do not spend their ghost vote to do so.<br>
-And finally, a simple majority vote is all that is required to exile a Traveler. However, I will houserule that no more than one exile may occur per day.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Traveller Characters</summary>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Presi</font><font color="red">dent</font></strong> - You may privately veto your exile unless the majority of 3 different character types voted for your exile.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Celeb</font><font color="red">rity</font></strong> - Each night (but not the first), until dusk, a player who was “mad” about everything you said today acts twice.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Inter</font><font color="red">pol</font></strong> - If the player you nominate is executed, everyone you whispered today may visit the Storyteller tommorow to learn something about that player.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">United</font> <font color="red">Nations</font></strong> - If all living players vote to ratify you, you run nominations from now on, and you may change the nomination and voting rules, excepte on yourself.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Spym</font><font color="red">aster</font></strong> - Each day, choose a player: if they agree, you learn their character tonight, then their character changes.</p>
</details>

<summary>
Town Composition</summary>
<p>This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the composition of the game at each possible player count.</p>
<p>Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons</p>
<p>5: 3/0/1/1<br>
6: 3/1/1/1<br>

<p>Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Wiretaps at the start, for example).</p>

<summary>
Phase Length</summary>
<p>Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.</p>
<p>12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.<br>
24 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, <strong>and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.</strong><br>
12 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.</p>
<p>The night phase will last for 24 hours, or until all abilities have been performed and resolved.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Storyteller</summary>
<p>Storyteller</p>
<p>The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.<br>
Also, the thing the Storyteller uses to keep track of things is called the Grimoire. It’s basically the spreadsheet.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Fabled</summary>
<p>The Fabled aren’t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters we may be using can be found below.</p>
<p><font color="gold"><strong>Angel</strong></font> : Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Buddhist</strong></font> : Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Hell’s Librarian</strong></font> : Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Fiddler</strong></font>: Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Deus Ex Fiasco</strong></font>: Once per game, the storyteller will make a mistake, correct it and publicly admit to it.</p>
<p>If you want any of these added, ping me in signup thread (before game) or in classcard (during game).</p>

<details>
<summary>
The Bomb (IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ)</summary>
<p><font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> is a fabled character that is always in play this game. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>If two players (dead or alive) agree to drop the bomb, and at least one is Good, Evil wins. If Comintern is in play, Good wins instead. If both are Evil, Good wins.</strong><br>
(Note that Kabal cannot make an outsider switch teams via dropping the Bomb.)</p>
<p>The only reason to ever drop <strong><font color="maroon">The Bomb</font></strong> as Good is if you believe Comitern is in play.<br>
<strong>I will prevent any attempts to drop <font color="maroon">The Bomb</font> out of intent to gamethrow.</strong><br>
Also, if necessary, I will timegate <strong><font color="maroon">The Bomb</font></strong> to a certain day, depending on playercount.</p>
<p>If you want to drop <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font>, do it like this:</p>
<p><strong>I would like to drop <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> with @[name] <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong><br>
then both of you will either say<br>
<strong>I turn the key <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong> (if both players do this, <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> will be dropped)<br>
or<br>
<strong>I do not turn the key <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong> (if at least one player does this, <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> will not be dropped)</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Scum Info</summary>
<p>On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Malfunctioning &amp; Registration</summary>
<p>The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the class is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning class’ ability simply does not have any effect.</p>
<p>You may also see experienced players refer to malfunctioning as “drunkness”, “poisoning”, or “droison”.</p>
<p>Registration causes a player to “appear” a certain way (for most purposes). For example, if the Jurist picks a good living player, then they learn something they are not. If you pick a character that the Symbologist has a functioning ability of, then you can learn the Symbologist, etc etc etc.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Madness</summary>
<p>Certain character abilities in this script reference a status known as “madness”. What madness means, in the simplest terms, is that when a player is “mad” about something, they are trying to convince the other players that it is true, even if it is not (especially if it is not). Ultimately, the Storyteller is the one who judges whether the “mad” player’s efforts are sufficient to avoid punishment (or to obtain a reward!), but this allows the Storyteller to be more lenient toward players who are unfamiliar with the concept, and by the same token, to expect more from an experienced player.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Nominations and Voting</summary>
<p>Voting in this game works a little differently. After the formal discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will declare that nominations are opened. A player must be nominated before they can be voted on. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day. When a nomination is opened, the storyteller will begin to count votes. Votes may be precast, and may be altered so long as they are considered not to be locked in. A vote is locked in when everyone between the accused and the voter (going down the list from the accused) has locked in their vote, or once the day ends, assuming that not all votes on the nomination have been cast. Any votes that are not counted at EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players, and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. There isn’t such a thing as a quickhammer around here; we’re a little more careful with what we do.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Whispers (DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL, PLEASE READ)</summary>
<p>Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper publicly.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may send up to 15 words to your neighbors without having to announce a whisper. <strong>These do not count as a whisper for the purposes of abilities.</strong></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Death</summary>
<p>When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of things. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Victory</summary>
<p>Good wins by eliminating all Demons (you don’t need to kill Minions to win). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (even if both players are good). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain character abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the character list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win at the same time), Good wins.</p>

<h2>
<a name="roles-3" class="anchor" href="#roles-3"></a>Roles</h2>
<p>All players will be randomly assigned a card. This card will say your role. These roles are between <font color="CYAN"><strong>Commoner</strong></font>, <font color="RED"><strong>Sacrifice</strong></font>, <font color="LIME"><strong>Sage</strong></font> and <font color="YELLOW"><strong>Keymaster</strong></font>. If you reveal your role (Or fake one in the chat) Please quote it in your classcard as I will leave a list of claims in a post at the start of every trial.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="CYAN"><strong>Commoner</strong></font> is a basic role. If you have this role, you’re just a basic player during that round, and all you do is vote and discuss.</li>
<li>
<font color="RED"><strong>Sacrifice</strong></font> is a special role. If you have this role, you will die at the end of the main game unless you are voted by the majority. If you are voted by the majority, you will escape with a victory while also granting victory a player of your choosing, chosen publicly. You will have an extra vote on yourself for the 2nd stage of the main game.</li>
<li>
<font color="LIME"><strong>Sage</strong></font> is a role where you know who the <font color="YELLOW"><strong>Keymaster</strong></font> is when you get it, due to it’s Clairyovant ability. Using this role could be tactical, however, claiming this role may get you killed due to not being the <font color="RED"><strong>Sacrifice</strong></font>.</li>
<li>
<font color="YELLOW"><strong>Keymaster</strong></font> is a role where if you are voted by the majority. All players who have not won already will lose the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="phases-4" class="anchor" href="#phases-4"></a>Phases:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alliance phase:</strong> This is 24 hour period before every main game. Every player gets to talk to other players before they recieve their card. They can plan out as much as they want to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Main Game Stage 1:</strong> You will decide the majority -2 of the players to place onto the chopping block vote during <strong>Main Game Stage 2</strong> (so, for example, if there are 12 players alive, Majority is 7. 7-2 is 5, so 5 players would go on the chopping block). This phase lasts 24 hours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Main Game Stage 2:</strong> you will decide based on the players who were elected to die, who you will kill. Be careful of the <font color="red"><strong>Sacrifice</strong></font> however, as if they are voted, they will pick a player to win with them and win the game. Claiming your role during this phase, especially if you aren’t on the stand, is a perfect time to claim.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="winloss-conditions-5" class="anchor" href="#winloss-conditions-5"></a>Win/loss conditions.</h2>
<h3>
<a name="you-will-win-if-6" class="anchor" href="#you-will-win-if-6"></a>You will win if:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are voted out as the <strong><font color="red">Sacrifice</font></strong>, or chosen by them to win with them.</li>
<li>You are one of the last 4 players alive</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="you-will-lose-if-7" class="anchor" href="#you-will-lose-if-7"></a>You will lose if:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are voted out as <font color="CYAN"><strong>Commoner</strong></font>, <font color="LIME"><strong>Sage</strong></font> or <font color="YELLOW"><strong>Keymaster</strong></font>
</li>
<li>The <font color="YELLOW"><strong>Keymaster</strong></font> is voted out while you are alive.</li>
<li>You are the <strong><font color="red">Sacrifice</font></strong> and fail to get yourself voted out.</li>
<li>Two <strong><font color="red">Sacrifices</font></strong> are voted out while you are alive, and you are not chosen to win by them.</li>
<li>You vote for the <strong><font color="red">Sacrifice</font></strong> during chapter 5, and are not the sacrifice or chosen by them to win.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As this game has 14 players, 2 players per chapter die, and the game ends at the final 4 if it has not already ended, there will be a maximum of 5 chapters.</em></p>

Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of <strong>20 substantive, on-topic, game related posts</strong> per in game day are required. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing <em>solely</em> a vote. The first time a player fails to meet this requirement, they will be given a warning; the second time they fail to meet it, they will be replaced out. A player who zero-posts will be subbed out without a warning. This requirement may be reduced or waived if an execution is hammered early by majority.</p>

<ul>
<li>This setup is a cop13er with A Hat in Time flavor. Flavor solve at your own risk, for flavor is NAI.</li>
<li>Days are 48 hours long, Nights are 24. At all points during the night, if all alive players vote to skip the night, the game will immediatley progress into the next day.</li>
<li>The wincon for the <font color="undefined"><strong>Town</strong></font> is <em>Kill all <font color="red"><strong>Mafia</strong></font> members.</em> The wincon for the <font color="red"><strong>Mafia</strong></font> is to <em>Reach parity with the  <font color="undefined"><strong>Town</strong></font></em>
</li>
<li>The <font color="red"><strong>Mafia</strong></font> will communicate through a special Discord/Forum PM</li>
<li>No-execute is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-execute and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-execute will have priority in the rand.</li>
<li>In cases where the votes are tied, the result will be randed in spec chat.</li>
<li>Self votes are <strong>not</strong> valid votes.</li>
<li>
<font color="red"><strong>Mafia</strong></font> have a factional kill. It is mandatory, and must be performed every night. If they do not submit a kill, it will be randomized outside of the <font color="red"><strong>Mafia</strong></font>.</li>
<li>All votes must be in the form <strong>/vote [name of player]</strong> (and ping the hosts/vc bots) to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <strong>/unvote</strong> (and ping the hosts/vc bots) This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.</li>
<li>Executions are both majority and plurality</li>

<p><strong>As a notice this game will run Wed through Saturday and be on pause sunday through Tusday.</strong><br>
<strong>The hosts may or may not utilize WOTM to prohibit players from joining.</strong><br>
In addition i am looking for 1/2 co-hosts to make action processing as smooth as possible</p>
<p>Hope to start on Wednesday Augest 18th maw allow disscusion to start slightly before this time.<br>
Likely close this thread sometime before that to rand roles and allow any questions to form.</p>
<h3>
<a name="how-to-play-3" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play-3"></a>How to Play</h3>
<p>The game will shift through three cycles, Discussion, Roaming, and Ambidex, until it is over. Note that this game is complex and has many elements and factors. Please read all of the below before signing up.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Discussion</summary>
<p>During Discussion all players can speak in the main thread. All players will be in the same room, so actions can be performed on other players during this time. You can also choose to end Discussion early by leaving the room. After you have left you can no longer talk in the main thread, and players can no longer perform actions on you.</p>
<p>Discussion will last for 24 hours, or until 3/4 of the total players have left the room.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Roaming</summary>
<p>During roaming all players can move about and perform actions, search for items, attack other players, and explore in a pre-made map via PMs. If two or more people are in the same place they will be added to a PM in which they can talk privately.</p>
<p>There will likely be different puzzles you can solve to get better and upgraded gear and to unlock other areas of the map.</p>
<p>Roaming lasts 48 hours or until all players say in their PM that they would like Roaming to end.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Ambidex</summary>
<p>During Ambidex all players will return to the room Discussion takes place. However, no actions can be performed at this time. Players will publicly vote on 1 of 3 lists that say which players will be paired with whom during the Ambidex Games.</p>
<p>After pairings have been voted on, the main thread will be closed and all players must decide whether to ally or betray their partner in their PM. If a player doesn’t cast a vote they will ally by default. If both partners don’t cast a vote they will both betray by default.</p>
<p><strong>Ally vs. Ally:</strong> Both players gain 2 Ambidex Points.<br>
<strong>Ally vs. Betray:</strong> The person who allied will lose 3 points, and the betrayer will gain 4.<br>
<strong>Betray vs. Betray:</strong> Both players will earn zero Amdidex Points.</p>
<p>Ambidex Phase will last 48 hours, 24 for voting, 24 to submit Ally or Betray.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Stats</summary>
<p>If an action a player performs has a chance to fail, a 1d20 will be rolled with discobot. Depending on the action, the player will have one or more of their stats added to the roll. This will determine how successful it is. There are five different stats that can be applied to actions.</p>
<p><strong>Strength (STR):</strong> Lifting or pushing heavy things, pulling things, attacking with melee-based weapons, etc.<br>
<strong>Precision (PRC):</strong> Throwing items, attacking with ranged weapons, doing actions with items that are hard to maneuver, etc.<br>
<strong>Endurance (END):</strong> How much hits you can, how much you can withstand harmful effects, etc.<br>
<strong>Intelligence (INT):</strong> Searching rooms, gaining information, healing, building things, etc.<br>
<strong>Agility (AGI):</strong> Dodging hits, running, attacking with melee weapons, etc.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Inventory and Items</summary>
<p>During the game, players may find useful items they want to keep with them, or take them from other players.</p>
<p>Players have a limited inventory space. They have 5 public inventory slots that can be seen by anyone looking into their inventory, and 1 private slot that no one can see unless the player is unconscious or specifically shows it to someone.</p>
<p>In addition, some players may start with an addition private role slot, in which a role item can be stored.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Roles</summary>
<p>Before the game starts, players will be assigned a role via PM. Roles will dictate unique abilities, stats, your alignment, and your win condition. Roles are custom.</p>
<p>Claiming anything on your rolecard is allowed. Players can make fake rolecards, abilities, stats, alignments or wincons. Speculating on the above is also allowed.</p>
<p>The four alignments are Good, Evil, Wildcard and Neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> players need to help others, and help as many people escape as possible.<br>
<strong>Neutral</strong> players need to escape at all costs, and may have other side goals.<br>
<strong>Wildcard</strong> players have a more flexible win condition and can end up being any of the other three alignments.<br>
<strong>Evil</strong> players are there to sabotage others, cause chaos, and cause conflict and potentially death.<br>
There is no role list.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and alignments will not be flipped upon death.</strong></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Actions</summary>
<p>Players submit actions to the moderator in order to interact with other players and the map. These can be anything; picking up an item, punching another player, doing a backflip, investigate a part of the room.</p>
<p>To perform an action, type <strong>/action,</strong> for example <strong>/Investigate the Couches.</strong> Actions can be submitted in your PM, in chats with other players, or in the main thread during discussion. You can submit actions anytime except during the Ambidex phase.</p>
<p>Players can set automatic actions for when they are AFK in case something happens to them while they are gone. If they have nothing set I will generally do something for them. <em>I’m not just going to let someone get stabbed because they were AFK</em>.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Combat</summary>
<p>All weapons will have a certain damage amount. When a player attacks another, I will take the weapons damage amount and add it to the attacks strength. For example, if a player with a strength stat of 4 attacks a player with a weapon that does four damage, they will do eight damage.</p>
<p>If a player attempts to dodge an attack I will roll a 1d20 and choose a number depending on how the player is attacked. If the number rolled is more than that number the player will successfully dodge.</p>
<p>I am flexible processing combat actions and might award more damage points for creativity.</p>
<p>Health is calculated by 20+(5*END stat). If a player takes more damage than this they will be knocked out. If a player is hit after that they will die.</p>
<p>Medical items will have a flat healing amount, and extra healing will be added on by the INT stat*2.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Ambidex Points and Winning</summary>
<p>Every player will start with 4 Ambidex Points. Ambidex Point totals will be visible at all times in the OP. If a player ever has less than one Ambidex Point they will immediately die.</p>
<p>If a player has more than or equal to 11 Ambidex Points, they can access the Door Number 11 that is located in the map. When the door is opened, it will remain open for 11 seconds, then it will close forever and the game will end. Only players with 11 points or more can exit the door.</p>
<p><strong>The Ambidex Game is the only way to earn Ambidex Points, and the Door Number 11 is the only way to escape.</strong></p>

            <p>Well now, welcome to the ninth game of Blood on the Forums, hosted by me, myself and I, Amelia. This time, we seem to be invaded by a peculiar sort of foe, infiltration from inside the Town itself! Also we seem to be harboring a princess from another realm as well.</p>

<summary>
Character List</summary>
<p>This game will be running an entirely custom script, this time with a few new characters, some of whom may strike fear into a player’s heart, while others bring a saving grace to the ailed Damsel or dying out town. Old and new shall mix together here.</p>
<p>Townsfolk:<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Pixie</strong></font>: You start knowing an in play Townsfolk. If you are “mad” that you are this Townsfolk, gain their ability when they die.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Bounty Hunter</strong></font>: You start knowing 1 evil player. If this player ever dies, you learn another that night. [One Townsfolk starts Evil]<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Sailor</strong></font>: Each day, choose a player; either they malfunction until dusk, or you do. You cannot die. You act on the first night as well.<br>

<summary>
Town Composition</summary>
<p>This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the standard composition of the game at each possible player count.</p>
<p>Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons<br>
5: 3/0/1/1<br>
6: 3/1/1/1<br>
7: 5/0/1/1<br>
8: 5/1/1/1<br>
9: 5/2/1/1<br>
10: 7/0/2/1<br>
11: 7/1/2/1<br>
12: 7/2/2/1<br>
13: 9/0/3/1<br>
14: 9/1/3/1<br>
15: 9/2/3/1</p>
<p>Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Magicians at the start, for example).</p>
<p>Certain characters may contain parts of their ability which modify the game setup; some add character types (and subtract others to compensate), while others change elements of the game entirely. Be sure to take notice of these. You’ll find them in [square brackets], like those ones.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Phase Length</summary>
<p>Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.<br>
12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.<br>
12 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.<br>
24 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.</p>
<p>The night phase will last for no more than 24 hours. If all relevant actions have been submitted and processed, Storytellers reserve the right to begin the next day early.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Storyteller</summary>
<p>The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Fabled</summary>
<p>The Fabled aren’t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters can be found below.</p>
<p><strong>Angel:</strong> Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.<br>
<strong>Buddhist:</strong> Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.<br>
<strong>Doomsayer:</strong> If more than four players live, each living player may publicly invoke the Doomsayer once per game to cause a player of their own alignment to die.<br>
<strong>Fiddler:</strong> Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.<br>
<strong>Hell’s Librarian:</strong> Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.<br>
<strong>Djinn:</strong> The two specified characters cannot both be in play, however Evil knows which ones are. Or, the Djinn’s special rule is in play instead, known as a “jinx.”<br>
The following Fabled character must be added before the game begins; please speak to the Storyteller if you wish to see it added.<br>
<strong>Revolutionary:</strong> Two neighboring players are known to be the same alignment. Once per game, one of them may register falsely.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Scum Info</summary>
<p>On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Malfunctions</summary>
<p>The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the character is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning character’s ability simply does not have any effect.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Nominations and Voting</summary>
<p>Once the discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will formally announce the opening of the nomination phase. Players must be nominated before they may be voted on that day. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day.<br>
When a nomination is opened, the storyteller begins to track votes for that nomination. The players may precast votes, but the votes will lock in a clockhand format. Starting with the player below the nominee on the list, and working downwards, the votes will be locked if they are cast. As an example, take the following five players;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex<br>
Brianna<br>
Cameron<br>
Derek<br>
Ellen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brianna is nominated. Cameron’s vote will be locked as soon as he places it, because he is the first person below Brianna on the list. Derek may cast his vote before Cameron, and may alter his vote if Cameron has not yet voted, but once Cameron has voted and had his vote locked, Derek’s vote will be the next to lock, and if it is placed when Cameron’s vote locks, then Derek’s vote will lock as the vote cast by Derek at that time.<br>
Any votes that are not cast by EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players (not half+1, that’s an important distinction), and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. If there is a tie between two or more players for the highest count of votes, the day will end with no execution. The Storyteller may only declare an early end to voting if it is no longer possible to tie or exceed the highest nomination.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Whispers</summary>
<p>Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Whispers to your neighbors (those seated next to you) do not have to be announced. Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Death</summary>
<p>When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of the game. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Victory</summary>
<p>Good wins by eliminating all Demons (Minions do not necessarily need to die for Good to win, but eliminating Minions can be helpful). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (irrespective of either player’s alignment). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain class abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the class list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win simultaneously), Good wins.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Jinxes</summary>
<p>With this specific set of characters, comes 3 jinxes this time.</p>
<p>Pit Hag + Damsel - If the Pit-Hag creates a Damsel, the Storyteller chooses who the new Damsel is.<br>
Pit Hag + Heretic - A Pit Hag cannot transform a player into a Heretic.</p>

<p>All players must post a minimum of 10 substantive and game-related posts per 48h Day phase. This requirement may be waived in the instance the Day ends due to majority or you die mid-Day.</p>
<details>
<summary>
What doesn't count?</summary>
<ul>
<li><em>Posting for the sole purpose of meeting the post requirement.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting about the fact that you are making posts, without adding any new content.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting about non-game-related topics (ex. IRL, news, homework, etc), or posting fluff such as images or gifs.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting that you are reading, will read, will provide content in the future, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>Posts containing non-substantive edits to a prior post (e.g. “I think Chloe is mafia because she is greenchecked” → “I meant redchecked” - this only counts as one post).</em></li>

</details>
<p>Alts are allowed. PM Chloe if you would like to play this game on an alt.</p>
<p>The hosts may or may not utilize WOTM to prohibit players from joining.</p>
<p><strong>THIS GAME HAS A POST CAP.</strong> Players can only make up to 200 posts per in-game day. This is lifted 2 hours before EoD. (Shooting the gun does not count towards the cap)</p>
<p><strong>EXCESSIVE AtE IS NOT ALLOWED.</strong> Appealing to emotion can result in a toxic environment that ruins enjoyment. We want this game to be somewhat competitive and taken seriously. As a result, we will be monitoring the thread for heavy AtE. If you aren’t sure if what you’re posting breaks this rule, feel free to run it by us. If you find yourself unable to play the game without it affecting you emotionally, please let us know so we can help you. Feel free to message either of me/sulit at any time if you need to vent, or just want to talk.</p>

<p>No-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the Day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the Day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will be announced, and votes will be locked. This means that your first vote is final and cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> and all unvotes must be in the form of <code>**/unvote**</code>. Please ping the hosts (<a class="mention" href="/u/chloe">@Chloe</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/sulit">@sulit</a>) and put your votes on a separate line in order to make it easier for us to process them.</p>

<p>Each painter may each night submit a painting of night action they want to perform. No words / letters can be used on the picture.<br>
Host will try their best to interpret the painting and perform action which they think is on the picture.</p>
<p>However, since being an artist is all about originality, if 2 or more people send picture which will be interpreted as same action. (For example <strong>“kill Luxy”</strong> and <strong>“kill firekitten”</strong>), those actions will be canceled out and not work.</p>
<p>Converts and revives are disabled for the purpose of this game.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>
<a name="combat-1" class="anchor" href="#combat-1"></a>Combat</h2>
<p>Works on a roll system similar to VLDR, with losing all health causing a player to be knocked out. If a knocked out player is attacked again, they die. The only exception here is critical hits, which will deal x2 damage and bypass the knockout stage. In addition, players can submit retaliatory actions such as fleeing, countering, or what have you.</p>
<h2>
<a name="stats-and-formulae-2" class="anchor" href="#stats-and-formulae-2"></a>Stats and Formulae</h2>
<p>Stats will be from 1-100. Passing the cap is possible. Aside from the stats present in Death City, INT is also added.<br>
A = Attacked. D = Defender.</p>
<p>Formulae:</p>
<p>Hit chance = 65% + 0.5%*A.PRE-0.4%*D.AGI</p>
<p>Critical Chance =15%+0.3%*A.LUK (Bypasses KO)</p>
<p>Max HP = 250+5*CON</p>
<p>Melee Damage = A.STR+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Ranged Damage = A.PRE+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Magic/Explosives Damage = A.INT+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Poison and Burn Damage = INT/3 per hour.</p>
<h2>
<a name="inventory-3" class="anchor" href="#inventory-3"></a>Inventory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each player by default begins with two private item slots and five public item slots.</li>
<li>Each player also gains a weapon slot, an armor slot, and an off-hand slot.</li>
<li>Each player has an infinite inventory where they can hold Crystals.</li>
<li>Anyone can check another player’s public slot, but the private slot, equipment slots, and crystal slots will remain hidden unless the player is knocked out.</li>
<li>A player can dual-wield if they have a passive or a crystal that allows them to. Dual wielding means that your second weapon will  also attack for x0.7 of it’s normal damage. You may only dual-wield 1H melee weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="claiming-4" class="anchor" href="#claiming-4"></a>Claiming</h2>
<p>You’re allowed to claim. The wincons are fairly varied and some may overlap with others so it will be fairly easy to fakeclaim.</p>
<h2>
<a name="flips-5" class="anchor" href="#flips-5"></a>Flips</h2>
<p>If a player is murdered, then only their murderer will learn their alignment. If a player is executed, then only the Sovereign will learn their alignment.</p>
<h2>
<a name="alignments-6" class="anchor" href="#alignments-6"></a>Alignments</h2>
<p>There are three alignments that players can roll. Good, evil, and neutral</p>
<p>Also a few notes on some changes on the alignment system when it comes to kills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good players don’t get EXP from killing other Good players. (Planning on removing the incentive for good players to knowlingly kill other good players.)</li>
<li>Any player will gain a Crystal when killing an Evil one. (In short, more incentive for players to hunt Evils rather than just let them mess around like Night.)</li>
<li>Any player will gain a Legendary Weapon when killing a Neutral one. (Method to prevent people from claiming neutral to avoid conflcit. Becoming a pinata should do the trick)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="wincons-7" class="anchor" href="#wincons-7"></a>Wincons</h2>
<p>Each player has a specific wincon. Evils gain fake safeclaims as well.</p>
<h2>
<a name="kill-penalties-8" class="anchor" href="#kill-penalties-8"></a>Kill Penalties</h2>
<p><strong>Bloodied vs Bloodless</strong>: Bloodied players have killed in the match, bloodless have not. This distinction matters in regards to passives and wincons.</p>
<h2>
<a name="sovereign-9" class="anchor" href="#sovereign-9"></a>Sovereign</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game begin with a Sovereign. The Sovereign can appoint up to three heirs. Once the Sovereign dies then a random heir will be chosen as the new Sovereign. Heirs may choose to decline becoming a sovereign.</li>
<li>Sovereigns can call execution votes.</li>
<li>Items called Skull Tokens exist. They can be used to give the voted player an additional vote for execution and are casted publicly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="crystals-10" class="anchor" href="#crystals-10"></a>Crystals</h2>
<p>Crystals are powerful items with strong passive abilities that can be found across the map. They are semi-rare, but they are relatively fragile and can be easily destroyed. Destroying them grants the destroyer EXP. Once every crystal in a chapter has been obtained, a new chapter will begin.</p>
<h1>
<a name="execution-rework-11" class="anchor" href="#execution-rework-11"></a>Execution Rework</h1>
<p>Executions automatically cause the Sovereign to execute their target once maj is reached. This should make them more useful now as before they were kind of like an afterthought to everyone just piling up on a random person ala Marshal.</p>
<h2>
<a name="npcs-12" class="anchor" href="#npcs-12"></a>NPCs</h2>
<p>Yes, there will be NPCs here in Castle Desolation. They’ll be fairly weak but they’ll give you EXP and may drop useful items, and many of the stronger ones even have the Crystals to use in the GoG that you can win. In addition, some players, mostly evils and neutrals though, will be able to summon NPCs to do their bidding.</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-gates-of-moloch-13" class="anchor" href="#the-gates-of-moloch-13"></a>The Gates of Moloch</h2>
<p>To put it short, there will be the Five Seals of Moloch spread throughout the castle. If all of them go boom, then the Great Demon Moloch will be released into the game and <em><strong>baaaaaaaaaad</strong></em> things will happen. No, this isn’t going to be another lolbloodmoon and won’t end the game prematurely. But still you should avoid breaking this. Obviously there will <strong>likely</strong> be an evil role or two who’s wincon involves interacting with the gates, so be careful.</p>
<h2>
<a name="light-of-hope-14" class="anchor" href="#light-of-hope-14"></a>Light of Hope</h2>
<p>In short, the LoH is a giant Crystal that’s located in a specific room in the castle. while the LoH is working, good players do +30% damage to NPCs. This should help you guys burn through the map. However, keep in mind that it’s possible for Evils to destroy the LoH. Once it’s been destroyed, Goods will lose this bonus and instead evils will gain +30% damage against Good-aligned players when the LoH is destroyed. Good players need to wait 6 hours before they can use a Shard of Light to repair it, where it will become immune to Evil attacks for 6 hours.</p>
<h2>
<a name="grimoires-15" class="anchor" href="#grimoires-15"></a>Grimoires</h2>
<p>Each Evil Class will have a grimoire of their class. If they obtain their own grimoire, then they will receive a shit-ton of buffs. If a Good player obtains an Evil player’s grimoire and the evil is dead, then the grimoire will give some slight passive buffs to them.</p>
<h2>
<a name="gate-of-glory-16" class="anchor" href="#gate-of-glory-16"></a>Gate of Glory</h2>
<p>After a player’s wincon is fulfilled, they escape by going through the Gates of Glory. The Gates of Glory are activated once ten crystals are place on the slots of the Gates of Glory. Though Evils do not need the Gates of Glory to be active and can go through them as long as their win-con is satisfied and may have wincons pertaining to sabotaging the Gates of Glory as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Good-aligned players need to go through the GoG to win and they must activate it beforehand.</li>
<li>Neutrals have wincons that do not require them to escape. They are less neutrals and more like true wild cards.</li>
<li>Some but not all Evil-aligned players need to go through the GoG to win, but they do not need to activate it beforehand. The only side requirement that evils have is that they need to destroy four crystals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="map-17" class="anchor" href="#map-17"></a>Map</h2>
<p>TBA</p>
<h2>
<a name="endgame-18" class="anchor" href="#endgame-18"></a>Endgame</h2>
<p>For the game to truly end, once there are five or less players alive who have not escaped then the game will end in twenty-four hours. If the remaining players do not finish up their wincon, they lose.</p>

            <p>The Unseen have won. New Unseen members flooded into the castle, with a promise of power and money. Their former enemies, the Blue Dragon and the Hand of Byzantium, have been entirely wiped out. Or so they thought, until they found the Marauder dead, a knife in his back and a note attached.<br>
“<em>We will take back our lands and overthrow your reign of terror.</em>”</p>

<p>Phase Length:<br>
Day Phase: 48 Hours<br>
Night Phase: 24 Hours<br>
Day 1: 24 hours but no execution<br>
Game will start soon after it is filled.</p>
<p><strong>Scum Faction: 50% chance BD, 50% chance HoB</strong></p>

<p>Game Setup: 18 players<br>

<p>18-er, King, 12-13 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 2 BD or HoB, 1 NK</p>
<p><strong>Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 4 players alive (with exceptions for specific Nks). If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.</strong><br>
<strong>The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert night 1, and all conversions have a 1-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to three members alive.</strong><br>
<strong>The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Grand Trial or Royal Pardon, and if the latter, on who.</strong><br>
<strong>"No Execution" is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer “No Execution” to end the day early without an execution. If “No Execution” is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.</strong><br>
<strong>No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.<br>
Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.<br>
If there is nothing that can stop one of the main factions or the neutral killers from winning, the game will end in a victory for whoever it applies to.</strong></p>

<p>This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!</p>
<p>There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.<br>
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.</p>

<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <code>**/unvote**</code>. <strong>Votes will only be counted if you ping the host account alongside it:</strong> <span class="mention">@CommunityFM3</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>

<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.</p>

<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jailkeepers and Doctors cannot target the same player on consecutive nights, nor can they self target.</li>
<li>Town Alignment Cops get a random n0 town peek. Peeks alignment (town/mafia).</li>
<li>Mafia Role Cops get a random n0 vanilla town peek. Peeks full role.</li>
<li>Mod rands the setup (rows and columns), <em>then</em> rands the “OR” statements. This means each row/column has a 10% chance of being chosen. <em>Setup 4 &amp; Setup B cannot have two jailkeepers.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the setup that is randed, 10 Vanilla Townies and 2 Mafia Goons will be added.</p>
<details>
<summary>
More in depth explanation on how I will rand this</summary>
<p>To rand the setup, I will do the following:</p>
<p>First, I will roll a d10. 1-5 will obviously be 1-5, while A-E will be 6-10.</p>
<p>If I roll a 7, then I get Column B.</p>
<p><img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/uploads/default/original/3X/a/3/a3542ece85f34da5be7233c10939ed204cb0bb68.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="niSbGUJ7EVnxM4vvHYEYfXXgZVm" width="132" height="316"></p>
<p>In cases like this, I will roll a d2 on the two mafia roles. Keep in mind there cannot be two duplicate Mafia Jailkeepers.</p>
<p>If I roll a 2 on the d2, then I will add a <font color="red"><strong>Mafia Ninja JOAT</strong></font> and roll a second. If I get another 2, I will add a <font color="red"><strong>Mafia Jailkeeper</strong></font>.</p>
<p>This would be setup B2, and would (in total, after adding the 10 VTs and 2 Goons) be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="green"><strong>11x Vanilla Town</strong><br>
<strong>1x Town Doctor</strong><br>
<strong>1x Town Tracker</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>2x Mafia Goon<br>
1x Mafia Ninja JOAT<br>
1x Mafia Jailkeeper</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li>Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.</li>
<li>Yeets are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the yeet will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.</li>
<li>No-yeet is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-yeet and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-yeet will have priority in the rand.</li>
<li>Self-votes are considered valid votes. Accompanied AtE is not required.</li>
<li>Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios. That is to say, in situations where a misyeet or a no-yeet will guarantee a Mafia victory, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>All votes must be in the form <strong>/vote [name of player]</strong> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <strong>/unvote</strong> . This is to enable the smooth processing of votes. Pinging the host(s) is not required, but is welcomed.</li>
<li>The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.</li>
<li>The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.</li>
<li>Mafia <strong>can</strong> perform the factional kill alongside any abilities they have.</li>
<li>Alts will <strong>not</strong> be allowed.</li>

<p>The ever-wise Headmaster of Beacon Academy, Vale’s premier school for training Hunters and Huntresses. However, Headmaster Ozpin has plenty of secrets up his sleeve, and he’s not willing to share them all, even to his inner circle. Among them… what the <em>hell</em> is in his mug?</p>

Constantly drinking and taking personal offense against authority, you’re probably not the <em>best</em> role model, but that doesn’t stop the girls from adoring you anyway.</p>

            <p>In the sleepy town of Ravenswood Bluff, the legends are as thick as the mist. Tales of demons coming in the night to steal away the souls of the townsfolk, as the brave citizens employed the limits of their strengths and wits to save themselves from annihilation. They make for great song at the local tavern, or stories to scare the children into obeying their parents. But as time went by, the tales became more… outlandish. The old clocktower where it all began became a great infernal clockwork ensnaring the whole town like some feverish opium dream… the demon became a bawling infant, hardly inspiring fear… and with it all, the people grew further from the truth. But those who cannot remember the past… must repeat it.</p>
<p>It’s about time we went back to our roots, folks. A nice, solid game of Trouble Brewing, to ground us once again and maybe even bring in some new blood. Speaking of which, I’d be remiss if I didn’t provide my breakdown of just how this game works, given that it’s… a bit different from your run of the mill forum mafia.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Character List</summary>
<p>This game will be running the Trouble Brewing script; it’s a solid build which should provide a fair balance.</p>
<p>Townsfolk:<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Washerwoman</strong></font>: You start knowing that one of two players is a particular Townsfolk.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Librarian</strong></font>: You start knowing that one of two players is a particular Outsider (or that no Outsiders are in play).<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Investigator</strong></font>: You start knowing that one of two players is a particular Minion.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Chef</strong></font>: You start the game knowing how many instances of adjacent evil players exist.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Empath</strong></font>: Each night, you learn how many of your living neighbors are evil.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Fortune Teller</strong></font>: Each night, select two people; you will learn if one of them is the Demon. One good player is the “Red Herring” and will register as Demon to you.<br>

<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Monk</strong></font>: Each night (not the first), select a player (not yourself); that player is safe from effects of the Demon’s ability.<br>

<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Drunk</strong></font>: You think you are a Townsfolk character, but the ability that you think you have instead malfunctions.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Recluse</strong></font>: You might register as a Minion or Demon, even if dead.<br>
<font color="29b6f6"><strong>Saint</strong></font>: If you are executed, evil wins.</p>
<p>Minions:<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Poisoner</strong></font>: Each night, choose a player; their ability malfunctions that night and the next day.<br>

<summary>
Town Composition</summary>
<p>This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the standard composition of the game at each possible player count.</p>
<p>Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons</p>
<p>5: 3/0/1/1<br>
6: 3/1/1/1<br>
7: 5/0/1/1<br>
8: 5/1/1/1<br>
9: 5/2/1/1<br>
10: 7/0/2/1<br>
11: 7/1/2/1<br>
12: 7/2/2/1<br>
13: 9/0/3/1<br>
14: 9/1/3/1<br>
15: 9/2/3/1</p>
<p>Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Chefs at the start, for example).</p>
<p>Certain characters may contain parts of their ability which modify the game setup; some add character types (and subtract others to compensate). Be sure to take notice of these. You’ll find them in [square brackets], like those ones.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Phase Length</summary>
<p>Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.</p>
<p>12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.<br>
12 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.<br>
24 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.</p>
<p>The night phase will last for no more than 24 hours. If all relevant actions have been submitted and processed, Storytellers reserve the right to begin the next day early.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Storyteller</summary>
<p>The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Fabled</summary>
<p>The Fabled aren’t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters can be found below.</p>
<p><font color="yellow"><strong>Angel</strong></font>: Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.<br>
<font color="yellow"><strong>Buddhist</strong></font>: Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.<br>
<font color="yellow"><strong>Doomsayer</strong></font>: If more than four players live, each living player may publicly invoke the Doomsayer once per game to cause a player of their own alignment to die.<br>
<font color="yellow"><strong>Fiddler</strong></font>: Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.<br>
<font color="yellow"><strong>Hell’s Librarian</strong></font>: Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.</p>
<p>The following Fabled character must be added before the game begins; please speak to the Storyteller if you wish to see it added.<br>
<font color="yellow"><strong>Revolutionary</strong></font>: Two neighboring players are known to be the same alignment. Once per game, one of them may register falsely.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Scum Info</summary>
<p>On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Malfunctions</summary>
<p>The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the character is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning character’s ability simply does not have any effect.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Nominations and Voting</summary>
<p>Once the discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will formally announce the opening of the nomination phase. Players must be nominated before they may be voted on that day. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day.<br>
When a nomination is opened, the storyteller begins to track votes for that nomination. The players may precast votes, but the votes will lock in a clockhand format. Starting with the player below the nominee on the list, and working downwards, the votes will be locked if they are cast. As an example, take the following five players;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex<br>
Brianna<br>
Cameron<br>
Derek<br>
Ellen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brianna is nominated. Cameron’s vote will be locked as soon as he places it, because he is the first person below Brianna on the list. Derek may cast his vote before Cameron, and may alter his vote if Cameron has not yet voted, but once Cameron has voted and had his vote locked, Derek’s vote will be the next to lock, and if it is placed when Cameron’s vote locks, then Derek’s vote will lock as the vote cast by Derek at that time.<br>
Any votes that are not cast by EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players, and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. If there is a tie between two or more players for the highest count of votes, the day will end with no execution. The Storyteller may only declare an early end to voting if it is no longer possible to tie or exceed the highest nomination.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Whispers</summary>
<p>Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Whispers to your neighbors (those seated next to you) do not have to be announced, but any whisper, to a neighbor or otherwise, must include the Storyteller in the message. Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered broken and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Death</summary>
<p>When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character or alignment and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of the game. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Victory</summary>
<p>Good wins by eliminating all Demons (Minions do not necessarily need to die for Good to win, but eliminating Minions can be helpful). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (irrespective of either player’s alignment). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain class abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the class list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win simultaneously), Good wins.</p>
