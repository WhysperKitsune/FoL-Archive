            <p><em>Going to the police was a mistake. A shifty figure has been following you for blocks, and you swear people on the street are taking notes as you pass by. You hide around a corner waiting for an ambush, only to see that shifty figure speeding off in an Aston Martin. An old war buddy calls in a favor to look up the license, and… no. No no no no no, how high does this go? The Reds don’t have this kind of influence, not yet, who’s behind this? That’s when you hear the knock.</em><br>

Character List</summary>
<p>Character just means role; the character types are Townsfolk, Outsider, Minion, and Demon.<br>
Townsfolk and Outsiders are good-aligned to start, Minions and the Demon are evil-aligned to start.  There are no neutral parties in Ravenswood Bluff.<br>
[Brackets] denote abilities upon setup; for example, if it says [+1 Outsider], then I replace 1 Townsfolk with 1 Outsider.</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorstebluetownsfolkcolor-5" class="anchor" href="#colorstebluetownsfolkcolor-5"></a><font color="steblue">Townsfolk</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Wiretap</strong></font> - You are 1 of 2 wiretap characters, but do not know which.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Domestic Wiretap</strong> - You start knowing two allied players. When they both die, you learn their characters tonight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Foreign Wiretap</strong> - You start knowing two opposing players. When you die, you learn the Evil character tonight.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Double Agent</strong></font> - The Demon sees you instead of a Minion. That Minion recieves no starting information.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Sleeper</strong></font> - You think you are an in-play Minion, and neither of you recieve starting information. If you are “mad” about being the Sleeper, you learn the in-play Demon tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Jurist</strong></font> - Each night, choose a player and learn their character. Good living players register falsely to you.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Freelancer</strong></font> - Each night, choose a Good character. You learn that it is 1 of 2 players, if in play. If not in play, you recieve arbitrary info tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Blacklister</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a character (not yours, not a Traveller). You learn its nearest Evil character, if in play. If not in play, you recieve arbitrary info tonight.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Black Ops</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn if you whispered the Demon today.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Populist</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn a character who was “mad” about being the Populist today.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Diplomat</strong></font> - Each day, you may whisper the storyteller with two other players (not Travellers, different from yesterday) &amp; broker a deal between them. If either player breaks the deal, they malfunction until dawn.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Eavesdropper</strong></font> - Each day, you may visit the Storyteller to learn something about each player you whispered today, in no particular order.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Symbologist</strong></font> - You have 3 Townsfolk abilities, but 1 malfunctions. You also register as the functioning Townsfolk.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Truther</strong></font> - If you die at night, choose a character and learn all players with that character.<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Ambassador</strong></font> - You are immune to all abilities and do not count towards the number of living players. One Good player starts knowing the Ambassador is in play.</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorsteblueoutsiderscolor-6" class="anchor" href="#colorsteblueoutsiderscolor-6"></a><font color="steblue">Outsiders</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Libertine</strong></font> - You start holding a Drunk character token. Each night (but not the first), it moves to a player the holder whispered today. You think you are a Townsfolk until the Drunk token moves.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Drunk character is an Outsider with the ability “You do not know you are the Drunk. You<br>
think you are a Townsfolk, but your ability malfunctions.” It cannot start in play. Note that the Demon is still the Demon, even if they are holding this token.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="steblue"><strong>Activist</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), a player dies unless a living player was “mad” about being the Activist today (even if you are dead.)<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>MAD-Man</strong></font> - Each night, choose another living player (not a Traveler) to hold the football. If the holder is executed, you drop The Bomb and lose (even if dead).<br>
<font color="steblue"><strong>Sympathizer</strong></font> - A Townsfolk is Evil and registers as a Defector, but does not know. You have their ability, and the Demon knows them.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Defector” is a character. (Ex: Jurist can see somebody as a Defector). It doesn’t actually have any ability, because you can only register as one, and it cannot be in-play.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="colorredminionscolor-7" class="anchor" href="#colorredminionscolor-7"></a><font color="red">Minions</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Agitprop</strong></font> - - Each night, choose a player and a statement. Tomorrow, if that player is “mad” about denying that statement, they might be executed.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Templar</strong></font> - If you nominate a Good player you did not whisper today and they are executed, Evil wins.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Chairman</strong></font> - Once per game at night (but not the first), choose an Outsider player: they swap characters and alignments with the Demon. [+1 Outsider]<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Brainwasher</strong></font> - Townsfolk might recieve the incorrect character in setup (their abilities work normally).</p>
<h1>
<a name="colorreddemonscolor-8" class="anchor" href="#colorreddemonscolor-8"></a><font color="red">Demons</font>
</h1>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Comitern</strong></font> -  Each Comintern knows one other Comintern. Each night (but not the first), a Comintern might die. Evil wins only when all Good players are dead. You register as a Minion too. [Most players are Comintern]<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Draconis</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a character: if in play, that player dies and an Evil player becomes their character. If not in play, a player dies.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Seclorum</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), you learn the character of everyone you whispered today, then choose a player: they die.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>Kabal</strong></font> - Each night (but not the first), choose a player: they die. If you win, if an Outsider was most responsible for their team losing, they switch teams and win with you. [+1 Outsider]</p>

<summary>
Travellers</summary>
<p>Travelers are special and powerful characters with different rules than normal citizens.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Traveler characters are publicly known.</strong> If a player joins the game as the United Nations, for example, everyone knows that they are the United Nations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traveler alignments are unknown.</strong> Because Traveler characters are known, the question regarding them becomes which side they’re playing for. Travelers are more likely to be good than evil; general practice is that one in three Travelers is evil, but it is possible for there to be only one Traveler in a game and that Traveler to be evil. Evil Travelers will be told who the Demon is when they enter play; Good Travelers will be told nothing. The Demon and Minions will not be told if a Traveler is good or evil.<br>
Note that if the Comitern is in play, Evil Travellers will only be told so, and will not be told any Comitern.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traveler players may join or leave the game at any time.</strong> This game is designed for live play, and the Travelers are designed to accommodate players who arrive late or must leave early. If you would like to play, but cannot join at game start or do not think that you can stay around for the end of the game, then you may consider playing as a Traveler character instead of a normal citizen. However, I will not allow Traveler players to sub out (since the nature of their character is designed for them to simply leave if they cannot play), and if a Traveler player has left the game, they may not rejoin later. I will additionally ask that players who would consider joining as Travelers after the game has started notify me of this before the start of the game; I will compile a list of these potential Travelers and people not on this list by the start of the game will not be allowed to join as a Traveler. If a player wishes to join an in-progress game as a Traveler, I may bar them from choosing certain characters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travelers with a night ability act before any citizens.</strong> Their abilities will be resolved absolutely first.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travelers are not executed; they are exiled.</strong> An exile is different from an execution in a few key ways.<br>
-An exile is not considered an execution, meaning that a game can see the exile of a Traveler and an execution in the same day.<br>
-An exile is not affected by any abilities affecting nomination, voting or execution.<br>
-An exile may be called for at any time, by anyone, even if that player is presently unable to nominate, and a player who calls for the exile of a Traveler may still nominate if they have not already.<br>
-Dead players may vote on the exile of a Traveler, and they do not spend their ghost vote to do so.<br>
-And finally, a simple majority vote is all that is required to exile a Traveler. However, I will houserule that no more than one exile may occur per day.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Traveller Characters</summary>
<p><strong><font color="steblue">Presi</font><font color="red">dent</font></strong> - You may privately veto your exile unless the majority of 3 different character types voted for your exile.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Celeb</font><font color="red">rity</font></strong> - Each night (but not the first), until dusk, a player who was “mad” about everything you said today acts twice.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Inter</font><font color="red">pol</font></strong> - If the player you nominate is executed, everyone you whispered today may visit the Storyteller tommorow to learn something about that player.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">United</font> <font color="red">Nations</font></strong> - If all living players vote to ratify you, you run nominations from now on, and you may change the nomination and voting rules, excepte on yourself.<br>
<strong><font color="steblue">Spym</font><font color="red">aster</font></strong> - Each day, choose a player: if they agree, you learn their character tonight, then their character changes.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Town Composition</summary>
<p>This game is designed for a variable number of players, and thus the composition of the game is able to change depending on how many players join. The following list denotes the composition of the game at each possible player count.</p>
<p>Total Players: Townsfolk/Outsiders/Minions/Demons</p>
<p>5: 3/0/1/1<br>
6: 3/1/1/1<br>
7: 5/0/1/1<br>
8: 5/1/1/1<br>
9: 5/2/1/1<br>
10: 7/0/2/1<br>
11: 7/1/2/1<br>
12: 7/2/2/1</p>
<p>Every character in-game is unique in that more than one of the same character will never appear at the start of the game (there can never be two Wiretaps at the start, for example).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Phase Length</summary>
<p>Each day phase will last for no longer than 48 hours.</p>
<p>12 hours: Discussion phase. Nominations may not be cast at this time.<br>
24 hours: Nomination phase. Players who wish to nominate may do so at this time, <strong>and votes may begun to be cast during this time as well.</strong><br>
12 hours: Vote finalization. During this time, votes may be cast freely on any existing nomination, but no new nominations may be made. Once this time ends or all votes have been locked in, the day will resolve.</p>
<p>The night phase will last for 24 hours, or until all abilities have been performed and resolved.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Storyteller</summary>
<p>Storyteller</p>
<p>The Storyteller is the key moderator for the game; All ability uses at night must be sent to the Storyteller via private message, and Storyteller will have the final say on any open-ended ability behaviors. Storyteller’s goal is to keep the game both fun and balanced, and they’ll often be trying to make it last as long as possible; however, the Storyteller may not alter any existing rules to accomplish this.<br>
Also, the thing the Storyteller uses to keep track of things is called the Grimoire. It’s basically the spreadsheet.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Fabled</summary>
<p>The Fabled aren’t really characters so much as special modifiers that the Storyteller can put in play to tweak the game. For example, the Angel can be put into play to help keep newer players from being targeted, or the Buddhist can be put into play to keep the more experienced players from dominating the discussion. Fabled will always be announced when they are in play, along with their effect upon gamestate. A breakdown of Fabled characters we may be using can be found below.</p>
<p><font color="gold"><strong>Angel</strong></font> : Something bad might happen to whomever is most responsible for the death of a new player.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Buddhist</strong></font> : Veteran players may not speak for the first six hours of the day phase.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Hell’s Librarian</strong></font> : Something bad might happen to whomever speaks when the Storyteller calls for silence.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Fiddler</strong></font>: Once per game, at night, the Demon secretly chooses a player of an opposing alignment; All players then choose which of these two wins the game.<br>
<font color="gold"><strong>Deus Ex Fiasco</strong></font>: Once per game, the storyteller will make a mistake, correct it and publicly admit to it.</p>
<p>If you want any of these added, ping me in signup thread (before game) or in classcard (during game).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Bomb (IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ)</summary>
<p><font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> is a fabled character that is always in play this game. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>If two players (dead or alive) agree to drop the bomb, and at least one is Good, Evil wins. If Comintern is in play, Good wins instead. If both are Evil, Good wins.</strong><br>
(Note that Kabal cannot make an outsider switch teams via dropping the Bomb.)</p>
<p>The only reason to ever drop <strong><font color="maroon">The Bomb</font></strong> as Good is if you believe Comitern is in play.<br>
<strong>I will prevent any attempts to drop <font color="maroon">The Bomb</font> out of intent to gamethrow.</strong><br>
Also, if necessary, I will timegate <strong><font color="maroon">The Bomb</font></strong> to a certain day, depending on playercount.</p>
<p>If you want to drop <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font>, do it like this:</p>
<p><strong>I would like to drop <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> with @[name] <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong><br>
then both of you will either say<br>
<strong>I turn the key <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong> (if both players do this, <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> will be dropped)<br>
or<br>
<strong>I do not turn the key <a class="mention" href="/u/elithepsycho">@EliThePsycho</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/crichard564">@CRichard564</a></strong> (if at least one player does this, <font color="maroon"><strong>The Bomb</strong></font> will not be dropped)</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Scum Info</summary>
<p>On the first night of the game, when relatively few characters act, the evil characters will all be woken to learn who one another are. Evil players will not be allowed to communicate at night. The Demon will be told who all of their Minions are, and the Minions will know who the Demon is and who all of the other Minions are. However, the Minions and the Demon will not learn which specific characters any of their fellow evils are. The Demon will additionally be told three characters that are not in play, to serve as safe claims. They may claim any of these, none of these, or simply hand the claims off to Minions; however they think they will be best served.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Malfunctioning &amp; Registration</summary>
<p>The primary source of interference with abilities in this game is the malfunction. A class that is malfunctioning is not told that they are malfunctioning; if the class is one that gathers information, then the information they receive that night is arbitrary (open-ended, Storyteller may resolve at their discretion), otherwise, the malfunctioning class’ ability simply does not have any effect.</p>
<p>You may also see experienced players refer to malfunctioning as “drunkness”, “poisoning”, or “droison”.</p>
<p>Registration causes a player to “appear” a certain way (for most purposes). For example, if the Jurist picks a good living player, then they learn something they are not. If you pick a character that the Symbologist has a functioning ability of, then you can learn the Symbologist, etc etc etc.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Madness</summary>
<p>Certain character abilities in this script reference a status known as “madness”. What madness means, in the simplest terms, is that when a player is “mad” about something, they are trying to convince the other players that it is true, even if it is not (especially if it is not). Ultimately, the Storyteller is the one who judges whether the “mad” player’s efforts are sufficient to avoid punishment (or to obtain a reward!), but this allows the Storyteller to be more lenient toward players who are unfamiliar with the concept, and by the same token, to expect more from an experienced player.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Nominations and Voting</summary>
<p>Voting in this game works a little differently. After the formal discussion phase has ended, the Storyteller will declare that nominations are opened. A player must be nominated before they can be voted on. Each player may only be nominated once per day, and each player may only nominate once per day. When a nomination is opened, the storyteller will begin to count votes. Votes may be precast, and may be altered so long as they are considered not to be locked in. A vote is locked in when everyone between the accused and the voter (going down the list from the accused) has locked in their vote, or once the day ends, assuming that not all votes on the nomination have been cast. Any votes that are not counted at EoD will be considered votes to pardon. If the count of votes to execute is more than half of the number of living players, and is the highest count of votes against any player that day, the accused will be considered “about to die”. At the end of the day or when all votes on all nominations have been cast, the player who is “about to die” will be executed. There isn’t such a thing as a quickhammer around here; we’re a little more careful with what we do.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Whispers (DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL, PLEASE READ)</summary>
<p>Players may whisper each other in-game through private messages. Whispers must, however, be publicly announced, typically by requesting permission to whisper (a standard format is /whisper [Player]). Once a whisper has been declared and accepted, the two players may whisper via private message until one of them speaks publicly in the game chat, at which point the whisper is considered over and the players must declare whispers again if they wish to whisper publicly.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may send up to 15 words to your neighbors without having to announce a whisper. <strong>These do not count as a whisper for the purposes of abilities.</strong></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Death</summary>
<p>When a player dies, nothing is revealed about their character and they are allowed to stay in the game and speak. They may not nominate and they will have only one vote token (this will allow them to cast a vote to execute) for the entire game. Evil players who die may thus continue to help their allies by keeping up their claim and spreading misinformation, and good players may similarly help their allies by retaining relevant info that others may have forgotten in the heat of things. Once a player dies, their ability stops working, which means that a player killed before they would perform their ability will not perform their ability, and any ability with a persistent effect will end upon the player’s death.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Victory</summary>
<p>Good wins by eliminating all Demons (you don’t need to kill Minions to win). Evil wins by reducing the game to two living players (even if both players are good). The Storyteller may also declare a victory for Evil if Good may no longer possibly win (for example, if only evil players are left alive and thus no one would nominate the Demon). Certain character abilities may present alternate routes to victory; these classes, if able to appear, will be made known on the character list. In the event of a tie (both teams would win at the same time), Good wins.</p>

<p>
Additionally, for this game, a minimum requirement of <strong>20 substantive, on-topic, game related posts</strong> per in game day are required. Posts that are explicitly or obviously made solely for the purpose of meeting this requirement do not count towards the minimum, nor do posts containing <em>solely</em> a vote. The first time a player fails to meet this requirement, they will be given a warning; the second time they fail to meet it, they will be replaced out. A player who zero-posts will be subbed out without a warning. This requirement may be reduced or waived if an execution is hammered early by majority.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to Minority Rule Royale  2: Teams Edition!  The rules are pretty simple. I will present you a choice of several rooms—just choose one to enter.  If you pick the room with the most people, you will all meet a horrible demise</em>.</p>

<a name="colorlightblue-how-to-play-color-2" class="anchor" href="#colorlightblue-how-to-play-color-2"></a><font color="lightblue"> How to play? </font>
</h1>
<p>Every round, you will be given a list of rooms to choose from. PM me your pick privately. if you pick the room a majority of the players pick, you will be eliminated. If there is a tie, then both rooms are considered a majority and players who picked both are eliminated. The game will end once there are two or fewer players left. .</p>
<p>Since its team edition, you will have to find a partner and signup with both of you claiming to be each other partners. Team size is limited to 2. Do <strong>/Join with <span class="mention">@PLAYER</span> as my partner</strong> to join. Feel free to PM or DM each other as long as you include me. I will need separate dms for submissions tho, so don’t just submit in your team chat.</p>

<font color="red"><strong>Care Package:</strong></font> Every round, a random room will be chosen to contain a care package.

<font color="lightblue"><strong>Shrinking Circle:</strong></font> The formula for determining the amount of rooms has been scrapped. The game will start with 8 rooms. Every round, the pool will shrink by one until there are only two rooms remaining. (This does not count rooms that exist due to special circumstances such as cultist.)</li>
<li>
<strong><font color="orange">Teams</font></strong>: If teammates end up in the same room by the end of the New Statuses phase they will receive a <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/tangerine.png?v=10" title=":tangerine:" class="emoji" alt=":tangerine:">  Tangerine <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/tangerine.png?v=10" title=":tangerine:" class="emoji" alt=":tangerine:"> each! That means more chances of winning ties. Also if one of you wins the game, both of you do. <s>Prepare to get carried</s>. There is also the new Friendship room to work with teammates’ mechanics.</li>

<a name="important-notes-2" class="anchor" href="#important-notes-2"></a>Important Notes</h1>
<p><strong>As a notice this game will run Wed through Saturday and be on pause sunday through Tusday.</strong><br>
<strong>The hosts may or may not utilize WOTM to prohibit players from joining.</strong><br>
In addition i am looking for 1/2 co-hosts to make action processing as smooth as possible</p>
<p>Hope to start on Wednesday Augest 18th maw allow disscusion to start slightly before this time.<br>
Likely close this thread sometime before that to rand roles and allow any questions to form.</p>
<h3>
<a name="how-to-play-3" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play-3"></a>How to Play</h3>
<p>The game will shift through three cycles, Discussion, Roaming, and Ambidex, until it is over. Note that this game is complex and has many elements and factors. Please read all of the below before signing up.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Discussion</summary>
<p>During Discussion all players can speak in the main thread. All players will be in the same room, so actions can be performed on other players during this time. You can also choose to end Discussion early by leaving the room. After you have left you can no longer talk in the main thread, and players can no longer perform actions on you.</p>
<p>Discussion will last for 24 hours, or until 3/4 of the total players have left the room.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Roaming</summary>
<p>During roaming all players can move about and perform actions, search for items, attack other players, and explore in a pre-made map via PMs. If two or more people are in the same place they will be added to a PM in which they can talk privately.</p>
<p>There will likely be different puzzles you can solve to get better and upgraded gear and to unlock other areas of the map.</p>
<p>Roaming lasts 48 hours or until all players say in their PM that they would like Roaming to end.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Ambidex</summary>
<p>During Ambidex all players will return to the room Discussion takes place. However, no actions can be performed at this time. Players will publicly vote on 1 of 3 lists that say which players will be paired with whom during the Ambidex Games.</p>
<p>After pairings have been voted on, the main thread will be closed and all players must decide whether to ally or betray their partner in their PM. If a player doesn’t cast a vote they will ally by default. If both partners don’t cast a vote they will both betray by default.</p>
<p><strong>Ally vs. Ally:</strong> Both players gain 2 Ambidex Points.<br>
<strong>Ally vs. Betray:</strong> The person who allied will lose 3 points, and the betrayer will gain 4.<br>
<strong>Betray vs. Betray:</strong> Both players will earn zero Amdidex Points.</p>
<p>Ambidex Phase will last 48 hours, 24 for voting, 24 to submit Ally or Betray.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Stats</summary>
<p>If an action a player performs has a chance to fail, a 1d20 will be rolled with discobot. Depending on the action, the player will have one or more of their stats added to the roll. This will determine how successful it is. There are five different stats that can be applied to actions.</p>
<p><strong>Strength (STR):</strong> Lifting or pushing heavy things, pulling things, attacking with melee-based weapons, etc.<br>
<strong>Precision (PRC):</strong> Throwing items, attacking with ranged weapons, doing actions with items that are hard to maneuver, etc.<br>
<strong>Endurance (END):</strong> How much hits you can, how much you can withstand harmful effects, etc.<br>
<strong>Intelligence (INT):</strong> Searching rooms, gaining information, healing, building things, etc.<br>
<strong>Agility (AGI):</strong> Dodging hits, running, attacking with melee weapons, etc.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Inventory and Items</summary>
<p>During the game, players may find useful items they want to keep with them, or take them from other players.</p>
<p>Players have a limited inventory space. They have 5 public inventory slots that can be seen by anyone looking into their inventory, and 1 private slot that no one can see unless the player is unconscious or specifically shows it to someone.</p>
<p>In addition, some players may start with an addition private role slot, in which a role item can be stored.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Roles</summary>
<p>Before the game starts, players will be assigned a role via PM. Roles will dictate unique abilities, stats, your alignment, and your win condition. Roles are custom.</p>
<p>Claiming anything on your rolecard is allowed. Players can make fake rolecards, abilities, stats, alignments or wincons. Speculating on the above is also allowed.</p>
<p>The four alignments are Good, Evil, Wildcard and Neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> players need to help others, and help as many people escape as possible.<br>
<strong>Neutral</strong> players need to escape at all costs, and may have other side goals.<br>
<strong>Wildcard</strong> players have a more flexible win condition and can end up being any of the other three alignments.<br>
<strong>Evil</strong> players are there to sabotage others, cause chaos, and cause conflict and potentially death.<br>
There is no role list.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and alignments will not be flipped upon death.</strong></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Actions</summary>
<p>Players submit actions to the moderator in order to interact with other players and the map. These can be anything; picking up an item, punching another player, doing a backflip, investigate a part of the room.</p>
<p>To perform an action, type <strong>/action,</strong> for example <strong>/Investigate the Couches.</strong> Actions can be submitted in your PM, in chats with other players, or in the main thread during discussion. You can submit actions anytime except during the Ambidex phase.</p>
<p>Players can set automatic actions for when they are AFK in case something happens to them while they are gone. If they have nothing set I will generally do something for them. <em>I’m not just going to let someone get stabbed because they were AFK</em>.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Combat</summary>
<p>All weapons will have a certain damage amount. When a player attacks another, I will take the weapons damage amount and add it to the attacks strength. For example, if a player with a strength stat of 4 attacks a player with a weapon that does four damage, they will do eight damage.</p>
<p>If a player attempts to dodge an attack I will roll a 1d20 and choose a number depending on how the player is attacked. If the number rolled is more than that number the player will successfully dodge.</p>
<p>I am flexible processing combat actions and might award more damage points for creativity.</p>
<p>Health is calculated by 20+(5*END stat). If a player takes more damage than this they will be knocked out. If a player is hit after that they will die.</p>
<p>Medical items will have a flat healing amount, and extra healing will be added on by the INT stat*2.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Ambidex Points and Winning</summary>
<p>Every player will start with 4 Ambidex Points. Ambidex Point totals will be visible at all times in the OP. If a player ever has less than one Ambidex Point they will immediately die.</p>
<p>If a player has more than or equal to 11 Ambidex Points, they can access the Door Number 11 that is located in the map. When the door is opened, it will remain open for 11 seconds, then it will close forever and the game will end. Only players with 11 points or more can exit the door.</p>
<p><strong>The Ambidex Game is the only way to earn Ambidex Points, and the Door Number 11 is the only way to escape.</strong></p>

    Well now, welcome to the ninth game of Blood on the Forums, hosted by me, myself and I, Amelia. This time, we seem to be invaded by a peculiar sort of foe, infiltration from inside the Town itself! Also we seem to be harboring a princess from another realm as well.

<p>All players must post a minimum of 10 substantive and game-related posts per 48h Day phase. This requirement may be waived in the instance the Day ends due to majority or you die mid-Day.</p>
<details>
<summary>
What doesn't count?</summary>
<ul>
<li><em>Posting for the sole purpose of meeting the post requirement.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting about the fact that you are making posts, without adding any new content.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting about non-game-related topics (ex. IRL, news, homework, etc), or posting fluff such as images or gifs.</em></li>
<li><em>Posting that you are reading, will read, will provide content in the future, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>Posts containing non-substantive edits to a prior post (e.g. “I think Chloe is mafia because she is greenchecked” → “I meant redchecked” - this only counts as one post).</em></li>
<li><em>Posts containing solely a vote.</em></li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Alts are allowed. PM Chloe if you would like to play this game on an alt.</p>
<p>The hosts may or may not utilize WOTM to prohibit players from joining.</p>
<p><strong>THIS GAME HAS A POST CAP.</strong> Players can only make up to 200 posts per in-game day. This is lifted 2 hours before EoD. (Shooting the gun does not count towards the cap)</p>
<p><strong>EXCESSIVE AtE IS NOT ALLOWED.</strong> Appealing to emotion can result in a toxic environment that ruins enjoyment. We want this game to be somewhat competitive and taken seriously. As a result, we will be monitoring the thread for heavy AtE. If you aren’t sure if what you’re posting breaks this rule, feel free to run it by us. If you find yourself unable to play the game without it affecting you emotionally, please let us know so we can help you. Feel free to message either of me/sulit at any time if you need to vent, or just want to talk.</p>

<p>On Night 2, the Mafia must select a member of the Town. This player will be given a gun publicly, and must shoot it on Day 3 by typing <code>**/shoot [player]**</code> in the thread. If they shoot a member of the Mafia, the Mafia member dies. If they shoot a member of the Town, the gun holder will die.</p>
<p>If the Mafia fail to select a target by the final hour of the Night, it will be given to a random living villager.<br>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both majority and plurality are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <em>may not</em> self-vote. Asking other players to vote and/or hammer you breaks this rule and goes against the spirit of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the Day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the Day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will be announced, and votes will be locked. This means that your first vote is final and cannot be changed.</p>

<p><em>You’re travelling through space. You wake up one morning to discover your ship has been sabotaged, the weapons stolen, the captain murdered. Your ship is quickly losing power. You come to the only logical conclusion — aliens have possessed members of your crew and are hiding among you, planning to murder you in your sleep. You need to figure out who among you is really an alien, and kill them before they can kill you.</em></p>

</div>
<h3>
<a name="crewmate-requirements-3" class="anchor" href="#crewmate-requirements-3"></a><strong>Crewmate Requirements</strong>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong> - All crew members are required to follow the <a href="http://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-rules-please-read-first/244">Global Forum Rules</a> and the <a href="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/t/official-forum-game-rules/78926">Forum Game Rules</a>, lest they be ejected into space through the airlock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loyalty to The Cause</strong> - Any attempt to intentionally make your faction lose the game will result in punitive action. All crew members must operate with the goal of winning as your faction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inactivity</strong> - If a crew member hasn’t said anything in 24 hours, they will be prodded for inactivity. If they do not respond to the prod within 12 hours of it being sent, they will be removed and replaced with someone else. Receiving two prods will result in an automatic replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement</strong> - All questions and requests to the ship’s computer must be done in private. Any messages delivered to you by the computer are to stay strictly between you and the computer, per your NDA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications Log</strong> - Any attempts to erase or change the backup log the ship’s automated systems keep are strictly forbidden without express permission from said systems, in case of an emergency. (Don’t edit or delete posts.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coherency</strong> - Crew members are encouraged to speak in coherent and understandable language, and to avoid rambling on. As such, “spam” will not be tolerated. Excessive posting may result in warnings or disciplinary action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Outside Communication</strong> - Crew members are not allowed to communicate with anyone through unauthorized channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Doxxing</strong> - Crew members are not allowed to publicly or privately discuss their own identities or the identities of other crew members at any time. (This is an <em>anonymous</em> game - do not do or say anything that may reveal your identity, even if you are not a player.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restricted Color</strong> - <font color="cornflowerblue"><strong>This</strong></font> is the Starship Epiphron Onboard Computer Official Announcement Color. Do not use this color or ones that could be easily mistaken for it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<a name="starship-status-4" class="anchor" href="#starship-status-4"></a><strong>Starship Status</strong>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small Ship</strong> - After three months of space flight, everyone on the ship has gotten to know each other pretty well. Therefore, you all know each other’s roles (see the Crew Analysis Report below), but not each other’s alignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Shortage</strong> - In the event of power being cut, the ship will have only 200 hours of power in its battery. Switching off the lights and going to sleep will not drain from its power bank. If the battery runs out, the ship will go permanently dark, which allows aliens to overrun the ship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quiet Hours</strong> - Talking in the common areas at night is strictly prohibited. These quiet hours will be 24 hours unless stated otherwise mainly due to host availability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crew Member Deaths</strong> - Only careful study of deceased crew members can determine whether or not they were host to the alien parasite. As such, only the Coroner will be aware of whether or not deceased crew members were possessed, and he will be unable to determine whether a deceased crew member was a non-infected sympathizer to the aliens.</p>

There's one thing that stands between this ship and absolute chaos, and it's you. The captain is dead. He was your leader and your friend, and you have to ask yourself: what would he do? The answer is simple. He would lead. And your first task is to make sure these aliens don't kill anyone else. You'll see your captain avenged. Despite the apparent breakdown of the chain of command, you are still respected among the crew. When you demand someone is executed, your vote counts as two. You take this responsibility very seriously -- if someone's going to die, you'll make sure it's one of the filthy aliens.
<p><strong>As the next in command, your vote counts for double that of any other player during the day.</strong></p>

Your role in the mission was to preserve samples in stasis so they'd be unaffected by the oxygen on your ship when you carted them back. You were preserving a handful of plants, but with the right tweaking, you feel you can preserve something... bigger. Say, the room of one of your compatriots. You dare not walk inside, and potentially endanger yourself, but you feel you can freeze a whole room for a night.
<p><strong>Each night you may freeze a player, protecting them from attacks but also preventing them from acting.</strong></p>

This was supposed to be an easy mission. Collect some plant samples, analyze them, return home. Now, all of a sudden your life is at risk. You're a botanist, not a xenobiologist. You have no idea what influence alien infestation might have on a host's DNA -- or even, what a regular human's DNA is going to look like. But in extraordinary circumstances, people like you rise to do extraordinary things.
<p><strong>Each night you may check a player, comparing their alignment to the last player you checked. You may not test yourself.</strong></p>

Yeah, the guns have been taken. Fortunately you kept your own. It's only got one shot left in it — you've got to make it count.
<p><strong>You have a single bullet left in your gun, and you can use this to kill any one player of your choice at night.</strong></p>

Your years of medical training seem wasted in this crisis. You're prepared to treat wounds and injuries sustained in the regular course of a peaceful mission, but unfortunately, medical science has not been able to keep pace with advanced modern weaponry — if someone shoots you, they'll kill you. As such, you're a little out of place in this situation. But there's more ways to save lives than just healing the sick. You're the only one on the ship who knows enough about anatomy to perform an autopsy and determine whether a crew member was host to an alien parasite before their death. Your crew members need you to help them determine if a threat has been neutralized, or if the aliens claimed another victim.
<p><strong>By performing a basic autopsy on all dead crew members, you are passively informed whether or not any dead players were host to the alien parasite.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be aware that you can only tell whether or not they had an alien inside them, meaning that you cannot identify the traitor.</strong></p>

Transporters don't work like they do in Star Trek. It's not about destroying and recreating matter. That's sort of a ridiculous (and destructive) solution to a really basic problem. Really what you do is more about reassigning space via a series of minor wormholes. It's incredibly confusing to the layperson, so you try not to spend much time explaining it.
<p><strong>You may switch the two doors of anyone’s room by teleporting them, causing any action performed on one player to be done instead on the other and vice-versa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to this process requiring a large amount of energy, and with the ships power being rationed, you may only do this twice.</strong></p>

Your intricate security system has been compromised. Where once you could see every move your crew made, your screens are now completely dark. What was once a comprehensive network of cameras and sensors is now just a mess of frayed wires and shattered consoles. You can still get some of it to work, though you have to allocate your time carefully.
<p><strong>Using whatever hasn’t been damaged, you may watch over one player’s room and learn the identity of all who visit that room.</strong></p>

With the ship's sensors and scanners out of commission, there's no reliable way to monitor everyone. Fortunately, you're a genius. Co-opting some of the equipment from the sensor grid, you've been able to construct a crude monitoring device you keep in your room. You'll register any burst of power, whether from a rifle, stasis unit or teleporter.
<p><strong>Each night you will be informed about everyone who was shot, put in stasis, had their room trapped, was drugged, or was teleported.</strong></p>

We've already agreed: we can't trust each other. So why are we discussing everything out in the open, in front of our enemies? That doesn't make any sense to you. Fortunately, you're not really a "rule follower." Every night, you use your equipment to contact someone in secret. You know the best way to survive is to figure this out yourself.
<p><strong>During the day you may select a player. The next night you and that player may talk freely with each other.</strong></p>

Ensuring that the wildlife didn't get to them and that they didn't end up poisoning themselves or worse.

Drugs are bad. Let's get that out of the way — there's no way you would ever endorse the use of drugs, except maybe in the scenario when using the drugs prevents aliens from killing you. It's okay only in this exact scenario and maybe the movie the Faculty. You've used some advanced amphetamines mixed with an adrenaline substitute and come out with something that protects a person from death itself. They also seem overly active and surprisingly tenacious. You hope the drug doesn't have addictive properties, because you only have two doses. But it probably does have addictive properties. Oh well — problem for another day.
<p><strong>During the night you may inject someone with a dose of your drugs, making that player use their night action before any others and making them immune to being killed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You only have enough doses to administer the drugs to two people.</strong></p>

            <h2>
<a name="combat-1" class="anchor" href="#combat-1"></a>Combat</h2>
<p>Works on a roll system similar to VLDR, with losing all health causing a player to be knocked out. If a knocked out player is attacked again, they die. The only exception here is critical hits, which will deal x2 damage and bypass the knockout stage. In addition, players can submit retaliatory actions such as fleeing, countering, or what have you.</p>
<h2>
<a name="stats-and-formulae-2" class="anchor" href="#stats-and-formulae-2"></a>Stats and Formulae</h2>
<p>Stats will be from 1-100. Passing the cap is possible. Aside from the stats present in Death City, INT is also added.<br>
A = Attacked. D = Defender.</p>
<p>Formulae:</p>
<p>Hit chance = 65% + 0.5%*A.PRE-0.4%*D.AGI</p>
<p>Critical Chance =15%+0.3%*A.LUK (Bypasses KO)</p>
<p>Max HP = 250+5*CON</p>
<p>Melee Damage = A.STR+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Ranged Damage = A.PRE+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Magic/Explosives Damage = A.INT+A.WeaponATK*rand(8…12)</p>
<p>Poison and Burn Damage = INT/3 per hour.</p>
<h2>
<a name="inventory-3" class="anchor" href="#inventory-3"></a>Inventory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each player by default begins with two private item slots and five public item slots.</li>
<li>Each player also gains a weapon slot, an armor slot, and an off-hand slot.</li>
<li>Each player has an infinite inventory where they can hold Crystals.</li>
<li>Anyone can check another player’s public slot, but the private slot, equipment slots, and crystal slots will remain hidden unless the player is knocked out.</li>
<li>A player can dual-wield if they have a passive or a crystal that allows them to. Dual wielding means that your second weapon will  also attack for x0.7 of it’s normal damage. You may only dual-wield 1H melee weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="claiming-4" class="anchor" href="#claiming-4"></a>Claiming</h2>
<p>You’re allowed to claim. The wincons are fairly varied and some may overlap with others so it will be fairly easy to fakeclaim.</p>
<h2>
<a name="flips-5" class="anchor" href="#flips-5"></a>Flips</h2>
<p>If a player is murdered, then only their murderer will learn their alignment. If a player is executed, then only the Sovereign will learn their alignment.</p>
<h2>
<a name="alignments-6" class="anchor" href="#alignments-6"></a>Alignments</h2>
<p>There are three alignments that players can roll. Good, evil, and neutral</p>
<p>Also a few notes on some changes on the alignment system when it comes to kills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good players don’t get EXP from killing other Good players. (Planning on removing the incentive for good players to knowlingly kill other good players.)</li>
<li>Any player will gain a Crystal when killing an Evil one. (In short, more incentive for players to hunt Evils rather than just let them mess around like Night.)</li>
<li>Any player will gain a Legendary Weapon when killing a Neutral one. (Method to prevent people from claiming neutral to avoid conflcit. Becoming a pinata should do the trick)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="wincons-7" class="anchor" href="#wincons-7"></a>Wincons</h2>
<p>Each player has a specific wincon. Evils gain fake safeclaims as well.</p>
<h2>
<a name="kill-penalties-8" class="anchor" href="#kill-penalties-8"></a>Kill Penalties</h2>
<p><strong>Bloodied vs Bloodless</strong>: Bloodied players have killed in the match, bloodless have not. This distinction matters in regards to passives and wincons.</p>
<h2>
<a name="sovereign-9" class="anchor" href="#sovereign-9"></a>Sovereign</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game begin with a Sovereign. The Sovereign can appoint up to three heirs. Once the Sovereign dies then a random heir will be chosen as the new Sovereign. Heirs may choose to decline becoming a sovereign.</li>
<li>Sovereigns can call execution votes.</li>
<li>Items called Skull Tokens exist. They can be used to give the voted player an additional vote for execution and are casted publicly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="crystals-10" class="anchor" href="#crystals-10"></a>Crystals</h2>
<p>Crystals are powerful items with strong passive abilities that can be found across the map. They are semi-rare, but they are relatively fragile and can be easily destroyed. Destroying them grants the destroyer EXP. Once every crystal in a chapter has been obtained, a new chapter will begin.</p>
<h1>
<a name="execution-rework-11" class="anchor" href="#execution-rework-11"></a>Execution Rework</h1>
<p>Executions automatically cause the Sovereign to execute their target once maj is reached. This should make them more useful now as before they were kind of like an afterthought to everyone just piling up on a random person ala Marshal.</p>
<h2>
<a name="npcs-12" class="anchor" href="#npcs-12"></a>NPCs</h2>
<p>Yes, there will be NPCs here in Castle Desolation. They’ll be fairly weak but they’ll give you EXP and may drop useful items, and many of the stronger ones even have the Crystals to use in the GoG that you can win. In addition, some players, mostly evils and neutrals though, will be able to summon NPCs to do their bidding.</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-gates-of-moloch-13" class="anchor" href="#the-gates-of-moloch-13"></a>The Gates of Moloch</h2>
<p>To put it short, there will be the Five Seals of Moloch spread throughout the castle. If all of them go boom, then the Great Demon Moloch will be released into the game and <em><strong>baaaaaaaaaad</strong></em> things will happen. No, this isn’t going to be another lolbloodmoon and won’t end the game prematurely. But still you should avoid breaking this. Obviously there will <strong>likely</strong> be an evil role or two who’s wincon involves interacting with the gates, so be careful.</p>
<h2>
<a name="light-of-hope-14" class="anchor" href="#light-of-hope-14"></a>Light of Hope</h2>
<p>In short, the LoH is a giant Crystal that’s located in a specific room in the castle. while the LoH is working, good players do +30% damage to NPCs. This should help you guys burn through the map. However, keep in mind that it’s possible for Evils to destroy the LoH. Once it’s been destroyed, Goods will lose this bonus and instead evils will gain +30% damage against Good-aligned players when the LoH is destroyed. Good players need to wait 6 hours before they can use a Shard of Light to repair it, where it will become immune to Evil attacks for 6 hours.</p>
<h2>
<a name="grimoires-15" class="anchor" href="#grimoires-15"></a>Grimoires</h2>
<p>Each Evil Class will have a grimoire of their class. If they obtain their own grimoire, then they will receive a shit-ton of buffs. If a Good player obtains an Evil player’s grimoire and the evil is dead, then the grimoire will give some slight passive buffs to them.</p>
<h2>
<a name="gate-of-glory-16" class="anchor" href="#gate-of-glory-16"></a>Gate of Glory</h2>
<p>After a player’s wincon is fulfilled, they escape by going through the Gates of Glory. The Gates of Glory are activated once ten crystals are place on the slots of the Gates of Glory. Though Evils do not need the Gates of Glory to be active and can go through them as long as their win-con is satisfied and may have wincons pertaining to sabotaging the Gates of Glory as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Good-aligned players need to go through the GoG to win and they must activate it beforehand.</li>
<li>Neutrals have wincons that do not require them to escape. They are less neutrals and more like true wild cards.</li>
<li>Some but not all Evil-aligned players need to go through the GoG to win, but they do not need to activate it beforehand. The only side requirement that evils have is that they need to destroy four crystals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="endgame-18" class="anchor" href="#endgame-18"></a>Endgame</h2>
<p>For the game to truly end, once there are five or less players alive who have not escaped then the game will end in twenty-four hours. If the remaining players do not finish up their wincon, they lose.</p>

<ul>
<li>The uninformed majority in this setup is the Elves and the informed minority is the Humans.</li>
<li>The set-up is a 15 player set-up with 9 Vanilla Elves, 1 Elf Doctor, 1 Elf Motion Detector, 1 Elf 1-shot Vigilante (Cycle 2+), 1 Human Roleblocker, and 2 Human Goons.</li>
<li>Flips are <strong>alignment-only</strong>, and will not reveal the role. (They may reveal non-role-indicative parts of their flavor.)</li>
<li>No role can self-target. The Human Roleblocker may roleblock other Humans, but the Humans may not factional kill other Humans.</li>
<li>The Doctor cannot target the same player on two consecutive nights.</li>
<li>The Roleblocker cannot target the same player on two consecutive nights.</li>
<li>If the Vigilante’s kill is prevented or interfered with in any way (including being roleblocked, targeting a player protected by the Doctor, or targeting the Human nightkill target), their shot is NOT refunded.</li>
<li>Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.</li>
<li>Executions are majority and plurality.</li>
<li>No-execute is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-execute and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-execute will have priority in the rand. In all other cases of a tie, the execution will be determined at random from among the tied players.</li>
<li>Self-votes are considered valid votes.</li>
<li>Votes are locked in LyLo (execute-or-lose) scenarios, but not in MyLo (misexecute-and-lose) scenarios. That is to say, in situations where elves must execute correctly or lose, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>All votes must be in the form <strong>/vote [name of player]</strong> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <strong>/unvote</strong>. This is to enable the smooth processing of votes.</li>
<li>The Human factional kill is assigned. If the member performing the factional kill is not specified, the last member to submit a kill will be assumed to be performing it.</li>
<li>The Human factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living Elves.</li>
<li>The Humans will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.</li>

Their former enemies, the Blue Dragon and the Hand of Byzantium, have been entirely wiped out. Or so they thought, until they found the Marauder dead, a knife in his back and a note attached.<br>
“<em>We will take back our lands and overthrow your reign of terror.</em>”</p>

Game will start soon after it is filled.</p>

<p>18-er, King, 12-13 Unseen, 1-2 Non NK Neuts, 2 BD or HoB, 1 NK</p>
<p><strong>Neutral Killer Win Condition is to make it to the final 4 players alive (with exceptions for specific Nks). If the NK accomplishes this, they instantly win and every other class that is not a Neutral who has achieved their win condition, loses.</strong><br>
<strong>The Blue Dragon and Hand of Byzantium can convert night 1, and all conversions have a 1-night cooldown after the previous conversion succeeded. They may have up to three members alive.</strong><br>
<strong>The entire court will be informed publicly from the host in public chat if the King ever chooses to use Grand Trial or Royal Pardon, and if the latter, on who.</strong><br>
<strong>"No Execution" is always a valid vote. It is possible to hammer “No Execution” to end the day early without an execution. If “No Execution” is not hammered by the end of the day, someone will die unless everyone abstained.</strong><br>
<strong>No Unseen class besides the Corrupted King is unconvertible. All Neutral classes are still unconvertable though, of course.<br>
Limit of 3 copies of any non-unique class.<br>
If there is nothing that can stop one of the main factions or the neutral killers from winning, the game will end in a victory for whoever it applies to.</strong></p>

<strong>Phylactery (Passive)</strong> - During Day One, you shall specify two players to be our Phylactery Holders. If you fail to do so before the end of the day, they are randomized. They can not choose The King to be their holder, nor can The King be a randomized Holder. You will know their starting classes, and will be night immune while at least one of them lives. If both of them die, you will die the following night. Investigations against the Phylactery Holders will also yield the additional message “You feel a chill surrounding the target player. They are a Phylactery Holder for The Lich.” If your Phylactery Holders die, this fact that they are one will be included with their class information.<br>

<p>All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; <em>nobody will be vanilla.</em></p>
<p>This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!</p>
<p>There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.<br>
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both majority and plurality are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <code>**/unvote**</code>. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of <code>**/ITA [player]**</code> and pinging the host account: <a class="mention" href="/u/folannualmash">@FoLAnnualMash</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be ‘Hit! Nobody died.’ Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or ‘Miss!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.</p>

</h2>
<p>All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; <em>nobody will be vanilla.</em></p>
<p>This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!</p>
<p>There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.<br>
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.</p>
<h2>
<a name="colorffe296votingcolor-4" class="anchor" href="#colorffe296votingcolor-4"></a><font color="ffe296">Voting</font>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both majority and plurality are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <code>**/unvote**</code>. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Days are 36 hours and nights are 12 hours. In the instance the day ends early due to majority, the Night phase will be extended to begin at a consistent time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Night actions is 2 hours before Night ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Day actions is 1 hour before Day ends, unless specified otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barring the potential existence of janitors, flips will always be true. Rolecards will not be fake. Conversion does not exist. Game-ending jesters do not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than the above, everything is on the table (:</p>

<a name="colorffe296itascolor-6" class="anchor" href="#colorffe296itascolor-6"></a><font color="ffe296">ITAs</font>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of <code>**/ITA [player]**</code> and pinging the host account: <a class="mention" href="/u/folannualmash">@FoLAnnualMash</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be ‘Hit! Nobody died.’ Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or ‘Miss!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.</p>

</h2>
<p>All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; <em>nobody will be vanilla.</em></p>
<p>This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!</p>
<p>There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.<br>
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both majority and plurality are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <code>**/unvote**</code>. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Days are 36 hours and nights are 12 hours. In the instance the day ends early due to majority, the Night phase will be extended to begin at a consistent time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Night actions is 2 hours before Night ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Day actions is 1 hour before Day ends, unless specified otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barring the potential existence of janitors, flips will always be true. Rolecards will not be fake. Conversion does not exist. Game-ending jesters do not exist.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of <code>**/ITA [player]**</code> and pinging the host account: <a class="mention" href="/u/folannualmash">@FoLAnnualMash</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be ‘Hit! Nobody died.’ Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or ‘Miss!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.</p>

</h2>
<p>All roles are custom-made, and will be designed based on the players who join the game. You may even get lucky and roll yourself! Everybody will have one or more ability/passive; <em>nobody will be vanilla.</em></p>
<p>This game will feature In-Thread-Attacks (ITAs). Along with this, there will be events in which you can earn prizes (or death)!</p>
<p>There will be at least two factions - Town and Mafia.<br>
Third-party roles (neutrals) may exist.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both majority and plurality are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All votes must be in the form of <code>**/vote [player]**</code> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <code>**/unvote**</code>. After voting in the main thread, send a link to the post in which you voted in the voting thread, or will not be counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-vote. Along with this, no-elimination is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-elim and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-elim will have priority in the rand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied votes will result in a player being eliminated at random from among the tied players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyLo (mis-eliminate and lose) and LyLo (eliminate or lose) will not be announced, and votes will not be locked.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Days are 36 hours and nights are 12 hours. In the instance the day ends early due to majority, the Night phase will be extended to begin at a consistent time.</p>

<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Night actions is 2 hours before Night ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline to submit Day actions is 1 hour before Day ends, unless specified otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barring the potential existence of janitors, flips will always be true. Rolecards will not be fake. Conversion does not exist. Game-ending jesters do not exist.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every day starting Day 2, there will be a single ITA window that begins 6 hours after SoD, and ends 6 hours before EoD. During this period, you may submit an ITA by typing some variety of <code>**/ITA [player]**</code> and pinging the host account: <a class="mention" href="/u/folannualmash">@FoLAnnualMash</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs have a base accuracy of 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not attempt to ITA if you are out of shots. If you shoot a dead player, your shot will be refunded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player is protected from an ITA, the feedback will be ‘Hit! Nobody died.’ Otherwise the feedback will be a death, or ‘Miss!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITAs will be disabled after a certain point. This will be whenever the hosts deem fit.</p>

More in depth explanation on how I will rand this</summary>
<p>To rand the setup, I will do the following:</p>
<p>First, I will roll a d10. 1-5 will obviously be 1-5, while A-E will be 6-10.</p>
<p>If I roll a 7, then I get Column B.</p>
<p><img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/uploads/default/original/3X/a/3/a3542ece85f34da5be7233c10939ed204cb0bb68.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="niSbGUJ7EVnxM4vvHYEYfXXgZVm" width="132" height="316"></p>
<p>In cases like this, I will roll a d2 on the two mafia roles. Keep in mind there cannot be two duplicate Mafia Jailkeepers.</p>
<p>If I roll a 2 on the d2, then I will add a <font color="red"><strong>Mafia Ninja JOAT</strong></font> and roll a second. If I get another 2, I will add a <font color="red"><strong>Mafia Jailkeeper</strong></font>.</p>
<p>This would be setup B2, and would (in total, after adding the 10 VTs and 2 Goons) be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="green"><strong>11x Vanilla Town</strong><br>
<strong>1x Town Doctor</strong><br>
<strong>1x Town Tracker</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>2x Mafia Goon<br>
1x Mafia Ninja JOAT<br>
1x Mafia Jailkeeper</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li>Days are 48 hours unless majority is reached early and nights are 24 hours.</li>
<li>Yeets are majority and plurality. In cases of a tie, the yeet will be determined randomly among the players receiving the most votes.</li>
<li>No-yeet is a valid vote, and may be hammered to end the day early. In cases where no-yeet and another vote are tied at the end of the day, no-yeet will have priority in the rand.</li>
<li>Self-votes are considered valid votes. Accompanied AtE is not required.</li>
<li>Votes are locked in MyLo and LyLo scenarios. That is to say, in situations where a misyeet or a no-yeet will guarantee a Mafia victory, the first vote cast by a given player is final and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>All votes must be in the form <strong>/vote [name of player]</strong> to be considered valid, and all unvotes must be in the form <strong>/unvote</strong> . This is to enable the smooth processing of votes. Pinging the host(s) is not required, but is welcomed.</li>
<li>The Mafia factional kill is mandatory. If no factional kill is submitted, the kill will be determined randomly from among living members of the town.</li>
<li>The Mafia will communicate through a private Discord server or forum topic.</li>
<li>Mafia <strong>can</strong> perform the factional kill alongside any abilities they have.</li>
<li>Alts will <strong>not</strong> be allowed.</li>
