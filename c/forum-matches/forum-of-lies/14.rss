<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/global-forum-discord-game-meta-rules-please-read-first/244">Global Forum/Discord/Game/Meta Rules - Please Read First </a>, and the <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-forum-mafia-and-forum-of-lies-rules/78926">Official Forum Mafia and Forum of Lies Rules </a>. Please make sure you have enough time for this game before you sign up.<br>
Wisdom of the Mod will be used heavily for this game in order to ensure a quality game experience.<br>
Alts are also not allowed.</p>
<p>Tell the host if you want to join privately, as WotM will be used heavily</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Days are 48 hours long or until an execution ends it, Nights last 24 hours. The first day is an exception, it lasts only 24 hours and has no execution.</li>
<li>You will be provided a DM with your classcard by the host, send your actions there.</li>
<li>Unseen/Cult will talk through a special Discord server or forum message, which will be deleted immediately once the game ends.</li>
<li>All other private messages will take place through the forum.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Executions</h2>
<ul>
<li>To accuse someone say “/vote [player]”. Please make the life of the hosts easier by bolding it (by putting ** ** around it)</li>
<li>Should the votes reach the majority, that player will be executed and the day will end.</li>
<li>When the day ends, the player with the most votes will be executed.</li>
<li>Voting “/no execute” is an option.</li>
<li>You may self vote.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Picking a New King</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the start of d2 and every day phase after a king dies, a king election takes place. There will not be an election if there are 4 players or less alive.</li>
<li>When the king dies a 12 hour period starts. In this, players may vote in their class PM for who they want to become the next king.</li>
<li>Voting for execution may take place simultaneously. If a majority execution takes place before the end of the 12 hour period, the election instantly resolves.</li>
<li>Whoever receives the most votes in this period will be crowned king. If votes are tied, a king election will be held the next day to determine it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Results</h2>
<p>Just ask the hosts.<br>
The feedback list works for most results.</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit Prevention</li>
<li>Occupation</li>
<li>Bus Driving (target swapping)</li>
<li>Killing</li>
<li>Protection</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Effects (like Bounty)</li>
<li>Investigation 1 (Faction checks, type checks, etc)</li>
<li>Conversion</li>
<li>Investigation 2 (Every kind of investigation which checks for abilities used <em>this</em> night)</li>
</ol>

            <p><em>The Castle of Regalia. A magnificent castle, one surrounded in riches and grandeur. The inhabitants of the castle all live in relative harmony, as even the commonfolk have enough money to stay out of poverty. The castle is also known for quite a few popular individuals, ones who have extraordinary powers and talents. They all band together under the banner of the Regal Lions. But it just isn’t enough for some, or that’s what the Lord’s wife said… before she was found dead in her quarters. A well known topic amongst the citizens of Castle Regalia is the revolutionaries that once plagued Castle Adiart, an ally of the Lions. However, the Blue Dragon of Adiart managed to defeat these revolutionaries… or so was thought until the heinous act of regicide was committed. It’s clear that the Unseen and the Cult are not completely gone… in blood on the wall of the quarters spells “Your riches and your talents cover up the true corruption within this castle. We will liberate this castle and spread your coin across those who deserve it!” Can the Regal Lions silence these familiar foes, or will they consume the castle within their iron fists? Only time will tell…</em></p>

            <p>I never actually designed something for this Lmao<br>
So this game will instead be as follows:</p>
<p>Scum team: SFoL 53 Syndicate<br>
Lost Wolf: SFoL 53 Dreaming God<br>
Town: SFoL 58 Hand of Byzantium - Champion<br>
Arbiter cannot convert but gains all of the abilities of the Justicar<br>
No other HoB class is guaranteed to rand</p>
<p>Neuts:<br>
SFoL 58 Faction Choosing Alch<br>
SFoL 58 Rebel<br>
+possibly others if there’s enough interest</p>
<p>NK:<br>
Something from SFoL 58 that was not in virtuous I or II</p>
<p>This will probably run before Arete’s turbo; let me know if you’d like to join!</p>

<li><small>Obey all general Forum rules.</small></li>
<li><small> The uninformed majority is called the <font color="steblue"><strong>BLUE DRAGON</strong></font>. </small></li>
<li><small> Our scouts are too afraid to tell us who the informed minority are. But they exist. </small></li>
<li><small>This game is <strong>Explicitly Bastard</strong>. Expect weird mechanics, lies, and fucked up bullshit in general.</small></li>
<li><small>Due to this game’s status as a bastard game, <strong>Wisdom of the Mod</strong> is in play. New players and known slankers will not be allowed to join for the sake of the rest of the players. </small></li>
<li><small>Majority is disabled. Plurality is enabled. In the case of a tie, the player who recieved more votes first is <strong>Executed</strong>.</small></li>
<li><small>Days will be 48 hours. Nights will be 24 hours. Unless otherwise stated.</small></li>
<li><small> You <em><strong>may</strong></em> communicate with players about the game outside of the game, so long as <strong>Icibalus</strong> is included in this communication at all times.</small></li>
<li><small> This game is definitely not inspired by <font color="gold"><strong>MANTICHORA</strong></font> again. That game was called Town of Salem FM. Totally different. </small></li>

            <h1>Rules:</h1>
<p>Every post here must be a Class.<br>
Classes must adhere to <a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/class-suggestion-template/47799">this format </a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every class posted here is assumed to be neutral.</li>
<li>Every class must include a win condition, a type, and a name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include the class number of your post in its description. You may have multiple class numbers in one post.<br>
If a class that you created has already won a game, please make note of it on the original post.</p>
<p><strong>Classes can NOT prevent others from appearing in a game by being rolled.</strong><br>
<strong>You can not change any aspect of an existing post in a future post.</strong><br>
<strong>Consecutive duplicate posts of the same class are banned unless that class is Vanilla Town. This includes named variants.</strong><br>
<strong>You may not change the base mechanics of the game using your classes and then say 'reroll this slot.'</strong><br>
<strong>Effort is required for your class, if it is just a named citizen it may be removed by the host.</strong><br>
<strong>You must use one of the 6 class types from vanilla FoL in your classes.</strong><br>
<strong>All classes must technically be able to win. Classes that require other classes to spawn for them to win are allowed, while classes that flatly can’t win are not.</strong><br>
<strong>Moderators will delete classes that do not fit the rules of this thread.</strong></p>
<h1>Host Notes:</h1>
<p>A game ends when a player has completed their objective. Multiple people are able to win if they win at the same time.<br>
The host has the right to reject/reroll any class if they so wish.<br>
If a class has already won a UIFoL game, reroll the slot if you wish.</p>
<p>UIFoL games fall under SFoL.</p>
<p>To start:</p>
<p>1</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><font color="yellow">The DoubleFool</font></h1>
<p><strong><font color="yellow">Social</font></strong><br>
<strong>Double the Trouble (Passive)</strong> - When you are lynched, choose another player to become a Fool.<br>
<em>Have yourself lynched along with another type of Fool</em></p>

          <category>Forum of Lies</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1><em>Rules:</em></h1>
<p>Every post here must contain a Modifier. It could be an existing one or something new. If the modifier is an existing FoL (any) modifier, the name and a hyperlink to it will qualify it. If it is a modifier that is already in this thread, put down the name hyperlinked to the post in this thread that includes its class card. Otherwise you must make the entire class card.</p>
<p>Include the post number of your post in its description. A post number may only cover one modifier.</p>
<p>Format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Post #</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Modifier Name</h1>
<p>Modifier’s text.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Modifiers can NOT prevent others from appearing in a game by being rolled.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can not change any aspect of an existing post in a future post.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consecutive duplicate posts of the same modifier are banned. This includes named variants.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may not change a core aspect of the game. Examples include: Removing the town faction, removing voting, etc.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This does not include renaming any aspects of the game. You are allowed to make a modifier that renames every class into one name.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moderators have the option to delete modifiers that do not fit the rules of this thread.</strong></p>
<h1><em>How to use the GIOAM threade:</em></h1>
<p>Instead of rolling classes, you roll modifiers from this thread, which may alter gameplay. This can be used in GIFoL, but should be announced if using. You should only use a few amount of Modifiers, as using too many may cause an un-welcoming environment to play in.</p>
<h1><em>Hoste Notes:</em></h1>
<p>The host has the right to reject/reroll any modifers if they so wish.</p>
<p>GIFoL games fall under SFoL.</p>

<h1>New player guide:</h1>
<details>
<summary>
Details</summary>
<p>Always ask the hosts when in doubt. We don’t mind if we get 20 mechanical questions a day from you to ensure that you understand how the game works.</p>
<p>Read the original post carefully as many questions are already answered in there.</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/fol-class-cards-now-officially-official/1998">FoL Class Cards (Now Officially Official) </a> is where all the classcards are that are possible.</p>
<p>There are definite deviations from Throne of Lies the game, although many many similarities persist.</p>
<p>We have even completely new classes like Priest, Archer, Demon etc., so be sure to look at this link carefully. Small deviations for existing classes exist as well to provide a more forum balanced game.<br>
An example is that a Knight can Cold Steel Night 1 already and a Physician’s Exhume only provides the faction of the dead person’s killer instead of the whole class.</p>
<p>Examples are that mainly investigative classes gain feedback. A butler occupying another player will not see if they are occupy immune or not. The player being occupied will not see that they are being occupied by anyone unless they are an investigative. Another example is that a Physician will not know whether their target was bleeding/poisoned and the target player will not know whether they are healed.</p>
<p>Trials also do not exist similar to Throne of Lies. That means when someone is “voted up”, they are immediately executed once majority is reached, so ensure that you stand behind your vote!</p>
<p>Forum players use a specific lingo and some common abbreviations can be found in the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations" class="inline-onebox-loading" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Commonly_Used_Abbreviations</a></p>
<p>Remember, when in doubt, ask the hosts in your classcard.</p>
