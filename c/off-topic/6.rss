          <title>What Class Are You?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Intensify]]></dc:creator>

            <p>What Class Do You Identify As?</p>
<p>Ok so I’m still new to forums as most of you know, and I just thought of this fun little idea. Basically, just tell me what class you are. Which class represents you the most or summarizes you the best for the rest of you guys? You can also just pick your favorite class or the class you would want to roleplay/act as the most I don’t know. This is purely for fun I guess and maybe for a way to get to know all of you better. I don’t really care tho if this blows up or dies down, tis the way of the forums.</p>
<p>No rules really… any class from Throne of Lies, Forum of Lies, SFoL, Custom-Made Classes, Classes from GI, etc. Just make sure you add in what faction you are a part of as well, whether it be Blue Dragon, Unseen, Cult, Neutral, Neutral Killing, uhhhh something something Red Dragon I think… idk what other factions exist lel.</p>
<p><s>I hope no one else had the same idea as me though this would suck then</s></p>
<p>Preferable Layout (You don’t have to follow this and I won’t judge for it)<br>
[Your Name], The [Insert Class Here]<br>
[Faction] [Class Type]<br>
<em>Add Description or whatever you want</em></p>
<p>Example:<br>
Intensify, The Illusionist<br>
Unseen Social<br>
Needs professional help 24/7 about trust issues</p>

Yes I kid you not, someone told me there was something called Blueberry syrup and I thought they were joking until I searched it up and yep… <strong>IT EXISTS</strong>. Oh our dear lord has forgotten these beautiful Canadian lands… he has driven away from us in out most dire of times… We must pray to our Canadian God that he will purify the American lands and remove this syrup made out of the very essence of Heresy</p>

<p>Tbh… that’s not a joke.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, this is last time you saw me inside a mod squad.<br>
Why? Becouse I plan to move onward with my life and focus on more… private stuff, you know.<br>
I will miss you and I think you will miss me too. But it’s not like I’m disappearing forever, I will show up now and then to play some games. I won’t, however, have enough time to actively moderate this forum, hence the decision to step down from the position.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to a flavor however, which was more true than you could expect.</p>

<p>Luxy was demoted.<br>
Squid went missing in action and noone really knows when they will return.<br>
Arete is too much of a nerd to count as a proper forum mod.<br>
And eevee? eevee got banned for excessive use of alts.<br>

<p>Amid this chaos 2 factions has emerged:<br>
First, the Users Union, fought to elect new mod from most active forum users.<br>
Second, the Judge Alliance, tried to keep the power in hands of ToL judges.</p>
<p>They were led by two respected forum users:<br>
DatBird and Chloe.</p>
<p>They both had forum’s best intentions in the mind.</p>

<p>They will be allowed to return to theirs previous position at any time, after they deal with IRL problems.</p>

            <p>So, I’m trying to host a regional National dex tournament on discord with some friends on there, kick off in around 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve divided every pokemon (except those banned) into Genarations, and the (Hopefully) 8 teams build a team under the conditions laid out (more specifics upon request)</p>
<p>Experience, prowess and knowledge is not required, but as <a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a> would attest to, standards are pretty high. But we are a memey, friendly bunch and willing to help and advise.</p>
<p>Anyone interested? You’d be expected to play one match/week and work well with your partner.</p>

          <title>Lack of Signups</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[KyoDaz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Off-Topic (Thronepass)</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Lacks of signups is something I’m really concerned about right now. We’ve once had ten people spectate rather than signup to a game. We’re barely filling games upwords of 20p which should be common to fill.<br>
That begs the question; why do people not sign up?</p>
<p>My thoughts go to a few places, as well as thoughts from others. Unfortunately we cannot have significant impacts on a lot of these issues such as time schedule however what we can help with is other numerous issues like setup types.</p>
<p>As a setup creator myself I have multiple ideas for a lot of setups (N.1 and myself are currently designing one) and I have WoW:BfA v2 on the way. However I’d like to expand the horizons a bit to higher playerlist which at it’s current state is impossible as seen of recent signup numbers.</p>
<p>If you have either not signed up for a game, considered not signing up or were thinking about stop playing I’d like to ask of you to fill out this form. For those of you that do, I’ve added a question for why you remain playing the forum games.</p>
<p>The intent of this survey/form is to improve signups by either deciding we need to take a course of action like hosting another NFoL to gain new players if the heaviest aspect of people not signing up is reasons outwith the setup or giving insight to setup creators in which setups will fill best and how to design them.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is incredibly simple and something we should have done anyways I suppose.</p>
<p>So here’s what you do - take a topic url, delete the postcount, add “/print?page=” followed by the page number you want.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
<code>https://forum.imperium42.com/t/54321st-poster-gets-a-cookie-mods-out/266/50145</code><br>
becomes<br>
<code>https://forum.imperium42.com/t/54321st-poster-gets-a-cookie-mods-out/266/print?page=51</code></p>
<p>This will give you 1000 pages of the topic ready to be saved as a pdf.</p>
<p>Discourse throws a fit if you do too many at a time, and although I could get around this with private browsing I’m busy with finals, so I’m crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>Do that with a handful of pages, rename the pdf to include the thread title and page number, throw them in a zip folder, and send them to my throwaway spam e-mail. <code>not.me13@rocketmail.com</code></p>
<p>We’ll start with the cookie thread, but realistically could back up anything in .pdf form. It’s not ideal, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>I’ll make the second post a wiki - if you save something, edit yourself in with the page you’re saving so nobody else wastes time or storage space on it. At the end, I’ll combine the .pdfs and put them on Google Drive or something. Simple, easy, everyone can contribute a bit.</p>
<p>If you really want to go above and beyond, you could always put in the research and legwork over on <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/">Meta</a> to try and find a better way to download things than .pdf, although they pretty much all require an admin’s help, so you would likely need some help to actually implement it.</p>
<p>Good luck friendos</p>
