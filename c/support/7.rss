            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wanted to try play again but I got a message saying that I was banned for a “dicknote” - But I did not do this, I did not play TOL for a long time. I think I played it abit after I bought it on the 16th december 2018 - fell alseep and then racked about 15 hours in play time but I never really understood what I was doing. The linked picture of the dicknote that gets shown when I login shows 5th april 2018 when it was upload on imgur LONG before I purchased the game or even played it.</p>

            <p>So I was banned from discord months ago because I was disappointed about mac users no longer being able to use the game. I have learned my lesson, figured out a solution and would like to get back on the discord. Is this possible?</p>

<p>What happened:<br>
The game crashed on the little option box, before I even got to the main game, or click on anything.</p>
<p>What was SUPPOSED to happen:<br>
It was supposed to run flawlessly without crashing</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the game.</li>
<li>Click either option on Steam’s box.</li>
<li>Crash the game on the next box for no reason.</li>

<p>What happened:</p>
<p>I was banned exactly 1 year ago today.  I used to be pretty flagrant in my offenses and take full responsibility.  After a year of not playing I just want to get back in and play the game again.  I’m fully rehabilitated and ready to be an upstanding member of the game.  Apologies for my earlier transgressions.  It said my ban was up TODAY: 8/9/19, but it seems to be that I’m still banned.</p>
<p>What was SUPPOSED to happen:</p>
<p>My 1 year ban would be up after the stated time.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p>

          <title>[RESOLVED] Suspended 3 days sharing info</title>

            <p>What happened: ive played this game for a day or two after which i told my friends about it and they bought its to.<br>
Everything seemed awesome and we had a blast playing the game for 2 days.<br>
Yet today when i logged in i was suspended for 3 days for sharing info outside of the game…</p>
<p>The rules are clear on this:</p>
<p>No cheating (or pretending to cheat), such as exchanging private info by “metagaming” with 3rd-parties like voice chat. <strong>(Voice chat is fine as long as you’re only sharing public info)</strong> (<a href="https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-in-game-rules-read-first/2673" class="inline-onebox-loading">https://forum.imperium42.com/t/official-in-game-rules-read-first/2673</a>)</p>
<p>So to keep it more fun and fair we didnt share our ingame names or roles and played games while in discord… however we all got banned (for using discord?) we used our standard discord group we always use for playing games and talked about work and stuff while playing this game, and after each game would tell each other what we were and did in de previous game. Can someone please explain to me what or how the game (/the mods) decided that we cheated and found a suspension of my account necessary?</p>
<p>Neither me or my friends shared any ingame info through discord until after we are all dead or the game ended…</p>
<p>TheEvilOne<br>
is more detailed account info needed to check ?</p>

            <p>What happened: Logged on to TOL to play and was met with a message that I was suspended for “Ban Evasion + You were suspended for using the word “fag” 3 days ago”.</p>
<p>I’m actually very confused. I don’t ever remember trying to evade a ban or calling someone else a “fag”. I really believe that there was a mistake in my ban. Also, the account name is DetectiveDeadpool. I don’t actually remember doing anything that the ban accused me of.</p>
<p>The reason I’m confused: I just don’t call people a “fag”. Sure I get frustrated and call people dumb but I don’t go any further. Also with the ban evasion thing, idk what i did.</p>

          <title>Game breaking bug, game makes graphics card restart &amp; causes black game window</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SpeedyB]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>Towards the end of a game, my graphics card appeared to crash/restart (monitors restart, game screen goes black). After my monitors turned back on, the game screen goes completely black (I play in windowed mode, and everything inside the window was black). I could still hear game noises (e.g. music and chat noises) during this time.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The game is not supposed to cause my graphics card to crash. I have a 980 and the latest drivers installed.</li>
<li>I should be able to see the game items/graphics in the game window (instead of a black window).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>None, it happens spontaneously and without warning.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>I really, really want to find a fix to this issue. It happens rarely, but without warning.</p>
<p>Today it happened right at the end of a really good game and I was very upset I had to leave the game because I couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Naturally, as I can’t see anything, I have to leave the game in this scenario. However, upon restarting the game, everything is back to normal again, but <strong>I can’t rejoin my old game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I feel terrible and there’s nothing I can do about it. I feel like I’ve let my team down, myself down, and I also don’t get any money for leaving the game.</strong></p>
<p>Please fix this, it’s literally ruining my games. Please add a re-join button for people who leave games at the very least, you have no idea what kinds of issues people might be having when they choose to leave a game while still alive.</p>

            <p>My game just crashed in the middle of a match with “Critical Error” message but won’t let me join a new one because it only gives me the option to “Reconnect” but gets stuck on “Reconnecting” when I click it</p>

            <p>What happened: Sooo not sure if this is going to be read or it’s just going to get me banned from here too but I was banned from the steam forums 3 hours ago for trolling because I hoped that a mod we see a certain post on the forums. It was my first post on the forums and the moderation report only showed the word troll as an explanation as to why I was banned. I don’t really care if I’m unbanned but I would like to understand why I was banned exactly.</p>

Not freeze and go on to night 3</p>
<p>I really don’t know how to repeat this but it was completely random<br>
also it keeps happening in an endless loop if you exit the game you still have to reconnect</p>

            <p>What happened: The ‘reconnect’ button replaces the play button. When pressed, sends player to an endless loading screen.</p>
<p>What was SUPPOSED to happen: The menu screen works as normal. When a game ends, the reconnect button disabled.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce this issue: [Unknown and unconfirmed]</p>
<p>How it happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joined a public match</li>
<li>Game took longer than normal to start</li>
<li>Game started to rapidly rotate (far faster than normal) while stacking player models on top of each other [chat did not work either]</li>
<li>At the beginning of the first night, the normal room was instead a changed perspective of the normal night, with a grayer tone.</li>
<li>Game proceeded to continue part 3 until I left the game.</li>
<li>Attempting to join another game led to what is written down in the ‘what happened’ section.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Letting this be known, this is a <strong>game-breaking</strong> bug.</p>
