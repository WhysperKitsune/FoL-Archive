            <p><small> Idea taken from <a class="mention" href="/u/orangeandblack5">@orangeandblack5</a>’s <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/self-archiving-stuff/81418">thread</a>. Thanks orange!</small></p>
<p>To download a thread, simply take the topic url, delete the postcount, and add “/print?page=” followed by the page number you want.</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markdown">https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cat-battle-royale-archie-win/88856/378

<p>Should become:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-markdown">https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/cat-battle-royale-archie-win/88856/print?page=1
</code></pre>
<p>Threads can be downloaded in chunks of 1000 posts at a time. The page number roughly corresponds to what thousand you are downloading, but could be off by a few numbers if there are deleted posts. (ie. page 2 is usually post 1000 to 2000)</p>
<p>After downloading a page, rename the pdf to “[Topic] - [Page #]” or something similar.<br>
After collecting multiple pages, put them in a <em>zipped</em> folder, and send them to the following email address:<br>
<code>folarchiveproject@gmail.com</code></p>
<p>The second post in this thread will be made into a wiki. If you download a page, please write your name along with the topic and page number so that nobody else wastes time on it. Try to keep it organized please. Feel free to reply to this topic saying what thread you’ll be working on.</p>
<p>If anything happens to the site, I’ll compile all of the files into some sort of cloud storage (ex. Google Drive) where everyone can access them.</p>

          <title>Patch v5.0.2 - Quality of Life, Vfx, Fixes</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[í42-Xblade]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>
<a name="visual-improvements-1" class="anchor" href="#visual-improvements-1"></a>Visual Improvements</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All weapons now have <em>some</em> kind of visual effect to it - even magic weapons that previously looked like you had no weapon equipped at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eg, <em>Rune of Frost</em> now shows frost particles swirling around your wrist [all using efficient particles that won’t affect your FPS].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
          <div class="onebox video-onebox">
            <video width="100%" height="100%" controls="">
              <source src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DismalHospitableAmurminnow-mobile.mp4">
              <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DismalHospitableAmurminnow-mobile.mp4" rel="noopener">https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DismalHospitableAmurminnow-mobile.mp4</a>
            </source></video>
          </div>

<ol>
<li>
<p>All executions that should trigger blood now trigger blood properly and more clearly each hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All executions that previously had crusty looking particles have received a hefty upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved idle animation variety (more later), and added 2 separate sitting animations for Chrono and Mystic rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed numerous texture issues that were displaying dim, dark, or dull - including some blood, a few weapons, some particles, the King’s scroll on the table, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<a name="other-improvements-2" class="anchor" href="#other-improvements-2"></a>Other Improvements</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Disabling cam orbit in options will no longer cause visual bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delay Death fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revamped the backend for delay death from the ground-up, fixing numerous bugs including the “stacking delay death” countdown bug. Now if a delayed death is delayed again on the night they were supposed to die, it will correctly delay again for another 2 nights.</li>
<li>Updated the delay death icons, now showing a countdown to remind you about pending death. On the night you are to die, the countdown within the circle is replaced with a skull.</li>
<li>Delayed deaths now explicitly tell you what night you’ll die after mentioning the # of nights.</li>
<li><a href="http://recordit.co/dSi3Af3VvN">Screencast summary</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgraded automod preventative system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlocked</strong> 2 previously locked weapons due to visual bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="yellow"><strong>Trueshot Crossbow</strong> has returned (with fixed vfx)!</font></li>
<li><font color="yellow"><strong>Rune of Force</strong> has returned (with fixed vfx + upgraded animations)!</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling/disabling “cam orbit” will now trigger immediately, instead of next session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug that would sometimes prematurely show popups at the login screen (that should only show in lobby+).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We stopped showing the toast to remind Newcomers to take a survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Status icons on the left now show the hover-text when they 1st appear for clarity that you can hover over it, and what exactly happened with minimal effort: Hovering over it once → then breaking the hover makes it disappear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaled how classes spawn and abilities work so we can change this easier in the future – please report bugs/inconsistencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>

          <title>Invitation - Social Deduction Team Comps</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rsarvar1a]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I come here on behalf of the team behind <strong>Deduction Team Comps</strong>: a competition that aims to bring all of our beloved Social Deduction games and their respective communities together into one massive and friendly competition.</p>
<p><em>Throne of Lies</em> will be one of the stars alongside <em>Secret Hitler</em>, <em>The Resistance: Avalon</em>, <em>Forum Mafia</em>, <em>Blood on the Clocktower</em>, and <em>Untrusted</em>. There will be plenty of other games and several game modes so you will be sure to find something you will like.</p>
<p>Deduction games aren’t the only things to do in this tournament! Despite them being a major portion, you will still be able to compete in many popular non-deduction games such as Mario Kart, 8-Ball Pool, Chess, Skribbl, Codenames, <strong>Bloons TD Battles</strong> (I was advised to bold this one specifically) and many other fun games! All games will be free and available online.</p>
<p>The tournament will run from July 5th to Oct 31st, but if this sounds hellishly long to you, don’t fret - the schedule is super flexible, and the games are super varied, so you can show up and enjoy whichever games specifically interest you. In past seasons we’ve had players show up to anywhere from 5 games to nearly 100 games, and everyone was able to have some good fun.</p>
<p>If this interests you, come join us at <a href="https://discord.gg/VTJBPyNCKM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://discord.gg/VTJBPyNCKM</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Spectators welcome! The more the merrier, and we’ll be hosting practice and casual games throughout the event alongside our official games.</p>

            <p>Goal: survive</p>
<p><strong>Passive 1:</strong> immune to death nights 1 and 2<br>
<strong>Passive 2:</strong> if you die, all your followers will immediately die as well.<br>
<strong>Night ability 1: (3 uses)</strong>  turn target player into a follower. their win condition is adjusted so that they only win if you live, <em>in addition to any other win condition they already have.</em> this effects persists even if they die before you. they will <strong>not</strong> be informed of this effect<br>
<strong>Night ability 2:</strong> (2 uses) redirect any visits to you tonight to a follower of your choice. players attempting to visit you will not be informed they were redirected.</p>
<p>if you have idea what to call the abilities please tell me. or even a class renaming.</p>
<p>positive effects on gameplay:<br>
-make less VFC, since then demagogue can single out important BD who will need to divert resources to protect him (such as the prince and physician)<br>
-add interesting depth to the game, as a psuedo-third faction arises. even makes cooperation between BD and cult/unseen possible since they might both be followers of demagogue (though they ultimately cant win together)<br>
-an interesting claim for non-demagogue to make, since he cant be confirmed.</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[RopeStringFace]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Game will start with a Father and Raven.<br>
Cult Game will start with a Father and a persian</p>
<p>How it works:<br>
7 levels of cult. converted players start at level 7.</p>
<ol>
<li>father (special)</li>
<li>sun runner (investigative)</li>
<li>persian (support)</li>
<li>lion (killer)</li>
<li>soldier (killer)</li>
<li>bridegroom (support)</li>
<li>raven (offensive)</li>
</ol>
<p>the levels are not unique. there can even be multiple “fathers”<br>
cult has “ritual power,” a shared pool used for various action and aquired through rital. at the start of a day, if the ritual pool is negative (because cult overused abilities), then a cult member will be revealed to the court (lowest level, if tie then most recently initiated)<br>
<strong>no limit to number of living cult members.</strong></p>
<p>when using the ritual ability, you will appear to observer or others who see movement as if you visted thhem. ordeal does involve visiting target (even if self)</p>
<p>Father - cult special<br>
Passive: invigorated - immune to death and occupation when 2 or fewer members of the cult alive<br>
Passive: Saturn’s blessing: the first time a Father class is executed by the prince or court, they wont be (force pardoned if court, execute fails to go through if prince).<br>
Day ability: Helping Hand (infinite uses) - target cult member will promote 1 level at the start of the coming night (able to use new level’s abilities)<br>
Day ability: Initiate (2 ritual power) - convert target player to the cult at the start of the following night (even if they are imprisoned). refund 1 ritual power if they are immune to conversion.<br>
Night ability: sacrifice (inf uses): kill target cult member. the cult will gain 5 ritual power.<br>
Night ability: Ordeal: Target cult member promotes 1-3 levels. 1 level is free, 2 levels costs 1 ritual power, 3 levels costs 2 ritual power</p>
<p>Sun runner - Cult investigative<br>
Passive: Sol’s blessing: You will Appear as good to investigators (compatibility as if blue dragon for maid)<br>
Passive: Mithraic ascension: If a Father dies and there are none left, you will become a father (if multiple Sun runner’s, all will become Father)<br>
Day ability: Cave-Knower (1 ritual power): cult will know who the prince imprisons tonight, and be able to see the conversation between them and the prince<br>
Day aility: Illuminate (2 ritual power): reveal target player’s class to the entire cult<br>

            <p>I hope to hear about everyone’s strategies for interrogating prisoners as Prince.</p>
<p>My favorite is, if I think someone is say, Mastermind, is demand that they tell me who they think is probably the Mastermind.</p>
<p>I got a real smart answer once that tricked me but usually the guilty ones don’t directly answer the question.</p>

          <title>Please Change How Button Confirmation/Changes Work</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[livejamie]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s really frustrating when changing your target at the last moment (i.e. Prince Jail or Cult Conversion) that the game deselects your target rather than allowing you to select a different number and click twice. This is both unintituive and suboptimal, easily resulting in the prince or CL screwing up and not taking any action that night.</p>
<p>Very rarely will that be an option that either will want to take, so it should be de-prioritized. I think we can also make it clear as to which action you’re taking so you don’t need to click the button to double check who you are taking action on.</p>
<p>It should never display “You have laid down your key-ring.”</p>
<p>Here’s the current flow:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4.png" data-download-href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4" title="image"><img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4_2_690x120.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oIieVU0GxGo0i6bzsnkntvVza9S" width="690" height="120" srcset="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4_2_690x120.png, https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4_2_1035x180.png 1.5x, https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4_2_1380x240.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad35f94f82f7968557df423bc5d81613d2cd0de4_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">2594×453 40.3 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Here’s my quick recommendation:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb.png" data-download-href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb" title="image"><img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb_2_690x191.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2CqjPBXe6WEcM8vMDJdDgLjQWYX" width="690" height="191" srcset="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb_2_690x191.png, https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb_2_1035x286.png 1.5x, https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb_2_1380x382.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/2/125c49a468b19103b72df014fd6bbb4f6adc1edb_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1626×451 39.4 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>

          <title>How To Properly Fake Claim In 3 Simple Steps. #3 Will Shock You!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kape]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
<strong>Choose your claim.</strong><br>
There’s a lot of BD classes, as well as some Neutral classes you can claim. You should generally prepare 2 claims. One that fits your class type and one that doesn’t.<br>
Claiming out of type, makes you less likely to be narrowed down for being starting evil, but it runs the risk of having to guess ability results and being found by a Princess.<br>
Having 2 claims ready, allows you to safely pick the better option without having to panic and scramble for better logs.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
<strong>Write your logs.</strong><br>
You have to fake your abilities in a realistic way. Claiming to, for example, Flirt and already outed player will make people suspicious of you, so you should claim your abilities in a way that a real Blue Dragon would.<br>
Writing your logs in a simple and easy to read way might also help you avoid suspicion, due to the other players just skimming though them.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
<strong>The presentation.</strong><br>
This is the most important step, but underused by many. You need to sound, breathe, and look BD to fool those who are after you.<br>
In this step I would include: outing yourself at the proper time, posting your logs or action feedback when they are needed, voting in a manner that a BD player would, amongst others.<br>
If you want for your claim to be believable, you need to play actively, rather than passively. This would include, for example, saying that someone is confirmed and posting your fake logs that confirm that player, rather than wait until someone tries to get you to post those.</p>

          <title>[Guide] Using Discourse for Forum Mafia</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Chloe]]></dc:creator>
          <category>General</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><small> Looking for the general guide to using Discourse? Click <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/guide-using-discourse/83609">here</a>. </small></p>
<h2>1. Isolation (ISO)</h2>
<p>ISO is a tool used to read a player’s posts in isolation. In order to utilize this feature, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click a user’s name or profile picture, and select <code>[x] posts in topic</code><br>
<img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/0/4/04486f1e8d475b8e3a6052ed9d079af79b27ea63.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="BT695IhiywfB7YgIRuQxCIVuqD" width="576" height="126">
</li>
<li>Click a user’s profile picture in ‘Frequent Posters,’ below the OP, and select <code>[x] posts in topic</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>                    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ypJs0Uc.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="onebox">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ypJs0Uc.png" width="342" height="115">
          </a>

</p>
<p>In order to stop ISOing a user, follow the same steps as above, but click <code>Remove filter</code></p>
<h2>2. Votecounts (VCs)</h2>
<p>Mafia games on Forum of Lies are hosted manually, meaning all actions are processed by a host. Almost all Forum Mafia games include a voting feature. In order to determine how many votes a player has, and/or how many players have not voted, hosts utilize <strong>votecounts</strong>.</p>
<p>An example of a votecount can be seen below:</p>
<hr>
<div class="md-table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Voted</strong></th>
<th><strong>Voted by</strong></th>
<th><strong>Votes</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Chloe</td>
<td>Xblade, System</td>
<td>2/3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not Voting</td>
<td>Chloe, Discobot</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><hr>
<p><strong>How to read a votecount</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Voted</strong> - Players under this column are those who are a current target of one or more votes. (Duh)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voted by</strong> - This column contains a list of all players who are currently voting a specific player, or voting for no execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Votes</strong> - The final column in a VC is split into two segments. The first number shown is the current amount of voters voting the player, and the second number shown is the amount of votes necessary to reach majority. <em>Not all games have majority enabled, so not all games will have the second number</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Quoting</h2>
<p>To insert a quote, select the text you wish to quote, then press the Quote button that pops up. Repeat this for multiple quotes even from different posts and different users. The quoted text will point to their original source.<br>
                    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FB2hPoe.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="onebox">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FB2hPoe.gif" width="614" height="79">
          </a>

<br>
                    <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nPf6fch.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="onebox">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nPf6fch.gif" width="690" height="263">
          </a>

</p>
<h2>4. Formatting</h2>
<p>You can format a post using simple HTML, BBCode, or <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">Markdown</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">This is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.
This is [b]bold[/b].
This is **bold**.
</code></pre>
<p>For more formatting ideas, I suggest <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/t/post-formatting-tips/76746">Magnus’ Post Formatting Tips</a> or the <a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/an-unofficial-discourse-user-reference-guide/1125">Unofficial Discourse User Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="heading--basic"> 1. Basic Terminology </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Topic</strong>:<br>
Also known as a “thread,” a topic is a collection of messages, or an announcement, with a title, listed in a category, beginning with an Original Post, and including all replies in chronological order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post</strong>:<br>
Each element of a topic is referred to as a post, including all replies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Original Post (or OP)</strong>:<br>
The first post in any topic. This is key since it determines the focus of the topic and is what the title and tags will link to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tag</strong>:<br>
A marker placed on a topic to describe it; sometimes referred to as a subcategory. While a topic can only have one category, it can have multiple tags. For example: <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/c/forum-matches/11">Forum Matches</a> is a category, whereas <a href="https://forum.throneoflies.com/c/forum-matches/fol-signups/17">Signups</a> is a tag.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading--browsing"> 2. Browsing the Forum </h2>
<p>Our homepage displays all <strong>Categories</strong>, as well as all the <strong>Latest</strong> topics, but this can be filtered in a number of other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>By what’s ‘New’ to you</strong>: new topics are those created in the last 2 days that you have not opened yet to keep the list fresh and relevant. New topics show a small blue dot next to the topic title.<br>
<img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/e/1/e12e6701687581efd30974f2d6152870d6e731f3.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="w82QxDsqd1Bb2Sy1CWgK4uZbfFh" width="600" height="55"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By level of activity</strong>: if you click on ‘Top’ the conversation topics will be listed in order of most activity (views and replies) for a specific time period. You can choose whether this is for all time, or select a specific period such as quarter, month, week or just today.<br>
<img src="https://forum.throneoflies.com/uploads/default/original/3X/c/5/c5a4b1976306fd6ea727bee8c85f05c6005c218b.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="scqUOp2cGxn5gqGlxHMg7jnZPMT" width="594" height="52"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By bookmarks:</strong> bookmarks allow users to save a topic or post to be viewed at a later time. To bookmark a topic, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the “Bookmark” button. To bookmark a post, press the “show more” button at the bottom right of the message, and click the bookmark icon. A menu will pop up allowing you to give the bookmark a name, as well as a notification to remind you to return to it at a later time.<br>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>See who is participating</h3>
<p>There are several ways to see who is involved in topics.<br>
You will see a selection of avatars (profile pictures) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user who started the topic (always the first photo);</li>
<li>a selection of the most active participants;</li>
<li>and, who created the most recent post. This photo appears in <strong>Latest</strong> on the homepage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading--navigation"> 3. Navigation </h2>
<ul>
<li>For Search, the Menu, or your User page, use the <strong>icon buttons at the upper right</strong>. Along with these, you can click the Discord icon for an invitation to the Throne of Lies Discord.<br>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading--reading"> 4. Reading Topics </h2>
<h3>Keep scrolling</h3>
<p>Click a topic title and read down the list of replies in chronological order, following links or previewing replies and quotes as you go. Use your mouse to scroll the screen, or use the timeline scroll bar on the right which also shows you how far through the conversation you’ve read.
