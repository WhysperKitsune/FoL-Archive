          <title>Possible bug: Noble doesn&#39;t get info from gossip when occupied, but intensified by CW</title>

<a name="what-happened-1" class="anchor" href="#what-happened-1"></a>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played Noble and used “gossip” on Prince (16). According to output I was occupied, intensified by CW, attacked, but protected by merc (so I was immune). If I was intensified I would bypass occupation and get info (I guess) from my gossip, but I didn’t get it.</p>

          <title>Day ability bug</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Iteration]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Bug Reports</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Pre-face; I already believe this bug is reported through Discord, but just for safety and general information, I post it on the forums as well.</p>
<h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>Cancelling a day ability with a target/selection, causes all day abilities to be grayed out.<br>
Example Prince jails a target, deselects the target (to change targets), the Imprison ability grays out and you cannot use it again until next day.<br>
Has also happened with Poss using Facelift, and I’ve heard the same for Sheriff using Scout.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>You deselect your day ability target and your day abilities are still active.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Use a day ability with a target, then click the ability again to cancel and it should lock you out of your day abilities.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>A bonus: if you cancel a day ability like above but have charge abilities, then you may encounter that clicking charge abilities can spend a charge without actually using the charge ability.<br>
This seems to be able to happen with other abilities than just cancelable target abilities. If Assassin Silences a player, they supposedly cannot use Bleed. If you click the Lacerate ability it may still spend a charge. This may be in conjunction with trials, using Silence during the trial of another player, then clicking on Lacerate (still during or after the trial - I don’t remember which).</p>

<h4>Steps to reproduce: Play a Phys and try to heal anyone. Do the emote combo “It’s you” and “Arms out like a airplane” quickly</h4>
<h4>Comments: Can’t speak for the Phy one (just know what people are saying and some logs). The Emote one people have known about for some time and have fun doing it when there is a trail. The player just keeps emoting into the camera, you just see the players face and then them in the middle of the table till the next day and they reset</h4>

          <title>Noble&#39;s gossip can&#39;t see drunk&#39;s deb on immune targets</title>

          <category>Bug Reports</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played Noble and used gossip on target (it was Fool). At the same night Drunk used deb on him and got feedback that the player (Fool) was immune (at least he swore that he did). As a Noble I got feedback that there were no abilities used on Fool. Also there were no classes in game that could frame me (except this Fool).</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>Noble should had seen Drunk’s feedback that Fool was immune/occupied/used no ability.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Use gossip and debauchery on the same target that is immune to debauchery.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>I don’t know if the reason of such behaviour was Fool’s frame, but anyway it shouldn’t work like that, because frame shouldn’t work on Noble (according to description of frame ability, because Noble is social class and not investigative).</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played inq and had all my targets dead: 2 physicians and drunk. 1 of phys died as Assasin cause he was converted. After last target died I had message that I won and could leave the game (but I decided to stay in game). After that I was executed by court, After the game ended it said that I actually lost…</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>Game was supposed to tell me that I had won and not lost after game ended.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t make screenshots right after the game cause I didn’t expect this to happen. In old patches this had never happened to me.</p>

            <h4>Decide Fate disabled, Cult Leader bleed randomly disabled, the victim of Hunter’s Mark got the feedback that they were attacked, but not the feedback that they were occupied</h4>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>Regarding Hunter’s Mark I was Alchemist with Stoneskin and attacked Inquisitor.  I got, “You attacked X last night” feedback, and “You were attacked but immune” feedback.  I was hit by Hunter’s Mark so the feedback I should have gotten “You were occupied” instead of “You attacked X last night”.</p>
<p>“You attacked X last night” wasn’t true since I was occupied, and also Inquisitor is death immune anyway so I would have gotten a death immune message.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Attack someone as Alch when you get hit by Hunter’s Mark.</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played phys and when I healed a guy game said that I was redirected to myself, but healed another guy. See screenshot: I’m 5 (phys), tried to heal 8, but redirected to myself and healed 9 (according to in-game message). 9 confirmed heal.<br>
<img src="/uploads/default/original/3X/4/d/4d894ca6eb9c86e9e7e962797de1bbb91f611243.jpeg" alt="bug" data-base62-sha1="b3UVwLG3r4womVmgzkkfskUNyEj" width="690" height="388"></p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I guess message was supposed to tell me that I was redirected to 9, not to myself.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>I don’t know how exactly this happened since that was cult game and i didn’t know how cullt players used their abilities at night. This could be a result of several redirections from cw / drunk / ritualist / invoker. Also I was heathen (I don’t know if this is important).</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>This happened today (patch 2.5b)</p>

          <title>Often disconnects</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[beo]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Bug Reports</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t know if developers know about this issue since I don’t see any reports on forum about that. The problem is that after latest patches some players (inluding me) started to have in-game disconnects very often. Some players said that they had never experienced such DCs though. I personally started to get DC every 5th game at least. It usually happens like this: at day or night game stops responding to your actions, you can’t write in chat and don’t see any new messages in chat. If day/night timer raches zero the game does not proceed to next night/day. After about a minute the game disconnects you to lobby without opportunity to reconnect. In lobby corresponding message appears, something like “You were reconnected to lobby after game disconnect”. The biggest problem here that you can’t even reconnect back to the game so the game becomes over for you.<br>
I want to emphasise that it’s not only me who experiences this problem and this is not issue with internet connection itself: it disconnects when internet connection is absolutely fine.</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>Three people left in game, me as Poss, Prince and a continually d/c’ing assassin.<br>
Come daytime, I used Mind Control to force assassin to Prince. It didn’t work, and I therefore could not vote Prince up. Ended up with Prince executing me.</p>
<p>Note that I used Mind Control before voting started.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I expected the ability to actually work., ie. that a vote was placed on the Prince so that I could exe him and win the game.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Use Mind Control, I guess before voting starts, to reproduce.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>Why am I almost the only one doing bug reports? Have everyone else just given up?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I was noble, had gossips on a sheriff and (later) a prince. The feedback only listed the alchemist that healed them, it did not include the chronomancer who insisted that they were also on the same targets. They were legit chrono, when court later upped and exe’d them after they falsely exe’d me.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I was supposed to receive feedback of all abilities used. I mean, if Noble doesnt receive all feedback, what good are they?</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Be a noble. Gossip someone healed by and alchemist and timewarped by a chronomancer. Receive less feedback than expected. Profit. Oh wait, get exe’d for ‘false logs’.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>Annoying bug to be honest, it could’ve easily have cost the game.</p>

<p>Play as Sellsword, perhaps die? When Unseen wins bug is reproduced.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>

          <title>Reaper kills do not should total souls after reap</title>

          <category>Bug Reports</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I played as reaper, and the message in the chat window after I reap someone always says “you now have 0 souls” after a successful reap. Note that I was granted the soul, its just a visual bug in the chatbox.</p>
<p>Also, at the end of the game, it showed me as winning twice. There was a Sellsword (who was dead) who also won with me. So, when the game ended, and it was allowing us to select the MVPs, it showed in the chat box: Me (reaper), the SS, then me again</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>After a reap, it should show  my new total number of souls.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Be reaper</li>
<li>Reap someone</li>
<li>Check chat window when night is over and it will show the incorrect message</li>
</ol>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>To clarify, two bugs here.<br>
1 - visual bug when reaping someone always displaying “0 souls”<br>
2 - When I won as reaper, it showed me twice as the people that were victorious</p>

<p>Nearly every time I quit the game, it still shows the game is running in my Steam library. I have to quit steam, wait for it to try and close Throne of lies, then force close it.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>Game should just exit, and steam should know its exited.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open Steam</li>
<li>Run ToL from the Library menu</li>
<li>Exit game</li>
</ol>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>I can jump on discord if necessary to help debug.</p>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I was poss and I tried to jump someone. Me and my target both died and kept our numbers in the graveyard. It said I successfully jumped them and their name showed as alive in the player list but their body wasn’t at the table and they couldn’t be voted for or jailed.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>A successful poss jump.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Be poss and jump someone. My jump target was a butler but that probably doesn’t matter.</p>

          <title>Phys Exhume charges spent too quickly</title>

            <h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>I was Phys and decided to Exhume. However, I changed my mind same day, and deselected my target and then chose another. I used up all three charges by this.</p>
<h4>What was SUPPOSED to happen?</h4>
<p>I was expecting my first charge to be refunded, ie. not spent, and only one charge in total to be spent.</p>
<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
<p>Exhume something, deselect it, exhume something else. All in the same day.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p>None. Hope the above is sufficient information to go on.</p>
