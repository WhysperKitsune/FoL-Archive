          <title>[RP Interest Check] GodCard: Return to the Roots</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Magnus]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Roleplaying</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><small><em>Original concept idea is credited to Damafaud</em><br>
Hosted by <a class="mention" href="/u/emilia">@Emilia</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/magnus">@Magnus</a></small></p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps nobody was entirely certain <em>how</em> GodCards spread across the globe as they did; regardless of whether they arrived as an act of god, the beginning of the world’s inevitable collapse, or simply an unexplainable scientific discovery was left to interpretation. One thing was for certain, however; life as everyone has once known it had changed forever.</p>
<p>A GodCard initially appears weak, manifesting merely the meanest abilities of a certain avatar to whoever wields it; despite the title, a card can represent a deity, demigod, mythological being or whatever else, typically drawn towards the individual who best suits it. A crime lord with the card of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Loki</a> could expand their villainous empire worldwide with minimal opposition. A presidential candidate could accept the teachings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peitho" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Peitho</a> and find themselves ‘fairly’ elected. With no GodCard bearer left accountable to anybody but each other, the world collapsed with these gifted mortals ruling the rest of the globe, save for a few unmentioned and unimportant islands.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Lagoon Islands, the disputed origin of the second wave; with the original world collapsing and a new organisation seizing control, the military sought to ‘evacuate’ any competent and powerless individual living on the islands - scientists, researchers, soldiers or technicians were removed, whether peacefully or at gunpoint, whilst leaving anyone expendable behind. Any found modern weapons or GodCards were confiscated and removed as well, before sealing everyone else behind an impenetrable barrier.</p>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
Players generally commit to an action by bolding and prefacing their text with a forward flash ( / ), within a private DM or group threads on the Forums. A ‘group thread’ will be constructed for a current party and/or location, and discontinued at the hosts’ discretion.
<blockquote>
<p>e.g; <strong>/Pickpocket [x]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certain actions may constitute a dice roll up to 20, which will determine your chance of success. An advantage may be applied depending on the specific player, or the dice roll may be waived entirely.</p>
<p>Players will be restricted to the primitive Lagoon Islands, limited to using their GodCards in a small world left using wooden bows and spears. Players will decide their GodCard figure/representative, although the hosts will decide their exact abilities.</p>
<hr> 
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This game is not Dama’s GodCard, and the hosts reserve the right to edit or revise practically anything. Similarly, this game is unrelated to Magnus’s previous GodCard game.

<hr>
<p><strong>As Close as it Can be Humanly Achieved, the Globe of Earth is Now a Perfect Utopia.</strong> World hunger and poverty has been eliminated. Diseases and illnesses have vanished alongside the past. The corruption of government had been eventually replaced with a series of intelligent, benevolent AIs, and even death itself can be undone and reversed in most cases.<br>
All knowledge is archived, all of the information of history is known on paper, and yet nobody remembers the mistakes and folly of their ancestors, in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Dozens of Years ago, there was a plan to design rockets capable of traversing the starry night skies,</strong> spaceships which could see the far reaches of the universe. This plan was put into action once the key to unlimited energy was finally discovered; nuclear fusion, the natural reaction which powers the night stars, and yields more energy than it consumes. As crafted and planned safely into the blueprints of the planned Ships. However, what truly made these spaceships, the ‘Precursor’s Silhouette’ and the ‘Monarch’s Tail,’ so special wasn’t the power source. It was the respective crews.<br>
<strong>There were several attempts to forge a psychic link between individuals on Earth, and the Twin Ships project was finalised during these practices.</strong> Only afterwards was it discovered that having another person’s thoughts in your head generally led to confusion, mental pain and <strong>[<em>REDACTED</em>]</strong>. At the time, however, these Ships were planned to be in constant contact with one-another, and the crews irrevocably bound.<br>
The Ships failed contact with Earth soon after, and the project was terminated. The respective teams, however, were unaware.</p>
<p><strong>This Misc focuses on the two crews</strong>, and their voyage through space, places, dreams and telepathy.</p>

<h1>“Do you hear my voice? Come closer.”</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>In this mundane world. There exists copies of people. No one knows why they exist, and even if they do, they do not do anything to people. Merely existing, they wander around the world, not doing anything.</p>
<p>Why do they exist? By all accounts of science, they should never exist. The mere prospect of another copy of ourselves touching our dimensional plane… by all calculations, is 0%.</p>
<p>And yet here we are. It seems that they do not have need for sustenance.</p>
<p>Oh, I haven’t talked about the world yet, have I?</p>
<p><s>We live in a society.</s><br>
The RP is based on a modern civilisation with traces of magic. All roleplayers will reside in a city named Adiart.</p>
<p>Lately… People have been going missing. Rumours have gone around on the internet that they were killed by a serial killer named Shurian. Another says they went missing as they went into another world as per the current popular novels.</p>
<p>What is the truth? What will everyone see? What are the dangers that lurk within?</p>
<p>Entangle yourselves in a world that has many secrets. Find and gather information that potentially be world-changing for everyone involved.</p>

            <p>Yes, I stole this from Hypixel. No idea where he got it from tho.<br>
No, I do not care.</p>
<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>I’ll create a “boss” with, say, 1k HP. It could be darth vader, scooby doo, your uncle Sam, etc etc etc.<br>
You may then submit 1-2 actions/attacks. (You may submit more when I process a whole batch of them.)<br>
Then, I decide what happens based off of that.<br>
<font color="red"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE! I’M THE ONE WHO DECIDES WHAT HAPPENS, NOT YOU. DO NOT BE UPSET/SUPRISED IF IT DOESN’T TURN OUT AS YOU INTENDED/EXPECTED!</strong></font><br>
When a boss is killed, I summon a new one. Rinse and repeat.<br>
The one rule is that you can’t repeat attacks. If you do, your attack is wasted.<br>
If you die during your action, then the <em>rest</em> of your action isn’t processed.<br>
A general guidline for attack damage is the more funny it is (along as it still makes sense), the more funny it is. However, note that this is a general guidline, and will not be enforced or anything like that.</p>

            <h1>Welcome to House Party!</h1>
<p>House Party! Is a non competitive, no plot roleplay which is basically just self explanatory. You’re at my house partying lol.</p>
<p>There is a main thread, a private thread connected to the main thread, and various private threads. To move somewhere, no need to dm me. Simply express your will to move somewhere either by simply saying “<strong>/Walk into the kitchen</strong>” or describe it like “<em>Min grabbed their cup off the table, letting out a sigh as they walked into the kitchen.</em>”</p>
<p>I’m saying this because my only job as a host is moving everyone. I’m literally going to be in this. As I said before, it is casual. If I get at least 5 people to join this, I’ll start it a while later. If anyone wants to join after it starts, just dm me and I’ll announce you arrived late. Please try to be somewhat active if you plan on joining. You do not have to take this incredibly seriously.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, if you want to whisper, obviously make a dm with your whisper buddy and do that. There’s no need to add me into it, as again this is entirely casual and I have no reason to see whispers.</p>
<p>There is no “secret” or “hidden motive” in this. It’s literally just cringe slice of life. If we manage to start and it dies, I’ll just end it by saying “the cops came and everyone ran away lol” or if it just gets really boring, I’ll say I ended the party.</p>
<p>For any reason, if you need me to create a private dm for a new place such as a store or idk?? A fuckin hospital? The woods? Just dm me and I’ll do something for you.</p>
<p>Please express some sort of want to join, or just say <strong>/in</strong> if you want to join. If you have questions, ask here as well. If you are inning as some sort of character or oc, just say <strong>/in as someone</strong></p>

            <p>In the face of war, what can mere children do?<br>
What were the roots of this dispute? What could they possibly understand?</p>
<p>In this RP (Arc…), all of you will be children of a young age in one of the Yaesen Empire’s outskirt villages, Getemy. (Age 10~13)</p>
<p>The Queen of Tearmoon Kingdom has been assassinated. In a fiery rage, the King has waged war on all neighbouring countries. Thousands perished, villages raided and left ablaze.</p>
<p>This is the birth of a vengeance of children against the flux of emotions that blur the lines between good and evil.</p>
<hr>
<p>Magic Exists in this world, though it does take a while to cast. They are powerful… though in this first arc, you won’t be able to use it (uneducated plebians)</p>
<p>Combat is not a focus. Combat RP will take years to finish one battle.</p>
<p>Be prepared to lie and learn the ways of the world, young children. You may split through various circumstances, but you will eventually meet again.</p>
<p>Now, what will you do after this first arc?</p>
<hr>
<p>Useful Info</p>
<p>Commoners have no last name. Nobility have their middle and last names. They also live in different areas in cities.</p>
<p>Each Noble house will rule over a certain piece of land. That applies for all nations.</p>
<p>Silver Pieces are worth 100 of Bronze Pieces. Bronze pieces are worth 100 of Copper Pieces.</p>
<p>Aerius is the God that foresees this land. There are shrines all over the land that worships this god. He is said to protect the land from hardships and bless the future.</p>

            <p>Boom! Slice of Life…<br>
School Life!</p>
<p>Get Ready Everyone!<br>
…</p>
<p>Oh Hell No!<br>
Who would go for a School RP?<br>
Only fools wo-</p>
<p>Don’t be so sure!</p>
<p>Man… things sure are boring… <em>I want my homework done you-</em></p>
<p>Hey… seriously? Haven’t you’ve heard of a sandbox? Just disappear already, can you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Whatever you want to be! The goddess shall sign her favour onto you! That is, if you want your character to survive without losing their very selves, be prepared to suffer, and fight for the things you hold dear.</p>
<p>No, you do not have to physically fight. You can be a Barbarian if you want, but make sure to clarify in your character’s backstory the reason why you have a certain amount of skills.</p>
<p>Wait… but this world is absolutely empty. There is nothing in this world. Not even a speck of dust, no one to communicate with. And definitely not enough information of the gods.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Sky is Sky! Fly towards your dreams!”</p>
<p>Will there be fairies? Will there be demons? Will there be angry officials waving giant berets around and about? Or people living in a giant volcano?</p>
<p>Hmm… I’m sure there’s something here… but I can’t figure what exactly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Roleplay? Is it… really fun?” A young child once asked to the cat in front of her. The cat purred, looking at the young child with expectant eyes, and turned into the hollow tree log and ran inside. The young child followed… and…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The more questionable a person is, the more unpredictable they become. So, why on Earth is Shurian doing this?</p>
<p>Why am I writing this? Wait, I know why… Well… my characters will only look on in confusion. How about your characters?</p>
<p><strong>How much RP experience can you bring to a sandbox?</strong> What can you do and can’t you do?</p>
<p>Let us explore…</p>
<p>Ahem. No supernatural stuff, sadly. Gotta drag myself back to reality after all the Trails of Cold Steel games I’ve played…</p>
<p>Ba da dum dee dee dum do do.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Maybe… the best things in life are the smallest of things…”</p>
<p>“I miss roleplaying… When will I be able to go back…?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Coming Soon…<br>

<details>
<summary>
Disclaimer</summary>
<p>This misc may have taken slight elements from other works, for inspiration, but the core story of it is all my own. As well, several noticeable elements may not have even been my decision, but those of another player. Elements may have been recycled from several of my personal works on the forums. In any case, don’t accuse me of plagiarism, unless you’re certain it’s not just a mistake and it’s entirely intentional.<br>
I’ve intentionally delayed the beginning of this misc to increase hype by those who enjoy them. As well, I’ve worked hard on the story, so I sincerely hope more than a few players take interest this time.<br>
Also, even though I’ve opened signups today, that doesn’t mean the game will actually begin today. Sorry about that.<br>
<small>For those who understand the timeline somewhat, this misc takes place in the Third Reality.</small></p>
</details>
<blockquote>
<p>A long time ago, there were five objects, all similar in likeness, but vastly different. They were the Source of magic, but there was a darkness inside them, given as they were from the Dark Gods.<br>
They weren’t easy for anybody to destroy, unfortunately. They weren’t immune to slight damage, but anything attempting to deal more permanent harm inevitably failed. Not to mention, those given the power of magic feared that if the Source Boxes were shattered, they would lose their own power. As such, a war rose.<br>
Hundreds of years later, the war drew to a close. In the last conflict, four of the five Source Boxes were destroyed in the skirmish, when a volcano erupted and flowed over everyone and everything present. The last of them, <em>Infragilis</em>, was badly damaged and barely useable. As feared, everyone lost their magic.<br>
Strangely, however, in the absence of magic, a new power arose in certain individuals; these were later named Validus, or Einherjar by those who hated them. In any case, the world changed - and not necessarily for the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The above is intended as a bait for those who are wondering about whether or not they should join. If you’ve read down this far, you should by now know the correct answer. <img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:">)</p>
<hr>
<p>All players have a Validus ability, regardless of their class. A Validus ability may potentially be unbalanced and unfair, but since every player can have one, it should automatically balance each other out. If not, well… sue me. Players can choose their own Validus. As such, <em>know thine enemy.</em><br>
Everyone can have up to three Names; True, Taken and Given. This is not just for flavour. The True Name would be a name of power, which nobody knows naturally (unless, you know, it’s a Validus). A Taken name is more or less an alias. A Given name needs no explanation.<br>
There are eight default classes, as opposed to six when the Demo began. There may also be hybrid classes, up to a three-way.<br>
There is an EXP chart, which determines your perks. That’s all it affects.</p>
<hr>
<p>You didn’t miss the <em>Temporal</em> in the title, did you? Every human has a life clock, and this includes most players. Aside from the clock, everyone is practically immortal. <em>Time</em> is the currency. <em>Time</em> can be stolen from others. <em>Time</em> is visible on your arm in neon green writing.<br>
Your money is your life. Guard it with your… well, with your life.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, you can post announcements on T.V. if you’re rich enough.</p>

          <title>[L5R 4e] Topaz Championship of Rokugan {Off Topic}</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Mercenary]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Roleplaying</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1>Topaz Championship of Rokugan</h1>
<p><img src="https://fol-archive.netlify.app/uploads/default/original/3X/4/4/448747b38855980c93c91c3d047f480eb771c516.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9MeiRt1qXkR13vUiH244evQDHbo" width="320" height="226"></p>
<p>There is a tourney in the village of Tsuma! Held each year, the invites to the Topaz Championship are sent to the most brilliant students all around of Rokugan to prove their skills as the best samurai that was trained this year. Your character received one of those invitations. This is the kind of chance that only happens once in a lifetime.  Do not disappoint.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Further Information - Topaz Championship</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The Topaz Championship is a competition that tests young men and women in all the skills that a samurai is expected to know. Points are awarded to those who receive the highest marks in each contest. Those who gain enough points may also participate in the climactic iaijutsu (duel) tournament, the winner of which is declared the Topaz Champion for a period of one year.</p>
<p>The position of Topaz Champion is accompanied by numerous material rewards, the most significant of which is an exquisite suit of armour crafted and maintained by Imperial smiths.<br>
The Topaz Armour is the most immediate badge of authority associated with the position, but it is typical for a Topaz Champion to be offered a number of different prestigious positions as part of the victory.<br>
The most frequent appointment is as an Emerald Magistrate (FBI investigator), indirectly serving the Emerald Champion (head-chief of diplomacy). The prestige associated with the position ensures that the competition is fierce.</p>
<p>Individual competitions during the Championship take the form of a match, wherein two contestants compete directly with one another, or tests, in which elder samurai ask questions of the contestant. Each competition completed successfully grants the contestant a single point. In the case of a match, only the victor receives the point.<br>
A competitor must attain a total of five points to pass their gempukku (assuming they still did not) and gain entry into the iaijutsu tournament.</p>
<p>At the beginning of any contest using the match format, the master of ceremonies withdraws small ceramic tiles from an exquisitely crafted vase. Each tile has the name of a single contestant on it, and two are drawn at a time to determine who will face each other during the matches. For a test, the tiles are simply used to determine in what order the contestants will be tested.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<hr>
<h2>Character Guidelines</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The characters are young samurai who are about to be tested before undergoing their gempukku ceremony (a coming-of-age test), after which they will be awarded their daisho (pair of swords), signifying their status as adult samurai.<br>
Some may have undergone private gempukku ceremonies at home, according to the family traditions (the Crab would be notable examples, since their regular gempukku ceremonies are tests of readiness for combating the Shadowlands). For others, their clan may view this as their official gempukku.<br>
For all the contestants, though, the opportunity for both great recognition and embarrassing ignominy is ever present.</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary>

<li>Lore: Heraldry is not used to identify people based on their Glory Rank anymore, and now solely exists to identify mons. Lore: [Their Clan] will be used for this purpose.</li>
<li>Lore: [Clan of School] is a school skill for all characters, given for free.</li>
<li>Cursed by the Realm: Yume-Do has been replaced for the following:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cursed by the Realm: Yume-Do</strong> [Spiritual] (3 or 5 points)<br>
<em>You suffer from terrible nightmares that impact the quality of your resting times. Every night, roll a die: On 1-5 (3 points) or 1-9 (5 points), regain half Void Points rounded up, +5 TN for Meditation and Tea Ceremony. Shugenjas can take this disadvantage for 4 or 6 points.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Battle Healing</em> advantage is not in use.</li>
<li>
<em>Touch of the Spirit Realms: Yomi</em> costs 5 instead of 7.</li>
<li>The <em>Dark Fate</em> disadvantage is not in use.</li>
<li>Assume the optional gender conventions in the Book of Air are in use.</li>
<li>Assume that the traditional male hairstyle is not in use.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>You will be playing children, aka rank 0 characters. The guidelines for character creation are as follows:</p>
<details>
<summary>
Level 0 Guidelines</summary>
<ul>
<li>You will start with 1 on all attributes instead of the usual 2. Family and School bonuses still apply.</li>
<li>You will start with only four out of your eight school skills, at your choice. You can buy the other  school skills with XP, but they will not count as school skills mechanically speaking.</li>
<li>You start with 25 experience points instead of the usual 40.</li>
<li>Your cap for disadvantages is 5 points instead of the usual 10.</li>
<li>You don’t have a level 1 school technique.</li>
<li>Shugenja don’t have Affinities or Deficiencies.</li>
<li>Remove all weapons (but a wakizashi) and armors from your starting equipment.</li>
<li>Your travelling pack has 5 items instead of the usual 10.</li>
<li>You start with a number of bu corresponding to the number of koku you usually would have.</li>
<li>Whenever you would lose honor due to a breach of etiquette, you instead only lose half this amount.</li>
<li>Your starting Status is 0.6, and your Glory is 0.</li>
<li>Character’s age should be between 12 and 20, with the average being 15.</li>
</ul>
